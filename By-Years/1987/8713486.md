The American fiber, textile and related industries are going through a period of
decline in the international market. To regain the leadership various technical
and non-technical issues need to be resolved. On a long-term basis, however, new
technologies which are less capital and labor intension must be developed.
Further, research needs to be initiated to develop new products for the market
of the future. The purpose of this project to convene a one day planning
workshop with the leaders of the industries concerned and faculty members who
are involved in research and education in these areas. Promising research
opportunities will be identified. The role of the National Science Foundation in
encouraging university-industry joint research activity will be delineated. The
recommendations will be used in developing a Program Announcement.
