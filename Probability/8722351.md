The investigator is one of the leading authorities in the world on reflected
Brownian motions in polyhedral domains. Such processes arise as limits of many
practical models, particularly in queuing networks. Investigator's previous
results will be extended to three and more dimensions, making the models more
applicable. The project will continue to investigate the local path properties
of Brownian excursions in Lipschitz domains. In particular, to investigate the
distributional properties, it is conjectured that the excursions from tangent
hyperplanes will be similar to the excursions from hyperplanes. Diffusions with
singular drifts or discontinuous diffusion coefficients arise in many important
area of applications such as filtering theory and stochastic control theory. The
investigator will explore the questions of existence and uniqueness of such
diffusions as well as the return to origin.
