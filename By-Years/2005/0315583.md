The proposed technology integrates piezoelectric plates onto MEMS substrates to
generate ultrasonic stress pulses incident on surface micromachines. The
piezoelectric plate actuators can deliver energy from the bottom of the
substrate to surface micromachines, giving three dimensionality to two-
dimensional sur-face micromachines. The proposal focuses on using the ultrasonic
pulse energy to address two challenges in making MEMS more practical. The first
is to de-stick stuck surface micromachines to solve the in-use stiction problem.
The second is to actuate hinged surface micromachines to enable massively
parallel assembly and actuation of surface micromachines. In order to explore
the ultimate limits of the technology, analytical and numerical models of the
pulse generation will be developed. These models will be used to design
electronic circuits and actuator struc-tures that are efficient couple energy to
surface micromachines. The techniques developed will enable interconnect-less
actuation of surface micromachines made by any surface micromachine process.
Realizing that the US industry needs many more MEMS students than can be
generated by the US grad-uate programs, and that the MEMS field originated from
the microelectronics fabrication community, a plan to assimilate MEMS concepts
into core microelectronics courses will be implemented. Assimilation into
department core courses in cooperation with non-MEMS faculty will be conducted.
The strategy should result in MEMS know-how in all electrical engineers taking
microelectronics courses. This massive proliferation of MEMS knowledge in a
broad community will allow industrial design teams to use MEMS devices more
readily, paving the way for large scale entry of MEMS into everyday technology.
A course in BioMEMS focused on fundamentals of chemistry, biology, and fluid
mechanics will be developed for electrical engineering students.
