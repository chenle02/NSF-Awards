Intellectual Merit This EAGER project is to study a novel extracellular
appendage, a nanopod, observed initially in the soil bacterium, Delftia, and
based on sequence analyses predicted to occur in a diverse group of microbes
from free living organisms to plant pathogens. This is the first report of the
appendage and the project is designed to investigate nanopod biogenesis, the
three dimensional structure of the nanopod, and the influence of nanopods on the
survival of the microbes in the natural environment. Initial results suggest
that the nanopod influences the capacity of bacteria to form biofilms and their
ability to utilize nearly insoluble substrates of polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons. There are risks associated with this project but if it is
successful it could result in the identification of a novel bacterial structure
and open a new field of study related to the interaction of bacteria with the
environment mediated by this surface appendage.

Broader Impact Undergraduate and graduate students as well as post doctoral
fellows will be involved in the study. The project also will serve as a
mechanism for broadening participation of members of underrepresented groups and
will include research assistants from diverse backgrounds. The PI will
coordinate with an existing group at the University of Wisconsin, that serves as
a conduit between faculty and prospective students in underrepresented
communities, as a mechanism for recruiting minority students for inclusion in
the project.
