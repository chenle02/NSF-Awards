This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses separation
needs of biopharmaceutical manufacturers by developing novel membranes with
exceptional performance. Currently available membranes used to separate
therapeutic proteins suffer from broad pore size variations, resulting in
additional expensive processing steps to the separations. TeraPore's patented
membrane technology enables the production of high throughput membranes with
uniform pores with sizes targeted to proteins used in medicine, resulting in
cheaper, more efficient separations. Customer needs in this industry are
dependent on the specific molecules being separated, requiring a suite of
membranes with tunable and reproducible pore sizes. This feasibility study will
show that changing the molecular structure of the polymers used to make the
membranes can control this pore size effectively. The outcome of this research
will allow TeraPore to make a variety of membrane products and specifically
design polymers that results in membranes that address specific customer needs.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the production
of high margin membrane products that will significantly improve efficiency in
the processing of therapeutic biomolecules. The US market for membrane
technology in biopharmaceutical processing was $2.4B in 2011 and is growing at a
rate of over 10%. Given the performance advances possible with TeraPore's
membranes, the company intends to enter the marketplace through the
biopharmaceutical processing market through separation/purification applications
involving high value, high margin biopharma products processed by TeraPore's
membranes.
