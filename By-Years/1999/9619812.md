The goal of this project is to develop a multimedia database management system
with enhanced capabilities to handle heterogeneous monomedia queries and data.
The development of this system caters to the computational and storage
requirements while accommodating and exploiting the inevitable semantic and
representational imprecisions inherent in such media. The underlying design
philosophy of this system is based on multilevel data models and search
mechanisms. These methodologies are designed to facilitate for the users the
posing of various types of queries. These query types include the following: (1)
low-level queries, such as finding objects in a multimedia database; (2) mid-
level queries based on spatio-temporal semantics, such as locating events
associated with multimedia data; and (3) high-level queries targeted towards
searching pre-composed multimedia documents, based on constituent monomedia
data, their spatio-temporal dimensions, and logical structure. The multi-level
search mechanisms are tightly interlinked. Imprecision in the search results is
modeled using a set of fuzzy parameters. The results of this research will
provide a comprehensive framework for building wide variety of multimedia
applications in commercial, educational, governmental and military sectors.
