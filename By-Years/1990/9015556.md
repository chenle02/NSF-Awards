The goal of this project is to support the adoption and use of X.400 in the
Internet through the following activities: 1. Continuation and expansion of
experiments involving use of 1984 X.400 on the Internet. At the time of award,
initial work in this area had been started at Wisconsin with funding from NASA.
2. Leadership in introducing X.400 into the Internet and liaison with relevant
groups including the NIST Implementors Group, the RARE Working Group 1 (X.400),
commercial X.400 providers (in cooperation with the Center for National Research
Initiatives), the Interagency Activities Board and the Federal Networking
Council. 3. Planning an Internet PRMD (Private Management Domain) whose
functions would include: management of Internet X.400 activities; liaison to
government agencies, standards bodies, academic/research networks, commercial
organizations and groups in other countries involved with X.400; technical
support functions for the X.400 user community; and planning for the evolution
of services. 4. Incorporation of X.400 technical innovations into the X.400
experiments including migration to 1988 X.400, multimedia extensions, use of
directory services, use of X.400 over ISO TP4/CLNP and security extensions.
