This Expedited Award for Novel Research is intended to fund a one year
exploration of an entropy-based principle of "increasing precision with
decreasing intelligence" which has been heuristically developed by the principal
investigator. The research will undertake to develop a scientific basis for the
principle, which can have useful application to the design of complex,
intelligent hierarchical control systems.
