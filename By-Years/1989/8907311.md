Long-term Research: The Adiabatic Phase as a Possible Probe of Large Amplitude
Motions in Large Molecules This award recommendation is made under the Program
for Long and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program
is designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term
research abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide
opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign
countries. The award will support Dr. Heidi Davis, under the sponsorship of
Prof. G. R. Fleming, both of the University of Chicago, for a fifteen-month
visit with Prof. Michael V. Berry, University of Bristol, U.K. The award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
