ABSTRACT GeoSCOPE - Exploring Geoscience Career Opportunities

GeoSCOPE (GeoScience Career OPportunity Exploration) will build long-term, self-
sustaining linkages between the Department of Earth Sciences at Florida
International University (FIU), a Minority Serving Institution, and beginning
FIU undergraduates, Miami-Dade community college students, and Miami-Dade County
high school teachers. The project will expose early career FIU and Miami-Dade
community college students, over 70% of whom are from groups under-represented
in the geosciences, to geoscience career opportunities, through workshops and
paid internships. It will also inform high school teachers about geoscience
career opportunities, through a yearly workshop highlighting the work of local
geoscience agencies, private firms and departmental research at FIU.
Undergraduate students, recruited from lower division science and engineering
classes at FIU and at Miami-Dade Community College will participate in summer
workshops highlighting interesting and professionally promising areas of
research done by department faculty. Examples are: 1) Applied Hydrogeology in
South Florida; 2) Environmental Geology of the Florida Keys; and 3) Geology of
South Florida and the Caribbean, all of which have a significant field
component; and 4) Applications of GIS in the Geosciences and 5) Mineral
Geoscience, which are technology based. Following the workshops, students will
be employed in paid internships, both within the department and cooperating
local agencies, such as the United States Geologic Survey (USGS), Miami-Dade
Department of Resource Management (DERM) and the South Florida Water Management
District (SFWMD). Students who choose a geoscience major, and complete one
subsequent year of coursework, will receive a second summer internship with a
stronger research component. Ultimately, such students are expected to become
fully integrated into on-going funded Earth Science faculty research.
