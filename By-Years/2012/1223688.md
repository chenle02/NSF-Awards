This activity confronts the need to study and forecast current and future data
flow volumes in the context of NSF's International Research Network Connections
(IRNC) program. The study is built around the following components:
"Capabilities Inventory", to itemize the largest international data flows in
combination with IRNC link capacities; "Data Volume Projection", a methodology
to forecast data volumes into 2020; "Gap Analysis", to identify disconnects
between IRNC capacities and projected data volumes; "CI Recommendations",to
provide insights on how to address those gaps; and a final report on project
activities. Intellectual merit is described as being found in the merits of the
study to be conducted on data needs of the community. Broader impact is
reflected in the potential impact of the study across scientific disciplines
globally, impacts resulting from the study's information and findings applied to
increased capabilities from IRNC connections through 2020.
