A consortium of four community colleges and their associated high performance
computing laboratories are studying the need for technician support for these
laboratories. High performance computing is the use of a networked group of
computer processors that perform complex computational operations in parallel.
In this project, a survey is being developed, distributed, and analyzed to
determine the demand for technicians and the skills they need. A national
advisory board composed of representatives from industry, academia and
government are guiding the project. The colleges involved are University of
Hawaii/Maui, Wake Technical College, Contra Costa College, and Pellissippi State
Technical Community College. The high performance computing partners include
Maui High Performance Computing Center, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Berkeley and
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and the North Carolina Supercomputing
Center.&lt;br/&gt;
