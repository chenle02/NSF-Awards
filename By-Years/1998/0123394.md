0123394 Semmens The objective of this research is to investigate the behavior of
membrane aerated biofilms in carefully designed studies. Existing computer
models will be used to select conditions for experimental testing and
experimental design. A combination of microscopic techniques, chemical
measurements made with microprobes and bio-molecular assays of the biofilms will
be used to characterize biofilm behavior under a variety of operating
conditions. The data will be used to calibrate and refine the computer model to
improve process simulation with the ultimate objective of providing a useful
tool for bioreactor design. Membrane aerated biofilm reactors are used in water
treatment for the degradation of soluble organics, and nitrogen removal. ***
