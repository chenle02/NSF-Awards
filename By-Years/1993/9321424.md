9321424 Hummel This Research Planning Grant (RPG) proposal seeks funding for the
preliminary investigation and initial performance data collection of the PI's
approach to dynamic loop scheduling on multiprocessor system, termed as
"fractiling". The approach combines "factoring", based on workload distribution
of each loop iteration with tiling which distributes loop iterations to
available processor resources. Each processor executes its local tile in
subtiles, whose sizes are globally determined by factoring rules. The simplicity
of the factoring rule used allows the common tiling rules to be applied
recursively to locally selected shapes (tiles). If a processor finishes its tile
early, the processor obtains additional tiles. This techniques retains the load
balancing properties of factoring and the data reuse properties of tiling.
During the RPG, the PI proposes to develop and implement a simple prototype of
fractiling technique on two parallel machines, BBN GP100 and CM5. ***
