9455693 Leber The fundamental tenet of this project is that student interest in
science will be aroused and their understanding of the scientific method
enhanced by the introduction of multi week bidisciplinary laboratory modules at
the end of each semester in the introductory chemistry sequences general and
organic chemistry. The laboratory modules are organized around themes that have
broad-based relevance: water analyses due to environmental concerns, plants
assays in response to environmental matters and biochemistry interest, and drug
design in recognition of the large pre-medical student population among the
students enrolled in the introductory chemistry courses. The laboratory modules
are designed to imitate aspects of research by allowing students latitude in
formulating specific goals for the project, by incorporating a longitudinal
component to the study for establishment of a qualitative and quantitative
database, and by forging research teams both within the individual teaching
laboratories and also by bridging students groups in related science
disciplines.
