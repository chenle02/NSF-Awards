9628265 Macfarlane The Himalaya-Karakoram-Tibet Workshop provides an annual
opportunity for geologists, geophysicists, geochemists, geomorphologists, and
other workers to present and discuss recent findings from work in the region.
The spring of 1996 will mark the first time this Workshop has ever convened in
the United States. All previous meeting have been held in Europe (with the
exception of Kathmandu in 1994) and therefore many North American workers have
found it difficult to attend and meet their European and Asian colleagues.
Recently, excellent advances have been made by American workers in Himalayan and
Tibetan geosciences. To continue this cutting-edge work, it is essential that we
open all lines of communication and collaboration with Asian and European
researchers. In addition to covering various geological segments of the Himalaya
(i.e., the Indus-Tsangpo Suture Zone, the Tethyan Himalaya, the Higher Himalayan
Crystallines, the Lesser Himalaya, and the Subhimalayan foreland), the Workshop
will also organize three special sessions: Geodynamic models of the Himalaya and
Tibet; the Neotectonics and Quaternary Geology of the Himalaya and Tibet; and
Extensional tectonics in a compressional orogen, all of which are subjects of
much debate currently. ***
