This project conducted by the Southwest Center for Educational Excellence will
work with ten districts to implement systemic reform strategies through content-
based professional development, action research, standards-based curricula,
reallocation of resources, formulation of supportive policies, and development
of local partnerships. Four catalyst schools will partner with smaller
districts, and key staff work will be organized by the schools' five-year
improvement plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
