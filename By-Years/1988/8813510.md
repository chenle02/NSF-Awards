Description: This project provides travel and partial support for Dr. Yogesh
Jaluria to spend a sabbatical academic year at the Indian Institute of
Technology in Kanpur, India. During that period he is expected to conduct
research on the transport processes associated with continuous casting. The
study is aimed at a numerical investigation of the effects of axial diffusion,
thermal buoyancy and conjugate transport on the interface shape and
characteristics and on the resulting thermal field in continuous casting. Scope:
Dr. Jaluria is an active scientist with considerable experience in the area of
metal casting. He is funded separately by CBTE for research in the same area to
be done in the U.S. This project allows him to conduct analytical and
computational study in the area while spending his sabbatical at Kanpur, in
collaboration with Dr. M.M. Oberai of IIT Kanpur. He will have the necessary
computer facility (DEC1090 computer available at IIT Kanpur) with necessary
perpherials. Indian graduate students and programmers will assist in the work.
