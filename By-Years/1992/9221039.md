This proposal strives to characterize the mechanism of dissolution and
crystallization when a sparingly soluble salt is produced from the dissoultion
of particulate material. In particular, the work focuses on the intensification
of tis prate process by the use of microphases. The presence of very small
particles or crystallites has been recentl shown to enhance the rate of
transport from one phase to another. The unique aspect of this work is that no
externally produced microphase will be added, and the reaction itself will
produce the microphase. This process has been termed reaction crystallization;
and it, in turn, falls under a class of research called "process
intensification". It is part of a trend to approach crystallization studies from
a reaction engineering point of view. On additional challenge to develop
theoretical analysis of the complex interactions involved and then apply them to
the design of dissolution - precipitation processes.
