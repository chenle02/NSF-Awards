The investigators propose to continue their current research on global
ionospheric electrodynamics and on plasma waves in the high latitude ionosphere,
the study of global electrodynamics use incoherent scatter radar observations.
The main topics of this program include (1) studies of the latitudinal and day
to day variations of the low latitude electric fields, (2) the effect of
magnetospheric and disturbance dynamo electric fields at low latitudes, (3)
equatorial drift and wind studies using joint measurements with the Jicamarca
radar and the San Marco satellite, (4) the study of F-region dynamo electric
fields and their latitudinal variation, and (5) development of an empirical
model for the latitude electric fields. The research on plasma waves in the high
latitude ionosphere consists of mostly analysis and interpretation of radar
interferometer data from Greenland and Sweden. We also intend to continue
working on the interpretation of in-situ rocket data, and to carry out
theoretical studies. The main aspects of this program include (1) studies of
E-region waves during periods of very large and highly variable auroral
currents, (2) experimental and theoretical studies of the nonlinear saturation
of two stream waves, particularly at unfavorable magnetic aspect angles, and (3)
radar and rocket studies of collisional ion cyclotron waves at altitudes of
about 150 km during periods of very large field aligned currents. In general the
above studies are concerned with motions of the ionosphere and the presence of
waves and other irregularities in it, which have importance both from the point
of view of increasing our fundamental understanding of processes occurring in
ionized gases (making up 99% of the material of the universe) and of the effects
of the propagation of radio waves for communication and of the effective
operation of radar systems.
