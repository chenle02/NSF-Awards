This is a three year project to further develop a scalable, distributed multi-
threaded architecture for the management, simulation and distribution of inter-
domain policy-based routing information for the Internet. It follows on the
success of a previous award to Merit to develop a distributed multi-threaded
route server (MRS), and will develop tools and methodologies for benchmarking
and evaluating the performance of the server in a variety of complex inter-
domain routing environments. Merit also will work with researchers using the
DARPA-funded CAIRN network and the RAISE (Rational ATM Internet Suite).
