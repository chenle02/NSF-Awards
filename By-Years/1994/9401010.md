9401010 Nur Funds are provided to develop a quantitative model of the seismic
properties of oceanic sediments containing gas hydrates. It will help delineate
the distribution of gas hydrates, estimate their volume, explain the nature of
bottom simulating reflectors and distinguish among hydrate morphologies. The
model will also help in future drilling efforts in hydrate fields. The model
will be based on microstructure of sediments. The model will be tested in the
laboratory by measurements of compressional and shear velocities in cemented
granular materials that simulates hydrate cements. ***
