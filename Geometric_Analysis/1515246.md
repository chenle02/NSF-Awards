Abstract Award: DMS 1515246, Principal Investigator: Ioana Suvaina

The conference "Recent Advances in Kahler Geometry" will be held May 18-22, 2015
at the Vanderbilt University. The main objective of the conference is to bring
together leading experts in the separate but related fields of differential
geometry, geometric analysis and algebraic geometry, to present recent results
and future directions of research in the field. The conference is organized in
conjunction with the 30th Shanks Lecture Series. Professor S-T. Yau (Harvard
University) will deliver the 2014 Shanks Lecture. The conference will attract
mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as graduate students and
young researchers who will greatly benefit from the wide spectrum of topics to
be presented at the conference.

Kahler geometry is an area with deep roots and very rapid and diverse advances.
Remarkable progress has been made recently in different directions such as the
study of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, and complete Calabi-Yau
manifolds with prescribed asymptotical behavior. Another very active area of
research concerns the study of extremal Kahler metrics and their link with
algebraic-geometric notions of stability on polarized manifolds. The topics of
the presentations include, but are not limited to, the following areas: Kahler-
Einstein metrics, complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with prescribed asymptotical
behavior, extremal Kahler metrics, moduli space of Kahler metrics, Kahler Ricci
flow, Hermitian manifolds. More details about the conference, as well as the
list of speakers, are available at the conference website, at:
