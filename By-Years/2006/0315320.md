This grant provides support for the development of a novel low-temperature nano-
calorimeter for low-dimensional materials research and education at the
University of Virginia. This new instrument is expected to have a high heat
capacity resolution to study electronic materials in a low-dimensional geometry
at low temperatures. This new instrument will, for the first time, be able to
explore heat capacity behaviors of low-dimensional electronic systems at
extremely low temperatures. Heat capacity is one of the most fundamental
physical properties as it directly probes thermodynamic quantities such as
entropy. However, heat capacities of low-dimensional electronic systems have
been nearly unexplored at extremely low temperatures. By measuring heat
capacities of various low-dimensional systems in this unexplored regime, our
calorimeter will open new horizons in studying electron and phonon densities of
states, magnetic interactions and ordering, and structural or electronic phase
transitions in thin film samples. &lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional electronic systems
have been a focus of research on modern science and technology, and will be in
the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As heat capacity would provide essential
information on understanding material properties, our proposed calorimeter will
have a significant impact on current and future materials research and
education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
