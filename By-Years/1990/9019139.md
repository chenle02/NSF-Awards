When DNA molecules of appropriate structures are injected into the nuclei of
Xenopus laevis oocytes, they are recombined very efficiently. This process is
completely dependent on sequence homology between the recombining DNAs and on
those DNAs being linear. Characterization of this process will be continued with
the goals of achieving a complete description of its molecular mechanism and of
the activities that catalyze each step in the pathway. The proposed approach has
several facets: construction of substrates that test predictions of possible
recombination mechanisms; isolation and characterization of recombination
intermediates; and injection of putative intermediates to prove that they are on
the pathway to recombination products. Considerable effort will be directed at
improving and exploiting a recently developed cell-free oocyte nuclear extract
that catalyzes complete recombination events. Requirements for recombination in
the extract will be examined as a means of determining the underlying
biochemical processes. Components of the extract will be fractionated in an
effort to purify enzymes that catalyze individual steps in recombination.
