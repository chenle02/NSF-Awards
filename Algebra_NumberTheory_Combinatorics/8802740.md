The principal investigator on this project will pursue investigations in three
separate directions: first, special cases of the weight conjecture; second,
permutation modules and Hecke algebras; third, Clifford theory. The postdoctoral
associate on this project will study the modular representations of groups of
Lie type. This project is in the general area of representation theory of finite
groups. The principal investigator will examine several problems in this area
including the weight conjecture. An affirmative answer to this conjecture would
lead to the solution to several long outstanding problems in this area.
