The proposed work will develop mathematical and numerical techniques to make
computer algorithms more efficient in several key manufacturing and engineering
processes. The work will focus on (i) semiconductor manufacturing to create
faster and more reliable computer chips; (ii) seismic imaging to efficiently and
accurately locate petroleum reserves; (iii) fluid jetting devices in the
construction of computer display devices, bio-engineering of tissue scaffolding,
and micro-jetting tools for printing circuit boards; (iv) injection molding and
part manufacturing, and (v) logistical transport to determine optimal routing of
goods and robotic motion.

These topics are linked through the requirement to efficiently, accurately, and
robustly track the motion of complex interfaces. Moving interface problems,
which describe how boundaries move under intricate physics, are at the core of a
host of practical and critical engineering and manufacturing problems. As
examples, semiconductors are built through multiple processes of shaping,
depositing, and etching the interfaces between chemicals. Seismic imaging in
petroleum analysis requires fast solutions of propagating waves through the
earth. Fluid jetting devices, which appear across a range of scales from desktop
inkjet printers down to automatic bioassay testing, require careful attention to
the moving fluid interface problems between air, fluids (such as ink), and solid
walls. Injection molding requires carefully tracking the evolving boundaries
between liquid, molten, and solid plastic as they fill a pre-formed mold.
Logistical transport and robotics require tracking optimal control interfaces to
determine first arrivals.

The proposed work will be two-fold. First, previous NSF support has allowed us
to develop many of the current state-of-the-art numerical techniques for
tracking moving interfaces, including level set methods, fast marching methods,
ordered upwind methods, and escape arrival methods; this work will continue
through a focus on more efficient versions and extensions to more complex
physics. Second, we will concentrate on prototype codes in each of the above-
listed areas, in collaboration with industrial scientists, with the goal of
creating practical engineering algorithms and simulations.
