This project is about a new way to detect and classify shifts in the patterns of
measurements taken by sensors. Subtle shifts in the output from a vibration
sensor on a bridge abutment, for instance, can indicate that a crack is
developing in that structure. Identifying these shifts can be a real challenge
because modern sensors can generate so much information, and so quickly.
Existing approaches to this use the mathematics of statistics: averages,
variability, and the like. This project uses techniques from topology, the
branch of mathematics that is concerned with shape, to detect these kinds of
shifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop techniques to assess and
characterize temporal patterns in nonstationary time-series data. The project
will compute aspects of the homology---e.g., the first few Betti numbers---of
the stream "on the fly" to obtain a signature of its regime. To mitigate the
computational burden of traditional techniques, this project uses a simplicial
complex based on a small, representative set of "landmarks," with the remaining
data, the "witnesses," defining the connections. New techniques include a
generalization of the oft-used false near-neighbor method to evaluate the
fidelity of the topology of the reconstruction, efficient selection of landmarks
and choice of witness relation, classification of structure through multi-
parameter persistent homology of embedded data, and development of a map on the
witness complex to obtain a dynamical signature of each regime. The goals
include efficient detection of regime shifts, the development of a catalog of
signatures within regimes, and the detection and mitigation of noise. The
classification techniques will be applicable, for example, to the detection of
failure modes in manufacturing systems, malware attacks on a network, incipient
heart problems, or an impending containment failure.
