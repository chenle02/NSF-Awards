This project addresses polymer interfaces commonly used in polymeric light
emitting diodes and other devices such as thin film transistors (TFT), focussing
on determination of the electronic structure, chemistry and morphology of
interfaces. Experiments will be carried out using pho-toelectron spectroscopy
(PES) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Results of in-situ studies will be
compared with ex-situ photo-electrical measurements on devices. Additionally,
simple polymer electronic devices will be designed and fabricated in vacuum and
tested against conven-tionally ex-situ prepared structures. The project will be
carried out collaboratively between Rudy Schlaf at the Department of Electrical
Engineering at the University of South Florida (USF), and George G. Malliaras at
the Materials Science and Engineering Department of Cornell University. Schlaf's
group will study and develop synthesis and processing capabilities enabling in-
situ depo-sition of polymer thin films and will investigate them in-situ with
photoemission spectroscopy (PES). Students from USF will visit Malliaras' group
during summer months where they will characterize macroscopic electronic
properties of the prepared thin films/devices by (photo-) electrical
measurements. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental
research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materi-als science
having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the
strong em-phasis on education, and the integration of research and education.
The PI places emphasis on in-volving undergraduates in research to help increase
the number of students pursuing advanced degrees. Results of the research will
also be used in research modules presented in the PI's Elec-tronic Materials
course and during the lab tours the PI organizes for undergraduate students. The
project offers unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students
involved in highly interdisciplinary forefront research. &lt;br/&gt;***
