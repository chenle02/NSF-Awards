Talcott&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0234462&lt;br/&gt;"FORMAL CHECKLISTS FOR REMOTE AGENT
DEPENDABILITY"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep Space Missions involve a tight
integration of physical and software systems that must function autonomously
over a prolonged time. These autonomous agents need to be robust and able to
react in real time to state changes without aid of earth control. The Mission
Data System (MDS) framework, consisting of an architecture, tools, and libraries
of reusable components, has been developed by NASA to address this problem. This
project builds on two key ideas of the MDS approach: a state-based approach to
system design and a goal-oriented approach to operation. It develops a formal
framework with methods and supporting tools for increasing the dependability of
goal based operation of space systems. In particular, a formal approach to the
analysis of goal net specifications is being developed that enables assertions
to be made about their dependability level. A set of formal checklists (formal
analysis suites) will be produced along with supporting tools that can be used
to achieve more predictable dependability of goal nets and goal-based operation.
The checklists will provide a qualitative means of measuring dependability of
goal achievers. A spectrum of analysis techniques of different strengths will be
developed to allow for achieving different levels of dependability.&lt;br/&gt;To
experimentally validate the ideas, the framework will be applied to goal
achievers for a representative set of domains in the context of the MDS test
bed. The experimental work will guide the development of formal checklists. The
resulting case studies will also serve as templates for further application of
the formal framework. Certified packages of goals, goal nets and corresponding
software modules developed for one mission can be re-used in future missions.
The formal technology developed in this project will be applicable to a wide
range of domains and physical situations.&lt;br/&gt;
