Description: This project supports a U.S. scientist as a guest scholar at the
Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) where he will conduct research
on the intake motion of air through the inlet port of cylinders of internal
combustion engines. The study will cover techniques for solving a system of
quasi-one-dimension, unsteady, first-order partial differential equations
governing the intake-fluid motion; development and testing of algorithms for the
numerical computation of these equations, defining the relevant boundary
conditions in the numerical scheme and possible weighted combinations of stable
and unstable finite element schemes to reduce numerical diffusion. Scope: The
P.I. has done considerable work in the area of engine combustion analysis. He
has visited the host institute (ARAI) in 1986 where similar analytical work and
experimental work on turbulence intake flow is being carried. The planned visit
is likely to help his research to produce a better modeling system for intake-
fluid motion. It is likely to increase future scientific-collaboration between
India and the U.S.
