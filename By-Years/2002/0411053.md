Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is adapting linear algebra problems
developed under the NSF/DUE-funded ATLAST program, for incorporation into the
WeBWorK computerized grading system. The resulting gains in grading efficiency
allow faculty more time to assess the explanation parts of the ATLAST problems.
In addition the project promotes the continued widespread use of these valuable
exercises. All new problems and problem sets are being added to the WeBWorK
problem library depository for free use by others, thus ensuring the broad
impact of the project on the teaching and learning of linear algebra.
