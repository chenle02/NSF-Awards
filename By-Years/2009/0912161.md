ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0912161&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium
(LUMCON)&lt;br/&gt;PI: J. Malbrough&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D.
Guidry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support (SSSE) items for the vessel
operated by Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON); namely the R/V
PELICAN. The requests specifically include items that have been recommended from
past NSF inspections, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise
deferred by the operators due to cost. All of the items requested will either
improve safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service
life. Due to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation
standards normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity
with many of the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based
mainly on past experience of the vessel operators for similar work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V PELICAN supports federally funded
scientific research in the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of
the ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate
and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also
achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house
events, educational cruises, and involvement in the Marine Advanced Technology
Education (MATE) Center which is an intern-based training program for marine
technicians. The PELICAN is scheduled to complete approximately 50 NSF sponsored
days in 2009.
