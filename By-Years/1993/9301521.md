This award will provide partial support for the International Symposium on
Coherent States: Past, Present, and Future to be held at Oak Ridge, Tennessee
during June 14-17, 1993. The NSF funds will provide support for about 15
students to attend the symposium, where they will be able to interact with
leading experts in the field. Present at the symposium will be many of the
theorists who are most active in investigating coherent-state phenomena, which
have applicants in many fields of physics, including quantum optics, condensed-
matter physics, particle physics, and nuclear physics.
