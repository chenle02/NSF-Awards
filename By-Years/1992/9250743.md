Small groups of students design and implement their own experiments including
presentation of a hypothesis, provision of a flow chart of the experimental
plan, and generation and analysis of data. Final results and conclusions are
discussed by the entire class. The focus is on cell compartmentalization and DNA
technologies. Equipment includes centrifuges and electrophoresis systems.
