0132089&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to understand
the mechanisms of arsenic uptake, translocation, distribution and detoxification
by Brake fern. The efficiency of arsenic uptake by Brake fern suggests the cost-
effective use of this plant for the remediation of arsenic contaminated soils.
This research focuses on elemental interactions of arsenic with calcium and
phosphorus, plant biochemical responses under arsenic stresses, speciation and
characterization of arsenic in the plant using analytical, microscopic and
spectroscopic techniques, and microbe-root-plant-arsenic interactions. Arsenic
hyperaccumulation characteristics in Brake fern growing in soils of different
arsenic concentrations will be investigated using arsenic spiked soils. The
impacts of P (increases arsenic availability yet competes with arsenic uptake)
and Ca (increases plant arsenic uptake and translocation) on arsenic
accumulation, and biochemical responses of Brake fern to elevated arsenic
(detoxification) will be examined. Also, the beneficial effects of mycorrhizal
fungi for enhancing arsenic accumulation by Brake fern will be explored. This is
a collaborative research project between the University of Florida (0132089) and
Northwestern University (0132114). These two awards were made pursuant to the
Joint Program on Phytoremediation, 2001-STAR-C1 (EPA, NSF, ONR,
SERDP).&lt;br/&gt;
