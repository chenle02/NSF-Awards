Evidence both from time production experiments (in which a person attempts to
respond at an appropriate time) and time perception experiments (in which a
person attempts to accurately estimate a duration) will be obtained to provide
data regarding the small, but systematic, deviations from perfect accuracy that
occur. These discrepancies are likely to be related to the duration being timed,
and to be similar for various different timing tasks. The quantitative features
of this nonlinear representation of time (which is called the `oscillator
signature`) will be used to identify a multiple-oscillator mechanism for time
perception and production. The effects of various independent variables (such as
perturbations and adapting stimuli) on the oscillator signature will be
identified; the oscillator signatures obtained with various perceptual and motor
tasks will be compared. In addition, individual differences in oscillator
signatures will be assessed; periodic phenomena that may be responsible for the
oscillator signature will be identified; and alternative quantitative models of
the oscillator signature will be evaluated. Although psychological time appears
to change in an approximately linear way with physical time, the small
systematic deviations of psychological time from exact linearity with physical
time provide a way to identify the biological mechanism responsible for time
perception. The major hypothesis is that timing is made possible by many
normally occurring periodic biological phenomena.
