9700206 Koster This proposal is for the assessment of industrially important
TiAl alloy castings. One engineering form of that alloy, known as y-TiAl,
currently in a research stage, is expected to be introduced in the near future
to aerospace engineering and other cutting edge applications. That alloy has two
attributes similar to the Galn, which are thought to contribute to the enhanced
segregation in the melt: (1) the difference in density of the elements, and (2)
the different melting temperatures of the elements. The research results from
both TiAl and Galn will contribute to a better understanding of the physics of
segregation and flow in thermally and solutally driven metallic alloy melts. The
outcomes of this research could provide useful experimental results that will
spur the development of new fluid mechanical models as well as adjusting designs
for industrial processing furnaces. This collaborative research project
addresses fundamental issues on fluid physics and chemical segregation study in
the natural convection cell, combined with the industrially relevant vertical
Bridgman crystallization, including metallurgical characterization and tensile
testing, will improve the understanding of manufacturing requirements for TiAl
alloy castings. The research project has a balance between theory and
experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the aerospace industry as
well as the aluminum manufacturing industry.
