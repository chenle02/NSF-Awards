The objective of this research planning grant is to lay the groundwork for a
research effort that will develop and integrate methods and tools to provide
computer assistance for designing single-chip microprocessors and multi-chip
based computers. The focus of this work will be at the architectural design
level. Most computer-aided design (CAD) research has not addressed the initial
formal specification phase of the design process. A correct and complete
functional specification is necessary before these computer-aided design tools
are useful. The results of this work will lead to a proposal for a global system
for computer architecture design and performance estimation.
