The increasing importance of ?big data?, i.e., the usage of computer systems to
store and analyze large data sets, is changing the face of both science and
industry. Underlying big-data analyses are big-data storage systems, including
the popular Hadoop File System (HDFS). The WiS3C project seeks to re-examine the
core foundations of storage systems such as HDFS, specifically by developing new
specialized storage techniques to improve both the reliability and performance
of these systems. The project specifically targets novel modifications in crash
consistency (i.e. how storage systems keep data safe despite power loss), end-
to-end data integrity (i.e., how storage systems ensure data does not become
corrupt), and caching and layout (i.e., how storage systems make access to data
fast); the sum of these changes will result in a new era of more robust and
high-performance big-data analysis. The project will also improve the
educational pipeline by connecting more undergraduates with research and
attracting more women into the Ph.D. program.
