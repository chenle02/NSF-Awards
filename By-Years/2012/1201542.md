The PI proposes to exploit recently developed techniques in the study of
projective homogeneous varieties to pursue several questions in the theory of
semisimple algebraic groups over an arbitrary field, their Galois cohomology,
and their cohomological invariants. The new techniques have already produced
some extremely strong results and the investigator proposes to push them
further. Previous work on these topics has had applications to other areas of
mathematics and to physics, and further such applications are expected.

The family of semisimple groups includes familiar matrix groups like special
linear and special orthogonal groups. These groups appear in many areas of
mathematics, and may be viewed as an essential outgrowth of the linear algebra
developed in the early 1800s and now taught to undergraduates. The groups became
prominent objects of mathematical interest in the late 1800s via Sophus Lie's
famous general theory of Lie groups. In algebra, the notion of semisimple group
unifies various historically distinct areas of study. For example, it connects
Jordan algebras -- discovered by physicists -- with quadratic forms and division
algebras.
