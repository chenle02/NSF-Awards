Two lines of research relevant to ionization and recombination processes in
plasmas will be addressed, namely spectral line broadening and ionization
equilibrium in a strongly magnetized plasma. The impact theory of line
broadening will be extended to include the effects or recombination on the line
shape and an investigation will be made of those plasma regimes where such an
extension of the impact theory is applicable. Analysis of the effects of thermal
motions, which create an electric field, will be made to determine their effect
on the ionization balance via continuum lowering and tunnelling and decay of
highly excited states.
