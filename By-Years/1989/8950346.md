High school teachers and industry scientists, engineers, and mathematicians,
with the support of UCLA and other university professors, will work together to
produce Teaching Resource Units which will teach technical topics, demonstrate
applications of the material in real world situations, and provide information
on related career opportunities. The units will be suitable for both disabled
and non- disabled students and will be specifically designed to demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating disabled students into regular science, mathematics,
and computer classes. At least one disabled person from industry will be
included on each TRU team. TRU topics will be carefully selected to fit well
into typical high school curricula. After initial preparation of each unit, it
will be taught by the teacher members of the team at a summer science camp which
will include both disabled and non-disabled students. These students will be
videotaped during this summer camp, and the tapes will be included as part of
the Teaching Resource Unit. Completed TRUs will be distributed widely, both
through normal educational channels and through organizations particularly
concerned with the disabled. Cost sharing by the partners will total 99% of the
NSF funding.
