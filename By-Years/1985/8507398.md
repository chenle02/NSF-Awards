The objective of this research is to model multivariate, non-stationary
electroencephalograms (EEG) and from the model, to infer the instantaneous
feedback and causality structure of the EEG signals. The research will lead to
advances in information processing and neurophysiology as well as to improved
clinical diagnostic methods in the treatment of brain injury or pathology.
