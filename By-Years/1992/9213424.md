A broad research program in statistical mechanics will be continued with the
goal of obtaining a better understanding of the properties of macroscopic
matter. The methods used range from rigorous mathematical analysis to computer
simulations. The research is supported jointly by the Divisions of Materials
Research, Physics and Mathematical Sciences. The research will focus on the
derivation of deterministic macroscopic hydrodynamical equations from
microscopic dynamics, by suitable scalings of space and time, in order to obtain
an understanding of fluctuatiions and sometimes large deviations from these
continuum equations - where the atomic nature of matter manifests itself. This
should enhance our understanding of shock structure, phase segregation and
related phenomena. The nature of stationary nonequilibrium states, including
phase transitions in nonequilibrium systems, will be another major focus of our
research. We also plan to investigate the statistical mechanics of probablistic
cellular automata with possible applications to parallel computations and neural
networks. The behavior of diffusion dominated reactions will be explored with
particular attention to the spatial patterns formed at long times. %%% A broad
program of theoretical research will be conducted in nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics. Emphasis will be placed on deriving equations which model fluid flow
from their microscopic constituents. This is a very complex and difficult task
which will involve state-of-the-art techniques in analysis and computer science.
Reflecting the range of the research, funding is provided by the Divisions of
Materials Research, Physics and Mathematical Sciences.
