This research compiles a data set of subsidies from national governments, for
the period 1975 through 1995, by country and industry for members of the
European Union. These data are analyzed longitudinally to understand how aid
levels changed in various European Union countries and industries after European
trade liberalization. The primary source for such information is published in
the European Commission's `Official Journal.` However, that source is very
incomplete. These data are assembled from materials resting in the archives in
Brussels. These data, in their complete form, allow numerous questions about the
effect of state subsidies and trade liberalization on economic performance to be
answered. One such question is whether the European Union has had an impact on
state aid. i
