In this project the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville will plan, organize and
conduct a Southwestern regional conference in applied computing. Participation
in this past year's conference has established it as an important regional forum
for information exchange and technology transfer, technology outreach and
research presentation in the Southwest. Last year's sponsors and associates
include the NSF, both the ACM and IEEE-CS, seven regional universities and
private industry. It is their expectation that this year, the conference will
begin to attract national visibility and, as a result, take a great stride
toward self-support.
