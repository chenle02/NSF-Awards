This RUI project focuses on the study of toroidal electron plasma confinement
with the following goals: 1) To design and build a toroidal electron plasma
confinement device with a one kG confining magnetic field, better vacuum
conditions than any previous device of its kind, and field symmetry comparable
to cylindrical electron plasma experiments that demonstrate confinement times of
minutes or hours, 2) to successfully confine toroidal electron plasmas in a
(partially) toroidal trap for times longer than 50 milliseconds, longer than any
prior experiment of its type, and permitting detailed investigation of
equilibrium, stability and transport physics, 3) o observe the theoretically
predicted magnetic pumping transport mechanism, a transport mechanism that
results from toroidal effects, and 4) to develop a charge injection (and plasma
diagnostic) strategy for use in a completely toroidal trap, opening up the
possibility of studying electron plasma configurations with parallel current.
The activity provide research experiences, as well as scientific authorship and
presentation opportunities, for undergraduate students
