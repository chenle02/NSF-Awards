This represents a coninuation of research previously supported by NSF grant EAR
84-08004 involving continued development and analytical applications of the
Laser Raman Microprobe, with emphasis on in-situ analysis of microscopic fluid
inclusions in mineral samples. Because the quantitative imterpretation of Raman
spectra of mixed-volatile fluid inclusions requires accurately known Raman
scattering efficiencies for each species at appropriate densities, the project
will concentrate on the determination of these parameters for mixtures of
volatiles of known composition at varied pressures. The results of the project
will permit quantitative analysis of fluid inclusions containing CO, CO2, CH4,
N2, H2, O2, H2S, and SO2 at various internal pressures. In addition, a series of
artificially produced C-O-H fluid inclusions containing CH4-CO2 clathrate
hydrates will be studied at different temperatures. These studies will
contribute to our understanding of phase behavior in the C-O-H system and to our
understanding of the conditions of formation of minerals containing such
inclusions.
