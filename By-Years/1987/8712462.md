This award will enable Dr. Richard R. Perez, State University of New York at
Albany, to collaborate with Dr. Pierre Ineichen, University of Geneva,
Switzerland, on solar radiation modeling. They will try to improve and validate
methods, developed by them, for modeling the sky diffuse and ground reflected
irradiance received by tilted surfaces. Additionally, they will model the
relationships between visible and total components of solar radiation reaching
the earth's surface. Model validations require large data sets covering a broad
climatic range. The researchers will share their information from different
locations, and will investigate the effects of environmental factors, such as
local aerosol contents, on the models' configurations and performance. The
collaboration will extend the scope of both investigators' research, and will
allow them to formulate needed recommendations for measurement and modeling
techniques. Improving irradiance and illumination efficiency models and gaining
an increased understanding of ground-reflected radiation are important to the
international building, energy, and lighting research communities. The project
brings together and significantly enhances complementary domestic research
projects of the American and Swiss investigators.
