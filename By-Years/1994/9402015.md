9402015 Murthy The principal investigator will study the structure of projective
modules and efficient generation of modules over affine algebras. He will
continue his work on finding obstructions to splitting of projective modules and
efficient generation of ideals, analogous to obstruction theory for sections of
vector bundles in topology. Some of the ingredients for these obstructions are
Chow groups. Other invariants have to be explored. The tools used are from
intersection theory, algebraic K-theory, and standard commutative algebra. This
research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families of
polynomial equations. One can either study the geometry of the solution set or
approach problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the
solution set that form what is called a commutative ring. This dual perspective
creates a close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
