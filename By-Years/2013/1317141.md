This conference award will provide travel support for early career U.S.
mathematicians to participate in the XXII Nevanlinna Colloquium which will be
held at the University of Helsinki, Finland, August 5-9, 2013. This mathematics
research conference will focus on recent developments in geometric analysis,
conformal geometry and dynamics, hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian groups, and
Teichmuller theory. The conference will feature 12 plenary speakers from a
diverse collection of fields, as well as 36 shorter talks. For example: Ian Agol
will discuss his recent resolution of the Virtual Haken Conjecture and
Thurston's Virtual Fibering question; Jeremy Kahn will discuss the resolution of
the Ehrenpreis Conjecture and the Surface Subgroup Conjecture; Maryam Mirzakhani
will discuss her seminal work on dynamics on Teichmuller spaces; Jani Onninnen
will discuss his work in geometric nonlinear analysis; and Marianna Csornyei
will discuss recent advances in real analysis and geometric measure theory. The

Nevanlinna Colloquium will bring together a diverse collection of international
researchers in analysis, geometry, and topology. The Nevanlinna Colloquium has
been, since its inception in 1964, one of the most important mathematics
international research conferences in the areas of conformal and geometric
analysis, and more recently has expanded to a major international conference in
analysis, geometry, and topology. The plenary talks will feature leading experts
presenting talks on recent major advances in their fields. These presentations
will expose early career mathematicians to cutting edge research in these
fields. The international nature of the conference, and the diversity of the
subject matter, will encourage collaborations between researchers in different
areas that will continue to drive the field forward. The principal investigators
will especially encourage the participation of early career mathematicians who
are members of groups under-represented in mathematics.
