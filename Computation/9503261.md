Abbott The investigator studies how the dynamic properties of large populations
of neurons allow them to represent, store, recall and process information. A
basic theme of the project is the study of population coding, the storage of
information in large arrays of neurons, each responding fairly nonselectively to
different aspects of a stimulus. The transfer of information between neuronal
networks is studied using population decoding methods. Questions to be addressed
include: How is the information encoded in a sensory network transferred to a
motor network in a task like visually guided reaching toward an object? How do
the invariant representations needed to identify and locate an object
independent of translations, rotations, and scaling changes arise? It is widely
believed that synaptic modification is the basic neuronal mechanism underlying
memory and learning. Population decoding methods allow for an interpretation of
the effects of synaptic modification with direct behavioral relevance. In
preliminary decoding studies it has been found that the temporal properties of
long-term potentiation naturally cause a population of neurons to predict a
coded quantity after training. This suggests a novel mechanism for learning and
generating sequences of motor actions that is explored. Reaching for an object,
turning toward a visual or auditory cue, and a variety of other tasks require
motor responses that are accurately guided by sensory information. In addition,
previous experience can play an important role in shaping these responses.
Experiments have provided important information about how sensory information is
represented in the brain and how experience can modify neural circuits.
Mathematical decoding techniques allow us to relate motor responses, such as
reaching, to the activity of neurons in the motor cortex of the brain. The goal
of the project is to construct a theoretical framework, based on these data, for
understanding sensory-guid ed motor tasks, including mechanisms for learning and
generating accurate responses and modifying them on the basis of experience.
This work should provide new insights into how we generate basic motor behaviors
and may have interesting applications to robotics.
