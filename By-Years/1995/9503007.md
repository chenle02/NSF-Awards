While the role of randomization in algorithm design has not been fully
understood, several important computational problems have been solved elegantly
using randomization. The best known randomized algorithms for a variety of
problems have better resource bounds than their deterministic counterparts. This
continuing research project addresses the issue of better understanding
randomization, by studying its function in the design of parallel algorithms for
several computing problems, including those in the areas of (1) sorting and
selection, (2) packet routing, and (3) computational geometry. Applications of
these sampling and algorithmic tools to the design of optimal (or near optimal)
parallel algorithms in such diverse areas as natural language processing,
computer simulation, and motion planning, are also examined.
