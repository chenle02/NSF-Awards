This award will support researchers at three institutions, the University of
California at San Diego (UCSD), the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), and
The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), to develop, distribute, and maintain
software for the structural biology community. The software will involve aspects
of both molecular modeling and visualization (at TSRI), development of improved
methods in crystallographic refinement (UCSD), and the documentation and support
of the software (at SDSC).
