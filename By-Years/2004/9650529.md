The instrumentation for this project is designed principally for an innovative
laboratory course to help students grasp both system and circuit aspects of
modern wireless systems. This rapidly growing area includes personal
communication networks, intelligent transportation systems, and other
applications that employ micro-, meter-, and millimeter-wave frequency bands.
This project establishes a Wireless Systems Design Laboratory and an associated
course that enables students to develop knowledge of the principles of wireless
systems and circuits and the relationships between them, gain practical
experience in related system and circuit engineering techniques, and acquire key
skills in using modern engineering tools. To motivate students, the project uses
a simple personal communication system (a pager) as a case study. Experiments
are based on signal flow through the system together with performance
characteristics of its individual components. The course also features computer
simulation, computer-assisted design (CAD), and fabrication and test of
component designs. The unique integration of circuit and systems engineering
fundamentals makes the course a model for electrical engineering curricula. For
students specializing in related areas, this lab provides an excellent
foundation for further study. The course is also part of an integrated
curriculum development effort in the wireless/radiofrequency and communications
area. The ability to develop new senior elective courses with hands-on content
for the revised curriculum bodes well for highly productive use of the
equipment. For example, additional use of the proposed instrumentation is
planned for senior design projects.
