Dr. McGovern and his colleagues will continue to conduct archaeological
excavations at the large and deeply stratified farm midden site of Svalbard and
other related sites in Iceland. Adopting a broad scale approach, he will uncover
the outlines of homestead buildings and through the recovery of faunal, floral,
and other artifactual remains, study the subsistence adaptation of Norse
inhabitants of Iceland. He will supplement these data with ethnographic and
documentary research and employ paleoenvironmental data to reconstruct
adaptation against a backdrop of changing environmental conditions. Between
800.1000 AD, Viking.age Scandinavian populations spread into the islands of the
North Atlantic taking with them a well developed seafaring tradition and a
subsistence economy based upon domestic animals and some cereals. As they moved
into new regions they adapted this to include wild resources which were readily
available. Archaeology in Iceland can shed light on this adaptive process and is
especially interesting because it provides insight into how human populations
cope in marginal environments. Beginning ca. 1250 AD a significant climatic
cooling known as the "Little Ice Age" began. This affected the Viking colonies
and placed great stress on local populations. The Svalbard site is particularly
interesting because it documents this period and the data which Dr. McGovern
recovers will provide insight into how human populations adapt to severe
climatic stress. Because faunal and floral material is so well preserved,
detailed subsistence reconstruction will be possible.
