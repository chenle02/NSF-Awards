This is a project to produce a grammar and a dictionary of a language indigenous
to northern California together with a set of texts in the language complete
with analyses and translations exemplifying the grammar and lexical material in
context. There are extensive descriptions of the culture of the speakers of this
language but until now, little has been published about their language itself,
which is of importance to the understanding of the relationships of the
languages of California and more broadly, of North America. The language is of
special interest to linguists because it contains certain highly elaborated
structures otherwise little documented, but of crucial importance to general
understanding of the possible range of ways that languages may work.
