This project deals with the development of a process for fabricating B-C alloys
with organoboron precursors so that the composition and structure can be
tailored and the anomalous mechanisms unique to these semiconductors can be
further explained. The payoff is in developing a manufacturing process for
fabricating semiconductors with electronic properties and thermal stability that
are unavailable today. Other borides (B12Al, GdB66, B12As, B13P2, etc.) are
expected to benefit from this process research and development.
