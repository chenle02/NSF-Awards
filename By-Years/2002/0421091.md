0421091&lt;br/&gt;Colman&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of Minnesota Duluth provides funds for acquisition of acoustic
imaging instrumentation by the Large Lakes Observatory (UMD/LLO), including a
side-scan sonar, a swept-frequency (chirp) subbottom profiling system, a towing
vehicle and winch system, and associated hardware and software for data
acquisition and analysis. These instruments will be managed as a shared-use
facility for the U.S. limnological research community, augmenting existing tools
for coring and seafloor mapping that are presently maintained by UMD/LLO. It is
anticipated that they will be applied to research projects studying limnological
processes, paleoclimate studies, studies of benthic habitats, and for
identification of appropriate sampling sites in lakes around the world. The
broader impacts of the acquisition, in addition to providing a shared-use
resource for U.S. researchers and students, including training students in use
of cutting edge survey technology on the Great Lakes, as well as application to
an array of research topics of significant societal relevance, including climate
change, lake circulation, and habitat research on lake biota. This proposal is
supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;
