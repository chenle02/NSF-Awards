This project develops and evaluates new speech coding algorithms for voice
communication at rates between 2.4 and 8.0 kilobits per second. Particular
emphasis is given to algorithms that are robust to transmission bit errors
caused by noisy channels such as, for example, mobile radio communication
systems. The algorithms under study use basic speech compression techniques such
as vector quantization, analysis.by.synthesis, perceptual weighting, short. and
long.term linear prediction, and vector excitation coding as well as several
newer techniques. This work is important to communication technology
particularly in mobile radio systems where bandwidth is a precious resource and
relatively high error rates must be tolerated due to limited radio frequency
power constraints.
