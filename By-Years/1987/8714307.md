This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds for the development of
a portable CCD-Based Synchrotron Area Detector for Structural Biology. It will
be designed for collecting nd processing diffraction data from protein crystals
and other biological structures. The detector system makes possible a
substantial increase in the efficiency of data collection, the quality of the
data, and the complexity of the problems that can be investigated with synrotron
sources. The structural information revealed by these studies will be vitally
important to advancing understanding in the fields of enzymology, immunology,
virology, protein assembly, bioengineering, and other areas of biotechnology.
The detector system extends the existing system developed previously for use
with conventional x-ray sources. The technology developed will be made available
to the research community, and training will be provided for detector users at
synchrotron beam lines.
