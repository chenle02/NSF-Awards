9634374 Krim Under an SGER award an attempt will be made to determine the
magnitude of the mechanical stimulation in tribochemical events. Single layers
of reagent gas molecules will be adsorbed on the metallic sample surface and the
surface will then be rubbed by the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) in an
oscillating mode, simulating a tribological system. Changes in the nature of the
surface layer will be indicated by the quartz crystal microbalance in which the
sample is mounted. The nature of the reaction molecule can then be determined by
imaging it with the AFM. The initial systems selected for testing (ethylene/Pt
and oxygen/Ag) have been very well characterized as far as their thermal
reaction kinetics are concerned. This should allow the mechanical component of
the tribochemical reaction to be determined from the results. ***
