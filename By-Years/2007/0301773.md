This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled
"Placing soil microorganisms into an ecosystem context: the dynamics of
microbial communities in soils of the southwestern U.S." The proposed research
addresses two fundamental and important questions: (1) how are soil microbial
communities influenced by changes in vegetation and climate? and (2) how do
microbial community dynamics influence soil carbon cycling processes? This work
promises to improve our understanding of how climate change and the widespread
conversion of grasslands to shrublands in the southwestern U.S. affects soil
carbon storage. &lt;br/&gt;
