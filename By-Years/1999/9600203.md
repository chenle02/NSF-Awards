Two experiments are undertaken in the area of intense field atomic physics. The
first experiment involves the study of electron correlation following intense
field dissociation of diatomic molecules. The second experiment uses the same
apparatus to explore collective ionization of multielectron atoms. A significant
fraction of the research builds upon the instrumentation obtained through the
NSF ARI Instrumentation award, PHY-9512313.
