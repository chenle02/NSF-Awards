9321668 Barrett This proposal has two main thrusts. The first is a continuation
of the study of the microscopic effective interaction in nuclei, taking
advantage of new theoretical insights on the effective interaction, along with
better computing capability, with applications to a variety of spectral and
reaction problems. The second centers on the use of the Interacting Boson Model
for the study of nuclear deformations, as well as the identical-band problem.
