This project focuses on the high-precision measurement of both the nuclear spin-
independent and the nuclear spin-dependent parity-nonconserving (PNC) effects in
atomic ytterbium (Yb). While based on proven experimental techniques, these
measurements represent a radically different approach compared to earlier work
in that they use an atom with an unusually large PNC effect and do not rely on
highly accurate atomic calculations. The nuclear spin-independent effect will
have a significant impact on our understanding of the semi-leptonic electroweak
interactions, while the nuclear spin-dependent effect will provide important
information concerning the hadronic electroweak interactions within the nucleus.
