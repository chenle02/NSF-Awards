We work on two outstanding open problems in the statistical mechanics of
charged particle systems. The first one is equivalent to the universality
conjecture of the local eigenvalue statistics of random matrices, an equilibrium
problem. The second one is the construction of relativistic Vlasov kinetic
theory from a microscopic model, a nonequilibrium problem. As to the first
problem, we use a new, entirely analytic strategy to extend the known
universality for the unitary matrices also to the other types of random
matrices: real symmetric, complex normal, and quaternionic self-dual. The
strategy applies to the bulk and to the edge of the spectrum. We also apply our
method to the study of the Laughlin wave function of superconductivity, which is
of a related structure. As for the second problem, we use the recently laid
microscopic dynamical foundations of relativistic many-particle theory to
establish the first derivation of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory in form of
a weak law of large numbers. We also study its fluctuations around the limit in
form of a central limit theorem. &lt;br/&gt; The universality conjecture is
currently one of the top priority problems of random matrix theory, a subfield
of probability and mathematical physics. Its applications range from nuclear
physics, nanotechnology and superconductivity on the physics and technology side
to deep number theoretical implications on the mathematical side - which in turn
have applications in cryptography and related fields. The conjecture has been
proven so far for the simplest type of matrices, but a proof for more general
matrices has so far been elusive. The relativistic Vlasov theory of charged
particle systems forms the dynamical basis for a large part of high temperature
plasma physics, with applications ranging from thermonuclear fusion research to
space plasma research, e.g. about the solar wind and magnetic storms. Its
microscopic atomic underpinnings, which have so far eluded researchers, will
make it possible for the first time to systematically study the accuracy of
Vlasov theory and in particular to compute its leading corrections.
