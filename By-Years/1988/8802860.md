Solar radiation in the ultraviolet and X ray regions ionizes the upper
atmosphere during the daytime above an altitude of about 80 km. The D and E
regions of ionization that are located below about 120 km absorb radio waves
fairly strongly, but the ions recombine rapidly after sunset. This leaves
ionization in the F region at heights from 200 to 300 km that recombines only
slowly during the night, and is normally a good reflector of radio waves, making
possible long distance radio communication at night. However, at times the layer
becomes quite irregular and inhomogeneous and produces fading and distortion of
radio transmissions, and for high frequency transmission from satellites
produces "scintillation" that has similar deleterious effects. The layer
irregularities are generated by electric fields and F region winds in ways that
are not fully understood. The purpose of the present work is to obtain data on
scintillation at latitudes ranging from the equator to the polar caps, and to
perform computer simulations and modelling, in a research program designed to
give a better understanding of the global ionospheric-thermospheric dynamics
that are responsible for the generation, evolution, and dissipation of these
irregularities.
