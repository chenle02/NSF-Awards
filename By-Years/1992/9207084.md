The primary objective of this research is to discover and recover remains of
giant extinct primates in Madagascar and to determine their dates of extinction
and interaction with the first human colonizers of the island. The giant
"subfossil" (recently extinct) lemurs represent an unusual group of primates of
special interest due their large body size and extreme adaptations. The effect
of the very late human arrival on the environment is also noteworthy not only
for its specific impact on the primate fauna of Madagascar but also for its more
general implications with respect to current environmental issues (e.g., the
relationship between human modifications of the environment and associated
extinction events).
