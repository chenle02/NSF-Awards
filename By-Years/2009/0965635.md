Elfriede Kraka and Dieter Cremer of the University of the Pacific are supported
by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue development
of the Unified Reaction Valley Approach (URVA). This program is designed to
provide detailed mechanistic information on elementary chemical reactions.
Methodological improvements are underway to extend the algorithm to variable
step sizes, to develop methods to treat reactions without barriers, to implement
more accurate density functionals, to increase the range of reaction complex
properties, and to automate the analysis procedures. Planned applications
include rearrangement reactions, substitution reactions, addition/cycloaddition
reactions, electrocyclic reactions and chelotropic reactions. This work is
having a broad impact through the creation of a publicly accessible atlas of
chemical reaction mechanisms, which may open new routes of synthesis and
control. The software will be made available to the scientific community, along
with training workshops to ensure its proper use. New courses in computational
chemistry and reaction dynamics that relate directly to the research are under
development at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
