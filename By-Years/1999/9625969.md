9625969 Langdon This research investigates processing parameters and
microstructural characteristics that are associated with ultrafine grained
materials, including the influence of microstructure and concurrent
microstructural evolution on the mechanical properties of materials at elevated
temperatures. The research employs a new processing method equal channel angular
pressing (ECA) to create nanocrystalline metal alloys. Past experiments have
established that metallic alloys with ultrafine grain sizes in the nanometer
range have the potential for high ductilities and superplastic-like flow at
relatively low temperatures. The alloy grain boundaries are generally in a
nonequilibrium condition and contain a large number of extrinsic dislocations.
ECA provides a capability for producing intense plastic straining that can
refine the metal alloy grain size into the nanometer range. Aluminum and
aluminum-based alloys and copper alloys are selected for the study because this
selection allows an evaluation of the role of stacking fault energy and its
effects on dislocation networks and grain boundary structure. %%% The research
could lead to a new processing technique for deformation processing of
nanocrystalline materials and could impact future metal alloy processing in the
metal forming industries. ***
