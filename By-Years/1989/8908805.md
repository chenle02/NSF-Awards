This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of inorganic, bioinorganic, and organometallic chemistry and in the
subfields of synthetic and physical inorganic chemistry. During the twelve month
period beginning 1 July 1989, Professor Bruce will conduct preliminary
experiments to assist in delineating how the structure at the nitrogen center in
imido complexes influences their reactivity. Her Research Planning Grant
pursuits will focus on the synthesis of imido complexes of coordinately
saturated metals in which the imido ligand lone pair remains nonbonding. These
activities should contribute to Professor Bruce's establishing a competitive,
independent research program in her laboratory at the University of Maine. The
research area that will be explored in this project is of potential importance
in organic synthesis and in catalytic and biological processes.
