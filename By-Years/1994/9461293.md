This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
feasibility of developing a novel three-dimensional seismic imaging method. The
novel algorithm is based on a new formulation of the dip moveout (DMO)
correction. Unlike the DMO correction which is formulated for constant velocity
media, the new method called migration to zero-offset (MZO) is valid for
variable velocity media. This new and innovative algorithm will produce images
of three-dimensional structures while being computationally less expensive than
prestack migration. The end result of this research effort is an algorithm that
enables better imaging of geologic structures, and improved reservoir
characterization. The technique allows for greater accuracy in delineating oil
field geological structures which in turn reduces development cost and increases
the amount of hydrocarbons recovered in the existing oil fields.
