This award supports cooperative research in molecular-electron collisions and
photoionization between Vincent McKoy at Caltech and three Brazilian colleagues:
M.A.P. Lima and L.M. Brescansin of the Universidad Estadual de Campinas, and
L.E. Machado, of the Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos in Brazil. The
researchers intend to study the collisions of low-energy electrons with
molecules and the photoionization of nonlinear polyatomic molecules. This work
is based on a Schwinger variational principle specifically formulated for
electron-molecule collisions and, for molecular photoionization, on a numerical
solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using separable potentials.
Professor McKoy's group at Caltech is one of the leading groups in the area of
electron impact molecular excitations. Their publications have been of highest
quality and he has a wide international reputation. The Brazilian scientists
have all worked with the group at Caltech in recent years and have established
research groups in Brazil with graduate students and other scientists. The
proposed work will continue their fruitful international collaboration.
