This project investigates the thioredoxin system of the filamentous
cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp., strains 7119 and 7120. Anabaena is a good model
for higher plants, since like spinach chloroplasts, they contain two dissimilar
thioredoxins. The genes for both Anabaena thioredoxins have been cloned and
substantial amounts of protein are in hand. The differences in redox potentials
and biological activity in vitro will be determined and compared with those of
the chloroplast thioredoxins. The relative amounts of these thioredoxins in
Anabaena under different growth conditions will be determined. Anti-thioredoxin
antibodies will be used to detect and quantitiate the proteins in crude extracts
using Western blotting. Inactivation of these genes in Anabaena will be
investigated in collaboration with J. Elhai at Michigan State University. This
work should provide basic information on the in vivo role of thioredoxins in
photosynthetic organisms. The proteins being studied are important in the
regulation of starch and sucrose synthesis in photosynthetic organisms. Plant
productivity is directly dependent on the distribution of these products of
photosynthesis.//
