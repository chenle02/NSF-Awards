Given the national importance of increasing the number of minority students who
persist in math, science, engineering, premedicine, and predentistry, Phase I
investigated why some such students follow through with their plans to major in
MSE fields and others do not. Data were retrieved from the 1985 College Board
files of 5,602 students with SAT math scores of 550 or above. All were minority
students except for a comparison sample of 404 White students. (In Phase II, 688
Asian American students were added.) In 1987, a first followup was conducted.
Sixty-one percent of the minority students had enrolled in college and were
majoring in MSE, in comparison with 55% of the White students and 70% of the
Asian American students. In Phase III, a booklet based on the results was
prepared for high school students. In Phase IV, the original sample was
resurveyed, five years after high school graduation. Fifty-four percent were
still studying or employed in MSE fields. The purpose of Phase V will be to
conduct a comprehensive in-depth analysis of the entire data file, including
path analyses with corrections for attenuation, as well as logistic regressions
to predict the probability that a student with a given academic and personal
profile will persist in MSE. Models will be developed and tested on the sample
as a whole and for each gender-by-ethnic group, so far a sample sizes permit,
and for scientists, engineers, and M.D.s separately.
