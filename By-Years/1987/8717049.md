During the summer of 1984, several scientists in atmospheric electricity and
radar meteorology conducted a thunderstorm experiment near Langmuir Laboratory,
New Mexico Institute of Mines and Technology which is located on a mountaintop
near Socorro, New Mexico. The objective of this experiment was to obtain a
comprehensive data set of the electrical and microphysical properties of the
thunderstorms formed near the mountaintop so that we could better understand
thunderstorm electricity. Under this award, Professor Ray will analyze the data
collected by four Doppler radars: three surrounding the mountain and one on the
mountaintop. The three-dimensional wind field to be extracted from the radar
data is essential to the understanding of the transport of charged particles
within thunderstorms.
