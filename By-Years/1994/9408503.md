BIR-9408503, PI-Schaffer, Rice University: As information about DNA sequences
accumulates, it is becoming increasingly important to identify the location of
genes or segments of genes. Genetic linkage analysis is a statistical technique
used to map genes and find their location in relation to other known segments of
DNA. The most popular software for doing this is called LINKAGE, but the
computational time required to solve problems is often prohibitive. FASTLINK,
developed by this principle investigator, is an improved version of LINKAGE.
This award will support the parallelization of the FASTLINK code to
substantially improve the computational speed, and to improve the shared
distributed memory system named TreadMarks, which manages the algorithms on a
network of workstations.
