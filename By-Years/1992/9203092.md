Long & Medium-Term Research: Cell-Cycle Regulation of the Jun Proteins This
award is under the Long and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of
Excellence Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three
to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.
The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of
unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Curt M. Pfarr to work with Dr. Moshe Yaniv of the Department of
Biotechnology, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France. While the Jun Proteins are
thought to function by binding to DNA and interacting with other nuclear
factors, the molecular details of these interactions are still poorly
understood. In addition, how the amount of each Jun varies under different
growth conditions and where Jun is compartmentalized within the cell is
presently unknown. Dr. Pfarr will use three experimental approaches to address
these questions using cultured cells as a model. They are 1) localization of Jun
proteins; 2) Inducible overexpression of Jun; and 3) affinity-probe analysis of
cell extracts. By this concerted set of experiments he hopes to reveal novel
aspects of Jun function and further clarify the complex control pathways of cell
proliferation. The award recommendation provides funds to cover international
travel, a stipend for twelve months and a dependents' allowance.
