This study seeks to develop and apply new concepts in digital holography to
obtain three-dimensional images of airborne particles, called "coarse mode
aerosols" (CMAs). These aerosols are a major source of uncertainty for radiative
impacts in climate models. The planned research will use a pioneering digital
holographic design, developed by the PI, to measure various optical parameters
of these aerosols. The associated education plan in this CAREER award will
integrate hands-on teaching in a research lab setting and the development of
online modules based on the planned research. The overall planned research and
educational components seek to recruit underrepresented minority students and
provide a unique learning opportunity in applied optics through the university's
Expanding Diversity in Astronomy and Physics Program (ED-APP).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to establish a new characterization
paradigm that is free from the drawbacks of conventional light scattering and
can unambiguously describe CMA particle size and shape. Optical observables will
be automatically measured, which include the angular scattering pattern, total
cross sections and single scatter albedo. A series of digital holographic
experiments will be used to image CMAs with particle sizes of the order of 1-300
microns. A new analysis method will then be used to quantify the particle size
and shape distributions. From these measured particle holograms, accurate
estimates of optical observables will be extracted. The goal of this research is
to solve the inverse problem, by removing the long standing difficulty relating
scattering measurements to particle properties. The study also seeks to
correlate particle morphology with optical observables - of critical importance
in many remote sensing applications. A portable version of the laboratory
holographic instrumentation will be developed for field studies. The goal here
is to apply the same techniques in urban and agricultural environments.
