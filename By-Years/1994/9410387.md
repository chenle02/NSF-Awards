9410387 Mathiowitz The research proposed in this application is concerned with
the development of a new magnetic method to study bioadhesion between individual
polymeric microspheres and living segments of gastrointestinal tissue, in vitro.
The adhesion forces will be measured by quantifying the magnetic force required
to hold an iron-loaded microsphere stationary, while the adherent tissue is
separated at a constant rate. X-ray imaging of animals, which have been fed
microspheres loaded with radio-opaque materials, will be used to determine the
location and duration of contact of the microspheres with target structures, in
vivo. A focus of the project will be to correlate adhesive forces determined in
vitro with GI residence time in vivo. In addition, the use of bioadhesive
microspheres to improve drug delivery to ulcerated GI tissue will be evaluated.
