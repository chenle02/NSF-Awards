To the extent that Biomedical Engineering (BME) is rooted in the biological and
medical sciences, a core Systems Physiology course provides undergraduates with
an important learning opportunity. However, the rapid evolution of BME's
biological and medical foundations necessitates that beyond learning systems
physiology's content and concepts, pre-professionals must learn to apply
relevant aspects of systems physiology to unanticipated new tasks. The
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology's EC-2000 criteria similarly
support engineers learning to apply their knowledge. This paper describes a
principled approach by which we are designing a BME instructional environment in
which students learn systems physiology subject matter coupled to its
application. We explain how our design principles for this instructional
environment evolved from the Project-based Science pedagogical framework and a
modern understanding of how people learn, and further discuss our process of
participatory design, which involves individuals from both BME and the Learning
Sciences. We present our progress to date, and the ideas we have distilled from
this experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
