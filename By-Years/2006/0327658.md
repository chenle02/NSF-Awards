Our focus is on the extratropical atmosphere, with special emphasis
&lt;br/&gt;on the dynamics in highly anisotropic backgrounds, such as is the
&lt;br/&gt;case near the tropopause. Theoretically, the wave dynamics for a
&lt;br/&gt;highly-anisotropic background atmosphere has been much less studied
&lt;br/&gt;than for the homogeneous and isotropic case. Yet it is intrinsic
&lt;br/&gt;in the atmospheric mixing process that nearly-stepwise environments
&lt;br/&gt;form in the atmosphere. Furthermore, when the anisotropy is in
&lt;br/&gt;potential vorticity (PV), the impact on large-scale wave dynamics
&lt;br/&gt;occurs at leading order, since Rossby wave propagation depends on
&lt;br/&gt;the presence of PV gradients. The proposed work focuses on
&lt;br/&gt;the dynamical impact of background anisotropy on cyclone
organization, &lt;br/&gt;frontogenesis, gravity wave emission and the overall
atmospheric &lt;br/&gt;energy spectrum. The unifying theme is that it is crucial
to study &lt;br/&gt;the whole spectrum of scales simultaneously, from energy
injection &lt;br/&gt;at synoptic scales down to dissipation at frontal scales,
because &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear interactions affect all scales in between. Hence,
the&lt;br/&gt;low-frequency variability and predictability of the planetary
&lt;br/&gt;scales depend significantly, through nonlinear cascades, on the
&lt;br/&gt;dissipative process at the meso- and frontal scales. A new
&lt;br/&gt;class of dynamical models take specific advantage of jumps in
&lt;br/&gt;potential vorticity at a tropopause discontinuity. Exact- and
&lt;br/&gt;high-resolution solutions provide a testbed to assess the adequacy
&lt;br/&gt;of current operational models in resolving the dynamical
anisotropies. &lt;br/&gt;Recognition of the highly-anisotropic nature of
tropospheric &lt;br/&gt;dynamics redirects previous mathematical efforts on
isotropic and &lt;br/&gt;homogeneous turbulence to atmospherically more relevant
anisotropic &lt;br/&gt;problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weather over North
America is greatly influenced by &lt;br/&gt;the pattern of winds near the
tropopause, a level of sharp&lt;br/&gt;change in the atmospheric conditions
found at an altitude of&lt;br/&gt;roughly 10 km. Because operational weather
models often do &lt;br/&gt;not have sufficient resolution to accurately describe
the &lt;br/&gt;atmospheric motions at these heights, our ability to understand,
&lt;br/&gt;and thus forecast, the weather and climate throughout the
&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere is diminished. An example of one of the many issues
&lt;br/&gt;which will be investigated is why many of the current climate
&lt;br/&gt;models show a biased error of colder temperatures near the
&lt;br/&gt;tropopause. The scope of this work seeks to unify the dynamics
&lt;br/&gt;of the atmosphere from the largest continental-scale (low pressure)
&lt;br/&gt;cells, through their subsequent collapse to intermediate-scale
&lt;br/&gt;storm fronts, and the generation of yet smaller-scale (gravity wave)
&lt;br/&gt;turbulence. The primary focus of new theoretical progress is to
&lt;br/&gt;account for the important contributions of the tropopause in the
&lt;br/&gt;evolution of weather patterns. The proposed research lies at the
&lt;br/&gt;intersection between mathematics and atmospheric science, which
&lt;br/&gt;is now possible through the synthesis of the investigators' recent
&lt;br/&gt;advances in tropopause modeling and new results in the numerical
&lt;br/&gt;computation of the statistics of atmospheric turbulence. The
&lt;br/&gt;anticipated impact of further understanding of how energy in the
&lt;br/&gt;lower atmosphere evolves over the full range of thousands down to
&lt;br/&gt;tens of kilometers would be the elucidation of currently
&lt;br/&gt;under-resolved features of weather prediction and climate models.
