This grant will provide partial support for a conference on the use of
computers in teaching physics. The conference will be held at North Carolina
State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, during the week 1-5 August 1988.
Attendees will be teachers of physics, both pre- college and undergraduate.
Topics will include teaching strategies using computers for classroom
demonstrations and student activities, computer-assisted instruction including
tutorials and simulations, microcomputer-based laboratories, hardware and
interfacing, programming languages, and computational tools. In addition to the
NSF funds, the conference will be supported by about twice the amount from other
sources.
