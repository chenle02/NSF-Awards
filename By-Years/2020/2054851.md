The spectral statistics of random matrices describe key properties of the energy
levels (eigenstates) of many disordered physical systems. The scope of their
applications has expanded recently. For example, integrable growth models,
quantum mechanics, and analytic number theory exhibit random matrix eigenvalue
distributions. Determinants of random matrices also serve as tools for the
analysis of many high-dimensional random functions. Applications include
criteria for the possibility of optimization of loss functions in deep learning.
More recently, a new connection has emerged, a hierarchical structure behind the
eigenvalues of random matrices and L-functions, their extremes being
characterized by analogy with branching processes. This project will extend and
combine recent methods developed for these random matrix spectral and
hierarchical universalities to enlarge their scope, and apply these techniques
to random landscapes. The project provides research training opportunities for
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will first work on universal
connections between random matrices, branching processes, L-functions and
gaussian multiplicative chaos, by studying the Fyodorov-Keating conjectures up
to tightness of the maximum, their universality in the class of Wigner matrices
and beta ensembles, and the emergence of the 2d Gaussian multiplicative chaos
measures from the characteristic polynomial of random normal matrices. The PI
will extend the Fisher-Hartwig asymptotic formulas to settings allowing any
temperature. The PI will also study the topological complexity of random
landscapes and the universality of their critical exponents, as the signal and
noise vary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
