ABSTRACT OPP-9732747 JACOBSON, RANDALL OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH Through this
award the Office of Naval Research provides building space at Thule Air Base
that is used by the National Science Foundation to store Arctic field equipment
and to stage field programs that require heavy airlift services of the New York
Air National Guard to the ice cap. Field work in northern Greenland and on the
Arctic Ocean ice pack is better facilitated by access to Thule Air Base because
its northern location shortens the distance over which logistics operations must
be conducted. In addition to use of the building space for logistics staging,
the building is also used to house a large equipment pool of Arctic field gear
that should be stored and maintained as closely as possible to potential
research sites in order to provide ready access in case of emergency
requirements.
