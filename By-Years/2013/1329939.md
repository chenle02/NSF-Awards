Until now, the "cyber" component of automobiles has consisted of control
algorithms and associated software for vehicular subsystems designed to achieve
one or more performance, efficiency, reliability, comfort, or safety goals,
primarily based on short-term intrinsic vehicle sensor data. However, there
exist many extrinsic factors that can affect the degree to which these goals can
be achieved. These factors can be determined from: longer-term traces of in-
built sensor data that can be abstracted as triplines, socialized versions of
these that are shared amongst vehicle users, and online databases. These three
sources of information collectively constitute the automotive
infoverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project harnesses this automotive infoverse
to achieve these goals through high-confidence vehicle tuning and driver
feedback decisions. Specifically, the project develops software called Headlight
that permits the rapid development of apps that use the infoverse to achieve one
or more goals. Advisory apps can provide feedback to the driver in order to
ensure better fuel efficiency, while auto-tuning goals can set car parameters to
promote safety. Allowing vehicles and such apps to share vehicle data with
others and to use extrinsic information results in novel information processing,
assurance, and privacy challenges. The project develops methods, algorithms and
models to address these challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact - This
project can have significant societal impact by reducing carbon emissions and
improving vehicular safety, can spur innovation in tuning methods and encourage
researchers to experiment with this class of cyber-physical systems. The active
participation of General Motors will strongly facilitate technology transfer.
There is significant outreach including high school student participation,
undergraduate research activities, internships, and creation of an open
framework for plug and play application developers to use.
