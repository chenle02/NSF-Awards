The goal of this proposal is to develop a stimulating laboratory program for
students in the College's Ecology and Environmental Technology (EET) program.
The acquisition of a bench scale Sequential Batch Reactor system allows students
to observe and analyze microbial populations and evaluate the effects of
nutrients and other environmental parameters on biochemical processes within the
reactors. Kinetic constants of the processes may also be determined, providing
for the construction of predictive mathematical models. The bioreactors allow
students to use microorganisms as models to demonstrate basic scientific
principles, and learn about the application microorganisms and bioreactors in
the management of wastes.
