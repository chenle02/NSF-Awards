This grant is in the area of adaptive signal processing which finds wide
application in tailoring signal processing algorithms to current signal and
noise characteristics, thus insuring best performance. Linear least squares
prediction (LLSP) is widely used in adaptive speech processing to model the
speech signal. In this application there is a need for the fast LLSP algorithms
recently developed by Prof. Bojanczyk and others. This research is pursuing the
development of these algorithms. The numerical stability of the fast LLSP
algorithms is being studied. Modifications will be incorporated to improve
stability while introducing only a modest overhead penalty. Also parallel
algorithms suitable for systolic and hypercube architecture will be
investigated. This grant is in the area of adaptive signal processing which
