The objective of this effort is a continuous process that converts methane to
methanol. The strategy is to convert methane first to a methyl halide using a
solid electrolyte to remove the hydrogen ions formed, and to then hydrolyze the
halide over a basic catalyst. Perovskites of various types can perform all these
roles, and the process depends on finding a suitable mixed perovskite membrane.
If such a system demonstrated high efficiency and reasonable operating life, the
commercial potential would be enormous. Easy conversion of natural gas to a
liquid fuel or a chemical feedstock could revolutionize the economics of energy
production.
