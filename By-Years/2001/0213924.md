This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project addresses the
development of Innovative Phase Shifter Utilizing Nonreciprocal Resonator. In a
nonreciprocal resonator, such as a ferrite disk, wave propagation is non-
degenerate, and the resonant modes all assume at differently frequencies. Thus,
for a given resonant mode its phase is unambiguous, allows it to be coupled out
providing the function of a phase shifter. Phase shift obtained in this manner
is uniform, and the operation is independent of the phase angle obtained. The
phase shifter for this project will be compact in size, providing 360 degrees
phase angle with low insertion loss. Furthermore, it allows for circuit
minimization facilitating fabrication as a large array.

Potential commercial applications include Low-cost, small-volume collision
avoidance radar capable of beam steering.
