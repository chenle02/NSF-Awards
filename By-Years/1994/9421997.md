9421997 Hatcher This award is to purchase a cluster of 24 100MHz i486 systems
connected via both an Ethernet and an ATM network constructed from 3 12-port ATM
switches. Each i486 system will have sufficient main memory to allow large
parallel computations to be run on the cluster and sufficient disk space to
allow parallel I/O experiments to be performed. This equipment will be dedicated
to supporting research in computer and information science and engineering. The
equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
the implementation of data-parallel programs on clusters of high-speed
processors utilizing a dedicated high-bandwidth network; the design,
implementation and evaluation of extensions to the data-parallel programming
model to support parallel I/O; the parallel implementation of the UNH Flexidesc
system, which integrates scientific data visualization and database technology
to support exploratory analysis of scientific data; the development of parallel
algorithms for graphics and data visualization; the development of parallel
algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems. ***
