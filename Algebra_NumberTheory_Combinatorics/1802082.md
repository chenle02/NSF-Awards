This award supports research in mathematical physics. The topological and
geometric structures of various kinds of spaces have captivated mathematicians
and physicists for many years. The current proposal lies at the interface
between algebra, geometry, combinatorics and analysis with applications to
2D-topological quantum field theory. In recent years the PI has organized
several workshops that have specifically facilitated interactions between
different research communities. The PI will continue to promote interactions
between enumerative geometry, algebra and the theory of quantization in the
direction emphasized in this project.

The proposed project is aimed at understanding a new point of view utilizing
edge contraction operations of ribbon graphs. These operations were originally
used to give a recursion relation of the generalized Catalan numbers of
arbitrary genus. This recursion implies the DVV formula for the intersection
numbers of tautological cotangent classes on the moduli space of stable pointed
curves. The PI and a collaborator have discovered, an alternative axiomatic
formulation for 2D-topological quantum field theory by edge contraction
operations of ribbon graphs. The set of rules based on edge contractions also
represent the key structure of topological recursion. The edge contraction
axioms reflect both the structure of a Frobenius algebra and the pair of pants
decomposition of a topological surface. The pair of pants decomposition of a
punctured Riemann surface was first used by Mirzakhani to give a recursion of
Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic
boundary components of fixed lengths. Using the multiplication and
comultiplication of the Frobenius algebra we aim at giving alternative axiomatic
definition of cohomological field theories in the same way. The goal of this
project is to study the interplay between topological recursion, Mirzakhani
recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes, the classification theorem of CohFT for
semi-simple Frobenius algebra and character varieties.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
