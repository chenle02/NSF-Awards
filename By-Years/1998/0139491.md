The primary goal of this research is to analyze three ice cores collected by a
joint Chinese-US team of researchers in the spring of 2001. At that time, a
117-meter ice core was recovered from the East Rongbuk (ERC) glacier at 6500
meters above sea level. In addition to these analyses, the researchers will
participate in a joint Chinese-US expedition to the region to retrieve modern
day glaciological and meteorological data to aid in the interpretation of the
ice core data.

Based on local accumulation rates and layer thinning estimates, the new
117-meter ERC core likely represents at least several centuries of snow
deposition. Thus, the researchers have the opportunity to develop a calibrated,
high-resolution paleoclimate record from the region that will complement
previous paleoclimatological research from Mt. Everest and Central Asia.

The analysis of the ice cores will focus on producing a detailed time-series of
major ion concentrations (i.e., chloride, nitrate, sulfate, calcium, magnesium,
sodium, potassium and ammonium), stable isotope ratios (i.e., oxygen and
deuterium), and total element concentration (i.e., iron, aluminum, calcium, and
sulfur).

These data will be used to develop: -- high-resolution time series of Late
Holocene climate variability for the region involving atmospheric circulation,
temperature, and precipitation, and -- detailed environmental records of biomass
burning, dust storms, anthropogenic pollutants, and marine and continental
biogenic source productivity.

The analyses of the ice cores could increase our understanding of the
atmospheric dynamics of an important weather system that impacts a heavily
populated region of the world. The interaction and cooperation of scientific
colleagues from the United States and China will enhance the prospects for
success.
