The solar magnetic field is cyclical in time and intermittent in space. The
field plays a basic role in the formation of the Sun's hot outer corona and in
the twenty two year activity cycle. This study will investigate magnetic
phenomena on the Sun which range from probing the interior field using
helioseismology to studying the evolution of the field in the corona, including
the generation of waves and the acceleration of particles in solar flares. The
helioseismology studies will help to elucidate the structure and temporal
behavior of the magnetic field in the solar interior. The investigation of
coronal magnetic field evolution will focus on the formulation of singularities
and the loss of equilibrium, which are important for understanding both steady
state coronal heating and eruptive phenomena such as flares and mass ejections.
The particle acceleration studies will focus on the generation of hydromagnetic
disturbances during the flare process and on simulations of particle interaction
with these waves. The latter should have application to acceleration in a wide
range of environments in addition to solar flares. Both analytical and numerical
techniques based on prior studies will be employed.
