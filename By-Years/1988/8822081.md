This award is in support of the second Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP II).
The principal objective of GISP II is the recovery and paleoclimatological
analysis of a deep ice core from central Greenland. The primary objectives of
this aspect are to study the effects of ice flow on the stratigraphy along the
GISP II flowline, and to determine a preliminary time scale for the deep
borehole site. Detailed variations of surface topography, strain rate, surface
velocity, and accumulation rate are to be measured. These results will be used
to determine the locations of intense shear zones resulting from the variation
of the effective viscosity with depth and the influence of the bedrock
topography. The large scale surface velocity field will be determined by re-
surveying sites in the GISP II site selection grid and the mass balance of the
region will be computed. All these results will be used along with a finite-
difference numerical flowline model to calculate the stress, strain rate and
velocity fields along the flowline, and the depth-age relation at the borehole
sites.
