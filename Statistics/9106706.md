Estimation of the mean vector and the covariance matrix for multivariate data
is an extensive practice. The investigation is aimed at studying properties of
estimators which are robust against contamination of long tailed distributions.
The study will investigate the breakdown properties of M- and S-estimates,along
with projection-based estimates. A study of the properties will determine their
suitability in real life applications.
