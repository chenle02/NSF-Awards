Abstract FLACLAS, C. AST-9618803 Funds will be used to build an optimized
coronographic imager for use with the adaptive optical system on the 100-inch
telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory. The Imager will be used to evaluate
the performance limits for coronographic systems in imaging circumstellar
regions.
