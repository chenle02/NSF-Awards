*** 9725263 Parish This project is a study of how the cold and intense surface
winds that flow down from the antarctic continental ice sheet (the so-called
katabatic winds) interact with the larger scale pressure gradients that result
from the passage of synoptic weather systems around the antarctic perimeter.
Recent research has shown that while katabatic winds play an important role in
the atmospheric mass, heat, and momentum budgets at high southern latitudes,
their interaction with synoptic weather systems is complex and unclear, with
different studies leading to different conclusions. This study will make use of
a series of observations on the structure of the antarctic troposphere that
resulted from an international effort to assemble the most complete, detailed,
and accurate data set possible for several prescribed observation periods in
1994 and 1995 - the First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere (FROST).
State-of-the-art numerical models will complement these observations: the
National Center for Atmospheric Research/Pennsylvania State University MM5
model, the Colorado State University RAMS model, and the University of Wisconsin
NMS model. Preliminary work has indicated that these models will be capable of
realistically resolving the antarctic environment. Numerical simulations of
cyclonic systems along the coast of East Antarctica will be conducted to resolve
the response of the katabatic wind regime. Extensive evaluation of model results
will take place in order to determine the magnitude of individual terms in the
equations of motion that are affected by the synoptic systems, the katabatic
winds, and the underlying terrain. It is expected that this work will provide
new information and a greater understanding of the connections of antarctic
weather systems to the circulation of the free atmosphere both at higher
altitudes and lower latitudes, and to global atmospheric processes. ***
