The goal of this doctoral dissertation research project is to develop a new 3D
analytical approach to untangle the impact of environmental and anthropogenic
factors on past human and animal populations, ultimately offering insight into
the transition of humans from foragers to farmers. By providing new 3D
quantitative techniques that enable animal bones to be utilized as proxies of
past anthropogenic and environmental impacts, this project contributes to
important discussions about the conditions surrounding this transition. These
data provide the background conditions under which human sedentism and
agriculture arose, allowing these events to be investigated on a local scale
while simultaneously contributing to knowledge of how the earthâ€™s major systems
changed through time. Importantly, this research highlights the essential role
of archaeology in recognizing the long-term impacts of humans on the
environment, and how archaeological data can help guide policy and conservation
efforts by informing on the ongoing interactions between humans, climate change
and biotic communities.

In collaboration with an international team this research will develop new
quantitative algorithms for 3D shape analysis including two new complete model
analysis (CMA) procedures to position (orient in 3D space) and segment 3D bone
models for quantitative analysis. These procedures will be applied to 3D bone
models from modern skeletal material from mountain gazelles of known age, sex
and geographic location to identify areas of bone surfaces that provide good
markers of sex, precipitation, temperature and locomotion. These algorithms will
be applied to 14 animal bone assemblages from archaeological sites spanning the
foraging-farming transition to better understand the intensity and nature of
human-environment interactions during this pivotal time in human prehistory.
This study will contribute both by developing new algorithms to analyze 3D bone
models, and by providing the necessary tools to interpret animal morphological
data. Furthermore, the CMA algorithms generated by this project will have
applicability to a wide set of research questions and can be adapted by other
disciplines.
