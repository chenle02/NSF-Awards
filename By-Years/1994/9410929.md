Abstract 94-10929 Studies of the NOD kinesin-like protein found in Drosophila
melanogaster and its role in mediating achiasmate disjunction will be continued.
These studies are designed to test a model in which the NOD kinesin-like protein
is distributed along the length of the chromosome arms and acts to push
chromosomes away from the poles. We also propose to continue our molecular and
genetic studies of the Axs gene and its role in allowing the proper separation
of achiasmate homologs. In the absence of normal Axs gene product, achiasmate
homologs fail to separate and cause the developing spindle to buckle, fray or
even break. Thus, a detailed understanding of the Axs gene product will provide
significant insight into the manner by which achiasmate homologs are associated
prior to their separation. Finally, a screen designed to identify mutations
specifically defective in heterologous segregation will be carried out. The
subsequent molecular analysis of genes defined by these mutations represents a
long term goal of this proposal. %%% How chromosomes identify their partners and
thereby allow the orderly process of transmission of the correct number and
types of chromosomes to progeny is a central question in heredity. Work from
this laboratory has contributed much to our understanding of some of the
involved mechanisms. Genetic approaches have been used to demonstrate that, in
Drosophila females at least, there are two separate systems of achiasmate
segregation. The elucidation of the physical bases of these processes at the
molecular level is the goal of this work. ***
