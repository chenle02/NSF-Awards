The project is devoted to two related topics, namely nonlinear hyperbolic
equations and partial differential equations with nonsmooth coefficients. The
hyperbolic equations we consider are either semilinear (such as the critical
Wave-Maps and Yang Mills equations), for which one hopes to obtain both local
and global results, or nonlinear, for which the aim is to improve the local
theory. The problems related to partial differential equations with nonsmooth
coefficients are mostly inspired by nonlinear pde's; this includes various
Strichartz and Carleman type estimates, as well as hyperbolic boundary value
problems.

The equations of interest for this project can be loosely described as models
for wave-like phenomena, such as generalized relativity and nonlinear
ellasticity. While many physical models are genuinely nonlinear, their
mathematical analysis is extremely difficult, often beyond the current
mathemathical theory; thus, in most cases we contend ourselves with simplified
models which are linear or only mildly nonlinear. The proposed work is part of a
larger program whose aim is to understand such fully nonlinear equations. The
strategy is to study a sequence of increasingly difficult model problems which
get closer and closer to the relevant physical model, so that at each step some
new nonlinear feature is understood.
