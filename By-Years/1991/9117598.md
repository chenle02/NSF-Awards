This research program is a combined experimental/theoretical effort to
investigate the physics of electron correlation in simple, many-particle
systems. Using photons from synchroton light source and heavily charged particle
collisions, the investigators probe the dynamics of double ionization and
ionization-excitation in the simplest of all a three-body systems, the helium
atom.
