With funding from the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological
Education Program, the project addresses the national need for technicians in
established and emerging advanced technological fields. Aligned with the state's
strategic vision for community colleges, Science Foundation of Arizona (SFAz)
and eight rural community colleges will establish a Rural Community College STEM
Network to enhance institutional partnerships; facilitate the adaptation,
implementation, and testing of the STEM Pathway Model, a suite of effective
curricular and student support activities; and accelerate the delivery and
implementation of the model. The project's objective is to demonstrate the
feasibility of expanding and replicating key success factors of the STEM Pathway
Model that have been piloted at one of the community colleges.

A partnership composed of members representing industry, the secondary and post-
secondary education communities, and state organizations will direct the effort,
which will meet the technical and engineering oriented workforce needs of the
state. The project will (1) expand awareness of STEM careers through student
engagement; (2) ensure that high school students in rural school districts place
in college-level mathematics courses and graduate from high school with college
credits (ensuring college readiness); and (3) increase the number of students
who enter and successfully complete STEM technician and engineering degree or
credentialing programs at these rural community colleges, transfer to four year
technical or engineering programs, and/or enter the STEM workforce. Project
deliverables will include a technology-based resource guide and information
platform that will assist the participating colleges in identifying and
deploying best and promising practices (e.g., suite of effective curricular and
student support activities), build a network of rural community colleges to
support deployment of these practices, develop comprehensive pathways from
awareness of careers in STEM to completion of degrees and/or credentials, and
prepare students to enter the STEM workforce. Implementing a common suite of
methods from document analysis of student records and surveys to interviews and
focus groups, the quantitative and qualitative mixed methods evaluation will
assess project outcomes (e.g., college credits earned in high school, enrollment
in technician progams and completion data, student experiences, and success of
the SFAz+8 network).

The participating rural community colleges are: * Arizona Western College *
Central Arizona College * Cochise College * Coconino Community College * Eastern
Arizona College * Mohave Community College * Northland Pioneer College * Yavapai
