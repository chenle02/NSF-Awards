The researcher developed an international optically switched data mining testbed
called the Tera Mining Testbed, linking the US, Canada and Amsterdam initially,
and which supports the remote analysis and distributed mining of Gigabyte and
Terabyte size data sets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher developed
specialized protocols for moving data efficiently over high performance networks
without the necessity of network tuning by striping data across networks and
using related methods. The researcher also developed high performance data
servers for OC-XY networks and optical switched networks&lt;br/&gt;incorporating
parallel network transport and parallel input/output.&lt;br/&gt;
