Prof. Goodwin will continue his research on the study of catalytic mechanisms by
means of the Steady Scope Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA)
technique. In this research he intends to extend the SSITKA technique to
sequential reactions, particularly to the hydrogenation of CO into methanol and
dimethyl ether on bifunctional catalysts, including Pd supported on silica,
alumina, HY zeolite, silica-alumina, and silica-HY zeolite. Surface
concentration of reactive intermediates, specific site activity, site
heterogeneity, readsorption of product, will be discriminated for each type of
site, namely metallic and acidic sites. Moment analysis, linear convolution, and
deconvolution methods will be used to analyze the isotopic transient kinetic
data obtained from the described reaction. The SSITKA program will be
distributed freely.
