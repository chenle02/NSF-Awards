ECS-9619785 Dawson The active magnetic bearing (AMB) is a non-contact means of
supporting a rotating member such as a motor or pump shaft. That is, an AMB
system can be used as a substitute for standard mechanical contact supports,
such as rollers or ball bearings. The AMB offers several important advantages
over conventional mechanical bearings which can lead to improvements in a large
variety of devices (e.g., possible rotating machine systems include electric
motors, electric generators, gasoline or diesel engines, jet engines and
turbines, fan, blowers, etc.). Specifically, AMBs: I) are not subject to
frictional losses, ii) can be used to compensate for rotor unbalanced, iii) can
operate in both high and low temperature environments, and iv) eliminate
contamination associated with lubricants and friction wear. The project will be
mathematical modeling and control algorithms and the associated software and
hardware modules for high precision control of large gap AMBs and for the
demonstration of their corresponding applications. Specifically, the proposed
research will bring recent advances in nonlinear theory to an emerging technical
area which could spawn a potentially large export market for U.S. manufactures.
