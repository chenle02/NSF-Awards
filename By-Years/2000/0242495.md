This proposal seeks funding to support minority-serving higher education
institutions and schools develop competitive proposals for the Math and Science
Partnerships. During the Fall of 2002, four workshops will be held. Teams will
be invited to participate where the partnering higher education institution is
recognized as an Hispanic Serving Institution, Tribal College, Historically
Black College or University, or other minority-serving institution. These two-
day workshops will focus on helping teams develop and refine their plans for a
comprehensive or targeted MSP project. Particular emphasis will be placed on
forming strong partnerships, developing a highly qualified teacher workforce,
implementing a challenging curriculum and designing a rigorous evaluation. After
the next round of MSP awards are made, QEM will hold a one-day workshop that
will focus on next steps, either program implementation for successful projects
or revisions of proposals for non-awarded projects.
