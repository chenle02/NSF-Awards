The Graduate Workshop on Inverse Problems and Applications at Colorado State
University, July 30th - August 3rd, 2007, will bring together graduate students
from eight countries including the United States to learn about theoretical and
computational aspects of inverse problems from seven world-renowned experts.
Inverse problems is an active area of contemporary mathematics with applications
in engineering, biology, geophysics, medicine, finance, and chemistry. Students
at various levels in their graduate degree programs will attend a series of
minicourses developed by the experts, in each of which they will study a
specific topic through lectures and assigned problems. Some topics will be tied
to a specific application, while others will be more generally applicable.
Participants will have access to the computational facilities at Colorado State
University for working on computing problems. Students will have the opportunity
to discuss the assigned problems as well as other topics with the experts during
the interaction sessions, which are time allotted during the day for students to
work on the problems and talk to the experts in a less formal setting than the
lecture hall. The goals of the workshop are to provide instruction in inverse
problems and to provide a venue for interaction between senior researchers in
inverse problems and graduate students at both a technical and personal level.
