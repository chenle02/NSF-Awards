*** 9514139 Fuller This is a planning visit proposal submitted by Dr. Michael
Fuller, the University of California at Santa Barbara. He plans to visit his
counterparts in Kalimantan, Indonesia for site evaluation for a paleomagnetic
study and for field logistics. Large scale platewide rotations have been noted
by paleomagnetic studies using the results collected from the Philippine Sea
Plate in the East to Myanmar (Burma) in the West. Additional paleomagnetic data
from Kalimantan, Indonesia are needed to ascertain whether such geological
signals are present in the area. Dr. Fuller will use this planning visit to
assess the accessibility to research sites and field logistics. ***
