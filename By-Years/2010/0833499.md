ARI-MA: Active Interrogation Using Radiation Generated from Intense Laser
Produced Electron Beams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high cost and large size of
conventional accelerator technology has stimulated a search for new methods of
accelerating particles. The objective of this research is to develop compact and
efficient radiation sources for active interrogation of objects in order to
detect nuclear materials. The approach will be to use radiation sources
generated by high power laser produced particle beams.&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the project stems from the novel approach to particle beam
generation involving the use of the large electrostatic fields generated by
intense laser pulses within plasmas, which can be several orders of magnitude
higher than those found in conventional accelerators. These fields are ideal for
accelerating electron bunches to high energies over very short distances. In the
proposed work, the 300 Terawatt laser facility at the University of Michigan
will be used to generate Giga-electronvolt-range energy electron beams which
will then be used to generate a high flux of highly directional gamma rays to be
used for simultaneous radiography and active interrogation (gamma ray
activation) of material. The production of very energetic proton beams from
underdense targets will also be investigated which may allow more efficient
production of pions and muons.&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research may lead to
broader impacts since such beams will be of benefit for a wide range of research
which presently relies on accelerator technology including biology, materials
science and medicine. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate
in this work and efforts will be made to increase public understanding of laser
and beam technology as well as to promote diversity. &lt;br/&gt;
