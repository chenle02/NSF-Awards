This grant provides participant support funds for the 19th International
Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT) to be held July 18-20,
2011 in Berkeley, California. The symposium will showcase 35 original papers
drawn from a pool of over 500 submissions from around the world. Selections were
made via a rigorous, multi-stage peer-review process. The 35 selected papers
will be presented in plenary sessions. To disseminate their findings, all papers
will be published in i) hard-copy proceedings; ii) Elsevier's on-line Procedia
series; and iii) the prestigious archival journal series Transportation
Research. A special workshop session will be held to explore additional ways of
placing the symposium findings into professional practice. The funds from NSF
will support key elements of the symposium. Part of the funds will cover
fellowships to foster participation from a select set of advanced graduate
students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception,
the ISTTT has been the premier gathering of transport theorists. The coming
Berkeley Symposium promises to build on that tradition: the papers accepted for
the event represent breakthrough research from around the world. These papers
have the potential to challenge current thinking about transport science, and
perhaps even to transform the field. And the papers address a variety of
pressing topics in transportation: they include ideas for promoting greener,
more sustainable travel modes, and for transporting people and goods in
emergency situations. Given the role that transportation plays in the world and
in the lives of her people, the ideas unveiled in the coming symposium are
expected to be of real significance.
