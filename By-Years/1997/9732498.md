9732498 Lee This project uses laser light forces to directly focus gallium and
indium atoms. It is proposed to demonstrate that light forces can modulate the
atomic density and provide a controlled growth of quantum wire and quantum dot
structures in molecular beam epitaxy. The work will have significant impact on
the field of optoelectronics and on the physics of heterostructures.
