The proposed research will attempt to understand the organization and regulation
of genes that behave in a peculiar manner when moved next to heterochromatin,
the cytologically compacted regions of chromosomes. Two genes, the Drosophila
melanogaster brown and karmoisin loci, are affected in both cis and trans by
such rearrangements. Almost all other genes that are similarly juxtaposed are
affected only in cis. Of the various models that have been invoked to explain
these anomalies, one which proposed closely linked trans-acting regulators is
supported by the results of our initial molecular investigation of the brown
locus, in which we find that brown lies just between the copies of a duplicated
gene. Another model which proposed that dominant variegation is caused by the
production of anti-sense RNA is also consistent with the unusual organization of
the region around brown. Yet another possibility is that heterochromatin can
directly inactivate transcription on the homologous chromosome. In any case, it
appears that the unusual behavior of the brown locus in response to position
effects results from a novel form of gene organization or regulation. A thorough
molecular characterization of both brown and karmoisin and the regions around
them will be done. The results of this work should bear on general questions of
regulatory interactions in complex eukaryotes and of position effects which can
lead to abnormal expression of genes.
