Abstract 97-27311 Fisher Integrating linkages among aquatic and terrestrial
components of arid landscapes This research will address the following puzzle:
In the arid Southwest, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) exceeds export by
streams and rivers. While measurements suggest a huge (&gt;10-fold) annual
storage increment in the catchment and widespread N enrichment of the landscape,
the opposite is true - usable N is rare. Both terrestrial and aquatic primary
production are N-limited, and N2 fixing organisms abound in both environments.
The objective of this project is to identify the hot spots (in space and time)
for N transformation and retention and thereby account for the catchment-level N
discrepancy. The investigators will focus on methods development for the
flowpath approach; experiments in the uplands, tributary system and stream-
riparian corridor; and developing an understanding of variance in these systems.
The work will concentrate on processes rather than patterns, and is expected to
lay the underpinnings for linkages between the empirical work and conceptual and
mathematical models now under development.
