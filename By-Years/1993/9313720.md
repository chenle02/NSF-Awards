9313720 Wheeler This award will support work to develop software for alignment
of DNA sequences in a network of workstations. The alignment of DNA sequences
has implications in systematic biology, where comparative studies give insight
into relationships between organisms and the pattern and the process of
evolution. These algorithms for alignment will be developed for the parallel
processing environment offered by the network of workstations. The award will
test the scalability of these algorithms as one moves to more processing units
in the network. ***
