9731541 George During the 3 years of this project, 72 high school and middle
school teachers and 36 students will work as members of atmospheric research
teams studying each of ten airshed around the Portland, OR metropolitan area.
Each summer's activities include a 4-week atmospheric interaction research
course and a one-week air quality measurement campaign during a pollution
episode. Transfer to the classroom is anticipated through action research
projects during the academic year. An interactive webpage will enable all
partners to access data, real time models of the atmosphere, and descriptions of
the action research projects. A lead high school will serve as the Horizons-Air
site for an airshed zone and will work collaboratively with four other
middle/high schools, the Horizons-Met sites.
