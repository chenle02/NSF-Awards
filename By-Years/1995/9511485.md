The European Parliament plays an increasingly important role in the process of
European integration. This research project will create four connected datasets
that will make feasible the first systematic empirical investigation of
decisionmaking in the European Parliament. These data sets will consist of
detailed bills and amendments, histories of proposed legislation, prior and
subsequent actions external to the EP, and roll call floor votes. A series of
case studies will focus attention of European environmental policies. Broad
theoretical reasons also motivate this study. Institutional and partisan
features of the EP facilitate cooperative decisionmaking which speeds
integration. Understanding the ways in which these features affect
decisionmaking can provide important insights into the design of institutional
structures.
