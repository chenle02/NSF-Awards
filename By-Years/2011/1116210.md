The rapid adoption of multicore and manycore processors in every class of
computing systems---from mobile handheld devices to high-end data center servers
---is increasing our dependence on concurrent software. However, defects in
concurrent programs are notoriously difficult for developers to detect and
diagnose, because concurrent behavior is fundamentally harder to reason about
than sequential behavior. Major software vendors report the tangible negative
impacts on software development from concurrent faults, such as reduced
development productivity or inadequate concurrency training and tools, along
with the significant impact on end-users from defective software. The goal of
this research project is to help developers of concurrent software find and
understand defects quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will employ novel
approaches that combine testing and dynamic analysis with automated post-mortem
statistical analysis of thread interactions. Dynamic analysis reduces false
positive fault reports, and statistical data analysis exploits the inherent non-
determinism of concurrent execution to produce informative prioritized rankings
of candidate faults. The resulting techniques will greatly improve debugging
productivity by helping the developer to hone in on the most likely causes of
program the resulting techniques and tools will be transformative, and will
automate fault-localization for concurrent software. The results of the research
will have broader impacts on the state-of-the-art in concurrent software
practice, research, and education. The research will prepare globally
competitive students in the emerging area of concurrent software and parallel
thinking, along with providing intellectual bridges between students in software
engineering and in computational science and engineering, and advance diversity
goals. Additionally, successes in improving fault-localization techniques for
concurrent software will lead to improvements in software quality and, thus,
benefit all segments of society that depend on software.
