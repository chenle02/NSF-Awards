9632122 Bormann Effect of Windthrow Disturbance on Decomposition-Weathering
Feedback and Watershed Nutrient Dynamics The ecology of disturbance is
increasingly considered an important foundation for new natural-resource
management strategies to provide for human uses while seeking to maintain
biodiversity and key ecosystem processes. A disturbance common to most forests
is the uprooting of trees (windthrow). This research will explore whether mixing
of organic and mineral soil horizons by windthrow is an process that influences
long-term forest productivity. The mixing of organic and mineral soils may speed
the breakdown (weathering) of rock particles and may release nutrients (base
elements, phosphorus, and micronutrients) for plant uptake. Extensive windthrow
over large areas may also affect weathering in entire watersheds--as measured by
the flux of bicarbonate, cations, and organic matter in stream water--by
increasing water flow through mineral soils. Changes in stream water chemistry
may have indirect, but significant, effects on the productivity of anadromous
fish. Productive, largely pristine, forests of Southeast Alaska provide the
setting for this research.
