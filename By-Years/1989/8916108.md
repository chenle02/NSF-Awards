Sulfate activation (beginning with ATP sulfurylase), along with sulfate
reduction to cysteine (beginning with APS sulfotransferase), is located on the
inner mitochondrial membrane of Euglena, but is absent from the chloroplasts.
Sulfite (or cysteine) from the mitochondria is used by the chloroplasts as a
precursor of the sulfolipid sulfonic acid group. This research examines 1)
phosphate inhibition of purified mitochondrial ATP sulfurylase as a means of
determining its regulatory significance, 2) the cellular location and properties
of a second different ATP sulfurylase purified from whole cells and, 3) the
mechanism of purified APS sulfotransferase. The flow of sulfur compounds out of
the mitochondrion to chloroplast serves as a model system in which to explore
the origin of chloroplast constituents during plastid development and the nature
of mitochondrial transport processes. Sulfate is the common form of sulfur in
aerobic environments. Sulfate must be metabolically activated before it can be
used for important reactions in cells. Since sulfur is an essential nutrient for
plants, an understanding of sulfate metabolism is essential for understanding
the normal agricultural (and ecological) utilization of sulfur, as well as the
consequences of sulfur deficiency and its correction. This research extends the
examiniation of sulfur metabolism to the chloroplast and mitochondrion of the
unicellular alga, Euglena because recent evidence indicates that there is a flow
of sulfur metabolites between these two organelles. Therefore, this research
provides not only for an understanding of sulfate metabolism at the subcellular
level, but also shows how these organelles are coordinately controlled and how
they share the cellular resources available for organelle development.
