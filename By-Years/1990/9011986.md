This award supports a cultural anthropologist studying fertility, mortality and
wealth flows among peasant farmers in Kenya. The research will test the theory
of wealth flows, that fertility changes in response to the wealth parents expect
to have under varying regimes of education, employment, and family
responsibilities. This research extends a year-long prior study of a neighboring
community, and will provide comparative information to test the implications of
the theory. This study is important because population growth is one of the
major problems facing third-world countries such as Kenya. Unless planners can
come to grips with the basic causes of declining fertility, economic development
and security are precarious. Improved understanding of the causes of variation
in fertility will help produce programs of fertility control, which can
ameliorate some of the development problems.
