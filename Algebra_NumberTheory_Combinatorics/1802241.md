A matrix group is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all products
and inverses of its members. Typical examples include O(3,R), the group of
orthogonal 3x3 matrices with real entries, and SU(2), the group of 2x2 unitary
complex matrices. Broadly speaking, the subject of representation theory deals
with how such groups can act on a (complex) vector space via linear
transformations. One can then ask what happens if we replace the complex numbers
by a finite field (or the algebraic closure of a finite field). Modular
representation theory is concerned with matrix groups with entries in such a
field, acting on vector spaces over the same field. The proposed research will
make advances in modular representation theory by geometric methods. Many of the
anticipated results are analogous to known facts in complex representation
theory, but new tools and techniques must be developed in the modular case. The
past few years have seen the emergence of powerful new tools for applying
geometric methods to the representation theory of algebraic groups in positive
characteristic, including parity sheaves and the mixed modular derived category.
This project will build on these developments with projects on three different
topics: (i) monodromy operators in positive characteristic; (ii) generalized
Springer theory for coherent sheaves; and (iii) Kazhdan-Lusztig cells, tensor
ideals, and tilting modules. Topic (i) is essentially geometric in nature, while
topics (ii) and (iii) are expected to have concrete consequences for
representation theory.
