The objective of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the synthesis and characterization of compounds consisting
of clusters of molybdenum, iron and sulfur atoms. Such clusters are related to
the iron-molybdenum cofactor, familiarly known as FeMo-co, of the enzyme
nitrogenase. This cofactor, which has a currently unknown structure, constitutes
a key portion of the enzyme's active site. Studies of the target compounds are
needed in order to assess those aspects of the structural and chemical
properties of FeMo-co which are essential to the "fixing" of atmospheric
nitrogen through reduction by the enzyme. Nitrogenase catalyzes one of the most
complex multi-electron transfer reactions in biology, so that understanding the
structure and reactivity of its active site is of fundamental chemical and
biochemical importance. Further, a catalytic cluster resembling the active site
may be a powerful catalyst for a variety of chemical transformations. Systematic
syntheses of high nuclearity Mo-Fe-S clusters will be explored. Emphasis will be
placed on controlling the structural reorganizations that occur during oxidative
decarbonylation reactions in order to prepare new Mo-S-Fe clusters that may
mimic FeMo-co structurally and which will bind small molecules that are
nitrogenase substrates or inhibitors in dinitrogen reduction. The synthetic
species will be characterized by chemical and physical methods, and their
reactivities will be investigated, with emphasis on a systematic examination of
the reactivity of the different metal sites within a given cluster.
