1315960 (Guy). This symposium will bring together the most innovative practices
in design, education and research for current and future reuse and recycling of
material resources in the building environment. The primary audience will be
researchers, educators, practitioners and advanced university students. The
symposium will take place April 11-13, 2013 at The Catholic University of
America, Washington, D.C. Resources used in the building environment result in
large quantities of extraction and processing waste, pollution and energy-use,
and in the current paradigm are in turn typically wasted in equally large
quantities in the processes of renovation and demolition. This symposium will
convene educators and researchers in architecture and engineering programs for
presentations, discussions, formation of collaborative networks, and the
production of knowledge in the form of a proceeding and a book as a resource for
educators, students and researchers. Symposium sessions will be dedicated to
pedagogy for resourceful design theory and processes. Under-represented groups
will be encouraged to participate via the offer of scholarships based on need
and diversity. A sign language interpreter will be provided for all keynote
presentations. It is the intent to involve universities from across the USA and
internationally in developing partnerships for future research and development
of education knowledge infrastructure. The symposium information will be
disseminated via a website, an electronic proceeding and a book. The book will
be a resource for faculty and students interested in these topics as well as
community based or government agencies involved in policies for environmental
protection and community development.
