All stars observed today are enriched with heavy elements (heavier than hydrogen
or helium) made by previous stellar generations. This project will track the
process of element enrichment using new and extremely accurate numerical
techniques developed by the research team and shed new light on the stellar
generation that first created carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and many of the other
elements necessary for life. The research will be driven by graduate students,
providing them with rigorous training in astronomy and computational physics.
Furthermore, the results will be disseminated broadly through the presentation
of public lectures, helping to engage a larger community in the excitement of
astronomy and the ongoing search for the missing first generation of
stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study the evolution of the first generation of
heavy-element free (Population III, Pop III) stars, the research team has
developed a unique, carefully tested subgrid mixing model that tracks three
quantities: (i) the heavy elements generated by Pop III stars, (ii) the heavy
elements generated by subsequent stellar populations, and (iii) the fraction of
unpolluted gas. The project would build upon this capability to develop
cosmological simulations that simultaneously model mixing, chemistry, and
radiative transfer and to carry out a suite of such simulations that spans the
unknown properties of Pop III stars. Working with observational experts, the
team will apply these results to provide insights into how unknown Pop III
properties can be constrained using metal-poor stars observed in the Milky Way
and metal-poor galaxies observed at high-redshift. These predictions will not
only help interpret current data but will also drive mission planning for the
next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes.
