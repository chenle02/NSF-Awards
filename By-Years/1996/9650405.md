Students choosing to major in biology at this college can choose from two
microbiology courses, Microbiology, and Medical Microbiology. Increases in
student enrollments in biology, along with increased student interest in
cooperative research, have lead to pressure to expand the biology offerings. The
decision was made to increase the depth of treatment of the topics covered
formerly by the Medical Microbiology course by dividing it into two courses,
Immunology and Medical Microbiology. The former course treats the host response
to pathogenicity, while the latter surveys major bacterial, fungal, and viral
pathogens. The immunology course has been assembled and was offered in the
Spring 1995 semester using borrowed equipment. Now, with the acquisition of new
equipment, the department is able to extend and improve the laboratory
exercises. The new equipment includes a microscope with fluorescence
capabilities, a 96-well microplate reader, and equipment to culture, manipulate,
and quantitate cells of the immune system. The Biology Department faculty
believe that majors learn best when offered the opportunity to conduct research
as a means to enhance their classroom knowledge. The equipment obtained can also
be used in faculty-directed student independent research.
