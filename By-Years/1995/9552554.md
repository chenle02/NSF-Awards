project is design to develop and study a model-based approach to teaching and
learning geometry for understanding in the elementary grades. The study will
focus on third grade students and combine this study s data with that of a
previous one to yield a mini-longitudinal study of changes in children s spatial
reasoning from the second through third grades. The PIs will develop and explore
a challenging but feasible third grade geometry curriculum that builds on second
graders enhanced understanding as well as examine classroom practices that
support model elicitation and model exploration. ; S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t
