Lipman Bers, one of the founding fathers of Teichmuller theory, will continue
his work on the strong deformation spaces of Riemann surfaces with nodes. He
will attempt to extend the theory of Riemann surfaces with nodes to surfaces of
infinite Poincare area. This is connected with the study of infinite dimensional
deformation spaces and moduli spaces which are currently of interest to string
theorists. He will also continue his investigations of the complex boundaries of
Teichmuller spaces. Masatake Kuranishi's research will continue his work on the
sectional curvature of a certain metric on the cartesian product of the two-
sphere with itself. The objective is to deform this metric in such way as to
obtain one of positive sectional curvature. If successful this will provide a
positive answer to a conjecture of Hopf. Kuranishi's second topic of
investigation is to bring the geometry of CR manifolds into the calculus of
Fourier integral operators with complex phase on strongly pseudoconvex
manifolds. Duong Phong will carry out research in two areas. These concern
oscillatory integrals in Fourier analysis and the connections between string
theory and Riemann surfaces. The former comprises an investigation of the role
of geometry in the study of singular kernels. The latter will be a continuation
of earlier work in which Phong, together with collaborators, has identified the
scattering amplitudes of strings with the Weil- Peterson measure on the moduli
space. Hubert Goldschmidt will work on problems in Riemannian geometry related
to integral geometry and the deformation theory of Riemannian metrics. In
particular his research will be concerned with rigidity questions arising from
the Blaschke problem for compact symmetric spaces. This will be studied in the
context of the Radon transform for tensors on these spaces.
