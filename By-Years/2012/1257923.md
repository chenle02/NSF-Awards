This project's central hypothesis is that brain networks may be much more
flexible than generally appreciated, perhaps to the point of altering their
functional organization moment-to-moment to optimize stimulus processing. This
hypothesis will be tested by using fast voltage sensitive dyes to image the
firing activity of networks of over 100 neurons in two different molluscan
species as they respond to sensory input, generate behavioral motor programs,
and store memory. State-of-the-art analysis methods will be applied to track all
recorded neurons as they shift allegiances among network communities in real
time. The project will have three areas of scientific and broader impacts.
First, the anticipated findings will significantly extend our current
understanding of how brain networks are affected by the very information that
they process. Second, the recording and analysis tools being developed by this
project will be of great use to many other laboratories. Finally, the broader
impacts of this project are designed to inspire and educate future scientists,
both undergraduate biology majors from neighboring 4 year colleges, as well as
high school students from two predominantly Hispanic Waukegan-area high schools.
These educational outreach activities aim to increase the excitement and
satisfaction of underrepresented individuals for careers in scientific research.
