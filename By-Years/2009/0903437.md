Effective management of supply voltage is of critical importance to overcome
power limitations in future highly parallel multi-core microprocessors. This
project proposes a new approach to efficiently deliver power and manage voltage
in chip multiprocessors through a technique, called flexible voltage stacking.
Voltage stacking involves delivering a higher supply voltage to the chip
(resulting in lower current draw for a fixed power budget), which can reduce IR
losses and improve power delivery efficiency. By providing flexibility to the
stack, individual cores can be stacked in such a way as to regulate the voltage
to the desired core supply level. The PIs plan to explore a range of
architectural and circuit techniques to mitigate issues related to voltage
noise. Also, a prototype chip will be designed demonstrating the flexible
voltage stack concept, driven by realistic workload traces from a combined
software/FPGA simulator of a multicore system. The work will have broader
impacts through technology transfer to the computing industry and by providing
training for both undergraduate and graduate students.
