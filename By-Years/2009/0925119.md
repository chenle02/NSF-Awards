Objective Conventional lithographic techniques, though highly developed, cannot
produce three-dimensional structures in a single step. However, such structures
are needed to implement the photonic crystal devices which are envisioned to
produce the first truly dense integrated photonic circuits and systems. Multiple
Beam Interference Lithography (MBIL) offers a promising technique for the
fabrication of photonic crystal devices. However, MBIL, in its present form, is
not compatible with 1) microelectronics manufacturing or with 2) integration of
multiple circuit elements. The objective of the present research is to overcome
these shortcomings by developing a new photo-mask concept that allows the
fabrication and integration of a multiplicity of optimized photonic crystal
devices, in parallel, across an entire wafer.

Intellectual Merit However, the path to achieving such a fabrication
breakthrough is impeded by the limited design space for interference patterns
that is currently available. The intellectual merit of the present research lies
in the dramatic definition and application of an exhaustive set of conditions
for primitive-lattice-vector direction equal contrasts, which, for the first
time, show the full richness of interference patterns usable with both positive
and negative photoresists. These results will affect all applications of
interference lithography including the photo-mask implementation of this
proposal.

Broader Impact The use of MBIL to produce dense integrated photonic circuits and
systems will, in turn, enable developments in security (through sensing,
uninterruptible communications, control, etc.) and in economic growth (through
systems that provide efficient interactive access to a broad range of business,
medical, financial, research, and data base information.).
