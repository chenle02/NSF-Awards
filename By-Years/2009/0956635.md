This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor
Karl Christe at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to carry
out fundamental studies on challenging problems in synthetic chemistry.
Experimental efforts will be carried out in the following areas: (i) fluorine
chemistry at the limits of oxidation and coordination; (ii) synthesis of novel
cyano compounds for use as electrophilic cyanating agents and energetic fuels;
and (iii) synthesis of new energetic fluorine substituted
nitramines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will have a major
impact on science and technology and result in important contributions to fields
such as more efficient and greener energetic materials and synthesis at the
limits of oxidation and coordination.
