This phase II SBIR project develops a prototype controller capable of enabling
robot systems to perform dexterous manipulation in an efficient manner.
Currently, robots can perform simple manipulation tasks, but more complex
dexterous manipulation tasks cannot be implemented in a real time sense due to
the complexity of both the robot dynamics and the controller design. Enhanced
computational power is required to implement these real time controllers. In
1985, the Center for Robotic Systems in Microelectronics at the University of
California at Santa Barbara developed an operational prototype robotic
controller, characterized by a unique architecture, with high performance. The
system was denoted Robotic Instruction Processing System (RIPS). Dynamic
MicroSystems was organized to bring this new technology to the market place. In
a phase I research project, Dynamic MicroSystems evaluated the RIPS architecture
for the purpose of developing an architecture which can serve as an industrial
platform for advanced robots. This phase II SBIR project's objectives are to (1)
develop and build a prototype system comprising a host computer, two three
dimensional processor subsystems, and one input output handler, (2) develop and
test the proposed multiprocessor programming environment, (3) develop and test
the proposed multi-window user interface, and (4) test and validate the complete
system with a two arm cooperation simulation experiment. This effort should
culminate in the development of a reconfigurable open architecture modular
controller system which will satisfy the computational needs for advanced
robots, and provide a powerful, flexible, software development and analysis
environment.
