The Chemistry Department is purchasing a FT-IR and a UV/vis spectrophotometer
and rebuilding a 300 MHz FT-NMR to create a laboratory instrument center for
students in biological, organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry courses. A
unique feature of the program is an upperclassman-freshman mentor system to
offer students intensive hands-on experience with modern instrumentation as
early in the curriculum as possible. Another feature of the project is the
development of interdisciplinary experiments in the areas of bio-organic and
physical-inorganic chemistry.
