Abstract :

The Principal Investigator is Michael Shub. Shub and co-workers Pugh, Wilkinson
and others have established the stable ergodicity of a wide range of partially
hyperbolic dynamical systems which preserve a smooth volume element, thus
establishing the statistical robustness of these chaotic systems. The thrust of
the work proposed is to extend these results to include almost all partially
hyperbolic systems and to eliminate the hypothesis of volume preservation. This
is an ambitious goal, but the results obtained included the development of new
tools, namely julienne quasi-conformality and julienne density point
preservation of the stable holonomy maps, whose power has not been fully
explored. A second theme is a study of the complexity of continuous problems
centered around the analysis and application of variants of Newton's method.

Chaotic dynamical systems are pervasive in scientific, engineering and numerical
simulation applications. The proposed work would lay foundations for the
statistical analysis of these systems, whose deterministic behavior is
unpredictable due to the presence of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
Newton's method for solving systems of equations is one of the main algorithms
of numerical analysis. A better understanding of its properties and those of
variants can make the solution of problems of scientific and engineering origin
more efficient.
