The award will support the ongoing research program of Professor Stephen
Reucroft with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN's Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). The group's main CMS hardware activity continues on the
Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) avalanche photodiode (APD) readout. The group
members are coordinators of the CMS electron reconstruction using particle flow
techniques - building on the group tracker and ECAL expertise. The award will
enable to group to continue their analysis effort working on Standard Model
Higgs searches using leptonic final states - building on their electron
reconstruction work. This proposal addresses the early discovery era of the LHC.
The support will enable the group to work on CMS commissioning work and
simultaneously develop electron reconstruction algorithms. These include
recovery of bremsstrahlung photons and conversions in the Silicon Tracker and
optimize the electron selection efficiency and purity. These tools will then
apply to the direct search for the Higgs boson. This support is critical to the
group's ability to exploit the considerable investment of more than a decade.

The intellectual merit of the research is profound, addressing fundamental
questions, such as the origin of mass. The chosen area of research, the search
for the Higgs, is one of the most important analysis of the LHC startup. The
broader impact supported by this award include possible technological spin-offs
from the photo-detector work to medical physics, biophysics and quantum optics.
The group is involved in educational outreach of a broad range of people from
elementary school, high school, undergraduate and graduate students, to
postdocs.
