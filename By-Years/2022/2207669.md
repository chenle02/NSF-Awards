Election scientists utilize social science theory to understand how elections
operate and how citizens perceive them. The central goal of this conference is
to build basic research capacity in election science, an interdisciplinary field
of scholarship that focuses on the study of election administration and election
conduct. The conference will bring together election scholars, election
practitioners, and local election-level experts to discuss and disseminate
electoral science research. The inclusion of election administrators allows
interaction between science, policy, and policymakers. Another goal of the
conference will be to continue to diversify the election science
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Election scientists utilize social science theory to
understand how elections operate and how citizens perceive them. Elections are
administered at the state and local levels, which provides fertile ground to
test theories such as rational choice, principal-agent, and representative
bureaucracy. The conference will bring together election scholars, election
practitioners, and local election-level experts to discuss and disseminate
electoral science research. The scholars will use the interactions of the
conference to generate new research questions, improve theories, and improve
research designs. Broader Impacts of the conference include clear policy
implications for election practitioners. The inclusion of practitioners in the
conference increases the likelihood that science of elections will be
incorporated into the administration of elections more generally. The project
includes a clear plan for inclusion of women and under-representative groups.
Additionally, undergraduate students are incorporated into conference
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
