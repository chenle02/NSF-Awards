9452372 Perry A computer laboratory is developed that is used for advanced
transfer and vocational work in operating systems, networking, and graphics.
Such an environment allows our students practice in: network administration
tasks in a UNIX environment; object-oriented design and programming in a
development environment; writing and using graphical user interfaces;
programming using 3D graphic design. The laboratory is connected through the
ethernet to the main laboratory supporting the rest of our two-year transfer and
vocational programs. The main laboratory is in the process of being partially
updated through the use of severely limited, state-provided, one-time funds
connected to the construction of a new Advanced Technology Center on campus,
which will provide laboratories for video, computing, engineering and
manufacturing technologies. The 22 station laboratory described in this project
is a detachable network with 22 Sun ClassicLX workstations, a Sun Sparcsystem 10
model 40 to connect the workstations to our main laboratory network, and
appropriate software needed by our advanced students to teach UNIX systems
administration, UNIX systems programming, networking in a UNIX environment, UNIX
shell programming, object-oriented programming in a development environment, GUI
programming, and 3D graphics programming.
