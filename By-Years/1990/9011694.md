There have been two main philosophical obstacles to investigations in set
theory. One is the opinion that there is no conception of the universe of sets
that can lead to the solution of outstanding problems such as the continuum
problem and the existence of large cardinals. The other is the opinion that set
theory is ineradicably 'Platonistic.' Platonism in mathematics, some argue,
implies that set theory could be wrong, even though, from an internal point of
view, there is nothing wrong with it. They argue that it could be wrong because
it implies the existence of things that just do not exist. Both of these
opinions, and especially both together, have led to a formalistic attitude
toward set theory and, in particular, have encouraged the turn from the study of
set theory to the study of models of first order axiomatic set theory. Professor
Tait has two aims in this project. First, he wants to argue that the conception
of the universe of sets such as is contained in the 1930 paper by Zermelo and
further developed in Godel's "What is Cantor's continuum problem" is a coherent
conception which supports the axioms of ZF as well as providing a foundation for
investigations into the questions of the Continuum Hypothesis and the existence
of large cardinals. Second, he wants to examine the philosophical confusions
underlying the idea of 'Platonism' in mathematics in light of recent literature
on the subject.
