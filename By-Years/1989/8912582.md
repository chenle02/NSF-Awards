Dr. Cozzens, working with Dr. Iskender Gokalp, a physical scientist at the CNRS
in France, are investigating the context and impact of the introduction of laser
doppler anemometry (LDA) into the domains of turbulence and turbulent combustion
studies. The case is significant for a number of reasons. The domain is an
important one with strong technological and social consequences. It is an
example of an interdisciplinary field with strong interactions between different
contributing areas. The changes introduced by LDA are drastic, and thus create
an opportunity to compare revolutionary and evolutionary changes in the field.
the pure turbulence and turbulent combustion research communities received LDA
differently, with one incorporating it immediately and the other resisting for
some time. The contrast provides a natural comparative design for studying the
factors that facilitate and inhibit diffusion of instruments. LDA was introduced
in a highly competitive domain with strong technological potentialities. The
case also allows the investigators to compare the response of different national
systems to changes with practical consequences. Finally, it is a recent case
which makes it relatively convenient to study. Drs. Gokalp and Cozzens are
exploring the case on a collaborative basis through analysis of documents,
interviews and site visits. A portion of the research builds a data base on the
process through which laboratories introduced LDA. Another analyzes LDA's impact
on the field of turbulent combustion itself. A third involves case studies of
individual laboratories, to explore in more depth the process of incorporation
of the instrument.
