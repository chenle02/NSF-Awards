A cluster of radio-wave instrumentation, including two (bi-static) coherent
radars and an ionosonde, and a magnetometer are added to the cluster of optical
instruments at Mt. Haleakala, HI to untangle the generation mechanisms of the
mid-latitude Sporadic E-region irregularity (Es). By the use of bi-static
coherent radar sampling in a common volume with the lidar and optical imagers,
the nature of the Es Hall polarization process leading to large electric fields
and sporadic E layer instability conditions is explored. The physics of
electrodynamic coupling along magnetic field lines between unstable sporadic E
layers and the F layer is investigated, and the role of wind and wind shear
dynamics in the interaction process of the neutral atmosphere with sporadic E
layer plasma is experimentally quantified.
