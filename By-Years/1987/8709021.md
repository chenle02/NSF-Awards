The project aims at the understanding of solid surface properties and their
ability to support growth of epitaxial films or formation of alloys. The central
piece of information sought is the atomic structure, in particular, the
difference between the atomic arrangements in several layers on a surface and
those expected in a truncated bulk. This difference, called surface relaxation
or surface reconstruction, is a fundamental property of solid surfaces and is
investigated both experimentally and theoretically. At the same time, the
ability of a surface to sustain growth of another phase or another metal is
tested. This growth may proceed by producing strained atomic layers clamped to
the substrate structure and has therefore interesting links to technology and
fundamental theory because both new bulk and new surface phases can be produced.
The new phases include metastable phases and magnetic phases, as well as the
formation of surface alloys. One goal of the project is to determine the atomic
and electronic structure of the epitaxial films or surface alloys grown. In
addition, attempts are being made to shorten the calculations that are necessary
in order to determine a surface structure by means of analysis of low-energy
electron diffraction intensities.
