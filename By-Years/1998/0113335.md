Abstract: Recent advances in software engineering, such as graphical user
interfaces and object-oriented programming, have caused applications to become
more memory intensive. These applications tend to allocate dynamic memory
prolifically. Moreover, automatic dynamic memory reclamation (garbage
collection, GC) has become a popular feature in modern programming languages
such as Java. As a result, the time consumed by dynamic storage management can
be up to one-third of the program execution time. The Dynamic Memory Management
Unit (DMMU), a special-purpose hardware mechanism based on bitmaps and
combinational logic can greatly diminish this overhead. The preliminary results
show that the hit ratio for 2 Kbits and 8 Kbits buffer range from 84-99% and
95-99%, respectively. The hardware complexity of the proposed scheme is O(n),
where n is the size of the bit-vector. For a design with 20K gates and 97% miss
rate, the overall speedup can be as high as 1.41. This proposal calls for the
integration of this hardware unit into SMP systems, which would allow concurrent
garbage collection in multithreaded-multiprocessors environments. This can speed
up the performance of server applications written in Object-oriented languages
such as C++ and Java. Additionally, this proposal also calls for the study of
garbage collection triggering points. The preliminary study indicates that time-
based triggering point may yield higher garbage collection efficiency than the
traditional space-based approach.
