9417753 KONDRASHOV Recent experimental data suggest that many organisms
experience high total rates of slightly deleterious mutations (1 or more per
generation). This means that selection against such mutations is intense and can
influence various aspects of populations. A general representation of mutation-
selection balance will be developed, which allows for arbitrary patterns of
selection, and for the evolution of genes that modify the genetic system. This
representation will be based on consideration of the number of mutant alleles in
the genome, and on application of the methods of quantitative genetics of such
traits. This representation will be applied to investigate three problems: 1)
the evolution of the length of the haploid and diploid phases; 2) the
coevolution of mutability and facultative asexuality or selfing; and 3) the
coevolution of recombination and inbreeding. Both mathematical and computer
models will be used. The results will contribute to the understanding of the
general features of selection against slightly deleterious mutations, and of the
evolution of life cycles, reproduction, and mutability.
