This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design and
evaluate a Software Development Platform for the rapid prototyping and
implementation of applications that will personalize the communications
experience of a wide variety of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) enterprise
phone users leading to large productivity gains in industry, government, and
academic settings. The proposed product shall provide the capability to make an
audio voice connection (telephone call) over a packetized data network. This
capability will take advantage of the data networks that exist within
enterprises (Local Area Networks), and of the infrastructure of enterprise-to-
enterprise networks (Wide Area Networks). The proposed product will ultimately
take advantage of the global network infrastructure found in the Internet. The
"advantages" being leveraged include both cost and functional capabilities found
only in a combined voice and data network.

This proposed development opens a window of opportunity for new ODM (Original
Design Manufacturers) to enter the market provided that they present cost-
advantaged, first to market, disruptive technology offerings that may appeal to
the enterprise customers of current OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) that
may or may not have VoIP phones in their product portfolio.
