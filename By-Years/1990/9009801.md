This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Aprille's sabbatical work,
which will be carried out in her home institution (Tufts University). The goal
of the project is to study molecular-genetic aspects of postnatal development of
mitochondrial function in mammalian liver. Dr. Aprille has an established record
of productivity in the area of physiological aspects of postnatal mitochondrial
development. This sabbatical year will provide her with the opportunity to
collaborate with and learn molecular genetic techniques from her colleague, Dr.
Susan Ernst. The acquisition of molecular techniques will allow Dr. Aprille to
make some unique contributions to her field, and is anticipated to significantly
enhance her career.
