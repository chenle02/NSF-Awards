This research investigates scattering of surface waves by obstacles among
dielectric waveguides. The work embraces both theoretical and experimental
studies of related scattering phenomena and is relevant to the study of guided-
wave phenomena in both uniformly-clad and integrated surface-waveguide
structures for millimeter and optical wavelengths. The methods are applicable as
well to the scattering of waves along inherently simpler mm-wave microstrip-
based circuits. An exact integral-operator description provides a new technique
for the study of surface-wave scattering including mode conversion and radiation
by dielectric obstacles having arbitrary shapes and refractive-index profiles.
The analytical studies will be supported and guided by measurements at
millimeter wavelengths using a complete- V-band millimeter-wave instrumentation
setup.
