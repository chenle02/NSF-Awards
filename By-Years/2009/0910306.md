This award provides financial support for sixteen travel grants directed at
scientists from less developed countries to attend the next IAPSO General
Assembly that will be held in Montreal, Canada on July 19-29, 2009. The last 15
years have seen an explosion in information technology and a revolution in
global communications. In oceanography there have also been exponential advances
in measurement technology and in modeling, the advent of a new era regarding
operational oceanography and newly established importance of interdisciplinary
research. The general scientific program, and the specific IAPSO one, reflect
these changes and can be found at: http://www.moca-09.org. Priority will be
given to young scientists, and scientists from developing countries and the
former eastern blocks (USSR,Yugoslavia) to attend the Assembly.

The scientific program encompasses the most recent advances in Oceanography,
Cryospheric and Atmospheric Sciences. Below is listed just a sample of the
IAPSO-only symposia to be held: in Montreal in 2009 :

P01 Mesoscale Ocean Eddies P02 Effects of Climate Variability on Nearshore
Coastal Environments: Physical, Geomorphologic and Biological Interactions P03
Argo and Operational Oceanography P04 Overflows and Abyssal Currents P05 Physics
and Chemistry of the Oceans : General Topics P06 Ocean Mixing Processes and
Consequences P07 The Southern Ocean : its Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Links
To the Global Climate System P08 Coastal Currents and Large Marine Ecosystems
P09 Deep Ocean Exchange with the Shelf P10 The Variable Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation: Characteristics, Causes and Consequences for Climate

There is also a considerable number of IAPSO Symposia jointly with the other
Associations, as it can be seen in the web site.

The funding is important to allow students and young scientists to have direct
interchanges with senior scientists and provides a forum for interchanges
between the supported scientists with those from developed countries.
Furthermore, the informal discussions outside the formal sessions have
significant values, allowing for interactions one-to-one and for the
establishment of scientific collaborations.
