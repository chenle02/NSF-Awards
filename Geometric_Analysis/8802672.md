Paul Ehrlich, Gerard Emch and Paul Robinson will work on problems in
differential geometry and quantum theory. The questions to be addressed include
geodesic incompleteness of Lorentzian manifolds, symplectic geometry of
geodesics and geometric quantization. These problems are of interest in both
mathematics and physics. They are fundamental to the mathematical aspects of
relativity and the relationships between classical mechanics and quantum theory.
Ehrlich's work focusses primarily on Lorentzian geometry and will build on
recent advances made towards establishing the splitting theorem. This is related
to rigidity phenomena in the singularity theory of general relativity. Emch and
Robinson will investigate spinors in both the symplectic and the orthogonal
contexts. These arise naturally in the attempt to geometrize the passage from
classical mechanics to quantum theory where the behavior of symmetries plays an
important role.
