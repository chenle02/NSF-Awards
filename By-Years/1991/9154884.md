The Virginia Commonwealth University will initiate a three-week, commuter Young
Scholars EARLY ALERT project in Mathematics and Physics for 30 students entering
grade 7. The Richmond Area Young Scholars Program emphasizes mathematics and
physics and is designed for rising 7th grade Black students in the Richmond
area. Honors topics instruction will be provided by university faculty and by
pre-college faculty who are members of the active Mathematics Teacher
Professional Network. Participant interest in mathematics and physics will be
nurtured; students will report on small group interactions with industry and
academic researchers, and will conduct and report on small-scale research
projects.
