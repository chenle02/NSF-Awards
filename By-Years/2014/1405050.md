In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor David Jonas of the University of Colorado at
Boulder is developing two-dimensional femtosecond spectroscopy as a tool for
measuring the motions of electrons in ultrafast chemical reactions. The factors
controlling efficient transport of charge and energy at the molecular level are
not understood, but are important for ultrafast chemical reactions in both
natural photosynthesis and light harvesting technologies. The project involves
an international scientific collaboration to implement the two-dimensional
spectroscopy technique developed at the University of Colorado over ultra-broad
frequency ranges using pulsed lasers developed at the Institute of Photonic
Sciences in Spain.

This project focuses on a two-color 2D electronic spectroscopy in which visible
pulses excite molecules to their first excited electronic state and short-wave
infrared pulses detect electronic absorption. This approach uniquely isolates
dynamics on the excited state, which can involve non-adiabatic coupling between
vibrational and electronic motions. The project aims to experimentally develop
two-dimensional spectroscopy in the short-wave infrared region of the spectrum
and use this capability to improve our understanding of carotenoid dynamics and
photosynthetic energy transfer. The broader impacts of this work include
scientific training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher, their
exposure to the scientific environment in the European Union, the development of
new techniques for measuring electronic dynamics, and potential societal
benefits from technologies based on an understanding of the most efficient
energy harvesting reactions.
