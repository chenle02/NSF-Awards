Organometallic vapor phase epitaxy will be used to generate germanium films on a
silicon substrate leading to silicon-germanium alloy and heterostructure
formation. The films will be produced as ultra-thin (1-10 atomic layer)
structures as a means to engineering the electronic properties of the desired
interfaces. Interactions of the films with the silicon substrate will be
investigated using SIMS, UPS and XPS surface science techniques. These studies
are aimed at a mechanistic understanding of the surface processes involved in
the deposition of epitaxial germanium films. %%% The research, in the general
area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on the formation of ultra-thin
germanium films on silicon, leading to silicon-germanium alloys. The results of
the research promise to improve our general understanding of these alloys which
have considerable potential in integrated optoelectonic devices, transistors and
thin film capacitors.
