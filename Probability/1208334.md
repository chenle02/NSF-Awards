For a general class of random matrices of size $n$ having independent entries,
the typical eigenvalue is of order $\sqrt n$. We had investigated the large
deviation properties when we are looking for eigenvalues that are of order $n$.
We had looked at the case when the tails decay faster than Gaussian and now plan
to examine the Gaussian case and we expect the results to be somewhat
different.Large deviation theory deals with the estimation of probabilities of
rare events. They are necessarily tiny and are often exponentially small in some
natural parameter. The theory deals with estimating with some precision the
exponential rate. When we study sums of random variables this often involves the
estimation of the expectation of exponential moments of the sums. We have
proposed to examine this phenomena in certain sums of unusual but general form
that have applications to other contexts.
