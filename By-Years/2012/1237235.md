Information technology, advances in statistical computing, and the deluge of
data available through the Internet are transforming computational social
science. However, a major challenge is maintaining the privacy of human
subjects. This project is a broad, multidisciplinary effort to help enable the
collection, analysis, and sharing of sensitive data while providing privacy for
individual subjects. Bringing together computer science, social science,
statistics, and law, the investigators seek to refine and develop definitions
and measures of privacy and data utility, and design an array of technological,
legal, and policy tools for dealing with sensitive data. In addition to
contributing to research infrastructure around the world, the ideas developed in
this project will benefit society more broadly as it grapples with data privacy
issues in many other domains, including public health and electronic
commerce.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will define and measure privacy in
both mathematical and legal terms, and explore alternate definitions of privacy
that may be more general or more practical. The project will study variants of
differential privacy and develop new theoretical results for use in contexts
where it is currently inappropriate or impractical. The research will provide a
better understanding of the practical performance and usability of a variety of
algorithms for analyzing and sharing privacy-sensitive data. The project will
develop secure implementations of these algorithms and legal instruments, which
will be made publicly available and used to enable wider access to privacy-
sensitive data sets at the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science's
Dataverse Network.
