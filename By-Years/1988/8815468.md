This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of catalytic
materials. The objectives are to probe the structural aspects of transition
metal ions of catalytic importance on zeolites and related oxide surfaces.
Electron magnetic resonance techniques will be utilized, with emphasis on
electron spin echo modulation spectrometry, to determine very weak hyperfine
interactions with nuclei surrounding the paramagnetic probe. This will allow the
development of control of transition metal ion location in zeolite structures
together with some control of adsorbate coordination. The results of this
research will provide new structural detail, not readily obtainable by other
techniques, that will increase knowledge of the nature of paramagnetic metal
species on zeolite and related oxide surfaces with molecular adsorbates and the
relationship to surface chemistry and catalysis.
