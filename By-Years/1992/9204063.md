9204063 Chave In this project, four principal investigators with support from
five separate institutions will study energy, momentum, and vorticity budgets,
and zonal volume and heat transport variability in the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current (ACC) south of Tasmania, Australia. A mix of moored current meters,
seafloor electric field recorders, and inverted echo sounders will be used in
collaboration with similar resources from scientists in Hobart, Tasmania. in
this component, the PI will work with the University of Hawaii and Scripps
Institution of Oceanography to oversee the construction and deployment of the
Bottom Pressure gauges and seafloor Horizontal Electric Field (HEF) instruments
for determining barotropic current variability. ***
