Los Angeles Disturbance and Diversity in Complex Ecological Systems The problem
of diversity in ecological systems has been the subject of intense interest
during the last 20 years, but a complete theoretical explanation still exists. A
number of hypotheses have successfully explained aspects of the origin and
maintenance of biodiversity including, the niche diversification, compensatory
mortality, equal chance, and intermediate disturbance hypotheses. This Career
Advancement Award research project explores the role of disturbance, in
particular, intermediate levels of biodiversity, in maintaining diversity in
dynamic landscapes within the context of work being done at the Santa Fe
Institute. Research at this Institute seeks a common theoretical framework for
complex adaptive systems and aims to find shared features of such systems that
explain their origin and functioning in a variety of fields, from cell biology
and evolution to economics and language. The objective of this study is to
explore several similarities between properties found in these systems and those
found in complex disturbed ecosystems. The work involves a broad review of the
literature and formalization of several aspects of disturbed forest communities
in order to test hypotheses about the role of disturbance in generating and
maintaining diversity. There are unresolved theoretical questions about the
assemblage of species, as well as, the rules that govern diversity in natural
communities. General rules and insights that emerge from this study of complex
systems may offer a fresh theoretical approach to the study of ecological
diversity.
