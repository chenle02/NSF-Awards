The COMPASS Program that creates smaller classes in many introductory STEM
courses, institutes an interdisciplinary seminar course and improved tutoring
and mentoring services is being instituted. Eighteen academically talented,
financially needy freshmen students majoring in the biological sciences,
chemistry and biochemistry, the geosciences, mathematics or physics are
receiving four year scholarships averaging $7500 annually starting during the
2009-10 academic year. In subsequent years, entering freshmen applying for
admission to and meeting the criteria for the COMPASS program will be admitted
into the program to benefit from the academic enhancements; however, they will
not receive NSF funded scholarships. They may receive annual $2000 university
"New Directions" scholarships provided they meet the requirements for those
scholarships
