This award is for partial support of an International Conference on Elastic and
Diffractive Scattering (the fifth Blois Workshop) to be held at Brown University
in June of this year. About 150 scientists from around the world are expected to
attend. The subject matter is concentrated on hadron elastic and diffractive
scattering phenomena at high energy. Support is requested in particular to cover
travel and subsistence expenses of invited scientists from eastern Europe and
former member states of the Soviet Union as well as younger participants.
