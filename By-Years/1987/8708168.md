To what extent is science a rational activity? Why are scientific theories
accepted at one time and then replaced by another theory at another time? Why is
theory change justified? What is the difference between science and
pseudoscience? What, in fact, is the aim of science? These questions are at the
heart of the philosophy of science. Increasingly, however, these questions are
no longer the exclusive concern of scientists, science policy makers, and
historians and philosophers of science. They are being argued in churches,
school boards, and even in federal court rooms as new challenges like
"Creationism" attack the traditional teaching of science. Dr. Maher is
undertaking a major study of these issues in order to determine how decision
theory can be used to make progress on these questions. In his study, he will
examine critically the very influential views of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn on
scientific change. This critique will involve a new representation theorem for
probabilities and utilities and will offer new explanations of features of
scientific method such as the importance of prediction as opposed to mere
accommodation of evidence and the value of simplicity and unity in theories. He
will show that a notion of acceptance which is not reducible to probability is
needed to account for central features of scientific method such as the
gathering of evidence and the search for explanations. He will also show that
this notion of acceptance provides the basis for an account of the role of
values in science. This notion will be used in particular to give precise
meaning to the idea of science is to try to determine the truth about the nature
of the physical world. This study is of great importance not only for philosophy
of science but also for assistance in the wider arena in which these issues are
now debated.
