Proposal is to set up an underway sea surface data system with thermistor,
fluorometer and transmissometer to be operated on all cruises aboard the R/V
Blue Heron. The vessel is operated by the University of Minnesota and managed by
Doug Ricketts as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) research fleet. The item requested is an: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underway
Sea Surface Data System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt; In the
present proposal, the item recommended for support provides an important
infrastructure capability for basic instrumentation that is cost-effective, and
will significantly improve capabilities for users of R/V Blue Heron, which
services a diverse group of investigators from around the U.S. The University of
Minnesota technical support groups have the expertise to operate and support the
recommended systems on the vessel.&lt;br/&gt;
