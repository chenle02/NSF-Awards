9423289 Nelson The possibility that atomic chlorine concentrations in the marine
surface layer are large enough to compete with hydroxyl radical (OH) as the
major tropospheric oxidizer continues to receive considerable speculation.
Chlorine atoms participate in the oxidation of hydrocarbons, dimethyl sulfide,
and can also directly influence tropospheric ozone loss through catalytic cycles
with chlorine monoxide (ClO) and hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals. The net effect on
the ozone budget may be highly dependent on the partitioning of the inorganic
chlorine pool between four chlorine-containing gases; hydrogen chloride (HCl),
hypochlorous acid (HOCl), molecular chlorine (Cl2), and chlorine nitrate
(ClONO2). To assess the potential importance of chlorine chemistry in the lower
atmosphere, direct measurements of these species are necessary. In Phase I of
this research, the feasibility of detecting both HCl and HOCl down to the 10 to
20 part-per-trillion (pptv) concentration range by tunable diode infrared laser
absorption was demonstrated. The Phase II research effort will improve the basic
spectroscopic parameters for quantifying HOCl concentrations in the atmosphere,
and develop and construct a prototype field instrument capable of simultaneous
measurements of HCl and HOCl in the marine troposphere. This new instrument will
be laboratory tested and evaluated against existing, albeit nonselective,
inorganic chlorine techniques in an intercomparison. The instrumentation
produced as a result of this research program will be useful for measuring other
trace gases in addition to HCl and HOCl. The novel long path, multiple pass
absorption cell developed during this project will have independent
commercialization potential for other laser absorption systems used to monitor
industrial pollutants, toxic wastes, and various gases emitted from combustion
processes.
