Taylor, Joseph AST 96-18357 Dr. Taylor will continue his research program based
on radio frequency observations of pulsars. High precision observations of
pulsars provide insight into issues in stellar evolution, gravitation physics,
cosmology, fundamental astrometry, and time-keeping. Dr. Taylor's observational
program will extend and improve a series of timing measurements of binary and
millisecond pulsars, with particular emphasis on measurements of general
relativistic effects, continue searches for new pulsars, especially those with
short periods, obtain proper motion and parallax measurements for millisecond
pulsars, and investigate the emission physics of pulsars through polarimetric
and single-pulse measurements. His program includes a significant component of
instrument development and improvement and includes plans to take advantage of
the upgrades to the Arecibo telescope and the new Green Bank Telescope of NRAO.
