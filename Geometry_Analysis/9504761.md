The investigators propose to continue organizing and holding the annual Geometry
Festival to be held at various locations in the east coast on a rotating basis.
The Geometry Festival has become an annual event for the east coast differential
geometers for the last decade; the topics cover a number of areas from
differential geometry including classical differential geometry and geometric
partial differential equations. The proposed conferences will bring together a
number of established researchers in geometry with junior investigators and
students; it is hoped that students can quickly gain an appreciation of the
scope of current research and learn of open problems in the area.
