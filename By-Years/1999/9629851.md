w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9629851 Goldman This experimental research project is
concerned with the most fundamental quantum mechanical properties of condensed
matter probed in an elegant fashion at low temperature and high magnetic field.
The results to be obtained are of interest in the formulation and confirmation
of advanced theory, which itself may apply to other phenomena such as high
temperature superconductivity, which remain poorly understood. More
specifically, the properties of the collective ground states of two-dimensional
and size-quantized systems of few and strongly correlated electrons will be
studied. Particular topics include integer and fractional quantum Hall effects,
the associated one- dimensional edge states, Wigner crystallization and single-
charge carrier tunneling phenomena. Experimental methods include
magnetotransport, thermal activation, nonlinear transport, and resonant and
single-particle tunneling, performed at low temperature and high magnetic field.
