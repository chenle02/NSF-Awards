This award involves the study of preconditioning strategies for the solution of
the large linear systems that arise in the discretization of elliptic boundary
value problems. In particular, the investigator will use preconditioning in
cases when the elliptic operator is not self-adjoint, as in certain non-self-
adjoint Helmholtz problems in exterior domains. In the course of solving
boundary value problems for elliptic equations numerically it is necessary to
solve very large systems of linear equations that arise when the continuous
problem is replaced with a discrete one. The investigator will develop methods
for solving such linear systems that are both efficient and robust, enabling
researchers to save time and money.
