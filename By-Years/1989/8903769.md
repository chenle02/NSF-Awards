Mosquitoes, like any living animal, synthesize and release chemical molecules
called hormones. These hormones control important life processes in the insect
such as molting, metamorphosis and reproduction. Some hormones are made by cells
in the brain of the insect and these hormones are called neurohormones. These
neurohormones usually control the release of non-brain hormones. This project is
designed to identify specific neurohormones which act to cause the synthesis and
release of a specific non-brain hormone. The non-brain hormone, called ecdysone,
is responsible for initiating molting and reproduction in mosquitoes. The goal
of this project is to purify the neurohormone and design experiments to
determine how the neurohormone can control the synthesis and release of
ecdysone. The results of these studies will increase knowledge of how
neurohormones control development and reproduction in mosquitoes. Furthermore,
this information can be useful in understanding the role of neurohormones in
other animals. Finally, these studies could provide information leading to the
development of more effective means of controlling mosquito populations.
