9320365 Karasz Technical Narrative: This proposed workshop, organized by the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst and the Marmara Research Centre, Gebze,
Turkey, is scheduled for 16-18 May 1994 at the Marmara Research Centre. This
activity will bring together highly regarded experts in the field of polymer
solution hydro- and thermodynamics with the overall objective of building
international networks between Turkish scientists and their U.S. counterparts.
It is expected that a full- scale collaborative research proposal will emerge as
a result of this workshop. This project supports the participation of
approximately 10 polymer scientists from the U.S. This workshop in materials
research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to identify critical
variables and methods of analysis in theoretical calculations. As Turkish
graduate students will also participate, this activity has an educational and
outreach effort that has the potential for generating new scientific activity
and new international linkages. ***
