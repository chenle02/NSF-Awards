The Project Director is one of the developers in a large-scale project entitled
Consortium for Upper-Level Physics Software (CUPS). This Consortium involves 30
faculty members spread over 27 major degree-granting physics institutions. The
main goal of the Consortium is to improve the teaching of physics by making more
effective use of the power of modern personal computers. The Consortium is
developing physics simulation software and accompanying texts which complement
material normally covered in nine upper-level undergraduate physics courses. A
typical simulation may perform calculations of real physical systems, based on a
model, or analysis of real data from experiments. The texts describe numerous
exercises and experiments that students can perform with each of the
simulations. The purchased equipment consists of computers of sufficient power
to run the CUPS software and specialized projection apparatus needed to
demonstrate the CUPS software. Demonstrations are necessary to acquaint students
with the software. The remaining computers are being used by students to carry
out projects and exercises based on the CUPS software. The CUPS software must be
thoroughly tested at each of the participating institutions before general
release. The equipment is essential for the success of this endeavor.
