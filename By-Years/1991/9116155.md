In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Bryan Kohler of the University of California at Riverside will
study the electronic structure of linearly conjugated molecules, the dependence
of this electronic structure on molecular conformation, and the response of this
structure to electrostatic perturbation. To do this, powerful spectroscopic
techniques will be used to obtain the absorption spectra of polyenes in
supersonic beams and in low temperature mixed crystals. Photochemical hole
burning will allow the response of linear polyenes to external electric fields
to be determined. %%% Linear polyenes are organic molecules which are vital to
processes ranging from vision to the fabrication of organic electrical
conductors and the use of passive optical processes to add or subtract light
frequencies in nonlinear crystals. The current studies will aid in a fundamental
understanding of these diverse phenomena by helping to develop a clear picture
of the electronic structure of these molecules and the response of this
electronic structure to electrical stimuli.
