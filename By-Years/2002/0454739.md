This project will compare the effects on algebraic learning when using the
Connected Math Program to the effects of using other (non-NSF supported) middle
school mathematics curriculum materials at the middle school level. The research
questions to be addressed by the project are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the
similarities and differences between the intended treatment of algebra in the
CMP curriculum and in the non-CMP curricula?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the
key features of the CMP and non-CMP experience for students and teachers, and
how might these features explain performance differences of CMP and non-CMP
students?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the similarities and differences in
performance between CMP students and a comparable group of non-CMP students on
tasks measuring a broad spectrum of mathematical thinking and reasoning skills,
with a focus on algebra?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algebra focus skills/concepts
to be assessed are: conceptual understanding and problem solving; algebraic
manipulative skills; solution strategies, representations and mathematical
justifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
