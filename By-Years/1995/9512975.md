9512975 Genack This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in condensed matter physics between research groups at Queens College, City
University of New York, and University of Nice. The collaboration is led by
Azriel Z. Genack in the United States and Patrick Sebbah in France. The
objective of their research is to measure the intensity and actual field
distribution in microwave propagation in disordered solids. They propose to
relate their research to the interconnectedness of diverse phenomena such as
atmospheric communication, medical imaging, and electronic conduction in
disordered solids. The French theorists are experts in quantum chaos while the
U.S. investigators are experimentalists with expertise in wave localization .
