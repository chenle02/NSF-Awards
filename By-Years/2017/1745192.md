Big Data have become one of the key challenges in many research areas. Big Data
Computing, Applications and Technologies, BDCAT 2017, serves as a platform for
researchers to share with the community their discoveries in various aspects of
big data computing, including big data science, infrastructures and platforms,
big data applications, big data trends and challenges, as well as visualization
of big data. The conference will also provide an education opportunity for
students participants, where they will be exposed to novel techniques and learn
state-of- the-art methodologies. In addition, the travel award recipients will
have opportunities to closely interact with a group of faculty mentors, who will
provide constructive feedback on their research projects, as well as career
guidance.
