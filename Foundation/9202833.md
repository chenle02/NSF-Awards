The project will concern mathematical logic and its connections with other
areas of mathematics, especially algebra and analysis. C. Ward Henson will
continue developing his model theory for Banach spaces and will investigate
topics in nonstandard analysis, including descriptive set theory on hyperfinite
sets. In addition, he will study the computational complexity of logical
decision problems, including the theory of the real exponential field. Carl
Jockusch will work in classical recursion theory and its connections with other
areas. In particular, he will study degrees of unsolvability, both in their own
right and in connection with model-theoretic structures (especially Boolean
algebras and certain groups). L. van den Dries will investigate definability in
algebraic and analytic structures. In particular, he will investigate
O-minimality in expansions of the ordered field of real numbers and questions
connected with A. Wilkie's recent proof that the elementary theory of the
expansions of this ordered field by exponentiation is model complete. He will
also study the model theory of local and Henselian fields. Mathematical logic is
a natural tool for studying any discipline expressed in a formal language, which
should bring most of mathematics itself under its focus. Algebra and number
theory and certain parts of analysis are particularly natural subjects for this
type of treatment. Large parts of the instant project bear this out. A typical
result of the investigators' recent work is the proof of a completeness
conjecture raised by Tarski: Is there a finite list of true identities combining
polynomial formation and exponentiation of constants from which all other such
true identities can be derived? (Counterexamples are known to exist if
exponentiation of variables is allowed.) Another area in which a natural role
for logic can be found is the complexity of algorithms. The investigators have
been ingenious in finding such niches as well as in exploring them, to the
obvious benefit of both logic and the other discipline involved.
