ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0918462&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University, LDEO&lt;br/&gt;PI: A.
Walsh&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D. Goldberg, P. Ljunggren&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific
Support (SSSE) items for the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH namely; a new magnetometer
winch, new stern capstans, a new X-band RADAR, and installation costs for the
Fleet Broadband satellite communications system funded through a group purchase
with WHOI. All of the items requested will either improve safety or enhance
science support capability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The LANGSETH
supports federally funded scientific research throughout the world's oceans to
expand human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic
vessel in the academic fleet. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes
graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time
satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events. The LANGSETH
is scheduled to complete over 260 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
