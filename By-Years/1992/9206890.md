The research in this proposal will focus on host plant biochemical and molecular
mechanisms that regulate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and NADH-glutamate
synthase, key enzymes involved in assimilation of symbiotically fixed nitrogen
in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) root nodules. This proposal is based on two
hypotheses. The first is that expression of the nodule PEPC and NADH-GOGAT genes
is regulated by cis-acting element(s) that interact with one or more trans-
acting factors and the activity of these factors is a function of one or more of
the following: nodule organogenesis, effective bacteroids, ammonium ion
availability and/or oxygen concentration. The second is that direct genetic
alteration of nodule PEPC and/or NADH-GOGAT enzyme activities impacts upon
nodule nitrogen fixation and ammonia assimilation. The specific objectives
include: 1) isolation and sequence analysis of PEPC and NADH- GOGAT genomic
clones and initial characterization of the promoter regions of these gene by
deletion analysis and by protein-DNA binding studies: 2) localization in planta
of PEPC and NADH- GOGAT proteins and mRNAs by immunogold staining and by in situ
hybridization; and 3) alteration in planta of PEPC and NADH- GOGAT activities
through direct modification of enzyme synthesis by the expression of transformed
genes. Knowledge gained from these studies will enhance our fundamental
understanding of plant genes involved in ammonia assimilation and may facilitate
crop improvement through the development of strategies to modify nitrogen
metabolism.
