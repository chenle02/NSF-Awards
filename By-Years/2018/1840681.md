This award will support student attendance at the 2018 International Symposium
on Distributed Computing (DISC), in New Orleans, LA, October 15 to 19, 2018.
Distributed computing is ubiquitous, with many applications in the Internet and
in small-scale devices. DISC gives an opportunity to expose students to the
fundamental concepts behind the algorithms that drive distributed computing
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support to
approximately 10 students to attend this top conference in the area of
distributed computing. Efforts will be made to support students from under-
represented groups and geographic diversity among students will be taken into
account. The award will encourage and facilitate the student participation in
this top-tier computer science conference. It will contribute towards attracting
more under-represented groups to computer science research giving students an
opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and social
exchanges that DISC fosters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
