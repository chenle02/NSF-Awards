Non linear interactions of electrostatic waves in a magnetized plasma are
studied using a combination of laser induced fluorescence and modern plasma
probe techniques. The research is designed to examine the consequences of
chaotic particle orbits on non linear plasma behavior such as wave mixing and
flow generation.
