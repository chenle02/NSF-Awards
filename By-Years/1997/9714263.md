9714263 Koch This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading the
stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SIRMS) facility at the University of
California, Santa Cruz. Funds will be used to purchase and develop a
fluorination vacuum line for extraction of oxygen from silicate, oxide and
phosphate minerals, and an induction furnace vacuum line for thermal
decomposition of hydrous minerals prior to hydrogen isotopic analyses These new
analytic capabilities will provide the recently hired PI, Paul Koch, with the
necessary tools to conduct stable isotopic analyses of fossil bone collagen,
teeth and soil carbonates as proxies in paleoecological investigations that have
profound implications for understanding Cenozoic climate, habitats and regional
tectonics. ***
