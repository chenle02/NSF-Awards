This project focuses on the mechanisms by which a group of fungal plant
pathogens from the genus Cercospora, exhibit resistance to the photosensitizing
toxin cercosporin that they produce. Cercosporin produces singlet oxygen when
activated by light and is toxic to a wide variety of organisms, including mice,
plants, bacteria and many fungi. However, Cercospora species produce high
concentrations of this compound in the light and are unaffected by its presence.
Published evidence suggests that the production of carotenoids and the ability
of Cercospora fungi to reduce and detoxify the cercosporin molecule are the
primary mechanisms of resistance to the toxin. This project tests the hypothesis
for the involvement of carotenoids in cercosporin detoxification through the
generation of a series of carotenoid- deficient mutants produced by gene
disruption experiments. Mutants that are either sensitive to cercosporin or
deficient in cercosporin-reducing ability will provide alternative means to test
for possible mechanisms of detoxification. %%% Naturally-occurring toxins are
usually without effect in the cells in which they are produced, yet they can be
potent poisons in the cells of closely-related organisms. The cellular
mechanisms of detoxification in toxin-producing organisms are thought to involve
either the chemical modification that results in the inactivation of the toxin
or the compartmentalization of the active toxin molecules away from targets
elsewhere in the cell. The chemical basis for cercosporin toxicity is understood
and the inactivation of cercosporin through its chemical reduction is thoroughly
reasonable. This project provides a straightforward test of the involvement of
carotenoids in the reduction of this toxin and will contribute to our
understanding of detoxification in a variety of other organisms.
