The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists
universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through increasing
the number of underrepresented minority students successfully completing degree
programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.
The All Nations Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ANLSAMP) has a
long history of successfully implementing innovative student programs that has
been instrumental to program success.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mission of the
ANLSAMP is to increase the number of American Indians and other underrepresented
minorities receiving a baccalaureate degree in STEM. This is accomplished
through direct participant support and collaborations with 35 geographically
diverse partner institutions. ANLSAMP provides students support at critical
junctures during their academic career. This includes financial support,
conference travel assistance, and domestic and international research
opportunities. In addition, ANLSAMP offers students an intercultural education
component shown to positively impact retention. The Resilience through
Intercultural Skill Enhancement (RISE) program teaches the skills needed to
thrive in diverse cultural environments. RISE is the focus of a scientific
research project to investigate the effectiveness and efficiencies of various
program delivery methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
