A key requirement of division of labor in social insect colonies is the ability
to respond flexibly to environmental change. This ability is crucial to survival
in variable environments. Recent evidence suggests a significant part of
observed behavioral variation in social insect colonies is genetically based. In
the research, the role of genetic variation in colony flexibility and task
regulation by the honey bee, Apis mellifera will be examined. Dr. Fewell will
examine stimulus threshold model which describes how genotypic diversity may
function as a mechanism for regulating division of labor in social insects. This
model proposes that individual workers have genetically linked thresholds to
perform a given task, and that a range of genotypic within a colony provides a
range of tendencies to perform that task. From this model, one can predict that
the genotypic composition of the population performing a task will change as
environmental conditions and, therefore, stimulus environments change. Dr.
Fewell will test this prediction by changing colony need for pollen and
measuring associated changes in the genetic composition of the pollen and nectar
foraging populations. This will be the first experimental test of the role of
genotypic variation in social insect foraging regulation. These studies will
address the important question of whether current hypotheses on the role of
genotype in honey bee foraging apply to naturally mated colonies. They also will
involve the application of a new set of molecular genetic techniques, PCR and
RAPD analysis, to behavioral questions in social insects.
