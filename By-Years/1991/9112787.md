This project deals with the application of the Walsh transform to electric power
engineering. The Walsh transform is a mathematical transform based on kernel
Walsh functions. These functions are square- waves and they result in compact
spectra when the signal to be transformed has a similar waveshape. This
application will be for electric power quality assessment. The expectation is
that the use of this transform will give new insight into models used in power
distribution.
