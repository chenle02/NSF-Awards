This project is concerned with the modular representation theory of finite
groups over a field of finite characteristic p and in particular, the relations
with the p-local structure of the group. The principal investigator will study
perfect isometries, a recent concept introduced by Broue. This links invariants
of block algebras of finite groups with the derived categories of block
algebras. The configurations in classical Chevalley groups connected with the
Alperin conjecture will also be studied, as well as, the classification of
blocks in finite Chevalley groups. This research is in the general area of the
representation theory of finite classical groups. One of the main applications
of group theory to other mathematical and scientific fields is in representation
theory, and finite classical groups are a primary source of finite simple
groups.
