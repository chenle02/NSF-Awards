Experimental studies to ascertain the influence of hydrogen atoms incorporated
during MBE growth of ZnSe on the electrical and optical properties are
conducted. The ability of hydrogen atoms to neutralize shallow and deep levels
in the ZnSe bandgap will be investigated. In order to incorporate hydrogen atoms
into ZnSe epilayers in a highly controlled way, a UHV-compatible RF plasma
discharge free-radical source mounted on the MBE system will be employed rather
than a conventional effusion source. Extensive Hall-effect and photoluminescense
measurements will be carried out to characterize the salient optical and
electronic properties of the epilayers. %%% This research may provide a solution
to the general problem of self-compensation in wide-bandgap compound
semiconductors which would represent a major step towards understanding the
fundamental nature of these materials and provide the basis for realizing
improved optoelectronic devices operating in the blue spectral region.
