The research program develops sampling plans and strategies based on statistical
analysis to obtain geomechanic properties in a geologic site and extends these
estimates to cover the spatial regions of importance to construction projects.
Improved statistical procedures which include the maximum likelihood estimate of
the autocovariance functions will be investigated to determine their
effectiveness in predicting the spatial trends. Site sampling plans will be
investigated by using simulation and data from eight different case studies.
