Arabidopsis thaliana has recently been developed as a model host system to
study the molecular genetics if plant pathogen interactions. This has allowed us
to propose a series of definitive genetic experiments to dissect the molecular
basis of recognition and potential signal transduction events involved in plant
disease resistance. We propose to genetically dissect both race-specific and
systemic acquired disease resistance by identifying and characterizing disease
susceptible mutants that are altered in the expression of disease resistance.
The mutants will be phenotypically and genetically characterized to ascertain
how many loci control the expression of disease resistance in both types of
resistance. Our research will then focus on the avrB- specific disease
susceptible mutants and will employ these mutants to clone the RPG1 disease
resistance locus by the techniques of chromosome walking and/or T-DNA tagging.
%%% The ease with which mutations in Arabidopsis can be isolated, genetically
mapped, and corresponding wild type loci cloned circumvents many disadvantages
encountered in the study of other plant species with more complex genomes and
puts us in a unique position to clone the RPG1 disease resistance locus which
can then be used to determine if the same resistance locus is present in
commercially important crop plants.
