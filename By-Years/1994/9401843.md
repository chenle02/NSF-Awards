Sczech This award funds the research of Professor Robert Sczech in analytic
number theory. Prof. Sczech plans to explicitly construct certain Eisenstein
cocycles in the Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology of the general linear group of
dimension n over the integers. The ultimate aim of these constructions is to
study the special values of particular L-functions in number theory. This is
research in the field of analytic number theory. Number theory is the study of
properties of the whole numbers. In analytic number theory properties of whole
numbers are examined by encoding numbers into the functions of calculus. Number
theory is among the oldest fields of mathematics, yet it has always played an
important role in choosing directions for the rest of the subject. Within the
last half century, the study of whole numbers has become doubly important as the
theory has been used to develop new algorithms for computer science and to
construct new error correcting codes for electronics. ***
