This project in linguistic theory is investigating the possibilities and
problems of an explicit theory of linguistic syntax and semantics which operates
on a single level of representation, with rules with strictly defined and
restricted formal properties. The basic research focuses upon a set of
interrelated issues in the areas of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The first
set has to do with how information about syntactic dependencies determines
surface order and (more generally) with characterizing the combinatorial
possibilities available to natural language in formal and computational terms.
The second set of issues concerns the representation of the syntactic
dependencies that arise in natural language. The goals of the project with
respect to semantics are to articulate the logical and ontological foundations
of a theory which makes computational constructions out of mental entities.
