The goal of this project is to understand the nature of communal resource
management in Indonesian villages in Aceh Province, Sumatra. It will provide a
detailed focus on a small scale cattle production system that is expanding due
to increasing external market demand for beef. The effect of this intensified
demand will be analyzed in terms of changes in the communal land tenure system
and consequences for environmental quality. Aside from addressing scientific
concerns of the stability of communal resource systems and the mechanisms (e.g.,
indigenous knowledge and household participation) that regulate such systems in
the face of external market forces, the information gained should provide useful
information for development planners.
