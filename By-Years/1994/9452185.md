9452185 Niederriter The focus of this grant is the creation of new experiments
for our course, The Physics and Chemistry of Materials. This course brings
together students who are majoring in chemistry and in physics and has them
explore the science and technologies of materials. The laboratory exercises are
designed to bridge the gap between chemistry and physics by bringing out aspects
of both disciplines and having students synthesize their experiences by sharing
their backgrounds in both chemistry and physics. Three new experiments will be
performed with equipment provided for this project, which include two ultra-high
vacuum stations and a scanning tunneling microscope system. The experiments to
be performed include a study of the effects of oxygen plasma on polymer
surfaces, vapor deposition of metallic films, and a scanning tunnelling
microscope study of metal and semiconductor surfaces. Students will be taught
vacuum techniques, contact angle measurements, reflectance and transmission
spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, and scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy. This project will also have an impact on other
courses in the Chemistry and Physics Programs and on student-faculty research.
