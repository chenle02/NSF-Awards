The plastics manufacturing industry has grown at the rate of about 10% a year
for each of the last 25 years and now has approximately 250,000 technician-level
jobs. Until about ten years ago most of these jobs were "blue collar", requiring
little or no technical training. Innovations in processing technology have
changed this situation dramatically and there is now a pressing need for
technicians and engineers with two (and four) year degrees. There are very few
two-year institutions with plastics technology programs and only one, Penn
College, is TAC/ABET accredited. The institutions that do have programs (or
often just one or two courses) are limited by the absence of instructional
materials aimed specifically at technician training. The objective of this
project is to tackle these problems through the development of curricular and
instructional materials and outreach to other two-year institutions through
faculty and teacher development. To accomplish these goals a consortium has been
established between Penn College (a predominantly two-year institution), Penn
State, the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, and a number of industrial
partners. The project is establishing a "modular" educational approach that
emphasizes hands-on training and allows students to progress from high school to
two-year and four-year programs. A special effort is being made to reach out to
students from underrepresented groups. Because of the lack of programs in this
field, this project is having an impact at the national level by helping to
establish programs that provide career opportunities for students while
satisfying the needs of what is now the fastest growing US manufacturing
industry.
