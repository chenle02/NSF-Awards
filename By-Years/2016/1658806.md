This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in
Imaging Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology. "To see with a keener
eye" has been a human obsession for centuries. This science seeks to see more
clearly what was far away or what was very small or even hidden - to magnify and
sharpen. The reliance of modern scientific and engineering research on imaging
techniques has created the need for a new generation of scientists who not only
design and develop the optical systems, electronics, sensors, image processing
algorithms, and integrated imaging systems of the future, but who apply those
systems to answer fundamental questions about ourselves and our universe,
monitor and protect our environment, help keep our nation secure, and improve
our health. This site will support eight undergraduates per summer in research
projects that address some of these important
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students will spend ten weeks during the
summer participating in research in one of a variety of topics that comprise the
field of imaging science, including physics, optics, radiation sources,
mathematics of statistics and topology, chemistry of materials, sensor
engineering, computer science, data mining, brain science of vision, and the
psychophysics of perception. By the end of the program, every student will have:
practiced a one minute "elevator pitch"; given a formal presentation about their
work; and prepared and presented a conference style poster and a four page
paper.
