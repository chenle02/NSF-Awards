In most applications of mathematics to science and engineering the mathematical
model of the phenomena under consideration takes the form of a differential
equation. Usually this equation involves many spatial and temporal variables.
Even more, the modeling equation is usually highly nonlinear in form. Although
great progress has been made in the past 200 years in developing methods to
solve differential equations (as well as in understanding the qualitative nature
of the solutions) we are still far from having a complete theory on how to deal
with them, and we accept instead a study of particular classes of differential
equations. This proposal is concerned with understanding what is known as the
complex Monge-Ampere equation. The origin of this equation is both geometric and
physical. A famous closely related equation (still not understood completely) is
Einstein's field equation from General relativity. The aim of this proposal is
to understand this equation from the point of view of geometry and to develop
efficient and effective tools from a very different branch of mathematics called
algebraic geometry to aid in showing-in concrete cases-that solutions actually
exist.

This project brings together several areas of mathematics: classical projective
algebraic geometry (Cayley forms and projectively dual varieties), toric
varieties and convex polytopes, partial differential equations and coercive
estimates for action functionals and a new kind of Geometric Invariant theory
discovered by the PI-namely the notion of a semistable pair. The goal is, as
suggested in the previous paragraph, to convert the coercive estimate (or lower
bound) for the Mabuchi functional into a problem in polyhedral combinatorics and
then solve this problem in as many cases as possible. All of this is motivated
by the desire to construct canonical metrics on algebraic varieties-usually
smooth or with relatively mild singularities.
