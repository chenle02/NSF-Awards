To provide insight into the substrate specificity, catalytic mechanism and
structure of trypsin, current methods of molecular genetics, biochemistry and
biophysics will be used to generate and analyze mutant trypsins. Three general
approaches are used to alter the enzyme: 1) targeted substitutions, 2) region
specific substitutions and 3) natural adaptation analysis. In each case site-
directed mutants of trypsin are generated according to structural and/or
functional principles. The novel trypsins are then over-expressed in bacteria.
The variant proteins of interest are isolated, purified and their parameters
compared with the native enzyme. Selected mutants are then chosen for more
detailed kinetic, molecular dynamic and coordinated three-dimensional structure
analysis. Results from the initial modifications will provide a basis for
introducing future amino aid changes into the enzyme. Initial experiments have
been successful in addressing the role of specific amino acids in substrate
recognition and the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Proposed experiments
involve amino acid replacements of active site residues for studies of the
catalytic mechanism, substrate binding pocket residues and surface loop
residues. These studies will contribute to our understanding of
structure/function relationships in the enzyme trypsin and related serine
proteases. In addition, these studies will help provide a framework for the de
novo design of enzymes.
