ABSTRACT NCR-9714696 Zeger, Kenneth Institution: University of California - San
Diego Title: Low Complexity Joint Source and Channel Coding
________________________________________________________________ The goal of the
project is to develop effective joint source-channel coding techniques. The main
objectives are to achieve a deep theoretical understanding of combined source-
channel codes and to develop practical algorithms that can effectively be used
in real applications such as low-bandwidth image compression and low-delay
speech coding. Very narrow bandwidth transmission channels, such as in mobile
cellular telephony, require efficient coding schemes to protect the transmitted
source information from the corruptive effects of channel errors. In particular,
low complexity techniques are needed for low delay real time implementations.
This project will investigate joint source-channel coding techniques with an
emphasis on image, video, and speech coding applications. Both packetized and
non-packetized transmission systems will be studied. A summary of the topics to
be investigated is given below: -- Variable Rate Source Coding for Noisy
Channels. -- Optimal Tradeoff Between Source Coding and Channel Coding. --
Feedback Control for Progressive and Region Selective Image Transmission for
Wireless Communication Channels. -- Structured Index Assignment, Vector
Quantization, and Channel Coding
