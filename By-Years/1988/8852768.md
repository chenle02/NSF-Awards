Mobile laboratory vehicles with appropriate sensors and complementary computer
equipment are to be incorporated into a laboratory that supports a newly
developed sequence of courses in the field of robotics. The courses form a three
quarter sequence covering kinematics and dynamics, control and navigation, and
integration and artificial intelligence. Two attributes of mobile robotics will
be encountered by students using computer simulations. However, actual robotic
vehicles are necessary to give real-world experience. The vehicles will make use
of associated computer facilities to show how navigation and goal-achieving
problems are solved and to illustrate the technological limitations to achieving
solutions. The intention is to continually develop this course sequence to
introduce undergraduates to the field of intelligent machines by transferring
complete graduate projects to the undergraduate curriculum.
