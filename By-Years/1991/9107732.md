Dr. Donald Pfister is the Director of the Harvard University Herbaria, which
together comprise the largest university-based plant collection in the U.S. The
Herbaria contain approximately 5 million plant specimens, and the collections
are actively used by visiting investigators and through specimen loan and
exchange traffic. Dr. Pfister proposes to continue the current service to the
research community (loan and exchange program, handling visitors and data
queries), to create an integrated computer database for the Gray Card Index of
plant names (320,000 records) and the Harvard vascular type specimens (80,000
records), and to install compactor storage units for a portion of the
collection. The proposed collection improvement projects will significantly
enhance the research impact of this internationally important collection. The
new specimen storage systems will alleviate crowding and accommodate future
growth, and the computerization efforts will greatly increase the community's
access to the specimens and their associated data. Reference collections such as
these are the primary research tool for many biological disciplines, and the
continued growth and improvement of these collections is vital for future
generations of research.
