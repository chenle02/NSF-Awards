The Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN), the Puget Sound Center
for Teaching, Learning and Technology (PSCTLT), and Reel Grrls (a community
media center) are partnering to involve 6th and 7th grade middle school girls in
science-focused after-school club activities in 10 schools in Seattle and
Spokane, Washington. The Science Journalism Pathways to STEM Careers project is
engaging girls in science journalism through information and communication
technologies (ICT) to investigate and publish information about local science
issues of interest to their communities. The ICT focus is video, multimedia, and
the Internet. Girls are also conducting hands-on activities and interviewing
STEM professionals to learn issue-related science content. The goals of the
project are to (1) increase girls' ICT fluency, (2) increase girls' science
literacy, (3) increase girls' interest in STEM careers, and (4) increase STEM
content in non-science courses taught by social studies teachers who manage the
after-school clubs.
