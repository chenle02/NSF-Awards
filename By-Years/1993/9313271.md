9313271 Lee The mechanisms of scuffing will be studied. Two possible competing
mechanisms are the critical temperature-pressure mechanism of desorption of a
lubricant film, aided by frictional heating and abetted by hydrostatic pressure
in the contact; and the thermomechanical wear mechanism, in which thermal
heating causes plastic flow of the contacting asperity. A set of experiments
will be performed to determine the relative roles of these mechanisms and the
conditions under which they operate. ***
