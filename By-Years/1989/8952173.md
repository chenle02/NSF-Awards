This award provides funds to the Biological Sciences Program at North Carolina
State University to make use of the personal computer's ever increasing
efficiency in data processing and manipulation. Students for the first time will
be allowed to become actively involved in all phases of the process of
scientific inquiry in introductory biology laboratories. Students will use the
computer to perform simulated investigative projects. Also, the computer will
serve as an aid in formulating hypotheses, data collection, analyses and
communication of their results to their peers when students work with living
materials. Students will begin to build a more realistic appreciation for the
vital role of collaboration, communication and verification in research. Their
interest in course material should also grow because they are taking a more
active role in developing their own and peer learning materials. The grantee is
considerably overmatching the award from non-Federal sources.
