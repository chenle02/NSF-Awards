The COMPASS (Co-Ordinated Math and Physics Assessment for Student Success)
program will support a national initiative to retain STEM majors and will be
designed to aid students to navigate successfully through their first year. In
particular, the program will be designed to help students improve their
achievements in their introductory courses and increase retention. The proposed
approach combines effective educational programs tailored to specific student
needs prior to their enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts for
the COMPASS program include the development of strategies specifically designed
to address the retention rates of undergraduate students in STEM disciplines.
Students will be placed in a program designed to build on their personal
strengths in a way to support them in the development of other important
academic areas. The program will build on existing courses grounded in
educational research and provides an easily adaptable retention strategy
accessible to a wide range of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merits for the COMPASS program include the development of
methodologies to interpret information about the initial state of students'
preparedness prior to their enrollment in college level courses. The program
activities will include an examination of new ways to improve introductory STEM
courses through a coordinated curriculum strategy which is adapted to individual
students' specific needs.
