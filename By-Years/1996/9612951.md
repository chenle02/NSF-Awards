ABSTRACT Complex non-steady flow processes and induction mechanisms in pressure-
exchange ejectors will be investigated. The goal of the proposed work is to
establish performance characteristic and design information that will allow the
technology to be used in ejector refrigeration systems. The research will have
an experimental phase to determine the optimal design of the rotor, diffuser,
and the nozzle in the ejector. Theoretical and computational analyses will also
be carried out to study the flow behavior inside the ejector. Results from the
theoretical study will be used to guide the design of the ejector. Because
ejector refrigerators are non-CFC based, they contribute to the reduction of
hazardous effluents by avoiding them at the source. This project is jointly
funded by NSF and EPA under the Partnership for Environmental Research Program.
