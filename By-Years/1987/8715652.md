The principal investigator is addressing graph embedding issues arising in
layout of VLSI designs and mapping of parallel algorithms to parallel computing
structures. With respect to layout, Dr. Hambrusch is investigating problems
motivated by multilayer models, including problems of linear arrangement and
partitioning nonplanar problems into planar ones. Cost measures used are
individual and total wire length, and number of layers. With respect to parallel
processing, the problem is the embedding of a source interconnection network
into a host network of smaller size. Concentration is on tree and mesh-like
networks and the algorithmic behavior of the source network. Such embeddings
will be tailored towards the parallel functions and subroutines used in the
algorithm for the source network.
