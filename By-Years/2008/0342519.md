For the past several years, the Crystal Ball detector has been providing high-
quality data at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for studies of non-strange
and strange baryon resonances and their decay modes. Tests of fundamental
symmetries of nature have also been made through high-statistics measurements of
the decay modes of eta mesons. An experiment for a precision measurement of the
up-strange quark mixing element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is
being planned and developed. When combined with recent and on-going measurements
of the up-down quark mixing matrix element, a critical test of the unitarity of
the CKM matrix can be made. Current data suggest a violation from unitarity, and
hence a breakdown of the Standard Model, of two standard deviations or more.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an alternative, the WASA detector at The Svedberg
Laboratory of Uppsala University in Sweden will complete a research program in
2-3 years and become available for use elsewhere. This detector was designed
specifically for the types of experiments such as the CKM experiment. In order
to determine whether the WASA detector can also meet the demands of the
experiment, similar studies must also be done for it. The studies will be
carried out by the Principal Investigator and undergraduate students in this
project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will directly benefit the education
of undergraduate students. Because modeling and simulation studies of complex
projects is an ever increasing activity in research and industry, the students
will acquire valuable skills which can be carried into graduate studies and
subsequent jobs elsewhere in society. When the experiment is ultimately carried
out, students from many institutions will be given significant or leading
responsibilities within the collaboration, and will work together and with
senior colleagues. Such teamwork approaches to complex problems are also highly
valued skills which will benefit their future careers.&lt;br/&gt;
