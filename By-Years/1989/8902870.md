Studying under Dr. Frank L. Parker of Vanderbilt University, Dr. McCabe in
examining the role of quality assurance in high-level radioactive waste
management. Dr. Parker is a world leader in the development of the basic
information required for the safe disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Dr.
McCabe's doctoral dissertation research was on the process by which science and
technology policy decisions are reached in a democratic system. It is
increasingly apparent that science and technology policy makers are developing
more open institutional arrangements, so that their decisions are perceived as
legitimate. As a consequence of this more open system of decision making,
scientific and technical experts are being held to unprecedented standards of
accountability in terms of research methodology. Thus, scientists are becoming
important actors in a frequently contentious political process. The Nuclear
Waste Policy Act,passed by Congress in 1982, is the first comprehensive national
policy to address high-level radioactive waste disposal. Since Congress amended
the Act in December, 1987, the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management has focused its efforts on preparing site
characterization plans for a proposed geological repository at Nevada's Yucca
Mountain. As a component of its site characterization plan, the DOE has
initiated an aggressive quality assurance (QA) program. The program has met
resistance from a segment of the scientific community, including some of DOE's
scientific contractors, charging that QA regulations designed for construction
of engineered facilities cannot be applied to earth science investigations. Dr.
McCabe will be working with Dr. Parker over the next two years under this
postdoctoral fellowship to examine systematically the conflict between DOE and
the scientists carrying out field investigations,particularly the implications
of this case for subsequent science and technology policy decision. She will
conduct personal interviews with DOE officials and contractors, Nuclear
Regulatory Commission personnel and other major actors affiliated with the QA
program. She will thoroughly examine the QA literature and supporting documents
to complete the database.
