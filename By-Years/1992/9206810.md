The study will examine the hydrologic conditions prevailing in the Oakland Hills
before the October 1991 fire which took the life of 25 people, injured 150
others, destroyed nearly 4,000 homes and caused about $1 billion property loss.
The preceding hydrologic and climatic conditions, the management of water supply
available during the fire, and the impact of the fire on the local watersheds
are some issues that will be examined. The research will take advantage of a
rare opportunity and its results will benefit the natural hazard research
community by providing a better understanding of these relationships, and many
of the municipalities in California and elsewhere where urban sites and
wildlands interact, and are also subjected to droughts, by the possible
development of improved mitigation and preventive measures.
