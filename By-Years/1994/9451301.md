9451301 Peterson Economics courses at Furman University seek to acquaint
students with the "economic way of thinking." We want majors to understand the
thought processes involved in specifying an economic theory, deriving
implications from that theory, and testing the theory using data from the real
world. We hope that by the end of their undergraduate education they will be
able to view theoretical arguments critically and begin to generate and test
some simple theories of their own. We want our students (majors and non-majors)
to know why economic thinking is important and to appreciate the dynamic
relationship between economic behavior and economic institutions. Historically,
lecture and textbook assignments, supplemented with data and anecdotes from
journals, magazines, and newspapers, have been the principal classroom tools.
Recent technological developments have facilitated the use of a more "active"
set of teaching tools in economics which include data viewing, transformation,
and analysis; model creation, comparative statics, and sensitivity analysis; and
macro- and microeconomic simulations. A computer laboratory with twenty-six
workstations and software for data analysis, mathematical modeling, and economic
simulations will be used to implement the full range of these active-learning
techniques. When combined with the appropriate laboratory exercises in the
principles, theory, econometrics, and topics courses, the laboratory will help
our students develop "the economic way of thinking" and it will enable us to
achieve our curricular goals.
