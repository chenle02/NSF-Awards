The proposal outlines a valuable extension of research on expected utility
theory. Forty years of experience has led to two conclusions. One, stressed by
empirical researchers, is that the theory does not adequately describe behavior
in many experimental and real-world situations. The other, stressed by decision
analysts, is that the axioms of the theory are normatively appealing and
difficult to dismiss. The gap between the descriptive inadequacy and normative
appeal has widened in the past ten years. As a result, researchers have
challenged not only the descriptive validity, but the normative basis of
expected utility theory. The proposed research begins by identifying a common
ground for descriptive and normative research in a newly developed rank and sign
dependent (RSD) linear utility theory. The investigators propose (1) to extend
the range of concepts included in RSD, (2) to test key assumptions of RSD, (3)
to develop connections between RSD and traditional utility theory, and (4) to
explore the normative-descriptive distinction in the context of RSD. Thus, the
research combines theoretical development, experimental research, and applied
experience in an effort to bridge the normative- descriptive gap in the theory
of decision making under uncertainty.
