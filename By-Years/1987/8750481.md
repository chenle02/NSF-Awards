The Department of Chemistry and Physics at St. Mary's College is upgrading the
biochemistry offerings in the curriculum. A major thrust is the development of a
biochemistry laboratory which emphasizes both the basic concepts presented in
the associated lectures, and introduces the student to the techniques commonly
used in the discipline. The recent acquisition of a high speed centrifuge, two
ultraviolet-visible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometers, electrophoretic equipment, a
tissue homogenizer, and an oxygen electrode has allowed the laboratory content
to be significantly upgraded. Innovative laboratory courses which provide
exposure to a number of fundamental biochemical techniques are now available,
affording students better opportunities to apply their knowledge of chemistry to
biological systems.
