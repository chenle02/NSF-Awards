This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
in the purchase of a Raman spectrometer with a laser excitation source tunable
in the visible region. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (a) Investigation of the Interaction between
3-Chlorocatechol and the Active Site of Catechol 1,2-Dioxygenase II; (b)
Application of Resonance Raman Spectroscopy for the Determination of the
Vibrational Reorganization Energies in Charge Transfer Complexes; and (c) Matrix
Isolation (MI) Raman Spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is concerned with
vibrational and rotational transition in molecules, similar to infrared
spectroscopy. The information obtained from a Raman spectrometer sometimes
complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides valuable
structural information.
