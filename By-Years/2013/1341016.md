This proposal is for a one day workshop including researchers from multiple
research disciplines (e.g. education, communication, psychology) and key
stakeholders from the giant screen film industry to develop key research
questions, priorities, and strategies related to giant screen cinema
characteristics that impact STEM learning. The workshop would be held preceding
the October, 2013 meeting of ASTC in Albuquerque, NM.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been little research performed on the unique
components of STEM giant screen films related to the role of immersion,
presence, and effect on cognition. This workshop would begin with an online
forum where invited participants would develop a list of questions, organize
prior research, and identify relevant readings. During the workshop day at ASTC,
participants would engage in roundtable exercises to develop the research
program strategies (methods, collaborative communities, etc.) for the
prioritized questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop outcomes include
development of future research proposals and collaborative communities that will
address the questions related to the impact of giant screen films and the role
of immersion and presence on learning.
