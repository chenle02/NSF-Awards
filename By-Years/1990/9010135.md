Effective support for analysis, verification, and testing requires coordinated
application of a variety of techniques. As the difficulties of analyzing
concurrent software are especially severe, so it is especially important that
multiple techniques be brought to bear on the problem. This project will develop
and demonstrate a general approach to integrating analysis techniques applied to
the detection of synchronization faults in concurrent software. A set of tool
components for analysis of concurrent programs will be embedded in a software
development environment. A reachability analysis technique will be used to
detect classes of faults (race conditions, for instance) that are particularly
difficult to detect with other analysis and testing techniques. A new technique
for divide-and- conquer analysis will be implemented. Flexible control of
effort/accuracy tradeoffs and the option of filtering reports of potential
errors through other analysis and testing techniques will be used to control the
shortcomings of reachability analysis as a stand- alone technique. The
concurrency analysis tool set will serve as an experimental test-bed for
investigating novel combinations of techniques, including integration of
reachability analysis with symbolic execution.
