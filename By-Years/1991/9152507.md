A 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer will be used in three
sophomore-level organic chemistry lab courses, two junior-level physical
chemistry lab courses, and senior- level laboratory courses in inorganic
chemistry and chemical spectroscopy. The instrument will strengthen the organic
courses, which are taught in a non-traditional way that emphasizes
interpretative skills. The principles of relaxation and coherence will be
illustrated in the experiments in physical chemistry. Two-dimensional NMR will
be introduced in the senior level molecular spectroscopy course. This instrument
will also be used to acquire data for students at other colleges in the region.
Methods of performing rapid ID NMR calculations on personal computers will be
tested. This project was funded jointly by the USEME Division and the Chemistry
Division.
