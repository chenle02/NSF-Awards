9409444 Jackson This research effort will investigate the application of
conjugated polymer thin film transistors to direct-view active matrix liquid
crystal displays. This work will begin with the synthesis and analysis of
several a-polythiophenes and concentrate initially on a-sexithienylene (a-6T).
Next, appropriate techniques will be developed for high vacuum deposition of
thin films of these materials onto organic and inorganic substrates. Emphasis
will be placed on controlled deposition and on maximizing the crystallinity of
the resulting thin films. Finally, thin film transistors will be fabricated and
used to evaluate the quality of deposited films and materials and evaluate the
suitability of these devices for use in direct view active matrix liquid crystal
display applications. ***
