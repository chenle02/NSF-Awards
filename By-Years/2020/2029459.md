Observations of the Earth's upper atmosphere at the altitudes from above 100-km
to a few hundred kilometers is subjected to highly variable forces as from the
top (energy and momentum transferred down from the solar wind interaction with
geomagnetic field) as well as from the bottom â€“ from the lower atmosphere and
mesosphere which generate gravity waves from the global atmospheric circulation
driven mainly by the solar radiation. It is not easy to explore the upper
atmosphere which lays below the satellite orbits, so only a remote technique
instrumentation (such ground-based Fabry-Perot Spectrometers, FPS) is used for
that kind of studies. Latitudes of interests here are polar regions,
specifically Antarctica where two modern FPSs are deployed at McMurdo and South
Pole stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award will focus on the behavior and
governing physics of the transition from the neutral fluid-like dynamics in the
lower atmosphere to the plasma electrodynamics in the ionosphere and geospace
domain above it. This transitional domain is frequently called the Space-
Atmosphere Interaction Region (SAIR). Knowledge of SAIR's properties and
dynamics are important because they strongly impact many modern technological
systems such as radio wave communication, navigation, and long-range radar
applications. The primary goals of this research are identifying the role of
waves and tides propagating upward from below and driving perturbation within
the SAIR, and what is the role of forcing from above in driving high-latitudes
thermospheric weather. The broader impact of this research is training the next
generation of scientists through deep involvment of students and active support
for diversity and inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
