Phytochrome is a regulatory master switch that controls gene expression in
response to light. The long term goal of the proposed research is to define the
molecular mechanism underlying this regulation. The rapid transcriptional
repression that phytochrome imposes on its own phyA genes provides an excellent
model system for this purpose. The specific objectives of this proposal are: (a)
to identify and isolate recombinant clones encoding DNA-binding proteins that
recognize functionally defined cis-acting elements in phyA promoters; (b) to
delineate the functional domains of such cloned factors; (c) to determine the
molecular mechanism by which a recently identified repressor factor, RF1,
disrupts phyA transcription in response to phytochrome activation. Experimental
approaches will include: (a) screening expression libraries with oligonucleotide
probes representing functionally defined regulatory elements for isolation of
cDNA clones encoding the cognate factors; (b) in vitro binding assays to define
the DNA-recognition domains of these factors; (c) gene transfer assays to
delineate nuclear localization sequences; (d) yeast transfection and in vitro
transcription assays with chimeric fusion proteins to define transcriptional
activation or repression domains in these factors. The significance of this
research is that it will help define the mechanism by which a central regulatory
molecule controls gene expression. Because phytochrome appears to have no
molecular counterpart in other eukaryotes, elucidation of this mechanism will
broaden our understanding of how eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression in
response to environmental stimuli. %%%% Plant respond to light by turning on
genes that are involved with growth, photosynthesis, and other functions. A key
regulatory molecule in plant cells that is responsible for this effect is
phytochrome. This molecule interacts with proteins and genes to activate genetic
messages for growth, etc. To understand the molecular mechanism it is necessary
to identify the regions of the gene which are affected, and the proteins which
are involved in the activation process. These studies will lead to greater
understanding of how to regulate plant growth.
