Students involved in research develop skills beyond those typically learned in
the classroom - in particular, refinement of cognitive and interpersonal skills,
enhancement of personal growth, and inculcation of intellectual and management
habits. These benefits are well known. The research experience, however, has
traditionally been restricted to the best and the brightest students. The
University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) has successfully implemented the Affinity
Research Group (ARG) model that expands the range to include those who
historically have not been involved in undergraduate research, including those
who are competent, but may lack the confidence to seek a research position. The
ARG model provides both undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities
to learn, use, and integrate the knowledge and skills that are required for
research with those required for cooperative work. This model integrates best
practices from a variety of sources in industry, research, and education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project refines the educational materials used in the
ARG model, fully develops the ARG model products and processes, distributes the
ARG educational materials across a range of institutions, and evaluates the
transfer of the ARG model to geographically and culturally diverse institutions.
