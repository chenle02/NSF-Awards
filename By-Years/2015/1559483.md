This IRES project at The University of Oklahoma will support international
research experiences for US engineering students to work at the globally
recognized 5th Generation Cellular Systems Innovation Centre (5GIC) at the
University of Surrey, U.K. In each of its three years, the twelve-week program
supported by this project will provide five (2 graduate, and 3 undergraduate)
students an opportunity to work closely with an internationally renowned
research group in three focused research areas within the domain of next
generation ultra-dense wireless cellular networks namely: Interference
Mitigation, Energy Efficiency and Mobility Management. This project will also
provide participants an opportunity for a hands on research experience using a
one of a kind, outdoor, large scale 5G test-bed for wireless cellular system
innovation that has recently been established at the University of Surrey as
part of 5GIC. Ultra-dense deployment of cellular systems is inevitable in near
future to meet mounting capacity demands. Interference, energy and mobility are
emerging as key constrains in realization of ultra-dense networks. This project
focuses on building complementary international cooperative efforts to address
these challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable US students and
PIs to establish long-term collaborative links with globally recognized academia
and international industrial partners in cellular domain. The project will
introduce students to the European perspective on research and development in
cellular domain. The extensive field research experiences planned in this
project for undergraduates will help to increase the success of these students
in graduate programs in engineering fields. For the graduate students
participants, the opportunity to do validation of their ideas on a real network
(5G test-bed) will help to transform and enhance their understanding of their
research and promote the ability of US engineers to advance and contribute to
leadership on state of the art mobile broadband wireless networks.
