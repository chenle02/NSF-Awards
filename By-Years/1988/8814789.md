They propose a comprehensive study of the oxygen-17 nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopic behavior of a range of oxide superconductors in their normal, and
in many cases, superconducting, state. Newer systems will naturally be included,
as they become available, as will a series of model perovskites and copper
oxides. They will obtain knight shift, linewidth, and spin-lattice (Korringa and
Arrhenius) relaxation time (T1) behavior of each of these systems, and relate
there to structure, and to the experimental Tc temperatures observed. Where
appropriate, oriented samples will be used, to facilitate spectral assignments.
They will investgigate the kinetics of oxygen exchange; the effects of
sequential oxygenation on NMR/superconducting behavior; the topic of "frozen"
states; melt textured growth and the removal of "weak links".
