DMS-0223533&lt;br/&gt;Shing-Tung Yau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial support for mathematicians from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups and
other junior mathematicians without &lt;br/&gt;other means of support to attend
a Geometry and Topology Conference&lt;br/&gt;on May 3,4, and 5 at Harvard
University. The first day of the &lt;br/&gt;conference will emphasize Karen
Uhlenbeck's leading role in &lt;br/&gt;mentoring women in Mathematics and
feature four female speakers&lt;br/&gt;from a well known leader in the field to
other more junior &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians. There will be several poster
session during the&lt;br/&gt;conference including one on "Women in Science." The
second and &lt;br/&gt;third days of the conference will feature lectures from
twelve &lt;br/&gt;eminent Geometers and Topologists. Further details about the
conference, including lists of speakers and local hotels can &lt;br/&gt;be found
at http://math.harvard.edu/jdg/index.html &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
