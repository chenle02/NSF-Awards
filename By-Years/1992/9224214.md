The objective of this research is to determine the effect of local flow
conditions on the distribution of a stream insect, emphasizing possible
constraints on settlement from the water current. Although some studies have
been done on this subject in marine environments, the consequences of
hydrodynamic constraints on settlement have not been actively studied in
freshwater systems. Transport by water currents in streams and rivers (drift)
has been the object of intense work and debate, but very few studies have
attempted to determine its significance to the individual organism. This study
will be one of the first tests of the hypothesis of active drift as a foraging
decision. This test will be aided by the development of a foraging model in
which the organism has incomplete information of its environment. In itself the
model will be an important addition to a field in which models and critical
tests are still fragmentary. Black fly larval dispersal in a stream is largely
analogous to the movements of ballooning spiders or lepidopteran larvae
(including gypsy moth larvae), two groups that have been analyzed from a fluid
mechanic point of view. What makes this system particularly interesting is the
largely unidirectional nature of the movement. This relative simplicity will
provide important insights that may be applied to the ecology of other organisms
that are transported by air or water currents in some phase of their life cycle.
