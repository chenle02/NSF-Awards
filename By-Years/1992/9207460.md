This research will apply molecular template techniques in concert with probe
microscopy to the chemical synthesis and ordering of oligomeric and polymeric
materials for electronic and photonic applications. There are three distinct
tasks within the research. First is the study of synthetic reactions initiated
by a confined electric discharge between a probe tip and substrate. Second is
the development of procedures for orienting a single conducting oligomer between
sharp probe tips by chemical insertion and binding. Third is the investigation
of single-layer ledges on highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite as chemical
templates of opportunity for the growth of highly ordered one-dimensional
polymers.
