The phylogenetic relationships among the orders of otophysan fishes and the
families of catfishes will be investigated using nucleotide sequence variation
of ribosomal RNA. Ribosomal RNA sequences will be obtained using a primer-
extension sequencing method applied directly to RNA samples isolated from tissue
samples. Statistical tests will be applied to these data to resolve alternative
hypotheses previously generated from morphological data. The evolutionary events
underlying the multiple derivations of complex morphological systems such as the
elastic spring apparatus and palatine-maxillary mechanism will be evaluated in
the context of a molecular phylogeny. The resulting molecular phylogenies will
also be used to test predictions of the vicariance and dispersalist models of
vertebrate radiation and to reevaluate major trends of morphological evolution
among otophysan fishes. The phylogenetic information contained in different
parts of the ribosome will be examined to identify a general range of divergence
times over which ribosomal sequence variation is likely to be informative for
teleost fishes.
