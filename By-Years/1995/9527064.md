The focus of this research will be in two areas. First, studies on nudibranchs
will identify new compounds and determine the source organisms for those
compounds that are dietary derived. Specific examples of systems to be studied
include: Bornella anguila, Phyllidia ocellata, P. zelandica, P. varicosa,
Siphonaria spp., Phestilla sibogae, Adalaria proxema and Alderia modesta.
Second, the role of symbionts in the production of marine natural products will
be examined. Target molecucles include: Swinholide A, the pyridoacridine
alkaloids, the Renieramycins, Jaspamide, Halichodramide, cyclic dipeptides and
diterpenes. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the research of Dr. D. John Faulkner of the Marine Research Division of the
University of California-San Diego Scripps Institute. Dr. Faulkner will focus
his work on understanding the impact of marine natural products on marine
biology. The project involves the chemistry and chemical ecology of marine
molluscs, and the the role of symbionts in the production of marine natural
products.
