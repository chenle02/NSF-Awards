9400642 Wagner This award will support the technical infrastructure of the
Center of Computational Ecology, which in turn will help support the development
of computational models in several areas represented by the researchers at this
center. The group is involved in developing, implementing, validating, and
distributing multiscale simulation models in biological research. One of the key
difficulties in understanding biological systems is the fact that every
biological phenomenon involves processes at more than one spatial and
organizational level and that these different processes are inextricably linked.
Consequently, to understand and predict the behavior of biological systems,
models must be developed and validated that simulate complex multiscale
biological systems. The group is involved in specific projects that represent
complementary approaches to solving problems of multiscale computational
modeling.
