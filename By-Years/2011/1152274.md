Ongoing discussions and scientific collaborations between NSF sponsored Critical
Zone Observatory (CZO) Principal Investigators and European Commission-(EC)
funded counterparts in the Soil Transformations in European Catchments
(SoilTrEC) project have identified the need for more formalized and well
organized international collaborations to achieve many of the goals of Critical
Zone (CZ) research. The proposal requests funds to support the US participation
in an international meeting to be held at the campus of the University of
Delaware in Newark on November 8-9, 2011. The meeting will be followed by an
optional field trip to the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory on
November 10. The meeting is intended to broaden and intensify communication
between U.S. and European (and other international) CZ scientists toward a goal
of establishing a truly international network of CZ scientists, data and
research sites. U.S. participation will include 20 scientists from funded CZOs
as well 30 CZ scientists from outside the funded CZO program. European
participation (50 scientists) is covered by an EC grant to SoilTrEC. Results
from the workshop will be published in a report.
