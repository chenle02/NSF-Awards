9505416 Pierce This proposal describes several experiments designed to
understand the mechanism(s) that are used by the cells of the marine slug,
Elysia chlorotica, to capture chloroplasts from the marine alga, Vaucheria
litorea, and keep the plastids photosynthetically active within the animal cell
for periods as long as 8 months after capture. The photosynthesis requires that
certain chloroplast proteins be continually replaced. The genetic information
for the synthesis of some of those proteins is contained within the chloroplast,
but for other of the proteins is normally supplied by the plant nucleus. The
experiments, which will use radiolabelling and gel electrophoresis techniques,
will indicate which of the chloroplast proteins are synthesized while the
plastid is within the animal cell. Using pharmacological agents, the site
(chloroplast or animal nucleus) of the genetic information for the synthesized
proteins will be determined. Antibody labelling will be used to identify the
synthesized proteins. The results will begin to provide information leading to
understanding how the animal cell maintains within it a completely foreign
structure (chloroplast) in a functional condition. ***
