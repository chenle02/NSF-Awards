9309690 Barton This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri--St. Louis
in the purchase of an x-ray diffractometer and an associated data analysis
system. This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of
areas including the following: Structural and mechanistic studies of Dppc-
bridged diplatinum complexes; Structural studies of group IV derivatives of
pentaborane(9) and hexaborane(10); The use of high resolution diffraction x-ray
analyses of the electronic and structural properties of organometallic
molecules; Chiral phosphonamides in stereoselective bond formations; and
Structural studies of silicon tricycles and silicon-silicon bonds. %%% The x-ray
diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
three-dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the
precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and
it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of that molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. ***
