In recent decades, political scientists have made less progress in
understanding the presidency than in studying almost any other political
institution. The study of the U. S. Congress, for example, has proceeded at a
rapid pace. One reason for this is that numerous academics have enjoyed
internships on Capitol Hill and have had the opportunity of learning from
senators and representatives and observing them at close range. Reflecting on
these experiences after they returned to their campuses, political scientists
have developed a rich literature about legislative politics. The result has been
a sophisticated understanding of congressional behavior and processes. This
award is for a conference to be held at the University of Pittsburgh's Center
for International Studies. The purpose of the conference, to be organized by
three distinguished scholars of the presidency, is to chart new theoretical and
research directions in the study of the presidency. While there has been some
distinguished work by academics on the presidency while they have served on
White House staffs, political science has fewer students of the presidency than
of almost any other political institution. Consequently, our understanding of
executive processes is less well informed. The goals of this conference are to
increase the number of presidential scholars, and to enrich the set of concepts
on which they can draw. This will be accomplished in two stages. The first stage
will be the conference itself. Two sets of papers will be prepared for the
conference. The first will be written by presidential scholars, each of whom
will do an inventory of a segment of the existing literature. The second will be
written by theorists in other social science research fields, such as cognition,
group theories, leadership theory, and statistical and formal modeling. Each
author will be asked to suggest new perspectives that could be applied to the
presidency. The second stage will be the preparation of a book based on the
conference proceedings. Here the presidential scholars will have an opportunity
to reflect on the theorists' sugestions, and the theorists can augment their
suggestions by understanding what the scholars are trying to accomplish. This
effort should spread the dialogue to a far wider audience than the small group
attending only the conference.
