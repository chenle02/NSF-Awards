This career development project focuses on an experimental study of a novel type
of "designer solid" consisting of a sample of ultracold Rydberg atoms that are
strongly coupled by long range dipole-dipole interactions. The experiments
investigate a new form of this designer solid -a Rydberg atom crystal. The
research works toward developing the ability to control interactions between
individual atoms in this strongly coupled spin system at the level required to
produce the entanglement necessary for quantum computations. The table top scale
of the proposed research provides excellent opportunities for student
involvement at a variety of levels. In addition, the work seeks to broaden the
exposure of a group of successful women scientists to the larger community.
Undergraduate students are involved in the development of a conceptual physics
course as student teachers whose duties go well beyond those of a typical
teaching assistant. They explore teaching pedagogies, help implement innovative
teaching methods, and help build lecture demonstration resources. Student
outreach is being extended beyond the confines of the college through a physics
demonstration show, which travels to local K-12 schools.
