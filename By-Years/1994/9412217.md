The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to assemble a quadruple mass spectrometer
for assisting with mechanistic studies of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
processes. The vacuum system for the spectrometer is to include two stages of
differential pumping to allow in-situ sampling of gas phase species from CVD
systems under reaction conditions. The system will be assembled as a portable
unit with an adjustable sample probe orientation in order to allow flexibility
for using the system with different CVD reactor configurations and multiple
users. One application for the equipment will be to assist with the PI's current
research into the reaction mechanism, kinetic parameters, and reactor design
models for the CVD of copper thin films. The equipment will also be suitable for
a range of other projects, both in the PI's laboratory (e.g. TiO2 CVD using
alkoxide pyrolysis) as well as other investigators who are studying gas-solid
reaction kinetics (e.g. methane oxidation research).
