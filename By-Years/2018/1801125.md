Von Neumann algebras were introduced in the 1930's and 40's in part as a tool
for developing a mathematical foundation for quantum physics. Von Neumann
algebras have since become a field of independent interest with further
applications to areas such as ergodic theory, Voiculescu's free probability
theory, Jones' theory of subfactors and planar algebras, knot theory, and many
others. The development of von Neumann algebras has also historically been
closely connected to the study of measurable dynamics and these connections have
recently begun to reemerge in the presence of newly developed rigidity
phenomenon. The investigation of this rigidity phenomenon has since led to new
connections between von Neumann algebras and other areas of mathematics.
Furthering the development of rigidity will in turn lead to new insights and
connections among these various fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing
alongside the theory of von Neumann algebras has been ergodic theory, and many
results in one field has had major applications in the other. A reemergence of
this collaboration has occurred in the last ten years with Popa's discovery of
deformation/rigidity theory, which juxtaposes deformability properties such as
Haagerup's property, free products, or unbounded cocycles, with rigidity
properties such as property (T) or spectral gap, allowing one to discover hidden
structure in a von Neumann algebra in the case when both types of phenomena
occur. This project will investigate more fully these connections, focusing
specifically on connections to the deep rigidity theory for ergodic actions of
lattices in higher rank groups initiated by Mostow, Margulis, Zimmer, and many
others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
