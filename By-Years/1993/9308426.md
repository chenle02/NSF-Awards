Najm This research is on synthesis algorithms for design of reliable, low power
CMOS and BiCMOS VLSI designs. The basis for the research is to use boolean
transition density to measure deviant activity and thus to help solve power
consumption and reliability issues. Research activities include: 1. exploring
use of circuit activity as a parameter to be minimized; and 2. investigating the
effects of minimizing local power dissipation on circuit design. Algorithms
incorporating these new optimization ideas are being developed and integrated
into a synthesis environment. The environment integrates the objectives of
optimizing area, performance, testability, reliability, and power into a unified
set of design algorithms.
