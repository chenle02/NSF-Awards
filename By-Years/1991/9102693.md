Scientists and engineers are an underutilized resource in motivating students
and assisting classroom teachers in teaching science. Pilot programs have
demonstrated the value of preparing scientists for what to expect when they
enter the classroom, how to incorporate the school curriculum into their
program, and how best to reach the goal of making their visits a "never to be
forgotten" life changing experience for students. The concept of a Survival Kit
is an outgrowth of a Scientist-in-Residence program at the North Carolina Museum
of Life and Science which has successfully matched scientists and public school
classrooms locally since 1982. The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science
proposes to conduct meetings for staff and outside educational specialists to
identify the materials and strategies needed to prepare scientists to enter
school classrooms. The final report of these meetings will include mechanicals
of a Scientist Survival Kit, which can be disseminated across the country, and
an evaluation report of how the kits can be and are used. Dr. Mark St. John,
Inverness Associates, a professional evaluator noted for his work with
nationally significant science education projects, will provide local and
national evaluation through surveys and meetings to give a picture of the issues
involved in establishing and maintaining programs of scientists in the schools
and the role played by the Scientist's Survival Kit in furthering this aim.
