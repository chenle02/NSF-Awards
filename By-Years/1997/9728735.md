The behaviors and fates of cells are specified by the proteins they express and
by the distribution of those proteins within the cell. One way that proteins are
targeted to specific subcellular sites is via the localization of their
corresponding mRNAs. Like other aspects of mRNA metabolism, localization is
governed by specific RNA-protein recognition events. This proposal seeks to
investigate the RNA-protein recognition events that mediate mRNA localization in
Drosophila oocytes. It focuses on K10 mRNA, which is representative of a
relatively large class of mRNAs (~30 members) that are synthesized in ovarian
nurse cells and selectively transported into the oocyte during early stages of
oogenesis. Previous studies have identified a small sequence element, called the
TLS (transport/localization sequence), that is required and sufficient for K10
mRNA localization. The specific aims of the current proposal are: (1) To define
precisely the structural features of the TLS that are required for its in vivo
localization activity, (2) To determine whether the activity of the TLS is
affected by its position in the mRNA, and (3) To identify and characterize
proteins that bind the TLS.
