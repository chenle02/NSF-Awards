A nonlinear robust control methodology for robot control based on robust
servomechanism theory has been demonstrated by computer simulation to possess
the capability of achieving satisfactory robot position control under severe
modeling errors. The object of this research is to experimentally evaluate the
merits of this scheme by implementing it on a PUMA 560 mechanical manipulator
and to determine the need for possible controller modifications. Success of this
project would have a significant impact on the operational speed and accuracy of
many robotic manipulators currently used in industrial operations, including
assembly, material handling, welding and deburring. Improved productivity would
also result.
