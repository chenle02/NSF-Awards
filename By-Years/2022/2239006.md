This project seeks to develop methods for using existing and ongoing carbonyl
sulfide (COS) observations to estimate carbon tracer gas exchange, including
carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to better understand the effect of tree litter on
carbon cycling within forests. This is an important step toward increasing our
understanding of the carbon cycle, and the knowledge gained through the course
of this project will enhance our ability to understand and project the impact of
changes to the carbon cycle on climate change and the ecosystem. Additionally,
the research team will work with a local high school teacher to develop a high
school-level leaf litter sorting activity, which will provide students with
hands-on experience related to real-world scientific
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two specific aims of this work include: (1)
to distinguish the influence of different components of forest ground cover on
the trace gas exchange of COS; and (2) to integrate the importance of understory
COS fluxes on ecosystem- and regional-scale evidence of plant functioning. This
work seeks to include the collection of tower flux measurements, the processing
of remote sensing and inventory data for these tower-scale measurements,
Lagrangian inversions for COS surface fluxes, and the identification of
previously unknown COS fluxes. This work also includes an 8-week visit from a
local high school teacher to develop a litter-sorting activity, which will then
be implemented at other nearby schools. Additionally, four local high school
students will be invited for 6-week summer internships in the Rutgers Research
Intensive Summer Experience (RISE) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
