New methods based on generalized Borel summation and trans-asymptotic expansions
are being developed by a number of analysts and are emerging as a new field of
study, "analyzability theory". The methods enable one to treat solutions of
equations at singularities much more general then usually dealt with and provide
a rigorous foundation to previously formal calculations. The present proposal
aims at developing and applying these new techniques. The PIs will continue
their research in the context of ODEs, difference equations and PDEs.
Applications addressed include the classification of nonlinear ODEs at irregular
singularities, determining their integrability properties as well as their
reducibility to simpler systems, study of adiabatic invariance, and Painleve'
analysis for difference equations. These techniques will be used to continue
rigorous research of the time dependent Schroedinger problem under periodic
perturbations of arbitrary strength and also of resonance theory.

The project is a piece in an unfolding enterprise to bridge the gap from formal
calculations to rigorous proofs, and in the advance of what appears to be
emerging as a general theory of singular behavior. Countless applications exist
in mathematics as well as in the study of physical phenomena.
