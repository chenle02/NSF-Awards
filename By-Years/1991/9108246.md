This award provides partial support a symposium on hotspots, mantle plumes and
related topics to be held at Caltech on May 2, 3, and 4. In the past decade
there have been rapid advances in geochemical characterization of basalts and
peridotites from various tectonic environments, in tomographic imaging of the
Earth's interior and in computer modeling of hydrodynamic and plate phenomena.
This PI will assemble workers in these areas for an extensive discussion of the
nature and origin of mantle plumes.
