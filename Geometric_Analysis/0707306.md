Abstract

Award: DMS-0707306 Principal Investigator: Lars Andersson

The principal investigator is proposing to do research on problems relevant to
Lorentzian Geometry, General Relativity and Riemannian Geometry. The main focus
of his research, the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations, interacts deeply
with each of these areas. Among the topics considered in this proposal are
global stability of cosmological models, the theory of marginally trapped
surfaces and dynamical horizons, and the structure of cosmological
singularities. Andersson will attempt to prove that in the case of spacetime
dimension at least eleven, there are families of vacuum cosmological models
which are globally stable, with quiescent singularity. In the 3+1 dimensional
case, similar results are expected to hold for the Einstein-scalar field
equations. Andersson and collaborators have recently been able to apply
techniques developed in the theory of minimal surfaces to the case of stable
marginally trapped surfaces, which play the role of apparent horizons in general
relativity. Andersson plans to pursue the connection between marginal surfaces
and minimal surfaces in his future research, and to apply these techniques also
to dynamical horizons. In addition to the above topics, Andersson proposes a
program of research using analytic and numerical techniques, directed towards
investigating the asymptotic behavior of general inhomogenous cosmologies near
the singularity.

The Einstein equations describe the geometry of spacetime, which in turn
determines the motion of bodies (planets, stars, galaxies) in space, as well as
the dynamics of fields and particles via their respective field theories. The
geometric view of the universe provided by the Einstein equations has led to
some of the most fundamental and paradoxical features of our picture of the
universe, including the initial spacetime singularity or Big Bang and black
holes. The mathematical study of spacetimes in extreme conditions such as near
the Big Bang singularity or near the singularity in black holes has led to a far
reaching conjecture called ``Cosmic Censorship'', which implies that phenomena
which violate the intuitive notions of causality must be hidden (censored) from
observers. In this project, problems related to cosmic censorship are studied
using a combination of computer based and analytical techniques, with a
particular focus on the evolution of geometry from initial conditions.
