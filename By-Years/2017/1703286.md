Observations of atmospheric processes are vitally important to unraveling the
complexities of weather and climate. In this award for conference support,
students attending the 2017 American Meteorological Society's (AMS) Annual
Meeting will be tasked with attending talks to collect data on the observations
that are needed to advance the science. While it is not a comprehensive survey
of the community, it is a large cross-cut that will provide scientists,
government agencies, and policy-makers an additional data point when considering
where observational needs are not being met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme for
the 2017 AMS Annual Meeting is "Observations Lead the Way". Special sessions
have been convened to discuss observations and each of the speakers throughout
the meeting have been asked to discuss what observations would best help move
their scientific studies forward. This award will provide support for a large
number of students to attend these sessions and then report their findings back
to the AMS program committee. The committee will then bring the data together
and disseminate the information through a journal article and documents for
funding agencies and policy makers.
