The Brookfield Zoo, operated by the Chicago Zoological Society, will develop a
participatory exhibition on avian anatomy, physiology, behavior and ecology, "Be
a Bird", whose overall goal is to bring biology to life with participatory
exhibits in a zoo setting. The Brookfield Zoo will design and construct a
permanent exhibition that uses discovery learning concepts to improve visitor
understanding of birds and to motivate visitors to observe avian behavior in
their everyday lives. Accompanying evaluation activities will contribute to a
better understanding of informal education methods in zoos.
