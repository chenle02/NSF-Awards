This project brings current FT-NMR technology to science and non-science majors
at Huntington College. Students in general chemistry courses will be introduced
to the theory and use of NMR through demonstrations. Hands-on use of the
instrument and analysis of spectra is initiated in the organic course and
continues throughout the remainder of the curriculum. Two-dimensional
techniques, such as COSY and HETCOR, provide students with the training and
experience required for industrial employment or graduate school. The NMR
spectrometer improves the scope of undergraduate research and sparks interest in
science. The project enhances the education and training of faculty and students
from local colleges in special courses. This expands the impact of the project
on a wider audience which includes underrepresented groups. The project is
evaluated by feedback from participating colleges, the number of students in
courses and undergraduate research projects, formal presentations, publications,
and surveys of faculty and students. Dissemination is occuring through
presentations, publication, the Web, and interactions with educators at
scientific meetings. *
