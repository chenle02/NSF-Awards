The goal of this project is to provide travel support for students to attend the
IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing to be held in May 29-31, 2017
in Hong Kong. The conference includes papers on many technologies that are
fundamental to the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program and the smart systems
aspect of the Partnership For Innovation: Broadening Innovation Capacity
(PFI:BIC) program, including smart and connected communities, pervasive
computing, and social computing. This project will fund 20 students to attend
the conference, and a selection committee and process will be used to choose
from potential invitees.

The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important
networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in
conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have
strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and
cyber-physical system experts.
