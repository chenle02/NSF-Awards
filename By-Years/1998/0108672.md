The research is for the development of mathematical and numerical models for the
full numerical simulation of jetting phenomena. The principal investigators
develop new mathematical and numerical models for phase change, vapor bubble
formation, vapor bubble collapse, and "explosive evaporation." New numerical
methods for including compressibility in low speed flow are being developed. The
resulting models are cast in an adaptive mesh framework in order to gain in CPU
runtime and memory efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program, the
numerical simulation of jetting devices, unravels basic physical mechanisms
underlying the jetting processes. This leads to improvement in design of
microscale jetting devices. The simulation substantially reduces the design
cycle period of such devices as ink-jet printers, soldering, and the application
of DNA strands.&lt;br/&gt;
