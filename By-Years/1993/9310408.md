9310408 Abraham-Shrauner Analytic solutions for the evolution equation of the
etched surface of a semiconductor are proposed as a exciting advance.
Calculations of the shape of the etching surface for both radical and ion-
assisted etching in simple models are feasible in analytic form. The specific
model is for etching of a trench on semiconductor such as silicon. Lie group
methods for finding the symmetries of nonlinear differential equations will be
used to expand the possible class of analytic solutions. These solutions will
not only complement numerical simulations of etched surface evolution but in
many cases will provide the user with easy expressions that can be quickly
applied to the particular etching process. The electric fields due to local
charging, chiefly differential charging, will be calculated by finite element
analysis with the computer program Maxwell. The deflection of the ion
trajectories by the local electric fields will be compared with another
mechanism for the distortion, the exclusion of thermal ions with non-normal
trajectories by the acceptance solid angle of the trench. *** v s t osed a a $ $
