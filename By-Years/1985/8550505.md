This project proposes a diversified plan to promote the professional development
of teachers and to raise the quality of teaching. Twenty science and mathematics
teachers from junior and senior high schools in Tennessee will participate each
year. The project will coordinate with and complement the State of Tennessee's
Career Ladder Program. Participating teachers will engage in full-time energy-
related research for eight weeks during the summer. The summer program will
include weekly workshop sessions designed to provide the opportunity to develop
resource materials and to explore creative ways to enrich the teaching of
precollege science and mathematics. To reinforce and encourage implementation of
the most important aspects of the summer research participation workshop
programs, the following complementary academic-year activities are planned:
Academic-Year Forums. Six forums will be held during the academic year. The
forums will involve teachers who participate in the summer program, other
science and mathematics teachers, and students. Science Mentor Visitations
Program. The research scientists who supervise the summer research participants
will make visits and given presentations, assist students and teachers in
laboratory experiments and research projects, and provide other help in their
areas of expertise. Scientist Lectures Program. Scientists from the U.S.
Department of Energy Laboratories in Oak Ridge and from other facilities will
visit area schools to present lectures and laboratory demonstrations. Teacher
Bootstrap Program. Teachers who participate in the summer program will serve as
in-residence resource teachers and will be encouraged to make presentations and
to demonstrate their knowledge and experience.
