The principal investigators will develop the method of 3d electron
crystallography for routine analysis of mineral structures from high resolution
electron micrographs. They will initially study rhombohedral carbonates,
calcium-aluminum pyroxene, and perovskite, as well as high-pressure phases
produced in the diamond anvil cell.
