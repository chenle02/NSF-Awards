The principal investigator will continue his research on singularities of the
n-body problem, especially the non-collision singularities and the relation
between collision singularities and non-collision singularities. He will also
work on some special solutions of the n-body problem which arise from an
analysis of the final evolution of the gravitational system. This award will
support research in the general area of dynamical systems. A process which is
very simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely complicated,
nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study of
this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best be modeled
using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence, complex
biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
