The project studies conformal geometry, the study of the set of angle-preserving
transformations on a space, particularly in conjunction with the correspondence
between general relativity of anti-de Sitter type and conformal field theory in
theoretic physics. This is a very important and fundamental area in the subjects
of differential geometry and mathematical physics. There has been substantial
progress in conformal geometry that is motivated by this correspondence with
theoretic physics. As a consequence of these projects, more interactions between
mathematics and physics will be brought out, thereby achieving better
understanding of geometric structure of low dimensional spaces.

Fefferman and Graham's seminal paper in the 1980s developed an ambient space
approach to study local scalar invariants for conformal geometry and empowered
the partial differential equation approach to the study of conformal geometry.
The renewed interests in such a construction have surged recently, particularly
after the interaction of the correspondence between general relativity of anti-
de Sitter type and conformal field theory in theoretic physics. To develop a
mathematical foundation for this correspondence in the spirit of Fefferman and
Graham requires the study of conformally compact Einstein manifolds and various
mathematical interpretations of such a correspondence. The most fundamental
question on the existence of conformally compact Einstein manifold for a given
conformal manifold as the prescribed conformal infinity remains largely open.
The project will investigate the general compactness property for conformally
compact Einstein manifolds, which will lead to more general existence theory.
Furthermore, the project will develop an ambient space approach to studying the
conformal geometry of submanifolds in the spirit of Fefferman and Graham.
