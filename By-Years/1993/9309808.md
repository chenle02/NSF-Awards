9309808 Glaeser The purpose of this project is to use evidence from U.S. cities
to test modern growth theory and use modern growth theory to understand the
successes and failures of American cities. Much of modern growth economics has
pointed toward education, knowledge, and the coordination of talent as engines
of productivity expansion. Forceful arguments and cross-national evidence stress
that the "external" effects of education are critical to economic expansion.
Schooling seems to raise productivity not only for those who receive it, but
also for those who live close to the well educated. This research uses evidence
for American cities to (1) further test for the existence of these external
effects, (2) test the manner in which these effects operate and (3) determine
the magnitude of these forces. The methodology involves using both individual
level data from the census and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and city level
data. Ultimately, the goal is to get an idea about how intellectual spillovers
work to enhance productivity and how policy can use these spillovers to speed
U.S. growth. ***
