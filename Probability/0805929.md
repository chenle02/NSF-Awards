Two fundamental phenomenons in probability theory are typical behaviors such as
expected values, laws of large numbers and central limit theorems, and rare
events such as extremely big or small values. This research centers on
developing methods and theory for the study of both typical behaviors and rare
events of the type that positive random quantities take smaller values. The
major objective is to extend the understanding of five related areas and build a
general small value theory based on systematic study of various techniques and
applications. The isoperimetric type Gaussian inequalities provide comparisons
between dependent (complected) structure and independent (simpler) one which
becomes an equality in certain (possibility limiting) cases. They have been used
as basic tools in various problems and played a crucial role in deeper
understanding of random phenomenon. The recent development of several new
techniques for Gaussian and closely related random processes broadened our
understanding of small deviation probabilities and their connections with
related topics of probability such as Gaussian random matrices, non-intersection
exponents and random assignments.In turn, it suggests many further questions
connected to applications in probability theory and geometric functional
analysis. The very successful applications to lower tail probabilities, zeros of
random functions and the first exit times will be expanded to a detailed study
of Brownian pursuit models and Gaussian chaos.

This research has a broader impact on diverse areas of probability, which is
both a fundamental way of viewing the world and a core mathematical discipline.
The theory of Gaussian (bell curve) processes is of fundamental importance in
probability and statistics. Its development is centered on applications of the
existing methods to a variety of fields and new techniques and problems
motivated by current interests of advancing knowledge. The proposed research is
a key step in the investigator's long term research plan of systematically
developing new Gaussian methods geared for applications to closely related
random processes. This research benefits both undergraduate and graduate
education and research. Many open problems and results from the proposed study
can be used as students course projects. It can stimulate the interests of
students in leaning and studying probability theory. This research should
improve our understanding of important random events and provide basic tools for
the study of our random environment.
