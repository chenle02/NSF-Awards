Science for Science Teachers features a four-week summer institute for 50
underprepared middle school/junior high school science teachers. The topics to
be treated are representative of all the major science disciplines. There is a
strong emphasis on laboratory experiences. The staff of the project include
university research scientists and high school science teachers, all of whom
have participated in similar programs during three previous years. Distinguished
guest lecturers are used frequently. Instructional materials, both reading
matter and laboratory apparatus, have been developed and tested in earlier years
and are now available for use during the 1988 summer institute and in the
classrooms of participants in subsequent years. The participants are drawn from
all parts of the United States. They maintain contacts with each other and with
project staff through newsletters and reunions that are arranged in connection
with National Science Teachers Association meetings. Strong group rapport has
been characteristic of this project in previous years. Costs of the project are
shared by the Lawrence Hall of Science and the participants' home institutions.
These contributions total 8% of the amount invested by the National Science
Foundation.
