The brain is especially vulnerable to damage in the neonatal and early fetal
period. Early brain damage can lead to a bewildering variety of behavioral
problems. Damage early in development does not necessarily cause the same
effects as damage in adulthood. Dr. Berger Sweeney has developed a novel model
system for studying the effects of early brain damage. She has found that
lesions of an important nucleus in the forebrain the nucleus basalis of Meynert
(nBM) cause unusual cellular formations in the sensori motor cortex in adulthood
and have severe deficits in spatial navigation. She hypothesizes that the
behavioral and morphological effects are due to transient depletion of
cholinergic afferents to the cortex. She will now determine whether the affected
behaviors are ones known to be dependent on cholinergic function or whether the
deficits are due to some more nonspecific effect of the early lesion. She will
also attempt to reverse the effects of the early lesions by augmenting the
function of the depleted transmitter. The results will greatly strengthen our
understanding of the mechanisms by which early brain damage affects behavior and
may set the stage for developing effective therapies.***//
