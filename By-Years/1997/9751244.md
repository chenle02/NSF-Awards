The goal of the project is to set up a Quality Engineering Laboratory to teach
statistical methods to industrial and manufacturing engineering students with
the use of an integrated sequence of part fabrication and assembly (using some
purchased parts) exercises resulting in a final product, where students collect
relevant data at each stage and learn to use appropriate statistical methods to
improve the quality of the product. These exercises not only give students
hands-on experience in various manufacturing and measurement processes, but also
enable them to see applications of key engineering statistical methods in a
holistic way in the context of a single production process. The synergistic
effect of making parts, measuring them, and analyzing data statistically
enhances the understanding and appreciation of production methods as well as
statistical methods. The impact of this project goes beyond about 150 students
per year taking the engineering statistics courses. The new laboratory
represents a significant upgrade of the laboratory that was set up at the
beginning of this academic year and that has some basic experimental setups and
measurement instruments, but no fabrication facilities. These setups continue to
be used as necessary. *
