Movement is the result of coordinated activity in several areas of the central
nervous system. One of the important relay structures is the thalamic reticular
nucleus, which has connections both other motor thalamic nuclei and with
extrathalamic sites such as the cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. Drs.
Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky will study the connections of the reticular thalamic
nucleus by using methods for tracing neuronal circuitry. Neuronal and synaptic
organization will be analyzed at both light and electron microscopic levels. The
neurochemical characteristics of transmitter substances in the neurons of the
thalamic reticular nucleus will serve as markers to identify the extrinsic and
intrinsic connections of these nerve cells. These studies are important because
they will increase basic knowledge about motor system control.
