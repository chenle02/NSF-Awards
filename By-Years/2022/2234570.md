The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project will introduce an innovative and more
effective option to help large mRNA enter cartilage and joint tissues for a
variety of biomedical applications from therapeutics to research reagents. With
the recent success of COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics
have attracted substantial interest from both academia and the biopharmaceutical
industry. However, the delivery of large mRNA is still a major challenge. The
proposed platform technology presents many advantages over conventional delivery
vehicles. PhD students and undergraduates will receive training in technology
development and commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
will develop a delivery technology based on the innovative DNA-inspired Janus
base nanomaterials (JBNs) for large mRNA that addresses a critical market need
for applications in “difficult-to-penetrate” cartilage tissue for joint and
skeletal diseases. The delivery of large mRNA is still a major challenge. The
proposed platform technology presents many advantages over conventional delivery
vehicles such as lipid nanoparticles and polymers. This new technology has
superior ability to penetrate into cartilage and other joint tissues, has
significantly better endosomal escape ability than lipid nanoparticles, and has
significant lower cytotoxicity compared to cationic polymers and lipids due to
their noncovalent structures and DNA-mimicking chemistry. Furthermore, this new
delivery technology has tremendous versatility. Depending on the specific needs
of a customer, the technology can be tailored for different joint and skeletal
diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
