Funding is provided for the development a new instrument that combines the
measurement of bottom pressure (Pb), sea floor to sea surface acoustic travel
time (from Inverted Echo Sounder, IES), and motionally-induced electric fields
(from Horizontal Electrometer, HEM) into a single autonomous device. The goal is
to improve the HEM, and incorporate this sensor with ones for Pb and IES into an
instrument that is robust, easily deployed and recovered, long-lived,
inexpensive, and suitable for wide community usage. The proposed instrument will
provide long-duration, deep-ocean observations of the gravest vertical structure
of current fields and water properties (e.g., temperature, salinity, specific
volume anomaly) of the water column using solely seafloor instruments. Although
autonomous and deployable anywhere, either singly or in arrays, the
instrumentation will also be cable ready for possible installation on planned
undersea cabled ocean observatories.
