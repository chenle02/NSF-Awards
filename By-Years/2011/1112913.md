The overall description of the proposal is to study manifolds with positive or
more generally non-negative sectional curvature under the assumption of a large
isometry group. In past proposals the principal investigator has used this
approach to produce many new examples of non-negative curvature, including some
on exotic spheres. Recently he also constructed a new example of positive
curvature among an infinite family of candidates he discovered in previous
proposals, and found an obstruction to one of these candidates as well. The
principal investigator plans to study these candidates in more detail in the
hope of finding more examples of positive curvature. The new obstruction is
quite general and needs to be explored in more detail for actions with large
isometry group, for example polar actions. Its implications without the presence
of an isometric group action will be explored as well. There are many questions
of a more general nature within this subject of ``non-negative sectional
curvature with large isometry groups" that the principal investigator plans to
study. Finally, as was done in past proposals with success, studying topological
properties of new and known examples can be very difficult but also very
rewarding.

Manifolds with positive sectional curvature can be defined by the property that
the sum of the 3 angles in any triangle is larger than 180 degrees, i.e. their
geometry is similar to that of the round sphere. Global Riemannian geometry can
be described as relating local stretching and bending to the global shape of
space. Since the beginning of global Riemannian geometry, manifolds with
positive or more generally non-negative curvature have been an important part of
this subject. Nevertheless one still has few obstructions to the existence of
such geometries, especially if one wants to distinguish between those manifolds
that admit non-negative sectional curvature and those that admit positive
sectional curvature. Unfortunately one also has few examples with non-negative
curvature and even rarer are examples with positive curvature. It is thus of
paramount importance to construct new examples, one of goals of this proposal.
