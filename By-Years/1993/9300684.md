Benthic studies in the northern Bering Sea indicate that the Gulf of Anadyr cold
pool, which has apparently shifted over the past decade, has an important
influence on benthic community structure. This research will integrate benthic
studies of this feature with a recently completed appraisal of the importance of
the nearby St. Lawrence island polynya on benthic communities. This appraisal
indicated that there were significant differences in benthic biomass, sediment
respiration, tunicate cellulose oxygen-18 content, sediment lipid content, and
bottom chlorophyll values between nearshore benthic communities most directly
affected by the polynya, compared to the offshore benthos. These findings
indicate that the presence of the open-water polynya in the winter contributes
to benthic productivity south of St. Lawrence island. This work also suggested,
however, that the presence of the Gulf of Anadyr cold pool had an even more
important physical influence; it appears to be associated with the most
productive benthic communities (as measured by sediment respiration and benthic
biomass) in the northern Bering Sea. This research will conduct detailed studies
of the nearshore benthos southwest of St. Lawrence Island and within the Gulf of
Anadyr cold pool, with the goal of characterizing the influence of this feature
on ecosystem function in the Bering Sea benthos. Benthic production is extremely
important in the shallow Bering Sea, and more detailed knowledge of its role
will contribute significantly to our understanding of the Arctic marine
ecosystem.
