The purpose of this proposal is to support the inclusion of more researchers at
the Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC 2020) to be held in College Station
on February 6-7, 2020 . Research in the field of power and energy is imperative
for the future, as the nationâ€™s demand for power will only increase as new
technologies are developed. TPEC 2020 looks to be the starting ground for
students of all academic backgrounds to present their work to a larger
community. By providing travel grants to students, TPEC 2020 can provide an
opportunity for students with limited resources to meet other researchers, learn
about ongoing projects, and develop professional relationships for future
collaborations. TPEC 2020 also has both paper and poster sessions, the poster
sessions providing undergraduate students the opportunity before graduate school
to present their current research. This exposure incentivizes undergraduates to
pursue their work further in graduate school. The proposed funding will assist
students from both graduate and undergraduate backgrounds pursue their work
further and enrich their research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TPEC 2020 is
primarily focused on student collaboration. A primary benefit of emphasizing
student participation is to promote their ability to collaborate on a variety of
research topics in the power and energy field. TPEC looks to advance research in
the fields of power systems, power electronics, renewable energy, and the energy
market as well as other relevant topics. Also included in the conference agenda
are keynote speakers, who will speak about cutting-edge research in the field of
power and energy, providing attendees insight into the latest
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
