The Twenty-Second Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
University from October 20-21, 2000. This colloquium series has become an
important regional meeting. It attracts participants primarily from the greater
Midwest probability community. It has a strong tradition of encouraging graduate
students and other young investigators to attend and interact with specialists.
