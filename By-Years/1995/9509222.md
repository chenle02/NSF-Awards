9509222 Middleton The primary structure of a family of proteins has been
identified as components of the rat colon epithelial sodium channel. The
coexpression of three homologous subunits, a, B, and g, in Xenopus laevis
oocytes results in the expression of a sodium current that is like that
described in the sodium transporting epithelia. Partial clones of each subunit
from Xenopus kidney mRNA have been obtained. The objectives of this research are
(1) to determine if the three clones encode renal sodium channels, and (2) to
determine if the clones are sufficient to produce sodium channel activity, and
whether all three are necessary for proper channel activity. Specifically,
antisense oligonucleotides will be used to suppress sodium channel expression in
A6 cells, a cell line derived from Xenopus kidney. Subunit specific antisense
oligonucleotides have been generated from the sequences of the partial clones.
The effectiveness of the oligonucleotides at suppressing protein expression will
be assessed by looking at target mRNA and protein levels with Northern and
Western analysis, respectively. Protein levels will be ascertained by Western
analysis, and the suppression of sodium channel activity will be determined
electrophysiologically. %%% The importance of epithelial sodium transport in
maintaining proper organismic sodium levels is very clear. Understanding the
structural correlates of function of the epithelial sodium channel will lead to
a better understanding of sodium transport and its regulation. This research
will determine whether a family of proteins encoded by three Xenopus clones
represents the sodium channel responsible for regulated sodium transport in the
distal nephron. It will be a first step in the investigation of structure-
function relationships of the epithelial sodium channel. ***
