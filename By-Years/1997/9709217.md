This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Miami acquire a
scanning probe microscope (SPM). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) monolayers of fullerene
derivatives, (2) electrochemistry of supramolecular systems, (3) Langmuir and
Langmuir-Blodgett films, (4) scanning probe microscopic studies of triazine-
barbiturate hydrogen bonded self-assembled complexes, and (5) chemical and
enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides-diacetylene lipid conjugates. The
scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms directly. The
technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely
sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is
small enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the gap and generate a
minute current. As the gap between the tip and the sample increases, the current
decreases. As then probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth across its
surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The AFM is
used in the control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits
