This proposal seeks support for a two-year project to investigate the complex
but systematic variation of earthquake activities near plate interfaces in
Wadati-Benioff zones. In particular, we plan to characterize the nature of a
notable number of predominantly normal faulting events that cannot be accounted
for by slip on the interplate thrust zone. The depth and mechanism of
approximately 100 moderate- sized earthquakes that are shallower than 100 km in
major subduction zones will be precisely determined by inverting the long-period
P and SH waves at teleseismic distances and by identification of surface
reflections from short-period seismograms. We anticipate delineating the
position of the plate interface and the seismicity near it in some detail. The
results will then be combined with a compilation of source parameters for events
in the outer-rise region and intraplate seismicity downdip from the interface.
We seek to clarify the possible association of thrust and normal faulting events
near the plate interface, the nature of the transition from interplate to
intraplate seismicity at intermediate depths, and the connection between
intraplate seismicity in the outer-rise region, beneath the plate interface, and
beyond the interface in the downdip direction. The ultimate goal of the
synthesis is to identify constraints that can be placed upon the state of stress
both on the plate interfaceand the subducted lithosphere by the source
parameters of earthquakes. We believe that the proposed study would provide
enough data to at least qualitatively address several important questions. For
instance, if the occurrence and mechanism of events below the plate interface
can be correlated with plate tectonic parameters that are believed to control
the seismic coupling of the interplate zone, then these events might provide
information about the zone both occur, the transition of the strain field within
the slab from lithospheric bending seaward of trenches to unbending at
intermediate depths will be investigated.
