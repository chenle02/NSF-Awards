Description: This project supports travel of twelve U. S. scientists to an
international conference on " Algebraic Groups and Applications" to be held at
the University of Hyderabad, India. Topics to be covered include: 1. Finite
dimensional group; 2. Infinite dimensional groups and 3. General surveys. The
conference will be for 10 days with 6 lectures per day. Participants are
expected from the U. S., the U. K., France, U.S.S.R., Japan, the Netherlands,
Switzerland and from Italy in addition to Indian lecturers and graduate
students. The lectures are expected to be published as a book or as a special
volume of a journal. Scope: The conference has two main objectives: to present
state of the art in the area of algerbraic groups to young scientist and
students in India, and to to provide a forum for exchange of information and
ideas between Indian, U. S. and other scientists; and to consider areas for
further research to be done jointly or independently. These objectives are
expected to be met through the well planned conference and the excellent
selection of participants. The meeting is expected to increase U.S.-Indian
collaboration in the field of mathematics.
