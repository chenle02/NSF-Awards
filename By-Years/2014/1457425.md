This award to the National Academies will provide partial support for the core
activities of the Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy (COSEPUP).
COSEPUP has a charge 'to deliberate on initiatives for new studies in the area
of science and technology policy, taking especially into account the concerns
and requests of the President's Science Advisor, the Director of the NSF, the
Chairman of the National Science Board, and the chairmen of key science and
technology-related committees of the Congress.' Its work has addressed issues of
critical importance to Federal Agencies and the Nation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key issues that COSEPUP is addressing or has recently
addressed include maintaining the excellence of human resources for U.S. science
and engineering research, promoting effective management of U.S. federal
research investments, and ensuring research integrity and the responsible
conduct of research. Since its inception, the National Science Foundation has
supported COSEPUP activities. This award will provide funds for core support of
COSEPUP, to continue its work as an independent advisor on issues relating to
national science and technology policy.&lt;br/&gt;
