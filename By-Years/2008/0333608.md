Florida Tech proposes to connect to Abilene/Internet2 to ultimately provide
Gigabit service to the desktop of each faculty and student. The internal network
has full Gigabit capabilities to all major nodes. The external access to the
Internet has expanded over the last three years and the next step in network
connectivity is to gain access to Internet2. The award will permit Florida Tech
to connect either through the Southern Crossroads Gigapop at Georgia Tech or
through Florida International University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three initial
areas were targeted as research candidates requiring advanced networking:
Astronomy, Meteorology, and Physics. Florida Tech astronomers are currently
remotely controlling a fully automated telescope located at Kitt Peak National
Observatory in Arizona in real time. Meteorologists are developing models of
weather behavior from massive data sets that must be down-loaded from national
databases for analysis on the NSF funded 48 node parallel processing systems at
Florida Tech. The advanced connection will enhance modeling associated with
NASA's Earth Science Application Modeling as well as proposed new
interdisciplinary modeling initiatives which couple land-air-sea remote sensing
data. The High Energy Physics research group must have direct access to enormous
quantities of real-time data collected at the supercollider at CERN, the
European Center for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland and the Brookhaven
National Laboratory, (RHIC).
