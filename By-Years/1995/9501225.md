This award supported travel expenses for student participants in CONCUR '95 --
the Sixth International Conference on Concurrency Theory, held August 21-24,
1995, in Philadelphia on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. The
purpose of CONCUR '95 was to bring together researchers, developers, and
students from academia, industry, and government so that the science of
concurrency theories and the technology of their applications can be advanced.
The conference spans all areas of semantics, models, logics, and verification
techniques for concurrent systems. Particular topics include, but are not
limited to, process algebras, Petri nets, true concurrency, shared-memory and
message-passing formalisms, operational and denotational semantics, programming
language semantics, concurrent logic and constraint programming, fairness,
temporal logics, compositional analysis techniques, model checking, verification
tools, and applications. The primary goal of holding CONCUR '95 in the U.S. was
to increase participation by American researchers in the area, and to encourage
interaction among the various schools, both European and American, that have
worked towards formal approaches to concurrency.
