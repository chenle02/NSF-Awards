Fritz 9707689 Diatom species distributions are highly correlated with ionic
concentration (salinity) and lakewater anion composition, and it is these
correlations that form the foundation for the use of diatoms as tools for
climate reconstruction. However, the actual mechanisms behind these associations
are unknown. Salinity may influences diatom physiology directly, by exerting an
osmotic stress, or salinity may interact with other factors and thus indirectly
affect species composition. Nutrient concentration and ratios frequently control
primary production and algal community structure in lacustrine systems, and in
saline lakes salinity and anion composition may influence nutrient availability
to primary producers, as well as nutrient requirements and uptake by diatoms.
Thus here we propose a series of laboratory experiments to test the effect of
salinity and anion composition on the outcome of nutrient competition between
diatoms.
