Effective processes are of fundamental importance to
manufacturing,&lt;br/&gt;government, engineering, and management. In all of
these areas greater&lt;br/&gt;understanding and control of key processes can
lead to improved&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness. For the past 15 years, it has also
been recognized that&lt;br/&gt;processes are fundamental to software
development, and that effective&lt;br/&gt;control of processes can lead to
similar benefits, such as improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding, coordination,
efficiency, and automation. It has been hoped&lt;br/&gt;that this would lead to
reductions in software development cost,&lt;br/&gt;improvements in software
product quality, and reductions in software&lt;br/&gt;development time. Our
hypothesis is that progress towards these goals can&lt;br/&gt;be speeded by
establishing a scientific basis upon which to build the&lt;br/&gt;process
technologies that will support more effective software
production.&lt;br/&gt;This research project will lead to the development of
needed improvements&lt;br/&gt;to the Little-JIL process definition language, and
the Juliette&lt;br/&gt;interpreter. These improvements will be validated by
programming and&lt;br/&gt;running multiuser, iterative software design processes
that are effective&lt;br/&gt;in integrating the activities of humans and
computer automation. These&lt;br/&gt;processes should be of considerable value
in themselves. Their&lt;br/&gt;development, moreover, will sharpen and validate
the Little-JIL process&lt;br/&gt;language, resulting in clearer understandings
of the underlying&lt;br/&gt;requirements for effective process definition
languages.&lt;br/&gt;
