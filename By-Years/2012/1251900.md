This workshop will assemble a diverse group of scientists from around the world
for a 3 day meeting in December 2012 to assess the potential of modern "omics"
techniques to help unlock the genetic potential of crop wild relatives to
enhance the efficiency of crop improvement. Crop wild relatives are increasingly
recognized as critical to breeding efforts aimed at adapting agriculture to
climate change. Genomics has the potential to help us better understand and more
efficiently use wild relatives in crop improvement. This conference will provide
a forum for (a) exploring essential gaps in our understanding of diverse crop
wild relatives, (b) understanding the potential of genomics technologies to help
bridge those gaps, (c) exchanging information and sharing perspectives among a
diverse group of scientists, and (d) building an interdisciplinary network of
researchers interested in using genomics-based approaches to exploit the wealth
of genetic variation found in crop wild relatives. The workshop will help
strengthen interactions among scientists from both public and private sector
institutions so as to enhance global food security.
