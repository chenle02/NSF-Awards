This project is concerned with research in Lie theory. It will cover a broad
spectrum of topics in this field including representation theory of finite
groups of Lie type and associated algebraic groups in the natural
characteristic; the character theory of finite groups of Lie type; the structure
and geometry of groups of Lie type; and the geometry of orbits and connections
with Lie group representations. This project is in the general area of group
theory. A group is an algebraic object with a multiplication defined on it. Such
objects are important in many branches of mathematics and are becoming
increasingly important in other areas such as physics, chemistry and computer
science. This project provides funding that will enhance the quality and level
of research in this area by making possible certain collaborative efforts. It
will also provide funding for graduate students.
