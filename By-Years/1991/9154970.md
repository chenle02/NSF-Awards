Fairmont State College will initiate a three-week summer component, commuter,
Early Alert Initiative Young Scholars project in Mathematics and Physics which
will offer science enrichment activities for 36 precollege students entering
grades 7 and 8. This program will emphasize laboratory research participation.
Manipulatives, real-world problems, various calculators and computers will be
part of the "action" mathematics component. Career exploration experiences will
be provided with professional counselors, mathematicians, engineers and other
scientists both at Fairmont State College and three different sites, including
the Morgantown Energy and Technology Center and the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory at Green Bank.
