This research is centered on the design of efficient approximation algorithms
for a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems. The main goal is to
develop and isolate general techniques which lead to approximation algorithms,
to improve the currently best performance guarantees for several combinatorial
optimization problems and to develop efficient implementations for these
algorithms. During the past few years substantial progress has been made in
these directions; in particular, the development of a general approximation
technique based on a primal-dual approach which lead to the first and/or best
approximation algorithm for a variety of problems including the weighted
matching problem, the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem, the
generalized Steiner tree problem and the most general version of the graph
augmentation problem. This research has demonstrated the usefulness of linear
programming techniques in deriving approximation algorithms. Linear programming
is one of the main tools that is to be used in this project in order to derive
improved approximation algorithms.
