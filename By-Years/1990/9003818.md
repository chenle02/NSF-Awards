The major long-term objectives of the research of this laboratory are to define
the chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus, and thus gain a better understanding of
the factors that are responsible for pathogenicity, the manner by which
extrachromosomal elements contribute to it's characteristics, and to evaluate
the degree of diversity that exists within the genus Staphylococcus. The
specific aims of this proposed research are to (1) continue with the
characterization of the chromosome map of NCTC 8325 (phage group III) S. aureus,
(2) continue to characterize the chromosome maps of strains 112 (phage group I)
and Ps55 (phage group II), and their relationship to the NCTC 8325 map, (3)
develop and evaluate potentially useful mutations that should expand the
spectrum of useful approaches and flexibility of genetic analysis in S. aureus,
(4) analyze the S. aureus chromosome for the presence of tandem genetic
duplications from the perspective of using them as an aid in chromosome mapping,
and (5) initiate the development of the necessary mapping techniques to develop
genetic/physical chromosome maps of representative coagulase-negative
staphylococci.//
