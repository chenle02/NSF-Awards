The international conference "FDIS 2013: Finite Dimensional Integrable Systems,"
to be held at the International Center of Mathematical Meetings in Marseille,
France, July 15-19, 2013, will focus on recent advances in finite dimensional
integrable systems and present new directions of research. Integrable systems
with a finite number of degrees of freedom is the most classical part of the
theory of integrable systems. Due to the seminal contributions of Kolmogorov,
Arnold, Moser, and many others, this subject is experiencing a revival.
Recently, new powerful method for working with integrable systems have been
developed based on a deep interplay between different branches of mathematics
and physics: complex analysis, symplectic geometry, Lie theory, representation
theory, theory of cluster algebras, discrete differential geometry, and computer
algebra. As a result, new integrable systems have been discovered, new
applications of integrable systems in physics and geometry were unveiled, and
many questions explicitly asked in the classical period have been
answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-linear ordinary and partial differential
equations describe a large number of physical phenomena, ranging from mechanics,
fluid mechanics, optics, magnetism to general relativity, and also many natural
and interesting geometrical problems. One of the most effective methods to
handle them is related to the so called integrable systems, which is, roughly
speaking, a collection of methods for finding exact solutions of certain
systems, or to analyze the behavior of their solutions without knowing them
explicitly. The conference will feature about 20 talks by the leading experts
and will provide a venue for junior researchers to network, to interact with
senior researchers, and to foster new collaborations.
