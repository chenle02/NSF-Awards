Three investigators will study problems interrelating the geometry and topology
of finite dimensional manifolds with analytic, algebraic, and geometric
properties of various function spaces that arise in the study of ordinary and
partial differential equations on these manifolds. One investigator will study
symmetry groups of a variational problem and the geometry of their associated
sections and slices. The second will investigate the Grassmannian structures of
the solution to integrable systems and the related Painleve analysis of these
structures. And the third will analyze the relationship between the Laurent
solutions to integrable systems and the geometry of their invariant tori. These
three investigators will extend theories involving the geometry and algebra of
certain integrable systems. One example of such systems are Hamiltonian
differential equations which model the physical behavior of moving objects.
These incorporate conservation of energy and momentum in an elegant manner.
Solutions to these systems tend to circulate and don't have many of the
properties of systems which incorporate friction.
