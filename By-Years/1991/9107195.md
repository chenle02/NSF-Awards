This research constitutes the first comprehensive study of interactions between
neotropical red mangroves, Rhizophora mangle, and epibionts that live on its
aerial roots. Mangroves cover&gt;75% of sheltered tropical coastlines. studies
of these ubiquitous communities will expand our understanding of the structure
and maintenance of these coastal systems, and clarify how such process may be
altered by the organisms themselves. This research also should elucidate
hitherto unappreciated direct and indirect interactions between trees and
benthic invertebrates. This project specially seeks to foster undergraduate
training and participation in tropical research. The research program will
expand upon four years of work in the extensive mangal of Belize, Central
America. Epibionts will be selectivity removed and added to roots of seedlings,
sapling, and mature trees. Effects of these treatments on surviorship, stem and
root growth, leaf production, and rootlet proliferation will be monitored. The
project will investigate mechanisms by which epibionts influence tree growth,
and will determine whether sponges are involved in nitrogen fixation for
mangroves. The research will further assess if epibionts alter the rate of
sediment accretion under saplings and matures trees, thereby influencing mangal
ontogeny. Knowledge of processes that structure and maintain mangal will inform
the wise use and conservation of these widespread communities.
