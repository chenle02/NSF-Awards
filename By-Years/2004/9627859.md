96-27859 Hager Abstract The PI proposes to use his newly developed modeling
method to understand the postglacial rebound problem and its implications for
sea level change. This modeling effort will use both forward and inverse
techniques and will determine the possible trade-offs among acceptable ice
models and acceptable mantle viscosity models and will determine the resulting
range of changes in relative sea level due to Pleistocene deglaciation. These
models will include ice history and mantle viscosity structure in their
parameterization, and will be constrained and tested using physical observations
including VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry), GPS (Global Positioning
System), and traditional geological data. ***
