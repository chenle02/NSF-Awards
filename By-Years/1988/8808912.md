The research is in the area of crystallization and precipitation of sparingly
soluble salts to develop expertise in the study of the precipitation and
processing of ceramic powders. The programs is complemented by collaboration
with staff at Sandia National Laboratories in the development of novel
experimental techniques. The objective of the research program is to develop a
fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in the precipitation of
ceramic precursor powders for the manufacture of electronic components. The
electronic properties of ceramics are critically dependent on the chemical and
physical properties of the precursor powder. Precipitation from solution is
proposed as the chemical method for obtaining the desired powder properties. In
order to fully exploit this type of processing and control the end use
properties of the ceramic, the mechanisms of precipitation are studied. The
focus of the work is on the preparation of doped zinc oxide powders for ceramic
varistors, but the techniques and analyses developed may be generally applied to
other compounds and other ceramic material types.
