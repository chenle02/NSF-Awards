TEAMS, an exhibit collaborative of seven small science museums, will collaborate
with academic researchers to expand knowledge about learning in informal science
environments and will apply that knowledge to the creation of eight (two copies
of four topics) traveling science exhibitions suitable for small museums and
science centers. The research investigations build on recent findings about the
nature of socio-cultural learning in museums. This close working collaboration
among researchers, museum evaluators and museum exhibition designers provides an
innovative opportunity to examine a model for rapid transfer of research
knowledge into museum practice. Through this collaborative effort the project
builds capacity within the seven small museums, helping address the larger
problem of under-served audiences in rural areas. One component of the research
supports design guidelines to increase effectiveness for girls visiting STEM
exhibitions.
