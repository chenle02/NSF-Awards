This project will enhance undergraduate laboratory experiences for students at
the University of New England by incorporating fluorescence spectroscopy into
several courses and research experiences offered for Chemistry, Biology, Marine
Biology and Environmental Science students within the Division of Life Sciences.
The analytical applications of fluorescence are growing dramatically because of
its sensitivity and applicability to problems of environmental and clinical
importance and will be exploited in Quantitative Analysis, Instrumental Methods,
Biochemistry/Cell Biology and Marine Biology/Oceanography laboratories. Examples
of analyses to be performed include the determination of pharmaceutical
components, pollutants in natural waters, chlorophyll in plant materials and
fluorescent markers for monitoring phytoplankton and water mass migration. The
technique's increasing use in Biochemistry and Cell Biology will be illustrated
in, among other applications, probing intracellular ion transport mechanisms.
More fundamental applications will be introduced in General Chemistry and
explored in detail in Instrumental Methods and Physical Chemistry. Fluorescence
immunoassay will become a component of the Immunology lab. Fluorescence will
also be used extensively for undergraduate research. The multidisciplinary use
of the proposed instrument will foster increased cooperative interactions
between Chemistry and Biology faculty and impress upon students the increasingly
interdisciplinary nature of modern science. The instruments will also be used by
University of Southern Maine students in Instrumental Methods and Physical
Chemistry courses.
