EIA-0103706&lt;br/&gt;Donald E. Thomas&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next Generation Software: A Computer System
Design Hierarchy for Simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer system design
requires reasoning about the interaction of software with the underlying models
of hardware resources without limiting such models to single system views.
Computer system elements and their interactions are not purely software-
functional or purely hardware-structural-they have properties of both. A
challenge in computer system design is to define the elements and the means of
resolving their interactions, so that software interacting with underlying
hardware resources can be modeled flexibly; alternate designs, ones with
different numbers and types of processors, network interconnections, and/or
software schedulers, may be easily considered.&lt;br/&gt;
