The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support from NSF to
connect seven of their member institutions of higher education to the Internet.
These include: Cumberland University, Lebanon, TN Manor Junior College,
Jenkintown, PA Martin Methodist College, Pulaski, TN Milwaukee Institute of Art
and Design, Milwaukee, WI Presentation College, Aberdeen, SD Urbana University,
Urbana, OH Wisconsin Lutheran College, Milwaukee, WI Each of the institutions
included will connect to the Internet using service providers in within their
respective areas. These institutions of higher education need the Internet
connections to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of
these institutions as well as the community in general. The award provides
partial support of the project for two years.
