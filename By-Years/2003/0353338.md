Travel Funds for the Involvement of Researchers in the 21st International
Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal
# 0353338&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. National
Committee for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the National Academies
proposes a travel grant program to assist researchers from the United States in
attending the 21st International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics,
August 2004, in Warsaw, Poland. International congresses provide a forum for
researchers from around the world to present and discuss recent research
findings and to define directions for future research work. They provide a
setting for exchanging ideas, cultivating working relationships, building
networks, and educating graduate students. Attendees are exposed to the latest
developments in theoretical and applied mechanics, interact with leaders and
pioneers in the field, strengthen their understanding of basic principles, and
establish a more personal relationship with their peers. The increased
involvement of all researchers, both junior and senior, from the United States
that this grant will enable will strengthen U.S. mechanics research and help
build the future of the discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
