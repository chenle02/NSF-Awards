This project is concerned with equations on varieties of finite monoids. Level
k of Straubing's hierarchy of aperiodic monoids can be parametrized in a natural
way giving a sequence of varieties of monoids. Eilenberg and Schutzenberger have
shown that varieties of monoids can be described in terms of equations. Simon
has given equational characterizations for the varieties which has been extended
by Blanchet-Sadri. One of the questions of this research project is to determine
equations describing other varieties. The study of equations on certain
varieties is closely related to the study of Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games, and
sequential functions and the wreath product. These equational formulations can
be applied to problems in language theory.
