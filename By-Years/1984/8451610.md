A three-pronged research effort will be initiated. Four projects in three
categories, genetic algorithms, classifier (rule-learning) systems, and fluid
pipeline simulation and control, will be undertaken. The role of dominance
operators in genetic algorithms will be studied to demonstrate their importance
in non-stationary environments; extensions to classifier systems will be studied
to enhance their rule-learning capability when applied to dynamic system
control; stochastic interpolations in time will be studied as a new numerical
solution technique for hyperbolic partial differential equations with possible
efficiency and accuracy advantages; and a pipeline operations laboratory will be
established at the University of Alabama with its first project targeted at
advanced pipeline simulation.
