Professor Snapper's research focuses on synthetic and mechanistic studies of
metal catalyzed alkylidene metathesis reactions. The scope of the ring-opening
cross metathesis of strained cycloalkenes will be examined, and both improvement
of the stereoselectivity of this process and development of enantioselective
cross metathesis reactions will be explored. Asymmetric syntheses using
substrate control, by means of chiral tetraenes, and reagent control, through
use of chiral Ru complexes, will be examined. A conceptually related
photo/thermal (2+2)/retro(2+2) cyclization pathway will also be investigated.
Professor Snapper will develop an undergraduate research course, assemble
outreach programs that will provide chemistry demonstrations and laboratory
equipment to local schools, and initiate a program designed to improve the
teaching, speaking, writing, and organizational skills of graduate students.
With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and
educational activities of Professor Marc L. Snapper of the Department of
Chemistry at Boston College. Professor Snapper's research is directed toward the
use of a metal catalyzed reaction of compounds containing carbon-carbon double
bonds, the so-called olefin metathesis reaction, to effect the formation of
various types of organic products. By variation of the specific structures used
in this reaction, Professor Snapper is able to prepare compounds which may serve
as convenient starting points for the synthesis of more complex molecules of
relevance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Professor
Snapper's educational activities involve enhancing the research experiences of
undergraduates, facilitating the interest of high school students in chemistry
through outreach programs, and improving the teaching and communication skills
of graduate students.
