A microcomputer teaching lab is established and equipped with hardware
permitting the instructor to control all student workstations and thereby lead
the students through the early steps of problem solving exercises. Upon reaching
a level of experience and confidence, the students use the network to access Sun
workstations using DOS and X-Windows. Video records of data analysis and
simulation runs provide an excellent medium for communicating basic
transportation analysis skills to undergraduate civil engineers. In addition to
permitting laboratory exercises to be conducted in an innovative and superior
learning environment, the facility provides a location for student
experimentation with innovative equipment and exposure to new traffic control
and analysis systems.
