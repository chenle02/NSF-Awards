The investigator studies the dynamics of certain classes of&lt;br/&gt;integro-
differential equations that arise in models of cortex. He&lt;br/&gt;examines how
recurrent activity terminates due to any of several&lt;br/&gt;effects such as
synaptic depression, depolarization block, and&lt;br/&gt;after-
hyperpolarization. He also considers how recurrent&lt;br/&gt;connections lead to
bistability and under what conditions this is&lt;br/&gt;sufficient to produce
localized spatial states, wave fronts, and&lt;br/&gt;pulses. He uses methods of
averaging and bifurcation theory to&lt;br/&gt;derive and analyse simplified
dynamics from these models. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical results explain a variety
of experimental findings&lt;br/&gt;in both normal and pharmacologically
manipulated neural tissue.&lt;br/&gt;These methods are applied to the Limax
procerebral lobe, the&lt;br/&gt;turtle olfactory bulb, and various cortical
slice preparations.&lt;br/&gt; Neurons, the main cells in the brain, are
responsible for&lt;br/&gt;processing inputs from the outside world and
converting this to&lt;br/&gt;motor actions. They communicate by producing spikes
that are&lt;br/&gt;propagated to different regions of the brain by chemicals
called&lt;br/&gt;transmitters. The nvestigator is interested in how
this&lt;br/&gt;electrical and chemical information moves from one part of
the&lt;br/&gt;brain to others. He uses simulations and mathematics to
derive&lt;br/&gt;equations and general principles about how this is
done.&lt;br/&gt;Experiments have shown that during some cognitive tasks,
certain&lt;br/&gt;groups of neurons fire synchronously. He is interested in
the&lt;br/&gt;conditions that are necessary to attain precise timing
between&lt;br/&gt;different groups of neurons. In order to study these, he
has&lt;br/&gt;developed mathematical software for the study of
complex&lt;br/&gt;biological and physical systems. As part of this project,
he&lt;br/&gt;continues to develop this software and to make it
widely&lt;br/&gt;available. The project also provides interdisciplinary
training&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for students and postdocs.
