Objective Due to diffraction, conventional lenses focus light to spots no
smaller than roughly half the wavelength. Optical antennas can overcome this
limit, spanning the mismatch between the wavelength of light and the dimensions
of nanostructures. The PI's goals are to demonstrate advanced optical antennas,
to educate graduate and undergraduate students in this growing field, and to
disseminate the results to the wider community.

Intellectual Merit The PI proposes to develop optical antennas with three
important new capabilities. 1). The PI proposes to demonstrate optical antennas
that can be optically switched. 2). The PI proposes to demonstrate surface
plasmon lasers based on optical antennas integrated with plasmonic collimators.
3). The PI proposes to demonstrate surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from
molecules adsorbed to optical antennas that are integrated with a gain medium.
The PI anticipates that significantly stronger SERS spectra will result due to
the gain counterbalancing metal loss.

Broader Impact There exists a move to chips that integrate multiple
photonic/plasmonic structures to function as a system. The proposed work will
contribute to this goal by introducing new capabilities to plasmonic devices.
The project integrates education and outreach with research. The PI will
incorporate results from the program into an optics course. The PI will train
undergraduate and graduate students. The project will therefore create not only
the science, but also the human infrastructure required for future advances.
Lastly, demonstrations to the public by the PI and his team will be made at
outreach events at local science museums.
