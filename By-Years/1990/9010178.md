By the year 1860, the criminal justice system transformed from a court-centered
system of public adjudication, dependent upon jury trials, to a police-centered
system of private adjudication, dependent upon guilty pleas. By 1914, the first
public and private defender agencies were established and the public relied more
and more on guilty pleas and non-trial dispositions. The dominant theoretical
perspective of most longitudinal research that, as trials became more complex
and as the number of criminal cases increased, guilty pleas began to dominate as
a means of facilitating the rapid disposition of the criminally accused. More
recent research suggests that plea capitulation and the abandonment of jury
trials have a much longer history than generally understood and that these
changes relate to structural factors at the very core of the criminal justice
process. This project will analyze the sociolegal context surrounding the
abandonment of jury trials. The research will trace the historical underpinnings
of the guilty plea system focusing on the structural factors which gave birth to
the system more than fifty years prior to the establishment of institutional
defense and the advent of modern case pressure. Through a detailed analysis of
New York City's prosecution files between 1800 and 1900, previously unstudied
trial transcripts, the Minute Book of the Court of General Sessions, and
biographies of lawyers who appeared in criminal cases, the study will provide
the first systematic account of the construction of criminal cases in the
nineteenth century with a focus on the method of disposition. The analysis will
explain how the ascendancy of the police in the evidence-gathering function and
an increase in adversariness among lawyers combined to eliminate jury trials and
to replace them with guilty pleas. The results of this research will increase
understanding of the reasons for change in the disposition of criminal cases
from one legal form to another. The analysis will consider whether the shift in
legal form occurred because of internalized responses to the growth of business
in courts or as a result of externally- generated pressures during a period in
which there was profound change in the structure of society and the role of the
state. Through such an historical analysis, important insights will be gleaned,
both theoretically and practically, for understanding the present criminal
justice system.
