This SBIR Phase II grant supports research and development of nuclear radiation
detectors fabricated from the semi- conductor material thallium iodide. Thallium
iodide has an extremely high photoelectric absorption efficiency for gamma
radiation and a large semiconductor bandgap. These properties render the
material an exciting candidate for specialized applications where small size,
high efficiency and relaxed environmental criteria rule out use of the available
materials. The research will develop techniques for producing ultra high purity
thallium iodide, building on promising steps in this director that were taken in
the Phase I project. Radiation detectors fabricated from thallium iodide would
have important advantages over existing detectors, for applications in nuclear
and particle physics research and in measurements important in industrial
processing control, and in nuclear medicine.//
