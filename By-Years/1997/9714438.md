This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of Notre
Dame supports the research of Professor Marya Lieberman. The research focuses on
crosslinking reactions applied to the synthesis and analysis of layered
materials. Initial studies are carried out with layered metal organophosphonates
and organophosphates, which consist of layers of metal phosphonate connected by
layers of organic spacer molecules. Each organic spacer is synthetically
modified to include a photochemically- or electrochemically-activated
crosslinker, whose function is to connect a known number of adjacent molecules
in a specific manner. The modified spacers are mixed with appropriate metal
salts to form layered materials. Activation of the crosslinker forms molecular
adducts trapped within the layered material. The study of crosslinking chemistry
leads to information on defects, structural rearrangements, and possible
metastable materials. This research advances fundamental understanding of the
synthesis and structure of layered materials by developing crosslinking
reactions as an analytical and a synthetic tool that can be applied to molecular
monolayers on surfaces and inside layered materials.
