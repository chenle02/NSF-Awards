The aim of this project is to provide a more realistic and challenging
experience in the process control lab by introducing a new class of control
experiments which use a flexible chemical process emulator. An emulator is a
combination of computer simulation and process equipment such that the inputs of
the simulation appear as physically-observed phenomena. Control valves move in
response to signals from a controller and liquid levels respond with any desired
kind of dynamic behavior. Use of the emulator is better than computer simulation
because the student observes a physical system and learns by doing. The emulator
can be programmed for either simple or complex dynamics. Consequently, it is
more versatile than conventional process control experiments. This adjustable
feature allows the assignment of individual problems to student groups working
on a capstone design project in process control.
