This grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program supports
studies of the factors that determine relative amounts of various chemical
fragments that are produced when a molecule decomposes after absorption of light
energy. This will contibute to the development of schemes to control product
formation in chemical reactions via design of coherent pulse sequences. The
project will involve the development of new theoretical methods for calculation
of wave packet propagation on bifurcating potential energy surfaces, a new and
promising method for the treatment of chemical dynamics. Applications will be
made to several systems of current experimental interest, including ozone,
methyl iodide, methylene iodide, and bromoiodomethane.
