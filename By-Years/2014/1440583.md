Polynomial systems arise naturally in many areas of human endeavor. These
include the modeling of tumor growth; the design of robotic devices; chemical
systems arising in areas ranging from combustion to blood clotting; assorted
problems in physics; plus many areas with mathematics. The solution of the
polynomial systems answers questions critical to these endeavors. This research
will be devoted to developing the next generation of Bertini, an open source
software package, which has been used successfully by many researchers on many
problems, which include all those mentioned above.

Bertini will be rewritten in C++ to be scriptable and modular, which will allow
it to be interfaced transparently with symbolic software. The new Bertini will
include tools allowing the user to construct and manipulate homotopies based on
the output of Bertini. A major focus of the research will be given to systems of
polynomials arising from the discretization of systems of differential
equations. The great challenge of these very large systems of polynomials is
balanced by the great potential impact new efficient and robust methods of
solution will have.
