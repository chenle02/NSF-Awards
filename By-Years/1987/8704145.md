The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student populations. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. Virginia State University will
use RIMI support to establish a laser physics research facility. The facility
will focus on the study of laser-induced damage mechanisms at semiconductor
surfaces and will investigate defects and deep levels in semiconductors using
wavelength modulation absorption spectroscopy. In addition, non-equilibriam
damage effects occurring in crystals (metals and semiconductors) in the
microsecond time range which are struck by powerful pulsed laser beams will be
studied using polarized positive muons from the Brookhaven National Laboratory
Alternating Gradient Synchrotron. Results from this project should expand the
existing knowledge base of laser-induced damage in semiconductors by the conduct
of research on gallium arsenide and silicon at subthreshold frequencies. The
investigators have done research at several national laboratories (Fermi,
Lawrence Livermore) and private sector laboratories (IBM, General Electric). The
Foundation has supported this project because minorities will have greater
opportunities to participate in meritorious laser research.
