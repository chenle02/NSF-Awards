ABSTRACT: EIA 0244604, Indiana Univ., Wm. Aspray, PI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
purpose of this project is to carry out a meta-analysis of the forty projects
funded in NSF's Information Technology Work Force (ITWF) program over its three-
year history. This analysis will compare, contrast, and consolidate the
knowledge of the ITWF projects with other research and implementation projects
in the IT workforce area. The final product is to be a report that provides
analysis that is planned to help guide further research on these topics, as well
as recommend actions to decision-makers (NSF and other local, state, and federal
agencies; policymakers at local, state, and federal levels; professional
societies; the academic community; and individuals desiring more productive
careers in the IT area).&lt;br/&gt;
