This program is automating the existing college observatory as part of a major
expansion of the astronomy offerings. This expansion also includes the
development and improvement of courses for both majors and non-majors, and a
significant increase in student astronomy research and outreach programs in the
surrounding community and at other schools. A unifying theme for student
observations is the study of variable and transient events. Variable and
transient events are a hallmark of astronomy at all wavelengths and on many time
scales. Three types of studies are being conducted: (1) a long-term supernova
search; (2) studies of known variable stars; and (3) studies of active burst
sources and supernovae, including searches for optical counterparts to gamma-ray
and x-ray bursts. A telescope with a flexible observing schedule and the ability
to respond rapidly to new events can be very useful for the discovery and study
of variable astronomical objects. The observatory is also being used in lower-
level classes. Such a facility is made significantly more efficient if the
observatory is automated in its operations, scheduling, data collection, and
data analysis. The automated facility includes a telescope and CCD camera, along
with a custom built automation control board interfaced to weather sensors, roof
control, and telescope control. Full development of an automated observatory is
being carried out over several years in a manner that is maximizing student
participation during implementation.
