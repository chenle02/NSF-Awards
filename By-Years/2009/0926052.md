This research addresses the question of how complex future robotic systems,
e.g., like humanoid assistive robots, can acquire, refine, and maintain a
variety of motor skills that enable them to operate autonomously in normal human
environments. Humans excel in their abilities to perform motor skills due to
various aspects, including i) imitation learning, which allows them to transfer
prior knowledge about a task from a teacher to a student, ii) trial-and-error
learning, which provides them with means to refine skills, iii) reactive
behaviors, which can deal with dynamic and stochastic environments, and iv)
compliant control, which is a basic mechanism for robustness against
disturbances and promotes safety to act amongst other humans. Understanding the
basic mechanisms of these abilities will lead to technological advances towards
truly autonomous robotic systems.&lt;br/&gt;Our technical work includes research
on modular representations of motor control in terms of movement primitives,
research on trial-and-error improvement of motor primitives and sequences of
motor primitives with trajectory-based reinforcement learning using novel
techniques from probabilistic reinforcement learning and path-integral
reinforcement learning, research on reactive behavior using direct coupling of
motor primitives to perceptual variables, and compliant control with the help of
operational space controllers that can be learned. Besides traditional benchmark
simulation studies, our evaluations will include the learning of motor skills
with a full-body humanoid robot, a system that significantly challenges the
scalability of our methods. &lt;br/&gt;
