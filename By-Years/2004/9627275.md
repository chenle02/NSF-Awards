CDA-9627275 Wegner, Peter Brown University Special Project: Research directions
in computing This grant provides partial support for an invitation-only workshop
on "Research Directions in Computing", developed by the ACM as a part of its
50th- anniversary year celebration. Goals of the workshop are to contribute to a
better understanding of computing research and its role in support of larger
economic and social issues. The workshop will examine the current status and
future directions of computing research, will involve approximately 100
participants, and will produce a set of working group reports. Its findings will
be made public through the working group reports, publications in major ACM
journals, and at least one panel at ACM '97. ***
