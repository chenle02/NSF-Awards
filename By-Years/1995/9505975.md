ABSTRACT: NCR-9505975, California Institute of Technology, "Coding Theory and
Applications", PI-McEliece: Three topics in modern coding theory are studied:
Trellis complexity of convolutional codes, subgroup subcodes of Reed Solomon
codes, and turbo-codes. The first involves a novel way of reducing the Viterbi
decoding complexity of a large class of convolutional codes, including many
codes currently used in practice (e.g. punctured convolutional codes and the
unit memory convolutional codes). This is a surprising spinoff of the large body
of recent work on the trellis complexity of block codes. The second considers a
new class of algebraic block codes, the class of "SSRS" codes, which promises to
break the "bottleneck" of Reed-Solomon codes, i.e. the restriction that the code
length be no more that the size of the code alphabet. Finally the new class of
"turbo-codes", recently introduced in France, will be studied. Turbo codes
represent the biggest single step forward in many years in high gain low
complexity coding. It is hoped to develop a credible theory to explain the
remarkable experimental results and enable the work to be pressed forward system
atically.&lt;br/&gt;************************************************************
