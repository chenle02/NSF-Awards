Neutron stars are the evolutionary end points of massive stars and are valuable
probes of matter under extreme conditions of density and magnetic fields.
Neutron stars with ages less than 10,000 years are extremely important for
studying physics of core collapse, the properties of matter at nuclear
densities, and the workings of astrophysical particle accelerators. Young
neutron stars are heterogeneous in their properties, and very hard to find.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Camilo and his group will undertake three
complementary searches for young neutron stars by a detailed analysis of
existing data from large-scale surveys at radio wavelengths. These data are the
most sensitive current probes of neutron stars, at least until the advent of the
next generation of radio telescopes. The goals of his work will be to obtain a
full picture of the properties of young neutron stars that power bright gaseous
nebulae, to determine the birthrate of a newly identified class of high magnetic
field young neutron stars, and to characterize the nature of transient radio
sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will also emphasize the
training of graduate students and the involvement of high school students and
teachers in frontline scientific inquiry, with a view toward increasing their
understanding and appreciation of science. The existing survey data will also be
made available to the wider astronomical community.
