The area of digital image and video compression and communications has seen
growing activity in recent years, including standardization efforts such as JPEG
and MPEG, and an increased number of current or proposed applications from Cable
or Satellite TV to videoconferencing and future multimedia services. This trend
will continue to create an incentive for new compression techniques that are
more efficient as well as better adapted to the particular transmission
environments. The main thrust of this research is to provide adaptive
compression techniques for video communications. Adaptive techniques are those
where encoders are capable of matching their encoding procedure to the local
characteristics of the source or the channel. Rate-distortion optimal solutions
and fast heuristic approximations are being obtained for some of the problems of
interest in video communications, such as bit allocation and rate control. A
novel scalar adaptive quantizer, close in spirit to arithmetic coding, is being
investigated. This new technique, combined with such popular quantization
techniques as trellis coded quantization, will be used in real encoding
situations. Convergence and asymptotic properties of this scheme are also being
studied. For variable channel situations where transmission resources are
shared, as in ATM networks for instance, rate constraints for each video
connection are being designed to enable good individual video quality as well as
efficient overall network utilization. This research is being carried out in the
Digital Video Communications research laboratory that is currently being set up
within the Signal and Image Processing Institute. Our main education goal is to
provide teaching in the area of signal, image and video processing. We will
introduce a digital video communications course, designed to cover material that
is specific of video compression including the relevant communications aspects,
and to provide hands-on experience for the students .
