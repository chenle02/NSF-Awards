The Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre (doing business as the Learning World
Institute), in collaboration with informal science education venues,
universities, and corporations in Chicago, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., is
organizing a set of three professional conferences and a web site to encourage
stronger national and local communities of practice around the application of
arts-based learning (ABL) to informal science education. Arts-based learning is
the instrumental use of artistic skills, processes, and experiences to foster
learning in non-artistic disciplines. The goal is to apply ABL to informal
science education in ways that can foster the acquisition of STEM skills that
are important in today's workforce.

The set of conferences, with a total attendance of 750, will focus on an
understanding of current and potential ABL applications to workforce skill
development, opportunities to practice ABL directly, and creation of a research
agenda on the impact of ABL on science education. The web site (funded through
other sources) will help conference attendees prepare for the workshops, provide
opportunities for networking, aggregate resources, and host the research agenda.
