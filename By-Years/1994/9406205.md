9406205 Daines The PI will investigate melt distribution and migration in
partially molten anorthosites using synthetic anorthosites in which a glass
phase with a composition approximating either a parental magma or a late-stage
differentiated melt has been added. Characterization will use optical, scanning
and transmission electron microscopy. The data obtained from these experiments
are critical for evaluating the efficacy of dynamic models proposed to account
for the formation of anorthosites and will provide insight into cumulate
maturation and magma chamber processes. ****
