This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
practical techniques for software reliability amplification. Reliability-
amplification occurs when some aspect of the software development process is
shown to complement reliability testing, in the sense that predictions of the
software failure rate are demonstrated to be pessimistic. The main objective of
this effort is to determine whether it is feasible to provide a framework for
"reliability amplification" as a new quantitative approach to software
validation that establishes statistical confidence in software quality. Since
reliability amplification rests on a failure-rate bound prediction, and there is
no plausible statistical model of software failure, theoretical work is
obviously required in this area. Two approaches are promising: (1) Study of the
software computation as opposed to the input/output behavior. The computation
contains full details of the internal software state, and may be an appropriate
home for a failure rate more plausible than one assumed for the input domain.
(2) Input subdomains homogeneous for failure. If it is not plausible that a
constant, failure rate exists across the input space, perhaps there is a
partition of that space in whose subdomains constant failure rates are more
believable. The results of this effort will be a report detailing the
feasibility of building a new software reliability framework that is based on
defect-removal methods as opposed to purely testing methods. Applications of
this research include defense, medical, aerospace, nuclear telecommunications,
and any other application requiring extremely high software reliability
assessments.
