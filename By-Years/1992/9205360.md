Controlled - environment chambers will be obtained for use in botanical studies.
Research by A.J. Shaw will investigate mechanisms of sex ratio determination in
natural populations of bryophytes. Single spore cultures will be isolated from a
population and differences between male and female gametophytes in ecologically
important traits will be assessed. J.M. Bernard will investigate the effects of
temperature on life history characteristics, including inorganic nutrition and
carbon allocation, in wetland plants, Growth chambers will allow Dr. Bernard and
collaborating undergraduate students to expand previous field studies by testing
hypotheses under controlled conditions. I.A. Tamas will investigate mechanisms
underlying the effects of indoleacetic acid (IAA) on plant morphogenesis using
transgenic tobacco plants. Dr. Tamas' work requires tissue culture under axenic
conditions as well as the growth of transgenic whole tobacco plants. B.P. Smith
will investigate interactions between environmental factors, such as humidity
and parasitism by mites, in determining mortality in populations of mosquitoes.
Dr. Smith's research requires close control of temperature, photoperiod, and
humidity.
