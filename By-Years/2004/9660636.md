This proposal addresses the one-step direct electrochemical synthesis of
propylene oxide from propylene/oxygen mixtures and a bifunctional
electrocatalyst for simultaneously generating hydrogen peroxide and epoxidizing
olefins. The ability to in situ electrochemically generate hydrogen peroxide
allows for the precise control of its local concentration and the resultant
enhancement of selectivity to propylene oxide. The proposed approach will also
allow for direct removal of product through a membrane semipermeable to
propylene oxide. Hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration will be catalyzed by either
gold or a supported metallomacrocycle (Ni-phthalocyanine or Comeso-
tetraphenylporphyrin). Propylene epoxidation will be catalyzed by Mn-meso-
tetraphenylporphyrin or titanium silcalite. Successful completion of the program
will result in a selective, high yield process for the epoxidation of olefins.
The technology developed in this program should provide a significantly lower
cost route to olefin epoxides using in situ electrochemically generated hydrogen
peroxide and should be of great interest to manufacturers of these types of
materials.
