This three-year project, Using a Constructivist Approach to Improve the
Teaching and Learning of Science, was submitted by the University of Vermont and
will create collaborating teams of scientists and learning specialists from the
University and designated teachers from the participating school districts.
These teams will provide three-week summer institutes and follow-up academic
year workshops in the teaching and learning of science from a constructivist
approach. During the three years, forty elementary teachers will be selected in
teams, which include an administrator, from the participating school districts,
Colchester, Franklin NW (Swanton), Lamoille South (Morrisville/Stowe), Southwest
Vt Supervisory Union (Bennington), Addison Northeast (Bristol), Rutland NE
(Brandon), and Barre Town. The teams are committed to participate in three
consecutive summers concentrating on the integration of the content (chemistry,
physics and geology) and current pedagogy (cooperative learning, writing to
learn) necessary to implement a constructivist active learning approach to the
teaching of science. Included in the yearly workshops will be sessions on adult
development to help these teachers appreciate the requirements for good
inservice delivery. The three summers plus intervening academic year workshops
will enable these forty teachers to provide their peers with the intellectual
and technical assistance to teach science effectively. The documented cost-
sharing from the districts and UVM is equal to 20% of the NSF request, with
additional in-kind contributions indicated.
