9529847 Fine In this project, the PI will assist in implementing phase 2 of
ARLINDO (Indonesian acronym for Indonesian Throughflow), called ARLINDO
Circulation (AC). The objective is to study the circulation and water mass
stratification within the Indonesian Seas in order to formulate a thorough
description of the source, spreading patterns, inter-ocean transport and
dominant mixing processes. AC is specifically aimed at resolving the throughflow
transport and velocity field across the central passages of the Indonesian Seas,
extending hydrography to the eastern Banda Sea. Moorings are designed to measure
the mean and variable current and thermohaline stratification. The PI in this
award will be responsible for the sampling for CFC (Chlorfluorcarbon)
distributions that are used to determine the rates and types of Pacific water
contained in the throughflow.
