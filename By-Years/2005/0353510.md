The Mathematics Department, College of William and Mary, will continue to host
an REU program for the next three summers in matrix analysis and applications,
broadly defined. A great range of timely research projects will be offered, and
many will involve significant combinatorial content, as well as analytic,
algebraic and geometric techniques. Eight carefully selected participants will
be chosen from a national applicant pool. Past pools have ranged from 80 to 160
applicants. The program will be led by Charles Johnson, with the assistance of
other faculty and PhD students. The group at William and Mary has a very high
international reputation in the subject. Projects offered will be sufficiently
sophisticated to permit publication in respected journals, and this has been a
typical outcome of prior projects.
