TITLE: Intrusion Detection Techniques for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

PI: Wenke Lee

Abstract:

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is formed by a group of mobile wireless nodes
often without the assistance of fixed or existing network infrastructure. A
MANET is very vulnerable to attacks because of its characteristics of open
medium, dynamically changing network topology, lack of centralized monitoring
and management point, and lack of computing resources and (battery) power. This
research focuses on developing intrusion detection capabilities for a MANET.

A distributed intrusion detection architecture is investigated. Each MANET node
can be the monitoring node for itself, or a cluster of neighboring MANET nodes
can elect a monitoring node for the neighborhood. A detection agent runs on each
monitoring node to detect local intrusions and collaborates with other agents to
investigate the source of intrusion and coordinate responses. This research
develops a learning-based algorithm that can automatically compute detection
models based on the correlations among a large set of features. For efficiency,
a cascaded detection scheme is studied where simple and energy efficient models
can first filter out the vast amount of normal data so that the more complex and
energy consuming models only need to analyze a small amount of suspicious data.

The novel intrusion detection architecture and algorithms in this research will
be valuable to not only MANET but also other existing and future technologies.
