Techniques such as program generation, partial evaluation, just-in-time
compilation, and run-time code generation respond to the need for general
purpose programs which do not pay unnecessary run-time overheads. The thesis of
this project is that a uniform, principled, high-level, and practical view of
these diverse techniques is possible through multi-stage programming, a novel
paradigm for the development of maintainable, high-performance software. The key
idea in multi-stage programming is the use of simple, high-level annotations to
allow the programmer to break down the cost of a computation into distinct
stages.

The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that the theoretical machinery that
has been developed for multi-stage programming can be put to work. This project
will involve the development of compilers of multi-stage programming languages,
addressing both practical and theoretical problems that arise in the development
of such systems, and using these compilers in interesting applications ranging
from dynamic programming algorithms and rewriting systems to implementations of
domain specific programming languages.
