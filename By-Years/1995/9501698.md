9501698 Kim It is proposed to develop Piezoelectric Microelectromechanical
Systems (PMS) through combining piezoelectricity, microelectromechanical-systems
(MEMS) technology and IC-microfabrication technology. Recent development of MEMS
has opened up many new applications due to their small size, easiness of forming
large number of arrays, integrability with circuits on a single chip, etc.
However, major activities in MEMS have involved electrostatic (or thermal)
actuation and capacitive (or piezoresistive) sensing that have some inherent
characteristics unsuitable in some applications. PMS expand the application
areas of MEMS due to their unique and promising features that are not offered by
electrostatic, thermal, capacitive, or piezoresistive MEMS. The proposed
research takes full advantages offered by piezoelectric actuation and sensing.
Specifically proposed for sensing PMS are dome-shaped piezoelectric microphones
on silicon that can detect the direction of sound source as well. For actuating
PMS, the following systems are proposed: 1) dome-shaped microspeakers with beam
forming and steering capability and 2) focused acoustic beam generators without
acoustic lens. Also proposed are lateral-field-excited bulk-acoustic-wave
resonators for high-frequency (&gt;Ghz) filters and oscillators. Since the
residual stresses coming from piezoelectric thin film has been the major
performance limiting factor for PMS, it is proposed to develop (into
manufacturable technology) our novel idea of using mechanical-vibrational energy
to increase surface-adatom mobility during sputter-deposition of piezoelectric
thin film for residual-stress reduction. Various educational activities are
proposed (1)to show the students how exciting an engineering is; (2)to inspire
the students to develop right attitude (toward technical problems), proper
analytical skills (to solve the problems) ingenuity and life-long-learning
attitude; and (3)to teach the students the specific knowledge in the area of
solid-stat e devices. Specifically, new courses on sensors and actuators are
proposed. Through the proposed pre-college educational activities the general
public and secondary-school students in the State at Hawaii will be drawn closer
to engineering. Through senior projects, design projects and research projects
the students will closely interact with an inspiring professor and engineers in
industry. ***
