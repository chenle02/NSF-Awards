9619141 Lerman This project, sponsored by Columbia College of Chicago, will
carry out a five year project to teach teachers in grades 7, 8 and 9 in 50 of
Chicago's public schools the basics of physical science using up-to-date
pedagogical technoques with exemplary materials. Each year of the project 40 new
teachers, selected from 10 of the 50 participating schools, will be selected and
will take an intensive three-week summer program, followed by 16 after school
sessions and two Saturday sessions during the schol year. In-class and in-
school assistance will be provided in subsequent years to aid in the classroom
implementation of the materials. At the end of the project, in most of the
target schools, all teachers who teach science in a given school at the grades
selected will have been involved in the program. A parallel program for parents,
not funded by NSF, will support what is being done in the classroom. Parents
will become knowledgeable of the science activities done by their children and
be involved in a science literacy program. Matching funds constitute 182% of the
NSF award.
