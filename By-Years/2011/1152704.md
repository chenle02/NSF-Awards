This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
an on-line analyzer to enable the increased use of alternative fuels in cement
manufacturing, and thus reduce energy costs. Cement manufacturing is highly
energy-intensive, accounting for a significant portion of fuel use in the world.
The rising cost of energy has motivated cement manufacturers to use alternative
fuels available at low or no cost (e.g., tires, municipal waste etc.). However,
the use of alternative fuels creates manufacturing problems due to the lack of
adequate and timely analysis feedback. In this project, a Rapid Clinker Analyzer
(RCA) will be designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate that the system
captures and analyzes data in a much faster and cost-effective manner to allow
cement manufacturers to analyze product clinker in near-real
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be
the potential to significantly increase the use of alternative fuels in cement
manufacturing. Widespread adoption of this technology will result in significant
savings to cement manufacturers, while greatly reducing the use of fossil fuels.
In addition, the shift to alternative fuels will reduce landfills, and thus
mitigate negative environmental impacts of waste products. This new technology
will also provide a unique advancement in analyzer technology because of the
more rapid performance and smaller sample required.
