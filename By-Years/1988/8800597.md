Research will be carried out on the basic physics of dense plasmas by light
scattering and spectroscopic methods using three plasma devices: pulsed arc,
laser-produced plasma, and high field z-pinch. These plasmas cover a large range
of coupling parameters, with emphasis on values of order one. Light scattering
measurements will be performed to determine electron density fluctuation
spectra, especially at relatively low frequencies. Spectral line profile
measurements will yield information on electric field fluctuations in dense
plasma and their effects on atomic systems. Auxiliary diagnostic measurements
will be made to characterize the plasmas more fully so that meaningful
comparisons can be made with the theory of fluctuations and transport in dense
plasmas.
