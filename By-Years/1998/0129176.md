0129176&lt;br/&gt;Groza&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Joanna Groza and students
from the University of California-Davis in a collaboration with Eberhart Burkel
of the Department of Physics at the University of Rostock, Germany. The aim of
the international project is to study field-activated sintering of nanopowders,
which occurs under exposure to microdischarges. Technologically, electric field
application has distinct benefits, such as enhanced sintering rates, sontrol and
production of novel microstructures, and fewer processing steps. The US group
has an ongoing research program which has already achieved results on difficult-
to-sinter materials. The German group is a leader in the development and
improvement of new synchrotron radiation ingvestigation using inelastic
scattering of synchrotron radiation with very high resolution. The research will
advace our knowledge of field-assisted sintiering, particularly as applied to
nanosized powders.. The work plan provides for extensive participation by
graduate students in the international travel and research, the work is intended
to offer insights into science and engineering education and prepare the
students to work in an increasingly interdependent global
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
