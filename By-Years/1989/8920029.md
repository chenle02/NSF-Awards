The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program has made an award to Professor
Richard A. MacPhail to study molecular dyanamics in fluids by vibrational
spectroscopy and CW stimulated Brillouin gain spectroscopy. The goal of this
research is to provide new and better data on molecular dynamics in liquids.
Vibrational spectroscopy is used to probe rapid shape changes in molecules and
the Brillouin technique is used to measure dynamical properties over many
molecules. Raman spectroscopy is to be employed to probe the damping of
torsional vibrations in liquid n-butane and pseudorotation dynamics in liquid
cyclopentane. On the vibrational timescale, these two cases correspond to the
high barrier and low barrier limits of unimolecular reactions in liquids. This
work will be extended to cyclobutane and cyclopentene, which lie in the
intermediate barrier regime. The CW stimulated Brillouin gain spectrometer,
begun under the previous grant, will be used to observe collective dynamics in
supercooled liquids, including glycerol, salol and low temperature optical
glass.
