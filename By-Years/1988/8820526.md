This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, utilizes
spectroscopic techniques to probe for structural and substitution isomers in
alkali cluster beams. The data obtained in these studies will further advance
the field of gas-phase clusters where, so far, information on multiple sructural
isomers among aggregates of one particular size is lacking. Near-infrared two
photon ionization and ion depletion probes will be used to characterize excited
states of microclusters, with the aim of identifying candidate species for
isomer differentiation. The differentiation studies will make use of isomer
specific optical bleaching followed by size specific detection of the resulting
modified absorption.
