This project will conduct a five-year study on the scale up of complex
instructional innovations. The PIs construe scale up to mean both widespread
adoption and high quality implementation. Using three large whole-school
projects-Success for All, America's Choice, and Accelerated Schools, the project
will examine two issues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To what extent do design and
environmental factors influence attempts to bring high-quality implementations
of educational innovations to large numbers of schools?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.
How do the designs and educational environments affect the problems of scaling
up, and how do interventions and implementers manage these
problems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
