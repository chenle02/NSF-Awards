Professor Khakoo will measure absolute differential cross sections of electron
impact excitation on Helium atoms. The excitation will populate excited levels
of Helium which subsequently decay by radiation. Coincident measurement of the
electron energy at fixed scattering angle together with the emitted photons will
test fundamental assumptions of approximate theories of electron-atom scattering
at intermediate energies.
