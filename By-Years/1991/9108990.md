Professor Salamanca Riba will investigate various topics in the theory of
unitary representations of reductive Lie groups. Firstly, she will attempt to
complete a proof of a conjecture of Zuckerman that certain Harish-Chandra
modules are isomorphic to Zuckerman functor modules. In addition she will
consider other generalizations of the above conjecture. For example, in certain
cases Barbasch and Vogan have conjectured that these derived functor modules are
obtained from a special unipotent representation. Professor Salamanca Riba will
attempt to prove this. The research project being described here is in group
representation theory. Groups usually arise as transformations which preserve
the structure of a system under investigation, as for example the group of
rotations around the center preserves a sphere. In specific applications a
concrete realization of the abstract group, or representation, is often needed.
These are the objects which are being studied here.
