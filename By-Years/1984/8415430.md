This research will involve the development of a model of the human knee joint
which will allow quantitative and predictive analyses of normal and pathological
knees. The model will be validated by measurements on cadaverous material and by
experiments on people. The dynamic predictive capability of the knee model will
be evaluated using optimization analyses of the lower extremity musculoskeletal
model during gait to establish the time course and force level of the individual
muscles as compared to synchronously acquired myoelectric signals. The model
will allow study of the normal and pathological knee joint's dynamic and
kinematic properties. In this way, it will contribute to the prevention and
treatment of knee joint injuries and will aid in the design of knee prostheses.
