Research and development of a technology that will allow the manufacture of
very high resolution autostereoscopic (3D) displays for advanced computer
applications is proposed. This innovative technology will provide the scientific
community a true 3D alternative to current 3D and 2D imaging systems. A method
that allows the display of images with a resolution greater than the pixel count
of the LCD itself has been devised. Use of this method may allow the production
of autostereoscopic displays with an image quality matching that of high-end
CRTs. Initial applications in advanced scientific computing include molecular
modeling and MRI.
