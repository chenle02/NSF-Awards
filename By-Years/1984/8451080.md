The mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced composite materials will be
studied theoretically within the framework of continuum mechanics. Emphasis will
be placed on exploring the microscopic origins of macroscopic properties such as
stiffness, strength, and toughness. Microscopic origins include the properties
of the constituent fibers and matrix, their geometry, and the extent to which
they are bonded to one another. In fact, the degree of bondedness will
constitute a major theme around which much of the proposed work revolves.
Alterations in the fiber-matrix bond have been thought to affect toughness
significantly. In particular, degradation of the bond frequently leads to
increased toughness in brittle matrix-systems. Response to the question, What
effect does such degradation have on stiffness in, say, discontinuous fiber
systems? and to similar questions requires a means of incorporating the degree
of bond degradation as a parameter into continuum-analyses of relevant mechanics
problems. Various means will be explored, and a number of key problems in which
the fiber-matrix interface plays a significant role will be studied.
