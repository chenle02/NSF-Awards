This proposal centers on determining precision tests of the Standard Model of
particle physics and new physics beyond the Standard Model at present and future
collider facilities. The PI proposes to do a full one-loop computation of
neutrino-nucleon scattering. This is the essential missing ingredient that is
needed to understand whether the recently observed NuTeV anomaly is in fact a
deviation from the Standard Model or just a consequence of higher order
radiative effects The PI proposes a variety of calculations covering radiative
corrections to electroweak observables (mainly WW production), radiative
corrections to both Higgs boson production and decay processes, top quark
production, neutrino deep inelastic scattering and precision measurements of
SUSY processes at a future linear collider.
