9352973 Rao Mercy College will initiate a five-week, commuter, Young Scholars
program in mathematical modelling for 30 students entering the eleventh and
twelfth grades. This summer program will use problems from the physical,
natural, and environmental sciences to introduce students to the mathematical
modelling process. Students will study differentiation, integration,ordinary
differential equations,and discrete dynamic systems. The program will offer
classroom instruction and hands-on activities in the computer laboratory. Weekly
visits to research centers will expose the participants to career options,
ethical issues and research methodologies in mathematics and science. All
students will return to Mercy College for six academic year Saturday sessions
during which they will visit additional research centers and complete a more
comprehensive modeling project. ***
