9457486 Mastrangelo The research supported shall aid in the development of
tools, processes and techniques for reliable micromechanical devices. These
include fabrication process synthesis programs and new transduction mechanisms,
devices and techniques for microsensors. In addition, the development of
micromachined chemical reactors for biological analysis, such as DNA sequencing,
and nanofabricated tools for intracellular studies will be pursued. ***
