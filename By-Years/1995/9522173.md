9522173 Bosart and Knight Under this award, Drs. Bosart and Knight will conduct
an observational and modeling study of South American cold air outbreaks and the
role that the Andes Mountains play in the modulation and control of these
events. As part of this study, the PI s will examine how the presence of the
Andes barrier affects the processes of synoptic and mesoscale cyclogenesis,
anticyclogenesis, and frontogenesis. Unlike the major mountain barriers of North
America or southeastern Australia, the distance, with latitude, between the
Andes and the east coast of the continent varies almost linearly. This may allow
the PIs to separate orographic and coastal effects on the above processes. The
results of these studies is likely to provide important insights for better
understanding cold air outbreaks in other parts of the world, including over the
U.S. The observational portion of the study will consist of analyses of
composite climatologies of cold air outbreaks over South America and detailed
studies of individual cases, using primarily the gridded data sets being
produced by operational centers as part of the reanalysis effort. The numerical
simulations will be done with the NCAR mesoscale model (MM5). ***
