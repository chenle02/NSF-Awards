The medium-term goal of this project is to develop a Bio-enabled Sensor Network
(BSN) composed of sensing devices that can enter a full sleep mode but still be
woken up by a long-range RF signal. The idea is to transduce a weak Electro-
Magnetic signal into biological signals and use a biological device to
demodulate the information embedded in the EM signal. The short-term goal of
this project is to develop a clear vision for the potential of biological
communications and computation in the specific context of wireless sensor
networks (WSN) and articulate a research path and preliminary answers to the
following questions. What are the fundamental limits of EM energy harvesting? In
the specific case of address recognition in WSN, what are the potential, means
and limits of computation, communication, of a distributed network of biological
processes? Beyond, the intra-node networked bio-communications and computation,
the wake-up mechanism results in optimization problems because of its high delay
and limited capacity. How can hybrid, biological and periodic, wake up
mechanisms be combined to satisfy the system requirements? What is the viability
of using biological organisms in WSNs? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in
biological and molecular communications and computation holds the promise to
revolutionize and bridge the fields of computer science, biology, electrical
engineering, and mechanical engineering. The PI aims at obtaining preliminary
results, and assembling a cross-disciplinary team with expertise in computation,
communication, networking, biology, and nano-mechanics, to write a full proposal
with clear, focused, and realistic objectives to develop a prototype
BSN.&lt;br/&gt;
