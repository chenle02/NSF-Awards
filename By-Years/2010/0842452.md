All animals communicate with each other using chemical signals. These signals
allow animals to assess their environment and to find food, potential mates, and
escape from predators. Understanding how animals recognize and respond to these
chemical cues is essential for a better understanding of animal development and
behavior. We are studying animal-to-animal communication in a laboratory animal,
the roundworm C. elegans. C. elegans emits a complex mixture of chemicals that
acts as a crowding signal for other worms. The goal of this project is to
explore how C. elegans detects and responds to this crowding signal.
Specifically, the goal is to identify the nerve cells and the proteins present
in them (receptors) that detect these chemicals, and to investigate how
detection of this information alters the development and behavior of these
animals. Understanding this critical process will provide key information on
chemical communication among animals, as well as between animals and their
environment. This project will provide the basis for a doctoral thesis and one
to two undergraduate senior honors research theses. Graduate and undergraduate
students will be trained in the experimental and theoretical basis of genetics,
behavioral studies, genomics and molecular biology, and will be provided the
opportunity to present their work at local and national forums. This work will
also foster interactions between biologists, physicists and biological chemists.
