This project is funded as a Phase I award under the 1988 Small Business
Innovation Research Program Solicitation. The purpose of this research is to
develop a queueing model that provides for dynamic readjustment of queue
management. The scientific merit of the research is high and the commercial
applications are considered to be attractive. The proposed research could
provide useful information for a wide number of applications and, in particular,
has the potential for making an important contribution to the allocation of
computer resources.
