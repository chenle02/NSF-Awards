This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bernardi will continue her
investigations of the evolution of the optical depth in the Lyman-Alpha Forest
using a much larger sample than previously available. Past work has shown that a
sharp change in optical depth at a redshift of 3.2 is very likely due to He II
reionization. The work to be carried out here will attempt to solidify this
conclusion using a much larger dataset derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release 7. The data will also be used to study the patchiness of
reionization, which will place constraints on models for the origin of the
ionizing photons. Broader impacts of this effort include training of a graduate
student.
