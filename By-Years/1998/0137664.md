The Advanced Materials program in the Division of Chemistry and the Electronic
Materials program in the Division of Materials Research make this joint renewal
award to Colorado State University. With this award, Professor Ellen Fisher will
study detailed chemical and physical mechanisms of plasma-enhanced chemical
vapor deposition and plasma etching, and will evaluate surface interactions of
radicals produced during plasma processing using spatially resolved laser-
induced fluorescence. The PI will evaluate the interactions between plasma and
surfaces during processing of integrated circuits using dual beam imaging; will
quantify and characterize the radicals formed during this processing; and will
develop detailed chemical mechanisms for plasma etching and plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition on different substrates. Use of dual beam imaging will
be enable to identify and quantitate a number of different processes that are
taking place during the plasma processing, and will be able to develop a
knowledge base to be useful to the plasma processing and modeling community. The
research project will provide excellent opportunity to graduate and
undergraduate students in chemistry and material sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project will use dual beam spatially resolved laser-induced
fluorescence imaging method to provide quantitative data on radicals produced at
surfaces of different substrates during the plasma processing. Information
generated will be useful to plasma processing and modeling community for the
development of improved and high performance integrated circuits. In addition,
the research activity in plasma processing will provide new opportunity to
graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry and materials sciences.
