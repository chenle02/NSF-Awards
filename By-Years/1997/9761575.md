This Small Business innovation Research Phase I project deals with a digital
hearing aid with the ability to adjust a discrete number of frequencies
independently and couple to a training computer. This hearing aid will use a
non-linear adaptive filter to eliminate unwanted noise and interface to a
computer for training and feedback. This is the first step in a development
series to enable a computer to `teach`' or provide assistance to speech
therapist in training hearing impaired children better language skills. The
first step will be to demonstrate a device capable of providing the specialized
frequency selective amplifications. This device will then be implemented with a
computer (and necessary hardware) that is capable of interacting with a child as
an aid to enhance specific sounds the child is missing. The second step in the
development series is to work with audiologists and speech therapists developing
a program implementing the training computer. The third step is to collect a
data base of the results of the children involved as a pattern recognition
device to speed up the process of language development. The potential commercial
market for hearing disabled children using this device is estimated to be in the
10,000's every year. The true potential, however lies in the enhancement of a
child's life, ability and opportunity because she is able to speak as normal
children do. This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research
Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
