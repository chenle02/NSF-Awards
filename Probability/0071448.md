Pitman and Yor are continuing their work on explicit descriptions of the
distribution of various functionals of Brownian motion and related processes
such as Brownian and Bessel bridges, meanders and excursions, and the
development of novel methods for obtaining such descriptions. Stimulus for
obtaining the exact distributions of ever more complicated Brownian functionals,
and understanding various identities, has been provided by applications of
Brownian excursion and Brownian bridge to the asymptotics of random
combinatorial objects such as trees and mappings, connections with the theory of
random partitions and random discrete distributions, and the applications of
Brownian motion in mathematical finance. While a great number of explicit
formulae are now known there remain many mysterious distributional coincidences
of the kind which have in the past provided stimulus for the development of
novel techniques and deeper understanding through such devices as path
transformations and decompositions.

This award will continue present lines of research into stochastic processes,
particularly Brownian motion, random partitions, and coalescent processes.
Brownian motion provides the foundation of the modern theory of continuous time
random processes with continuous paths, and has applications in fields as
diverse as physics and mathematical finance. Random partitions find applications
to combinatorics, physics and genetics. Coalescent processes model random
phenomena involving irreversible clustering or aggregation in a wide variety of
contexts. This is fundamental research into the mathematical structure of
stochastic processes. Progress in this direction enhances our understanding of
these processes, and has potential for application in numerous fields of
knowledge.
