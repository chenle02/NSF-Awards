This project will incorporate a sophisticated aerosol model within an existing
general circulation model (GCM) with the goal of improving the ability of GCMs
to predict the indirect effects of aerosols on climate change. The aerosol model
will include size-resolved representation of all major aerosol types (sulfate,
sea salt, carbonaceous, and mineral aerosols) and their microphysics. The model
will be "nudged" towards NCEP reanalysis of meteorological fields. Model results
will be compared with data from field campaigns, such as ACE-2 (Aerosol
Characterization Experiment). The broader impacts of this project will be to
help reduce discrepancies between current global aerosol model predictions and
observations. This grant will provide for the training of a graduate student.
