This project develops unified cognitive network management architecture for end-
to-end application-oriented quality of service (QoS) provisioning in
heterogeneous cognitive radio networks. The core of the architecture is a
unified cross-layer controller, which has two control plans: vertical nodal
control plan and horizontal network control plan. The nodal cross-layer
optimized resource allocation is guided by the control policy dynamically
generated by horizontal network control based on a cognitive agent network, and
thus leads to a multi-scale cross-layer architecture for distributive and
autonomous application-oriented QoS provisioning for future cognitive radio
networks. The transformative significance is two-fold. First, characterizing and
understanding the end-to-end network behaviors of cognitive radio networks is of
major fundamental research interest. Second, cognitive network management is a
technique to implement end-to-end application-oriented QoS provisioning under
various randomness and uncertainty in cognitive radio networks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides solutions for a variety of domain-
specific applications while addressing future societal needs. By using cognitive
network management to implement end-to-end application-oriented QoS provisioning
under various randomness and uncertainty in cognitive radio networks, this
project benefits other kinds of networks such as the 3G/4G mobile networks, and
WLAN/WMAN/WWAN. The research findings will be integrated into networking
courses. Research results will be disseminated in journals and conferences.
