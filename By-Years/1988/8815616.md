They will construct an instrument capable of high-resolution infrared
reflection-absorption spectroscopy of absorbates on single-crystal metal
surfaces, over the frequency range 350 - 4000 cm-1. The system will include a
sensitive photo- conductive detector, a liquid nitrogen cooled grating
monochromator and a full array of standard surface analysis equipment.
Application will be made to the dynamics of absorbate-substrate vibrations by
careful study of linewidths and line shapes, to interactions of absorbates with
co-absorbed alkali metal atoms, and to absorption on semiconductors.
