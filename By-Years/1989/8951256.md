Laboratory activities for freshman and sophomore (Microbiology) students will be
revised to emphasize experimentation rather than demonstration-oriented
activities. The objective is to allow students to experience science as a
process of hypothesis formation and testing by experimental design, data
collection and analysis. Exercises for six laboratory periods will be replaced
by newly developed exercises emphasizing the experimental approach, using new
microscopes, computers, and a spectrophotometer. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
