This project is in the general area of the Office of Special Projects dealing
with instrumentation development. The research will focus on the further
development of Fourier Transfrom Mass Spectrometry and its analytical
applications. It will focus on the better understanding of mass resolution, mass
range, signal to noise ratio, data acquisition period, kinetic energy of ions as
related to collision induced dissociation, and ionization methodology. Mass
spectrometric instrumentation of this type is noted for its utility in studies
of structure, reactivity, and gas-phase kinetic measurements of organic and
organometallic ions. Studies of these types have great importance in fundamental
chemistry, in biological analysis, and in extremely sensitive analytical methods
because ions can be stored for long periods of time and then measured in an
instant.
