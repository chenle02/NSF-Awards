9511174 Hencheck The properties of the very neutron-deficient isotopes near the
proton-drip line are of great interest to astrophysicists who model the rapid
hydrogen burning process in very hot, dense stellar environments. However,
little is known about many of the key nuclei that lie along the proton drip
line. Their masses, lifetimes, and decay modes must therefore be estimated in
order to include them in the calculation of the rp-process path. The
uncertainties in the predicted ground state properties, together with a lack of
knowledge about excited levels, which might serve as final states in B-decay
processes, are enough to produce large uncertainties in the resulting
astrophysical calculations. The goal of this project is to determine the half-
lives and decay modes of several of the very proton rich nuclei in the A=90 to
100 region including, but not limited to 96Cd, 98Cd, 96Ag and 98Ag. The
experiments would be performed at GSI Darmstadt, where isotopes will be produced
using the FEBIAD and FEBIAD-B2 ion sources. The experimental method would
closely follow the methods used successfully at GSI. ***
