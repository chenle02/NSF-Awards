9360420 Diehl This project provides a fundamental change in the way discrete
event simulation languages are constructed. The approach parallelizes the
performance evaluation experiments instead of the algorithms. By taking
advantage of recent theoretical developments in performance sensitivity analysis
and stochastic optimization techniques, it will be possible to create a general
purpose discrete event simulation language that has the potential of several
orders of magnitude improvement in the efficiency of performance evaluation of
discrete event systems. The project will result in a user-friendly software
package for general discrete event simulation with several orders of magnitude
speed improvement, and will enable the solution of performance evaluation and
optimization problems previously thought to be beyond reach. ***
