The objective of this research is to investigate the ways fluids interact with
solids. In nature, fluid-solid interactions are exemplified in the
precipitation/dissolution reactions that create porosity changes during
sedimentary diagenesis. Such porosity changes not only alter the geophysical
properties of the sedimentary rock, but control the migration and site
accumulation of hydrocarbons. Specifically, in order to ascertain the role of
crystal imperfections on the fluid transportation within a solid, electron
microscopy studies (CTEM, HREM, and AEM) will be conducted on plagioclase grains
whose cores have been replaced by nearly pure albite, on quartz that has been
overgrown, and on cemented carbonate. In addition, the application of electron
crystallography to mineralogy will be explored.
