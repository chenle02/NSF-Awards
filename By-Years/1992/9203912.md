An extensive study of the electrical conductivity within Middle Valley on the
Juan de Fuca Ridge will be conducted using a deep tow electromagnetic surveying
instrument. Middle Valley is a segment of the mid-ocean ridge crest buried
deeply by sediments and hosting a vigorous and well studied hydrothermal system.
The conductivity measurements constrain two parameters related to hydrothermal
circulation; the temperature gradient, and the porosity of the sediments. The
study will also investigate the extent of the large sulfide ore bodies within
Middle Valley. In addition, a controlled source will be used to extend the
electromagnetic studies to greater depth.
