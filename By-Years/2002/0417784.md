Plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) have dual functions as calcium
sensors and effectors, and are thought to be involved in multiple cellular
responses to external and internal stimuli. However, their precise physiological
functions remain elusive. Using a protoplast based functional genomics approach
and RNA interference based reverse genetics, a novel function of two Arabidopsis
CDPKs in auxin signaling was discovered, providing the first molecular evidence
connecting Ca2+ signaling to the action of auxin. A CDPK double knockout mutant
shows severe meristem defects, repression of several key meristem regulators,
and exhibits abnormal growth throughout the plant life cycle. Based on these
results, it is hypothesized that these two CDPKs represent a "missing link"
between auxin and Ca2+ signaling, and developmental processes. The long-term
goal of this research project is to understand the mechanisms and significance
of the CDPK-mediated auxin signal transduction pathway. The data will show that
a rapid movement of CDPK from the plasma membrane to the cytosol upon auxin
stimulation is a crucial step for CDPK-dependent auxin signaling. The objective
of this project is to identify and characterize cellular mechanisms controlling
auxin-dependent CDPK translocation. The proposed experiments will use functional
assays with an auxin-responsive reporter in both protoplasts and seedlings,
combined with fluorescent-protein based bio-imaging to establish if CDPK-
mediated auxin signaling involves protein lipid modification, phosphorylation,
vesicle trafficking, and/or cytoskeleton remodeling.
