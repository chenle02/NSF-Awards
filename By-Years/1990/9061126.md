Conventional refrigeration systems are limited in several respects: neither
vapor compression nor absorption coolers are efficient in small-scale units, and
most vapor compression systems use freons (CFC's) that are harmful to the
environment. Thermoelectric cooler have been used in a small scale,
applications, but also suffer from low efficiency. A cooling device which offers
higher efficiency in a small scale unit, and which avoids the use of CFC's,
would be highly desirable. To meet these criteria, TDA plans to look at a novel
cooling device using coupled electrochemical oxidation and reduction. After
carrying out detailed thermodynamic calculations to define the system and the
desired characteristics of the coupled reactions, they have identified a number
of promising reaction sets. However, detailed data on many of the desirable
chemical systems are not available. Accordingly, the objectives of the research
are (1) to carry out measurements of the fundamental electrochemical parameters
of redox couples that are potentially useful in such a process, and (2) to
conduct a systems analysis to determine the performance of a device based on
these reactions. Theoretically, the electrochemical cycle operates at the same
Coefficient of Performance (COP) as a Carnot refrigerator; however, real
equipment considerations will limit performance to about 40% of the Carnot
limit. The refrigerator has potential for several applications, including
replacement of refrigerators with CFC's and small scale cooling such as a
chiller for electronic components. In Phase II they will construct and test a
prototype cooling device using this approach.
