9723420 Ball Winter is energetically-demanding; energy requirements for
thermoregulation and other winter-coping adaptations typically increase when
food is scarce. Physiological and behavioral adaptations, including termination
of breeding and growth, have evolved among nontropical animals to cope with
winter energy shortages. Presumably, selection for the mechanisms that permit
physiological and behavioral anticipation of seasonal ambient changes have led
to current seasonal breeding patterns in many populations. Energetically-
challenging winter conditions can directly induce death via hypothermia,
starvation, or shock; surviving these demanding conditions likely evokes
significant stress responses. Winter conditions can also indirectly affect
health; the stress of coping with energetically-demanding conditions may
increase adrenocortical steroid concentrations and compromise immune function.
Individuals would enjoy a survival advantage if seasonally- recurring stressors
could be anticipated and countered by shunting energy reserves to bolster immune
function. The proposed laboratory studies of seasonal changes in mammalian
immune function will test the hypothesis that immune function is enhanced in
short days to counter the immunosuppressive effects of winter. Melatonin
secretion patterns change seasonally and may affect the shunting of energy into
different physiological processes. If the hypothesis that short days ameliorate
the energetic demands of immune function is true, then several testable
predictions emerge. In contrast to previous studies of the energetic costs of
immune function, the proposed studies will examine direct measures of immune and
endocrine function. Finally, the direct energetic costs of immune responses will
be assayed in mice housed under various environmental conditions. Taken
together, the results of the proposed studies will provide insight into the
interaction among neural, endocrine, and immune functions.
