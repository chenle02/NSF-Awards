This award will provide support for US students to participate in the primary
annual international conference on accelerator science and its applications, the
7th International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPAC`16) to be held in Busan,
South Korea, on May 8-13, 2016. The IPACs are an annual series of conferences
that rotate between the Americas, Europe, and Asia to highlight the science and
engineering of major accelerator facilities, provide scientists with a forum for
presenting results from research conducted using accelerators, and are a venue
for describing new applications of accelerators. At a time when not just old
jobs but entire old industries are disappearing, accelerators and accelerator-
driven light sources are burgeoning worldwide, offering new prospects not only
for fundamental discovery science, but for medicine and biology, for energy and
environment, for security, and for industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award
will be used to provide partial travel support for US students to attend the
conference. The recipients of the travel support will be making presentations at
the conference and will assist in conducting the conference. Attendance of 12 US
students will be facilitated by the funds provided by this award. The conference
will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to interact with more
experienced researchers and their colleagues in the broader international
scientific community.
