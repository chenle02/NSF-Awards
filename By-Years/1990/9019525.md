The research is concerned with the properties of acoustic phonons in thin films.
This knowledge is essential for the unambiguous interpretation of non-
equilibrium measurements of these systems. The objective is to obtain a more
complete knowledge of phonon dimensionality, occupation number, and transmission
between dissimilar solids. The experimental techniques to be employed combine
magnetoresistance and electron heating experiments with phonon spectroscopy in
the study of novel structures in which the phonon properties can be modified in
situ. The research will also be broadened to the investigation of acoutic
attenuation in disordered metal films. Films with contacts and connections for
precision resistivity measurements will be fabricated inside novel acoutic
cavities permitting the simultaneous measurement of sound attenuation and
electrical properties.
