This project will enable 20 physics educators from the United States to attend
the Second Inter-American Conference on Physics Education to be held in Caracas,
Venezuela from July 14-20, 1991. The daily thematic design of the conference
includes: Contents of Physics Teaching, Cognitive Processes and Problem Solving,
Physics Teaching and Society, Experimental Physics and its Teaching, and
Alternative ways for Communicating Physics and Physics Teaching. Research in
physics education will be highlighted. Strong contributions to the quality of
physics teaching in the U.S. is expected from the Latin-American contingent.
They have demonstrated expertise in developing simple and inexpensive equipment
as part of their approach to the teaching of ethnic groups similar in make-up to
U.S. minorities. Translation of these materials and techniques to similar
minority audiences in the U.S. will be a focus of follow-up activities for the
U.S. participants. Post-conference expectations include: 1) the peer-led PTRA
Program type workshops to share "lessons learned", 2) the on-going stimulation
and support for and Training of Elementary Teachers (TNG-7 of AAPT), and 3) the
development of Educational Partnership facilitated by AAPT. Cost sharing equals
9% of the NSF award.
