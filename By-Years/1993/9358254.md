This NYI award will fund both theoretical and experimental research on the
evaluation of photon migration imaging as a biomedical optical imaging and
spectroscopic tool. Investigations will focus upon correlating measured photon
transport characteristics with the diffusion approximation which describes light
propagation in tissues and other random media. This NYI award will also allow
the investigator to continue teaching at both the undergraduate and the graduate
levels in the chemical engineering department and to revise the level of
instruction of an undergraduate course.
