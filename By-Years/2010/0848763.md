In this project the PIs will determine the motor-generated shear forces and
doublet sliding in the biciliated unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
under wide range of conditions with the goal of establishing the correct
mechanism for self-organizing beating structure. First the PIs will record long
durations of high temporal and spatial resolution images of ciliary beating
using electron-multiplying CCD camera. Next they will determine accurately the
drag force exerted by the fluid along the cilium using a slender body theory for
low Reynolds number flows. The force generated by motors along the length of a
cilium will then be determined by balancing the hydrodynamic drag to internal
forces due to sliding and bending. The precise images of the cilia will also
allow the PIs to determine the relative sliding of the doublets. The force-
sliding data will be used to test various models of self-organizing beating
structure as well as to determine the dynamics of the basal body that connects
the two cilia to the cell body. The proposed study will add a significant tool
for determining the active internal forces generated during ciliary beating.
This in-vivo technique will complement the in-vitro molecular genetic, electron
microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and sliding assay techniques
currently used to understand the physiology of ciliary beating. Several graduate
students will be trained in interdisciplinary research and to work as a team
with several advisers. They will participate in all phases including experiment
development, data collection, data analysis, and modeling. Undergraduate
students will significantly aid the project by characterizing individual ciliary
mutants that have mechanical or control function defects and will learn to use
AFM. High school students will assist with mutants. The physics of cilia will be
incorporated in undergraduate and graduate courses.
