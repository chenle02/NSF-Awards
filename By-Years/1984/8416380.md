This study attempts to elucidate the properties of chromia-doped tin oxide
before and after platinization by probing electronic structure, composition, and
geometrical structure using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron
spectroscopy, electron stimulated desorption, and ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy. Recent work on chromia-doped tin oxide shows that this material
holds promise for treatment of nitrogen oxides. These experiments involve ;itin
situ;ro dynamic measurements, the most promising technique for modern catalyst
studies. An improved system has been developed for use of an established
analytical technique known as Auger spectroscopy. The new system allows more
meaningful results than have been possible in the past from this technique which
determines kind and amount of compounds present on surfaces. The improved method
also allows more sensitive surfaces, not hitherto susceptible to the Auger
method, to be analyzed.
