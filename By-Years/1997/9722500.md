Yasbin 9722500 The 41st annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on
Procaryotic Biology is to be held at the Lazy H Ranch, Allenspark, Colorado,
June 4-8, 1997. 8This conference is primarily concerned with the biology of
prokaryotes, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject
area. One significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility to
graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently are
limited. Specifically to address this problem, funds will be used to provide
travel and support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate
students and post-doctoral students working in various areas that comprise
prokaryotic biology.
