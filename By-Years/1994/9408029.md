9408029 Bach This project will investigate the effects of insect herbivory and
abiotic disturbance on rates and patterns of primary succession on sand dunes,
with emphasis on the colonizing plant Salix cordata and the specialist
folivorous beetle Altica subplicata. This project will examine the effect of
sand burial and flooding (two natural disturbances) on Salix performance and
plant succession, and the interaction between herbivory and disturbance in
influencing sand-dune succession. There has been only limited study of the
interactive effects of disturbance and herbivory on succession, yet such
interactions may have major influences on the course of community change. All
biological communities are in a state of successional change. Understanding the
mechanisms that drive this change will improve our ability to manage altered
ecosystems and biological preserves, promote ecosystem recovery, and mitigate
the loss of biological diversity.
