9400507 Mikkola This research is aimed at understanding the mechanical
properties of cubic forms of trialuminides. The work focuses on various cubic
aluminum-titanium-chromium and aluminum-titanium-manganese alloys, though it is
expected that the results will be important to the understanding of other alloys
having the cubic L12 structure. These chromium and manganese ternary alloys have
many desirable properties, but are unusual in that, while they are relatively
soft and have little tensile ductility, failing by transgranular fracture.
Similar behavior can be found among some other potentially useful
intermetallics. The primary thrust of the research is to improve these alloys
through additional alloying, based in large part on studies of the
micromechanisms of plastic deformation by high resolution transmission electron
microscopy. In this approach weak-beam imaging is combined with computer
simulation of images and related to the mechanical behavior of the alloys as a
function of temperature and composition. It is the intent of this research to
define this behavior in the cubic trialiminides, thereby sorting out the wide
variety of conflicting ideas and interpretations found in the literature.
Specific details of interest include the nature of the superdislocation
configurations and dissociation mechanisms and how these change with temperature
and composition; and, further, how these changes determine the mechanical
properties, including ductility, work hardening rates, and the occurrence of
serrated stress-strain behavior. %%% It is expected that this research will lead
to improvement of the properties and engineering potential of the cubic
trialuminides. Effective modeling of the deformation behavior should contribute
in a meaningful way to the future of intelligent alloy design. ***
