This award supports the participation of graduate students, postdocs, and other
early-career mathematicians in the Twenty-Third Riviere-Fabes Symposium, held at
the University of Minnesota on April 24-26, 2020. The award gives junior
researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and
researchers without other sources of funding a chance to attend and participate
in this conference, thus helping to promote the future generation of scientists
working in mathematical analysis. The symposium focuses on recent developments
in the field of analysis, with this year's program having a particular focus on
the analysis of partial differential equations (Navier-Stokes, Schroedinger,
elliptic, dispersive, porous media equations, optimal regularity). More
information can be found on the symposium web page:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
