9407800 McKee This is a project to investigate growth and physiological
responses of wetland species to anticipated effects of global climate change.
The PI will spend three months at the University of Aarhus, Denmark, to conduct
a study on the response of mangroves to elevated CO2 and nutrient availability.
Climate conditions, assimilation and exchange of nutrients and metabolic gases
are controlled and continuously monitored at the Institute of Biological
Sciences' PhytoNutriTron Facility, an advanced system for conducting
ecophysiological experiments with plants.
