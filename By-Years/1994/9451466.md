9451466 Halpern The Department of Mathematics of Brooklyn College is equipping a
classroom and a laboratory with computers for use in advanced post-calculus
courses serving the needs of mathematics, computer and information science,
secondary mathematics education, science, pre-engineering, and pre-med students.
The aim of the project is to enhance the courses by enabling instructors to
present topics in their lectures both graphically and numerically and by
deepening the students' understanding of core ideas of mathematics and the
classical interplay of arithmetic, algebra and geometry via the computer.
