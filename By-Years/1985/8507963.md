This research is concerned with experimental and theoretical studies of two
related subjects, rheology and airblast atomization, in concentrated suspensions
of particles larger than colloidal sizes. The major research objective is to
improve understanding of the structure and the underlying mechanisms of
concentrated suspensions with application to coal water slurry (CWS) technology.
Research emphasis is placed on particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions
as affected by particle surface property.
