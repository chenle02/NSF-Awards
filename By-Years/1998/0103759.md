Title: NGS: Efficient Script-Based Application Development for Networked High
Performance Computing Environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action will
continue the research on the GrADS technologies for building Grid applications
and to expand their applicability to new classes of applications. In particular,
the work will concentrate on workflow- style applications from mesoscale weather
forecasting and computational biology. In addition, it will explore enhanced
technologies for automatic construction of grid applications from high-level
specifications, along with new mechanisms for performance monitoring and
rescheduling. The results will be demonstrated on new versions of the two GrADS
testbeds.&lt;br/&gt;
