Dr Zuk will be researching the role of parasites in sexual selection. There are
two projects involved in this research effort. The first involves study of
conflicting selection pressures in a field cricket subject to an acoustically-
orienting parasitoid fly. The second project examines the relationship between
sex hormones, parasite burden as reflected in immune response, and sexual
selection in red jungle fowl. Dr. Zuk will expose undergraduate and graduate
students to current research from a variety of areas within ecology and
evolution, with particular commitment increasing the representation of women and
minorities in the sciences.
