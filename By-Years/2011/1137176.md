Symposium support for the meeting "Towards a Digital Society through Advanced
Connectivity Infrastructure symposium" to be held in Santiago, Chile, May 3,
2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chile is the host country for numerous astronomical
facilities, some of which are fully operational while others are under
development and/or being planned. Many of these observatories are funded, in
whole or in part, by NSF. Recent technological increases in telescope and
instrumental capabilities are enabling a rapid and very significant increase in
the quality and quantity of digital astronomical data delivered by the
observatories. In recognition of this and the impact that the resultant data
flow will have on Chile's broadband network infrastructure, a symposium is being
held in Santiago, Chile where national and international experts along with
representatives of Chilean government agencies will help develop the ideas for
an advanced connectivity infrastructure that will serve not only NSF's
investments but Chilean society as well.
