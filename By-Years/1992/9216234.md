The development of sound engineering solutions for soil and soil-structure
systems is important in the design and construction of the material
infrastructure that supports human lives and the nation's economy: buildings,
bridges, earth dams, lifelines and tunnels for communications and municipal
electricity, gas, water and sewer systems. Additional challenges are posed by
growing environmental problems, including the design and construction of
landfills and the evaluation and remediation of contaminant transport by
groundwater. The many uncertainties in the design of such facilities are
compensated for through conservative designs, involving increased cost and use
of materials. An alternative approach is provided by the testing of physical
geotechnical models, specifically by geotechnical centrifuge model tests. This
symposium focusses on the application of the geotechnical centrifuge testing
technique to geotechnical, earthquake and environmental problems, and it
addresses a wide audience of researchers and practitioners. The symposium is the
second day of a two-day event, which begins with the official inauguration of
the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 100 G-ton centrifuge, which has been in
operation since 1989.
