9318783 WERREN Recently it has been shown that a single group of bacteria
(Wolbachia) cause both incompatibility and parthenogenesis in many causing
destruction of chromosomes or by preventing segregation of chromosomes in
unfertilized eggs, resulting in generation of female offspring without the need
of fertilization. Wolbacia are of interest because they may be involved in the
rapid evolution of new species in insects. In addition, they are of considerable
interest because of their potential uses in biological control of pests (e.g. by
causing sterilization), improvement of beneficial insects (by use of
parthenogenesis), and as a tool for genetic modification of both beneficial and
pest insects. Research described here will involve sequencing of two different
genetic regions. The relationships among Wolbachia from different insects will
be determined and it will be determined whether parthenogenesis has evolved more
than once among Wolbachia, to what extent Wolbachia have been horizontally
transmitted among insects species, and whether parasitic insects are likely
vectors for movement of these bacteria between species. The research proposed
here will provide information on Wolbachia relevant to their use in biological
control of insects and to studies of insect development.
