Recent studies on chemical scavenging, based on either modelling or laboratory
experiments, have suggested the importance of submicron particles. Bacteria and
colloids are two kinds of submicron particles deserving special attention. The
usual flow-through filtration using 0.4 um filters cannot separate these
particles from solution cleanly. Consequently, the interpretation of solution-
particle and particle-particle interaction may be biased. A cross-flow
filtration method will be employed to filter seawater samples sequentially
through 1 um, 0.1, and 1 nm filters, with the attempt of removing bacteria by
the second filter and colloids by the third filter. Materials retained by the
second and the third filters will be characterized by their C/N ratios to assess
the contribution of colloids to the bacterial fraction. Isotopes of Th(230Th,
232Th, 234Th) and 231Pa will be measured on these and sediment trap samples.
Except 234Th, which will be measured by B-counting, all other nuclides in
seawater samples will be measured by mass spectrometry.
