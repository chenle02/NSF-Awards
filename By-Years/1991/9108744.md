The field of behavioral genetics has demonstrated that heredity influences
differences among people for many aspects of behavior, including cognitive
abilities, personality, and psychopathology. However, little is known about the
extent to which genetic factors influence behavioral interactions for pairs of
individuals. From the perspective of child development, some of the most
important interactions are those within the family, yet essentially nothing is
known about such family relationships from the perspective of behavioral
genetics. This research will extend into early adolescence the Colorado Sibling
Study (CSS) which focuses on the social environment of familial and extra-
familial relationships. The CSS has previously studied family relationships for
nonadoptive and adoptive siblings in early and middle childhood. This research
on early adolescence will investigate nonshared environment and genetic
influence on parent and sibling relationships. This study is embedded within the
long-term Colorado Adoption Project, which makes it possible to study
antecedents and consequences of family relationships and to consider the role of
heredity in these associations.
