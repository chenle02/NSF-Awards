9614076 Conley Net shape aluminum casting and their production applications have
gained a great attention by companies in the U.S. and Mexico. As government
regulation forces automotive manufacturers to reduce weight and improve fuel
efficiency, the suitability of aluminum alloys to replace ferrous materials
become more attractive. This collaborative research project addresses
fundamental issues on the design and microstructural characterization of near
net shape aluminum alloy castings between Northwestern University and the
Institute Politecnico Nacional in Mexico. Under the NSF CONACyT Collaborative
Research Project Initiatives, NSF supports international collaborative research
activities in the areas where efforts are likely to produce complementary and
synergistic effects. The research project has a balance between theory and
experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the aluminum alloy casting
industry.
