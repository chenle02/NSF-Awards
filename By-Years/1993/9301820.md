This grant is for partial support of a special international symposium on
elastic waveguides to be held during June 6-10, 1993 at the University of
Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. The proposed symposium will allow the
presentation of state-of-the- art research findings in the area of waves
propagation in elastic waveguides to the leading workers in this field from
academe, government laboratories and industry. This area is currently of great
interest in the fields of non destructive evaluation (NDE) of devices and
structures, and in seismology. In particular, the symposium will feature
presentations of research concerning the propagation of elastic waves in half
spaces, mechanical waveguides, and layered media. General topics in elastic wave
propagation will also be presented, as well as scattering problems.
