This awards supports the research of Professor M. Stillman to continue the
development of Macaulay 2. This system will enable large scale research
computing projects dealing with systems of polynomial equations in many
variables. He also hopes to work on the relationship of syzygies of a projective
variety to the geometry of the variety. This research is in the field of
algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that
have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by
the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields
as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory
and robotics. The software being developed here will make many previously
difficult or impossible computations in this field possible.
