This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI-R2) award is to develop a state-of-the-art, precise and
highly flexible instrument for testing and measuring the fuel efficiency,
emissions and performance of automotive propulsion systems. The centerpiece of
the instrument is a precise and high-speed hydrostatic dynamometer, which
absorbs (or provides) torques from (or to) the engine/powertrain so that the
engine or powertrain can follow any desired rotational speed and acceleration
profile. The hydrostatic dynamometer is utilized to experimentally mimic the
drive train, vehicle load, and the alternative power sources in coordination
with an engine control system and a hardware-in-the-loop vehicle driveline
emulator. This instrument will allow all aspects of the vehicle propulsion
system such as the engine, transmission, hybrid power sources, energy storage
systems, emission control systems and driveline system to be tested or simulated
in a real-world driving scenario without actually building the complete physical
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a shared research infrastructure, the instrument
will encourage the interaction and research collaboration of users from multiple
departments at the University of Minnesota. Furthermore, it will help to prepare
the next generation instrumentalists, researchers and engineers to design and
build clean and efficient automotive propulsion systems. The developed
instrument will also be integrated into core mechanical engineering curriculum
for both undergraduate and graduate education. It will also enhance
collaborations with industrial partners and help to disseminate research results
to communities at large.
