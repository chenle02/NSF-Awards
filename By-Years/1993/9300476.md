The Geology Departments of Bryn Mawr College, Bucknell University, Lafayette
College, and Lehigh University have successfully formed a consortium fostering
undergraduate geologic research. Important research opportunities in
Pennsylvania and the surrounding areas in subjects as diverse as tectonics and
hydrogeology are being examined by undergraduates from the four institutions as
well as George Washington University. The program is designed to foster cross-
institutional and cross-disciplinary studies as students work closely with one
or more faculty mentors. The research activities fostered by the Consortium
become part of a year-long undergraduate research experience. To fully
comprehend how a research problem is conceived and conducted, students generate
a proposal, conduct field work, sampling, and/or laboratory studies as
appropriate, and periodically report on their research progress. Ultimately they
will formally present their results to faculty and colleagues at a Consortium
symposium.
