This project establishes a Capstone Experience for senior undergraduate
geoscience students. The major component is equipment for a networked
Collaborative Computer Laboratory housed in the new sciences center. The
laboratory is the major resource for an integrated course including computer,
field work, laboratory, analytical, and publishing experiences for undergraduate
seniors in geology and anthropology. This Capstone Experience has a strong
interdisciplinary component (geology, environmental sciences, and anthropology)
and involves other universities and K 12 students. This project focuses on Maine
and neighboring regions and builds on the strengths of the university and
opportunities provided by Maine's geological and geographic setting. The result
of this project (MAINEly Geology) is an interactive, multimedia presentation of
geological and anthropological aspects of Maine that is available as a World
Wide Web site and published as a CD-ROM. It is a geological resource for other
institutions in the Nation, as well as for Maine's people, and represents a
model of a student-centered, inquiry-based, active learning experience by
undergraduate students.
