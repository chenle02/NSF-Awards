Professors Kleiber, Stwalley, and Sando are supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program in a collaborative experimental and theoretical
investigation of far-wing laser absorption leading to chemical reaction and
various inelastic processes in alkali metal interactions with hydrogen
molecules. The far wing absorption technique is one way in which to probe
directly the properties of the usually very short-lived intermediate or
transition region between reactants and products in a chemical transformation. A
laser tuned slightly off-resonance from an allowed or a forbidden atomic
transition of an alkali metal is being used to pump colliding alkali-hydrogen
"intermediates" at distances suitable for resonant absorption of the off-
resonance photon. The subsequent branching into various product channels is
monitored, as a function of the amount of laser detuning, by either emission
measurements or laser-induced fluorescence. Of particular interest are reactions
dynamics near threshold and the influence of spin-orbit coupling on the
dynamics. Theoretical treatments are emphasizing approximate classical path
methods that include the full motion of the nuclei. Extensions and
generalizations of semiclassical line-broadening theories are being explored.
