This project is concerned with the endomorphisms of groups and modules. The
pricipal investigator will examine the endomorphism rings of certain Butler
groups and will classify them in terms of their natural filtrations. Research
will also be done on torsion-free abelian groups as modules over their rings of
endomorphisms, automorphism groups of nilpotent groups of class two and
automorphism groups of locally finite groups. This research is in the general
area of abelian group theory. An abelian group is an algebraic structure with a
commutative multiplication defined on it. This area is currently impacting
several areas of mathematics including set theory, ring theory and group theory.
