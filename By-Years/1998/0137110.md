Metalliferous clays and Mn nodules and crusts contain highly radiogenic Hf
isotopes and if subducted, the Hf isotopes could be used as a tracer for their
presence in arc lavas. The purpose of this proposed study is to analyze Hf and
Nd isotopes in marine sediments from outboard 12 subduction systems to determine
how prevalent this signature might be. The origin of this unusual Hf isotopic
fractionation is also uncertain, and these new data will help to constrain its
cause. Finally, the new data will be helpful for constraining the terrestrial
mass balance of Hf and Nd isotopic systems. The samples will mostly be ODP-
drilled sediments obtained from arcs with potentially high variations of Hf
isotopes and systems with very high sediment flux.&lt;br/&gt;
