&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0226095&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Stefan
T. Thynell&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation: Pennsylvania State
University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Fuel
Cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal deals with
the coupling between anisotropic thermal transport and water management in PEM
fuel cell membrane systems. Water management is critical to the efficient
operation of the fuel cell. The proposed research will include measurements of
the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the gas diffusion layer and the
electrolyte, as well as the gas and surface temperature of a 5 cm2 operating
fuel cell. An analytical model will account for orthotropic thermal
conductivity, as well as fluid mechanics, species transport, advection, and
electrochemistry. The results will have impact on fundamental understanding of
anisotropic thermal transport, will address the critical water management issues
for PEM fuel cells, and will serve to expose mechanical engineering students to
a technology area often considered to be outside the
discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
