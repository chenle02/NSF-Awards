Three micro-VAX processors are being acquired to be used both for pure
simulation/emulation and for an active distributed database systems testbed.
These machines are placed in a Dedicated Distributed Processing Lab and are
networked together. Computer engineering research at this facility broadly falls
into two categories, distributed computer systems and design of VLSI
architectures. Work in distributed computer systems supported by this equipment
includes efforts in: understanding the effects that different parameters and
components have on the performance of distributed database systems; the design
and evaluation of scheduling algorithms for distributed computer systems; and
the design and evaluation of channel access protocols for local area networks.
