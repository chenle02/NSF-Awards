This MRI award provides funds to support the acquisition of a high performance
computing system at Texas Southern University, a Historically Black University.
This acquisition will enable TSU faculty to pursue cutting edge research in the
areas of computational material science, nano-science, quantum chemistry,
electronic structure theory, strongly correlated plasma simulations, and the
further development of robust tools and methods for parallel processing and
distributed computing. This resource will be used directly in the research of
faculty members from Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology and Computer
Science. The computing system will also serve as a platform for promoting
interdisciplinary collaboration across the campus and for opening new areas of
research and research training.
