The processes of salt secretion play a fundamental role in the maintenance of
body fluid volume and concentration in the majority of vertebrate species, as
well as providing the basis for the secretory activity of a variety of different
glandular structures - such as the pancreas, salivary glands and tear (lacrimal)
glands. Amongst the most powerful salt-secreting tissues known are the so-called
"salt glands" found in certain non-mammalian vertebrates, which evolved
specifically for the elimination of excess salt from the body fluids. As such,
these tissues have recently become important model systems for the study of the
basic processes of salt secretion. As a group, the reptiles are unique in the
diversity of the salt glands they possess, both in their anatomical origin (e.g.
modified lacrimal glands, nasal glands, salivary glands) and in the nature of
the secretions produced (some secrete only sodium, others only potassium, and
still others can switch between the two). However, the cellular processes
involved in these diverse secretory activities and their control are completely
unknown. The aim of this project is to describe, at the cellular level, the
relevant secretory mechanisms and their control. This will not only increase the
understanding of these fundamental, and physiologically important, processes but
may also help us better understand the basis of certain widespread clinical
conditions (e.g. cystic fibrosis, cholera etc.) known to be associated with the
disruption of such salt-secreting activity in tissues.
