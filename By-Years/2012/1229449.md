City College of New York (CCNY) of the City University of New York (CUNY) aims
to acquire a state-of-the-art Vevo 2100 high-resolution micro-imaging ultrasound
system from Visualsonics. This imaging system will enable both basic science and
translational research by providing a novel biomedical research and ultrasound
contrast imaging platform for in vivo and ex-vivo studies in several research
fields. High resolution ultrasound allows real-time longitudinal studies on many
research fields such as cancer, atherosclerosis, tendon, cartilage and ligament
damage, tissue repair by stem cells, drug delivery, tissue biomechanics in
cardiovascular/soft tissues, the development of novel molecular probes and basic
science research on wave propagation on poroelastic media, experimental fluid
mechanics by Doppler velocimetry and development of photoacoustic sensors. No
such kind of imaging equipment exist in

CCNY, therefore, acquisition of this system will provide the perfect complement
to the existing imaging capabilities at CCNY (i.e. microCT, confocal and light
microscopes). Several faculty members from different departments of CCNY (BME,
ME, EE, Biology) will benefit of such system.
