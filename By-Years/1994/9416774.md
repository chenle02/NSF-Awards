9416774 Henyey This study will make use of the presence of the Lamont-Doherty
Research Vessel Maurice Ewing when it is in southern California waters in fall
1994 to acquire a refraction/wide angle reflection onshore-offshore transect
through the Northridge epicenter. The ship will be in southern California waters
as part of the Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment already funded by the NSF,
SCEC and USGS. The 10,000 in tuned air gun array on the R/V Ewing will be used
to add a north-south transect over the Transverse Ranges fold and thrust belt
form Santa Monica Bay to the western Mojave Desert through the Northridge
epicentral region. The results of this study will be combined with reprocessed
industry seismic reflection data from the San Fernando Valley to provide
information on the subsurface structure of the Santa Monica Mountain-Elysian
Park thrust ramp and the Northridge earthquake fault system as will as the San
Fernando Basin and its underlying crust.
