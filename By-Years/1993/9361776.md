9361776 Adams This project will develop a new architectural approach for
insuring synchronization and determinacy that will make clock synchronous fault
tolerant systems modular and capable of utilizing industry standard busses and
off-the-shelf cards. These architectural innovations will utilize the
organizations experience in designing, integrating, testing and fielding both
synchronous and non-synchronous fault tolerant systems. Clock synchronous fault-
tolerant systems are more efficient and easier to program than their loosely
synchronized counterparts. An architectural approach and implementation that
alleviates the characteristic inflexibility of this type system will be highly
marketable in the current fault tolerant computing market. ***
