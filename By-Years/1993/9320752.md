The overall goal of this research is to create a new class of synthesis tools
which address the design of complex controller-data path machines under
constraints of pre-defined interfaces. Because the results will be integrated
with commercial EDA design tools, a design output format, which can be simulated
and allows automated re-design of selected portions of the design, is being
developed. In a second task, approximate sequential reachability analysis is
being used to design and implement algorithms for optimizing and partitioning
controller designs. The third task is to explore scheduling algorithms for both
the control and data-path portions of the design. Finally, an optimizing
compiler is being built. It contains algorithms which solve encoding issues for
high performance designs, and performs re-scheduling of the data-path operations
to minimize required resources while maintaining design behavior.
