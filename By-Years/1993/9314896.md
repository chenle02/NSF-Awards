This project is a workshop to highlight the High Performance Computing (HPC)
National Challenge Applications in chemical, transport, and thermal systems. The
workshop will be held in Washington, DC on June 4, 1993. The workshop will
consist of five talks by academic researchers and an invited talk on HPC by an
NSF representative. The talks will provide a synopsis of HPC activity both
present and future in their research areas. The talks will focus on high
performance computing in the areas of: synthesis of electrorheological fluids;
microstructure modeling of complex fluids; process synthesis, design, and
optimization; and thermal effects in polymer processing technology. This
workshop will be held in Washington, DC, and the University of Wisconsin will
handle travel costs of the participants.
