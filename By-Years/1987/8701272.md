Control categories provide a first-order framework for the denotational
semantics of control structures in which programs are represented by algebraic
expressions. The main innovation is the emphasis of an axiomatized case
statement in terms of which program simplification has points in common with the
manipulation of linear combinations in noncommutative ring theory. Assertion
semantics is deduced and the Dijkstra composition rule is equivalent to
determinism. Under development is a theory of canonical form based on algebraic
reduction, matrix similarity invariants and equational and first-order
characterization. The thesis is that lines of attack familiar to algebraists
find new applications in theoretical computer science. Module-theoretic ideas
applied to a simplified model express conditional statements in terms of guard
action, leading to a canonical form expressed as a linear combination. A first-
order axiomatization of iteration discovered with Arbib in 1978 emphasizes how
iteration transforms and this leads to a proposed transformation theory
analogous to techniques used to solve linear differential equations. The P.I. is
a highly respected contributor to mathematical aspects of computer science. The
proposed work is expected to make a useful contribution to computer science
especially as it expands the understanding of the concept of control categories
as introduced recently by the P.I. JUSTIFICATION
