The major objective of the Protein Identification Resource is to develop a
biotechnological information resource of protein sequences and associated
information that is well verified, complete, and well organized according to
biological principles, including functional and evolutionary relationships. This
Resource is fundamental to developments in all phases of biomedical research; it
has already made major contributions to studies on evolution, on protein
structure/function relationships, and on the role of proteins (and the genes
specifying them) in many diseases. The information is essential to the basic
sciences for developments in areas related to protein and genetic engineering
and for interpretation of data generated in large genomic sequencing projects.
To cope with an extremely rapid influx of data without sacrificing quality and
reliability, new software tools, new procedures for data input and organization,
and methods for the international distribution of information collection are
being developed. The participation of the international community of biomedical
scientists in data collection, analysis, and verification is being encouraged.
Collaborations with the major nucleic acid sequence databases are being pursued
in order to set up mechanisms to minimize duplication of effort and to share
insights and experiences. Collaborations with the National Library of Medicine
and with databases containing related information, including particularly the
Brookhaven Protein Data Bank of three-dimensional structures, will contribute to
the organization of biological knowledge into a multidimensional matrix.
