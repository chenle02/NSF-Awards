This proposal is for partial support for a conference in hadron spectroscopy
and a one week school in the subject, aimed at graduate students and
postdoctoral associates, to be held the week immediately before the conference.
The proposed venue for both events is the University of Maryland at College
Park. The conference is fourth in a biennial series that began at the University
of Maryland in 1985, and was supported by NSF in that year. It has since
circulated through KEK in Japan in 1987, Ajjacio (Corsica) in 1989 and is now
proposed for Maryland in 1991. Broadly interpreted, in the sense of including
both light and heavy quark hadron states, the subject is of direct interest to
all experimental and most theoretical physicists. The focus of the proposed
conference is likely to be somewhat more on the light quark states where
interest is still quite widespread. At the present time, it appears that at
least one hundred persons have expressed an interest in attending the
conference. The school is also likely to be well attended at the level proposed
of about 20 students.
