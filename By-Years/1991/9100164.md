Most plant communities are comprised of many different growth forms with one
that usually dominates in biomass. Ecological studies tend to focus on the
dominant growth form and species, primarily because they process most of the
energy that flows through the system. However, when species richness is
considered, it is usually species within the subordinate growth forms that
contribute most to diversity. With the exception of ruderal species, relatively
little is known about the mechanisms by which subordinate species, especially
long-lived perennials, maintain themselves in communities. A comprehensive
evaluation of the mechanisms of persistence of these less common species is
critical to maintaining diversity within natural and restored communities. This
study will experimentally examine the mechanisms of persistence of tallgrass
prairies forbs (non-woody, perennial herbs) at the Konza Prairie Research
Natural Area. This site is characterized primarily by just two growth forms (the
dominant grasses and forbs) and this facilitates comparisons of resource use and
responses to fire, grazing, light regime, and nitrogen between dominant and
subordinate growth forms. The forbs share many life history characteristics and
owe their persistence within the tallgrass matrix to the long residence times of
established individuals/clones. A combination of descriptive studies and a full
factorial experiment involving water, N and light manipulations will be used to
elucidate the processes by which long-lived forbs maintain their presence in a
"sea of grass" that varies topographically and in fire history.
