This award is for partial support of a conference on operator algebras to be
held at UCLA in May 2006. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together
researchers in von Neumann algebras and/or ergodic theory. These two subjects
have had a synergistic relationship for more than five decades. Recent
achievements have re-emphasized the importance of this relationship. The meeting
in UCLA will explore the various ways that techniques from one area can be
fruitful when applied to the other. The main goal of the conference is to
develop a unified picture of recent progress in these areas.
