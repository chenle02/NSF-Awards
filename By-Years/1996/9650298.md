The intent of this project is to equip a laboratory in which students in
networking courses can complete exercises and perform experiments that enhance
the classroom learning occurring through lectures and discussions. This
laboratory is being used as a facility for developing and refining a set of
appropriate exercises and experiments which may then be shared with computer
science teachers at the undergraduate level. Networking is assuming an
increasingly central role in computing. Distributed systems are displacing
centralized computing facilities. This paradigm shift has no greater impact on
the curriculum than in the area of data communications and networking. The
change from a world of minis and mainframes to workstations, LANs, and WANs must
be reflected in the computer science curriculum. The new lab addresses both the
hardware and the software aspects of this change. As a consequence of this
shift, employers have an increased need for and a high expectation of networking
expertise on the part of the students that they hire. Also, coursework and
research at the graduate level are increasingly devoted to networks and
distributed systems. The lab provides the students with concrete examples of
things discussed conceptually in the lecture. The students also gain valuable
familiarity with hardware and software products that they may be working with in
their future careers or research situations.
