This research continues efforts to apply advanced interference spectroscopic
methods for studies in aeronomy. The study emphasizes applications that take
advantage of the improved sensitivity of a CCD detector with double and triple
etalon systems. These include geocoronal Balmer-alpha nightglow and (OI)6300
dayglow measurements. A primary goal is the full validation of our daysky
measurements. The system will be moved to the optical facility at Millstone Hill
in Massachusetts where measurements will routinely be coordinated and compared
with other optical and radar measurements. Other measurements planned will
extend the long baseline of geocoronal Balmer-alpha intensity measurements for
the purpose of studying solar cycle variations and the predicted variation of
exospheric hydrogen with lower atmosphere methane buildup.
