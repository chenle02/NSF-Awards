The theory that "water-stress" improves the nutritional quality of plants for
insect herbivores and leads to outbreaks has received much support. Although
studies report improved performances for insects fed water-stressed foliage
others have shown that insects either avoid or grow poorly on water-stressed
plant. It appears that Orthoptera and sapfeeding insects tend to benefit from
plant water-stress, but leaf chewers and skeletonizers do not. The P.I. Will
test the hypothesis and that the effect of water-stress in plants on herbivorous
insects depends on the feeding mode of the insect. He will perform preferences
and controlled rearing experiments examine the effects of water- stress in the
host plant on feeding and oviposition preference, growth, survival, and
fecundity in ten insect species distributed among three feeding guilds and four
insect orders. Soybeans will be the experiments since the physiology and
biochemistry of soybean under water-stress is well known. These experiments will
enhance our knowledge of the interactions of soybean with several of its insect
pests, and allow the identification of the effects of water-stress in plants on
insects herbivores depends on insect feeding mode. This information will help
explain the complex responses of insects to water-stressed plants.
