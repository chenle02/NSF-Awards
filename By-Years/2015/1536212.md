The U.S. has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in astronomy
infrastructure in Chile, and continues to invest tens of millions of dollars
more each year to operate federal telescopes. One avenue that can foster strong
relationships between the U.S.-funded observatories and local Chilean
communities is an extensive public outreach effort. This award will support the
Principal Investigator to organize and lead a Chile-U.S. Astronomy Education
Outreach Summit as the next step to strengthening that partnership. The
conference attendees will share best practices in astronomy education and
outreach, with almost all of the major U.S.-funded observatories based in Chile
taking part. In addition, personnel from Chilean educational and funding
institutions will attend. The workshop will produce a 'roadmap' that describes
the state of the art in astronomy education and public outreach, while at the
same time identifying future needs. This roadmap will be used by the major U.S.
astronomical facilities to guide their strategic planning. The resulting
education and outreach activities will also be transferable to both the US and
Chilean educational communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by
the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.
