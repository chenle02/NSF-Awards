Abstract for 0302854&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds technical assistance
to the NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program by providing planning,
logistical, and administrative support for an MRI proposal-writing workshop
targeted at the 32 tribal colleges throughout the United States. Guided by the
expertise of chosen exemplars, the workshop will provide an overview of the MRI
proposal-writing process, a guide to key proposal evaluation criteria, and
hands-on instruction intended to maximize the success of an institution's
submitted proposal. The ultimate goals of the workshop are to increase the
number of proposals submitted to the MRI program by U.S. tribal colleges in FY
2004 and to increase the competitiveness of the tribal colleges' proposals
within the overall submission pool.&lt;br/&gt;
