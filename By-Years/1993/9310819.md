9310819 Mooney A general goal of machine learning is automating the construction
of efficient knowledge-based systems. Current methods tend to focus on either
the acquisition of the basic domain knowledge (inductive learning) or the
acquisition of search-control knowledge (speedup learning). However, these two
tasks are not always cleanly separated. This research investigates the general
framework of learning search-control heuristics for logic programs, which can
improve both accuracy and efficiency. Logic programming provides a very general
and well-understood representational and computational platform on which to
build. Recent methods in inductive logic programming can be used to
automatically learn search-control heuristics from a set of training problems.
Efficiency may be improved by learning control rules that eliminate backtracking
during the search for a proof. Accuracy may be improved by learning control
rules that eliminate search paths that produce incorrect results.
