9361088 He The development of a new type of composite color filter is proposed.
This color filter will be composed of a polymer (Methyl Methacrylate) reinforced
with colored optical glass and will have the combined properties of a glass,
solution, and gelatin filter. Glass composition will be developed and techniques
for preparing composite color filter will be established. Basic properties of
glass fibers or composite filter will be established. Basic properties of glass
fibers or composite filter will be evaluated in this work. ***
