The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing an unmet need in incomplete
colonoscopy procedures. Incomplete colonoscopy procedures can result in missed
colorectal cancer and ultimately increased healthcare expenditures related to
follow-up procedures. Use of current balloon overtubes during colonoscopy can
significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes; However,
operating in todayâ€™s healthcare economy, colonoscopies and small bowel endoscopy
are modestly reimbursed placing considerable pressure on the endoscopist to
maximize patient throughput in an endoscopy lab at minimal cost. Current balloon
overtubes are not widely utilized except in challenging and highly tortuous
conditions due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application. This
project will provide endoscopists with an intraoperative tool that can
transition incomplete colonoscopies to completed procedures at a fraction of the
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
II project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated balloon
overtube that can be used intraoperatively. The technology represents a mid-
procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope to aid in completing
challenging colonoscopies and minimize the occurrence of incomplete
colonoscopies. The goal of this project is to achieve a safe, effective,
manufacturable device that exhibits a clinically acceptable user interface. The
advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete
colonoscopies for better patient health, using a cost effective endoscopy
accessory that is easy to use and time efficient. This novel approach provides a
new way of converting incomplete procedures to completed procedures to minimize
costs while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experiences. The
technological expertise that will be generated during this project will address
a critical unmet need in the colonoscopy market, while future versions may be
transferable to other fields of use in the medical procedure
realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
