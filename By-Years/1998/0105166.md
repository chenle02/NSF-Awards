CCR-0105166&lt;br/&gt;Luqi&lt;br/&gt;Naval Postgraduate
School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Monterey Workshop 2001- Engineering Automation for
Software Intensive System Integration"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3-day workshop, to
be held in Monterey, CA on June 19-21, is organized for the dissemination and
integration of recent research results related to the production of reliable
cost-effective software in heterogeneous environments. A major goal of the
workshop is to help the software engineering community focus on issues that are
vital to improving the state of software engineering practice, including all
topics related to supporting engineering automation of reliable, cost-effective,
integrated, distributed software development processes. The workshop activities
aim to assess current research efforts in this area, identify results and
directions that can increase the degree of automation, aid tool integration by
building a common understanding, and increase the practical use of formal
methods.&lt;br/&gt;
