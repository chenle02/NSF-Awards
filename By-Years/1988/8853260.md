The undergraduate laboratory capabilities will be expanded to include the area
of coherent optical measurement. The equipment will be used for experiments in
required undergraduate laboratory courses, serve as the laboratory basis for a
course on coherent optical measurement, and be used for undergraduate research
projects. This program is being undertaken because of the increasing use of
lasers and coherent optics in engineering applications and the need for
mechanical engineers who understand these techniques. The mechanics laboratory
and the thermal sciences laboratory are involved. Mechanics laboratory
experiments to be developed are interferometric measurements of simple beam
deflection and the measurement and visualization of the vibrational modes of a
clamped plate. In the thermal sciences laboratory, the equipment will be used
for visualization and temperature measurement of heat convecting flows. The
comprehensive undergraduate course in coherent optical methods will include
laser doppler velocimetry, holographic interferometry, and speckle photography.
Finally, the equipment will be used for senior level student research projects
in fluid mechanics, dynamics, and design. Some specific projects will include
visualization of separated flows, studies of crack propagation, and surface
contouring and profilometry.
