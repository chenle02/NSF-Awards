This award supports research on the representation theory of Lie algebras. The
principal investigator will continue work on the Lie cohomology of some vector
fields algebras. He will also consider the modular representations of Kac-Moody
algebras at the critical level. This research is concerned with a mathematical
object called a Lie algebra. Lie algebras arise from another object called a Lie
group. An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a sphere where one rotation
is followed by another. Lie groups and Lie algebras are important in areas
involving analysis of spherical motion.
