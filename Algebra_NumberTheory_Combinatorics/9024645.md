This award supports the research of Professor C. Rodger to work in
combinatorics. He will work on the embedding of partial latin squares of order n
into latin squares of order less than or equal to 2n. He also intends to work on
problems involving embedding triple systems and graph decompositions. The
research crosses lines between the areas of combinatorics and statistics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be organized. And so it is extremely important to
modern communications, for example the design of large networks as in telephone
systems. The main object to be studied in the proposed research, latin squares,
is a fundamental tool used in designing experiments and so in improving quality
control in many areas of production within the economy.
