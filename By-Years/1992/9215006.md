The main objectives of this study include: 1. To expand on a previous study and
determine required unit energy levels imparted to a soil to induce liquefaction
through laboratory testing of granular soils in the torsional shear device; 2.
To determine the energy levels required for liquefaction under random loading,
and compare them to the ones needed under sinusoidal loading; 3. To develop and
validate a rational procedure to determine the liquefaction potential of soil
deposits based on relationships between soil characteristics and energy levels,
along with time series of design earthquakes. The validation procedure will
include the analysis of time series and pore water pressure development records
obtained during earthquakes.
