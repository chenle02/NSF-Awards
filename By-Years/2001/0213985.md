The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
of Alabama investigates new materials that may lead to future information
technologies. The Center involves interdisciplinary research by faculty
participants from the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Materials and
Metallurgical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer
Engineering. The MRSEC research is organized into two interdisciplinary research
groups (IRGs). IRG1, Dynamics and Transport in Nanostructured Magnetic
Materials, focuses on the synthesis, characterization, modeling and optimization
of films of ordered, self-assembled, monodisperse, magnetic nanoparticles that
may serve as future extremely high density magnetic recording media. IRG2,
Dendrimer-Based Materials for Information Technology, investigates new
dendrimer-based materials for information technology and evolves from a seed
project that demonstrated long-term charge storage in special redox gradient
dendrimer molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center maintains shared
experimental facilities in support of its research and for student training. The
MRSEC also supports education and outreach efforts that include development of
instructional materials for middle school students by teachers and MRSEC
faculty, a summer research experience for teachers and undergraduates, and a
summer research program for faculty and students from Historically Black
Colleges and Universities. The Center has strong interactions with the magnetic
recording industry that inform the fundamental research done by the MRSEC
participants of 'real wotld' contraints and
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Center currently include 16
senior investigators, 5 postdoctoral associates, 13 graduate students, 1
undergraduate student and 1 support personnel. Professor William H. Butler
directs the MRSEC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
