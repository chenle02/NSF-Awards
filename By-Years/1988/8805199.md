The project aims to develop mathematics in the area of Algorithmic Geometry of
Numbers, apply the mathematics to sequential and parallel algorithms for Integer
Programming, testing and ensuring randomness of sequences and numerical
integration. It is intended that some of the algorithms will be implemented.
