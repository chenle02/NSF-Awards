ABSTRACT 97-07641 Kilham and Kreeger Collaborative Research: Effects of Seston
Quantity and Quality on Zooplankton in a Mesotrophic Lake Zooplankton are small
animals that abound in lakes where they serve as critical links in the food
chain. Zooplankton feed on microscopic plant, animal and dead organic material,
called seston. Like most animals, they are known to be negatively affected by
poor food availability and quality. This research will use microencapsulation
technology to produce a variety of artificial seston particles containing
specific biochemicals. These will be analyzed for their suitability as
zooplankton diets by measuring digestibility. The best particles will be
delivered to zooplankton as nutritional supplements to an otherwise poor diet,
and any increase in animal performance will be definitively attributed to the
specific biochemical in the supplement. Results of this study will help launch a
broader research program to examine how natural, mixed populations of
zooplankton can be nutritionally limited, a topic widely perceived to be a
fundamental hurdle to an improved understanding of aquatic ecology.
