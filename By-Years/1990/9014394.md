The oxidation of organic compounds is of concern in fuel cells, synthetic
electrochemistry, pollution control, and gas sensing. The complexity of the
desired reactions allows opportunities for unwanted side reactions to occur,
with the formation of undesirable blocking intermediates. To perform organic
oxidations without such complications, there is a need for the proper metal
surface to facilitate adsorption and cracking of molecules, as well as powerful
oxidizing conditions to overcome strongly bound intermediates. The latter
conditions are found, but are not limited to situations where oxide
semiconductors such as n-ZnO, N-TiO2, and n-SrTiO3A are used as the catalyst.
The PI plans to combine the desirable properties of both metals and
semiconductors to achieve an advanced catalytic electrode for facile oxidation
reactions by fabricating the electrode to take advantage of the hot hole effect.
He is planning studies of dark injection and photo-injection of hot holes into
thin metal films over n-type and p-type semiconductor substrates. His hot
carriers (holes) are available in the dark, and he will use metal films to
radically alter the catalytic properties of the semiconductor surface. The
method features the formation of excited states at metal surfaces that have, in
the past, been created only by high energy photoemission into the liquid
electrolyte. The physical and chemical properties of hot holes will be
investigated with emphasis on oxidation of organic species such as CO and
methanol and their oxidative intermediates.
