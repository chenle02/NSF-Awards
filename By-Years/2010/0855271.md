The FrameNet project has been building a lexical database
containing&lt;br/&gt;highly detailed information about the syntax and semantics
of the&lt;br/&gt;different senses of English words, with applications such as
question&lt;br/&gt;answering and information extraction. The database is based
on&lt;br/&gt;Charles Fillmore's theory of Frame Semantics, relating word
meanings&lt;br/&gt;to conceptualizations of situations and their participants,
ranging&lt;br/&gt;from simple actions like Placing to complex events such as a
Criminal&lt;br/&gt;process, with subevents like Arraignment and Trial.
The&lt;br/&gt;generalizations are derived from annotated example sentences
from&lt;br/&gt;large text corpora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this planning grant,
input will be gathered from researchers in the&lt;br/&gt;NLP field regarding how
the FrameNet data is currently being used, how&lt;br/&gt;it can be made more
useful to a wider range of users, and how it can&lt;br/&gt;be enhanced so as to
enable new directions of research. As part of&lt;br/&gt;this, a series of
conferences will be held, both face-to-face and by&lt;br/&gt;videoconference, to
plan future FrameNet development and cooperation&lt;br/&gt;and alignment of data
with other lexical resources and annotation&lt;br/&gt;projects, such as WordNet,
PropBank, OntoNotes, etc., with the&lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of improving results
in sense disambiguation, semantic&lt;br/&gt;role recognition, and natural
language understanding in general.&lt;br/&gt;
