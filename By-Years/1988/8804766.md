Sixteen undergraduates from schools other than the University of Tenn at
Knoxville are participating in various research projects. Some of the projects
are: 1. Implementation of the algorithm of Prelle-Singer as modified by
Shtokhamer/Glinos/Caviness for finding integrating factors for first order
differential equations. 2. Using graphics tools to study the actions of
algorithms for sparse matrix computations. 3. Neural network learning of latin
grammar. 4. Designing a functional systems programming language. 5. Performance
analysis of distributed algorithms. 6. Development of intelligent information
system.
