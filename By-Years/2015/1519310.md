The University of Washington will host a national workshop where graduate
students in data science disciplines will interact to explore data science grand
challenges in a collaborative environment. The project will implement a novel
idea and advance the understanding of how to develop data science communities by
engaging graduate students, academia, and industry. It also addresses an
important national need for researchers with cross-disciplinary training in data
science and serves as a catalyst for other institutions to integrate data
science skills more broadly throughout the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the project is to help create a highly connected workforce that is adept
at cross-disciplinary communication and idea synthesis, primed to solve a new
generation of data science and big data challenges. To accomplish this goal, the
investigators will conduct a 2.5-day workshop for approximately 100 attendees
that is designed to (1) introduce graduate students to new data science concepts
and applications, (2) enable students to interact with experts from industry,
domain, and methodology fields, and (3) initiate the establishment of a
professional community using team building activities. The investigators will
conduct a pre-workshop promotional campaign and develop a web site where users
can connect and share their ideas. Following the workshop, a set of white
papers, team reports, and a workshop report will be available to the public.
