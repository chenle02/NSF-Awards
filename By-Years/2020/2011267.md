Nuclei are the basic building blocks of matter and understanding their
fundamental properties is the main goal of this award. The PI and her team of
undergraduate students will use the newly developed La Crosse fIREBAll detector
system, located at the University of Notre Dame’s Nuclear Science Laboratory, to
measure conversion electrons in the Erbium-166 nucleus. This information will be
combined with previous data to address an open question in nuclear physics about
how or if nuclei vibrate. This research program will involve the University of
Wisconsin – La Crosse undergraduate students early in their scientific career in
publishable research through detector development, data analysis, and
collaborative projects. The students will present their work at national
conferences, be involved in writing results in peer-reviewed papers, and acquire
skills important for the next generation of
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclei show some emergent collective behavior
across isotopic and isobaric chains and are known to be deformed in shape in
regions of the chart of nuclides away from closed shell. This award will
investigate the vibrational degrees of freedom superimposed on the deformed
ground states and the expected rotational excited states built upon them. The PI
and her team of undergraduate students aim to determine the characteristics of
excited state by the measurement of conversion electrons in coincidence with
gamma rays, using the only array of its kind in the US. At the University of
Wisconsin-La Crosse students will also work on High Purity Germanium (HPGe)
detectors in a small local laboratory. All experiments will be performed,
analyzed, and disseminated in collaboration with UWL undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
