The Political Science Department of The Ohio State University in conjunction
with the American Political Science Association is conducting a three-week
summer (1992) workshop on the teaching and research applications of statistical
data analysis. The general objective is to enhance the instruction of
undergraduates in the research practices of political scientists with access to
a large variety of individual and aggregate, citizen and leader data on
political and related phenomena. This includes data on a number of democratic
nations, international relations, elections of members of state legislators,
voting in the U.S. Congress, presidential elections, and the U.S. Supreme Court.
One of the hallmarks of political science research has been a growing attention
to systematic observation across time. In addition to using a variety of
statistical techniques, from bi-variate cross- tabulations to multi-variate
analysis, experimentation with the comparative advantages of data analysis,
using programs on large mainframe computers, as opposed to programs designed for
microcomputer processing, will be conducted.
