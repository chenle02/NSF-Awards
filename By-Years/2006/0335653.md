The PI proposes a three -year project for the examination of technology-based,
data driven instructional decision-making tools, their implementation, their
effectiveness and impact on different levels of school systems (i.e.,
administrators and teachers). Research questions include can tools facilitate
decision-making and how to use such tools and data to enhance instruction. The
Investigators will leverage work from three current projects, each focused on
the development/implementation of a different tool available for teachers to
assess student progress. They are: &lt;br/&gt;o Grow Network - a web-based test
reporting system, which disaggregates state test data &lt;br/&gt;o IBM
Reinvention Education Warehousing project - offers educators, etc. access to a
broad range of data from attendance to test scores and grades. &lt;br/&gt;o
Wireless Generation - handheld technology for teachers for on-going diagnostic
assessment of student math learning at grades 3-4-4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
plan is to develop and validate an evaluation framework, which will be developed
within the context of a systems perspective, using multiple methodologies
(formative and summative) at multiple levels, including systems
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
