A novel method is being developed for study of sub-threshold synaptic events
that occur within individual neurons in the awake mammalian brain. Unlike
traditional methods which require impalement and resultant damage to a nerve
cell by an intracellular microelectrode, the present method uses an electrode
which is extracellular. Far less cellular damage results, therefore, and sub-
threshold synaptic events can be studied for very long periods of time. The
method entails passing extracellular current pulses through a recording
microelectrode and measuring the threshold of the neuron under study to this
direct electrical stimulation. This research explores the application of this
new method to two problem areas in cortical neurophysiology: (1) the analysis of
sub- threshold receptive fields and components of receptive fields in sensory
neocortex, and (2) the analysis of sub-threshold synaptic inputs to neurons
studied with chronically implanted electrodes over very long periods of time.
This research will contribute to a better understanding of the cortical neuronal
substrates of sensory perception and the dynamic mechanisms by which the
properties of individual neurons are modified by experience over long periods of
time.
