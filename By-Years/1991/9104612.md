This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of an X- ray fluorescence
spectrometer that will be installed and operated in the Department of Geology at
Brigham Young University. The University is committed to providing matching
funds for this equipment acquisition. The equipment will be used for rock and
mineral analysis in research areas of igneous petrology, economic geology,
volcanology, and archeology. Five faculty members and their students in the
Department of Geology have currently active research programs in these areas and
need the analytical capabilities of the X-ray Fluorescence system as an integral
part of their research projects. In addition, another ten faculty members at
Brigham Young University have documented occasional need of the instrument for
research and teaching projects.
