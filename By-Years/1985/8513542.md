This research project performs experimental as well as theoretical studies of
the mechanisms involved in miniemulsion copolymerization. This study aims at
exploring the mechanism and the rate of interparticle monomer transport between
miniemulsion droplets and its effect on particle morphology. The results could
ultimately be used to predict the conditions (additive concentration and droplet
size) under which the transport of one monomer or the other to the site of the
polymerization becomes limiting, and thus develop a novel method for regulating
the particle morphology and therefore the microstructure of the final copolymer.
