Climate change and pandemic disease are two of the most daunting challenges of
the twenty-first century. In this new era with the potential for increased
temperatures and climate variability, controlling the spread of infectious
diseases will require a deep understanding of how climate variation influences
parasitic diseases. Most studies of climate-disease interactions have focused on
mean temperature and precipitation, ignoring short-term climate fluctuations.
This approach assumes that neither parasites nor their hosts acclimate to
temperature shifts, despite evidence that such acclimation responses are
pervasive in ectothermic hosts. Accounting for these acclimation responses could
dramatically alter predictions of climate-disease models, particularly for
diseases with ectothermic hosts and vectors (e.g., malaria). However, there is
currently no quantitative theory describing parasite and host acclimation
responses to temperature shifts. Johnson and his colleagues will fill this
important gap in knowledge by (1) developing a mathematical model describing how
temperature variability influences parasitic infection, (2) parameterizing this
model in a trematode-tadpole system using a series of controlled temperature
experiments, and (3) testing quantitative predictions of the model across
different timescales of temperature variability in artificial ponds. Their
central hypothesis is that parasites acclimate to temperature changes more
rapidly than their hosts because of their smaller sizes and faster metabolisms,
leading to higher infection rates under variable-temperature conditions. This
project will also train undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral research
scholars and promote science awareness through public outreach and workshops for
K-12 teachers.
