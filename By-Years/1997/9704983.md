NSF: DMS 9704983 Statistical Methods for Models with Constraints and Incomplete
Data Y.Vardi and C-H Zhang Rutgers University ABSTRACT Statistical methods and
inference tools for problems with incomplete - data and constrained -parameters
will be developed. There are four main research topics: The first topic covers
regression and multisample data under selection bias that depends on the
response variable. A number of semiparametric models (parametric weight
functions, nonparametric base distribution) are studied and maximum likelihood
procedures with related inference tools are developed. Applications to HIV
clinical trial are proposed. The second topic focuses on estimation in
multinomial models subject to upper and lower bound constraints on the cell
probabilities. This method is incorporated into an EM algorithm for image
reconstruction in discrete tomography . The third topic extends current
semiparametric regression models to truncation-censoring cases and
heteroscedastic regression models with censored data. The fourth topic centers
on inference for right-censored random (growth) curves, where the censoring
mechanism depends on the progression of the curve. This is informative,
nonignorable, censoring and it poses methodological challenges for the problems
of comparing two groups of curves (treatment and control). Methodolgy based on
U-type statistics is developed, and a semiparametric accelerated growth
regression model is introduced to model relationship between the curves and
their corresponding covariates. The research centers on statistical methods for
problems in which data collection is impaired by sampling bias, missing
observations, and models with partial information on the parameters. The
developed methods contributes directly to certain scientific areas considered of
strategic national importance. The research on estimating cell-probabilities in
constrained multinomial models is incorporated in an algo rithm for image
reconstruction of binary images in electron transmission tomography; an
important high-tech technology, still in research stages, for estimating the
atomic structure of a crystal layer by taking projection measurements. This is
important in material studies and in manufacturing. The research on
semiparametric selection-bias models relates to applications in biotechnology,
as it is developed in preparation for planned HIV vaccine trials. The goal here,
is to have a methodology in place for analyzing HIV-1 sequence data arising from
forthcoming vaccine trials.
