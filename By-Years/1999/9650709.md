This project supports the purchase of a gas chromatography/mass spectrometer
(GC/MS) system, including both headspace equipment and an automatic sampler.
This instrument is an integral part of new research-based experiments in general
chemistry, chemical analysis, organic chemistry, and instrumentation and in
undergraduate research. Chemical educators recognize the value of introducing
students to research early in their careers, as it increases their interest and
enthusiasm; however, few have implemented such experiments in the general
chemistry laboratory. This project develops new research-based environmental
experiments that can be introduced into the general chemistry and analytical
chemistry curricula and serve to support the newly formed environmental science
and studies concentrations. These experiments introduce students to the
applicability of GC/MS to environmental study, particularly in the analysis of
organics in natural water samples. This project further illustrates the
usefulness of this technique by incorporating it into laboratory experiments
that emphasize its importance in the bioanalytical (drug analysis, peptide
structure) and organic fields. The GC/MS system has the capability to perform
the analysis of volatile organic contaminants of water (headspace equipment),
mass spectral library searches, single ion monitoring, and deconvolution
(difference spectra) of overlapping peaks, and is able to facilitate the timely
analysis of many samples (automatic sampler). This instrumentation can have a
broad impact on science (chemistry, biology, and geology) majors and non-
science-majors and especially on those students interested in environmental
science.
