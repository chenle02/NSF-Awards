Ultra-high-energy neutrinos are unique astrophysical messengers as they interact
only weakly with intervening matter and can therefore be used to probe the
distant universe. A small but observable flux of these ultra-high-energy
neutrinos are expected to be produced in interactions between high-energy
"cosmic ray" charged particles traveling through the Universe and Cosmic
Microwave Background photons. Observations of these cosmogenic neutrinos probe
the structure and evolution of the Universe and test physics at energies beyond
the standard models. Utilizing the large volume of radio transparent ice,
several pioneering efforts to detect these high energy neutrinos have been
implemented in Antarctica. Ultra-high-energy neutrinos traveling through the
dense Antarctic ice generate cascades of particles that emit observable radio
waves. This award will support operations and continued development of the
Hexagonal Radio Array (HRA), located on the surface of the Ross Ice Shelf in
Antarctica. HRA is designed to detect short-duration radio pulses generated by
neutrino interactions in the ice, which reflect from the ice-water surface at
the bottom of the Ross Ice Shelf up to the stations on the surface. This award
provides funding to improve the detector characterization and continue
observations. The group will utilize a variety of outreach activities, including
twitter feeds and personal blogs, to engage the public in the
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consisting of seven autonomous stations, HRA is
intended to demonstrate the technology, assess data quality, and evaluate
backgrounds as the first phase of a larger project, the Antarctic Ross Ice-shelf
ANtenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA.) With data from the HRA stations, the group
will further characterize the sources and properties of non-thermal
contributions, and improve the accuracy of detector simulation and event
reconstruction programs.
