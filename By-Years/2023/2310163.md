The Telescope Array (TA) Observatory is the largest detector of ultra-high
energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in the Northern Hemisphere. A combination of surface
detectors (SD) and florescence detectors (FD) provides the ability to observe
and characterize cosmic ray events at the highest energies. This award renews
support for the TA Observatory data analysis activities of the cosmic ray group
at the University of Utah, including graduate student researchers, conducting
studies of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray spectrum and composition and the
tentative TA “hotspot” regions. The team will also continue to develop the
ASPIRE outreach program that includes web lessons and direct interactions with
the local community.

The TA observatory measurements have provided indications of possible
differences in the cosmic ray spectral shape at the highest energies when
compared to the Pierre Auger Observatory, the largest UHECR detector in the
southern hemisphere. In addition, a “hotspot” of UHECRs above 57 EeV in the
northern hemisphere has emerged at 3.5 sigma significance. Advanced studies of
the hotspot region, for which the potential source remains unknown, show initial
indications of differences in the cosmic ray spectral shape for events within
compared to outside, as well as an apparent declination dependence of the
spectrum at the highest energies. Additional data collection underway with the
TAx4 array, combined with the energy calibrations realized with the FD, will
improve the sensitivity of the observatory toward resolving these open questions
in the understanding of the highest energy particles in the Universe.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
