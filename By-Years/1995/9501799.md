The research project will investigate operating system and application issues
in a network that includes mobile and wireless hosts. Recent advances in
wireless technologies and light-weight computers make it attractive to build
networks that combine traditional workstations and servers with portable
computers. But portables will not achieve equivalence to stationary hosts unless
the portables can remain continuously connected to the network, even when
changing locations or communication devices. The project, called MosquitoNet,
will increase the connectivity of mobile hosts using the following approaches.
(1) Enable portable computers to move seamlessly from one communications medium
to another; for example, from an Ethernet connection to a wireless modem,
without rebooting or restarting applications. (2) Determine the feasibility of
hiding the resulting changes in throughput, latency and other network
characteristics from applications. (3) Design a simple interface to expose these
changing characteristics to applications as necessary. (4) Examine communication
device usage patterns for use in implementing battery life extension policies.
(5) Develop new file data consistency algorithms for use in a distributed mobile
environment where disconnection is allowed but not mandatory. The educational
component of the CAREER project will modernize and vitalize the teaching of
operating systems and distributed systems at the Stanford University. In
particular a new course on wireless and mobile computing will be introduced
along with the introduction of new teaching tools, topics and projects into the
current curriculum on opepating systems and distributed systems.
