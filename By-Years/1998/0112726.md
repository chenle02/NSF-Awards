It is planned to addresses the high-fidelity storage and manipulation of quantum
information in trapped atomic ions. Rudimentary quantum logic operations will be
demonstrated between a few qubits, using atomic cadmium ions confined in a rf
ion trap. This will permit a demonstration of repetitive quantum error-
correction schemes. Multiplexing schemes will also be investigated.
