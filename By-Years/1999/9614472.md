The purpose of this research is to provide information of the timing of initial
occupations of the western Aleutian Islands, help identify the contemporaneity
of groups living on Buldir and Attu, and provide a clearer cultural chronology
by documenting well dated stylistic change in artifacts. The research also
includes gathering ethnographic and historical information from the remaining
Attuans who once inhabited the western Aleutians. Archaeological data combined
with information from oral histories of the last surviving Attuans will shed
light on the lifeways of some of the last hunters/gathers to inhabit the western
Aleutians.
