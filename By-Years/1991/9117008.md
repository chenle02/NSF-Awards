Scientific data types show promise for support of scientific computing at all
computer system levels, from programming and visualization tasks, through
compiler and database technology, to operating systems. Rather than having a
distinct data type mechanism at each level, this project concentrates on a
coordinated approach across the levels of compiling, data management and
operating systems, centered on database support for scientific data types. Key
aspects of the project are the development and deployment of a Hybrid Data
Manager as a software substrate for rapid experimentation in coordinated data
type support across these layers. The HDM uses object-oriented database
technology to build a powerful front end for data type instances residing in
other storage systems. Existing datasets, as well as newly created objects are
to be supported using a staged approach that can lend some support to existing
codes while providing full data type support for newly created applications. An
important phase of the project is the deployment of the HDM on applications in
current use in two scientific domains, computational molecular chemistry and
microstructure property predictions in materials science. The experience gained
in this project will provide input in the design of a new generation of database
systems that will better support the space and modeling demands of scientific
applications as well as integrate tightly with compiler and operating system
components for increased performance.
