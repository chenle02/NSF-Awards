This project will greatly enhance our ability to teach about the importance of
accurate chemistry reports and their use in manufacturing and quality
engineering. Accurate chemistry reports are needed for on-site alloy
preparation, on-site heat treatment activities, stress/strain diagram
interpretation, metallographic sample analysis, material removal and horsepower
calculations, and quality assurance report preparation. These subjects are
covered more than once in at least four of our courses. The courses identified
are required for all Engineering and Industrial Technology majors in the
department. Specifically, the project will use a 24 element capable Glow
Discharge Emissions Spectrometer and a Carbon/Sulfur Determinator system to
accurately determine all alloying elements in the aluminum, copper base, and
ferrous based alloys. This will allow students to instantly analyze and
mathematically adjust furnace heats in the foundry, select appropriate phase
diagrams and time/temperature/ transformation diagrams for various heat
treatment activities and obtain hard copy print-outs of chemistry reports that
would typically be used for quality assurance reports.
