The objective of this project is to develop adaptive numerical methods for the
first principles prediction of the properties of technologically important
materials. These materials may be characterized as having complex structures and
compositions, large numbers of particles (> 100) and little or no symmetry. The
methods being investigated include a suite of iterative, acceleration, and
minimization schemes for the nonlinear eigenvalue problem and accompanying
elliptic problem arising in first principles prediction of material properties.
This suite includes the eigenvalue iterative methods of Rayleigh-Ritz and
Longsine and McCormick; minimization methods such us conjugate gradient,
steepest descent, and the trace minimization method by Sameh and Wisniewski; and
multilevel methods such as multigrid and fast multipole method. These methods
will be used with adaptive grid to exploit the underlying dynamical, localized
structure inherent in electronic wave functions. Modern parallel architectures
will be used to reduce the computational time and memory costs. The various
components of this project will be developed through the close collaboration of
researchers from chemistry, physics, computer science, and numerical analysis.
