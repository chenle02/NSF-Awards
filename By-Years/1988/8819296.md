The object of this research project is to develop, plan and conduct the Fifth
North American Masonry Conference in June of 1990. The location of the three-day
conference will be the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Like former North American Masonry Conferences, the meeting will provide a
unique forum for the exchange of information and ideas on topics related to
masonry design, engineering, research and construction. Attendance at the
conference will be of interest to researchers as well as practicing engineers
and architects, manufacturers and construction people. Equivalent dissemination
results cannot be obtained at regular meetings of professional societies because
of the diverse nature of professional interests in the masonry industry.
