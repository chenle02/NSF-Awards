A three-day workshop is planned for Fall 1985 at the University of California at
Los Angeles, to determine and clarify the basic research needs in the field of
building acoustics. Research in building acoustics to date will be surveyed and
then projected to new areas of concern, including verification of theoretical
analysis and simulation by acoustics modeling, comparison of building
performance with reference to acoustics regulations, examination of existing
design systems and optimization, and application to building design and
construction. Emphasis will be placed on the examination of building acoustics
as an integrated part of environmental conditions and control systems in
buildings. The relationship of building acoustics to thermal requirements,
lighting, and other environmental factors in buildings will be considered.
