9400712 Knoll Processes of organic decay and fossilization impose strong filters
on the paleontological record. Because extraordinarily well-preserved fossils
retain biological information not commonly available in sedimentary rocks, they
have played a key role in the interpretation of plant and animal evolution. They
are equally important in attempts to understand Precambrian life. I propose a
comprehensive systematic, taphonomic, paleoecological, and biostratigraphic
study of three exceptionally well-preserved fossil assemblages that collectively
shed significant new light on the early history of eukaryotic organisms: the
ca.750 million year old (Ma) Multicolored Series, Greenland; the 100-1100 Ma old
Ruyang Group, China; and what is among the best preserved and most diverse of
all Precambrian fossil assemblages, the 600-580 Ma old Doushantuo Formation,
south China. Information gathered in these studies will contribute to a new data
base (DELTA System) of Proterozoic Eukaryotes that will simultaneously serve as
a taxonomic key and a tool for exploring the environmental and age distribution
of radiating eukaryotic taxa and characters. In a practical vein, these data
will contribute to a growing biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental framework
that is proving valuable in rapidly expanding exploration for Neoproterozoic
resources.
