The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program will support Charles S. Parmenter of
Indiana University in Bloomington to continue his studies of state-resolved
energy transfer in various molecules. The gist of his experiment is to use a
supersonic molecular beam technique to generate molecules in a few, very
specific rotational states. Laser pumping is then used to excite the molecule to
the first singlet electronic excited state, and dispersed fluorescence detection
of states populated by inelastic scattering yields relative cross sections for
single collision energy transfer channels. Past efforts involved scattering of
glyoxal (12 vibrational modes) from rare gases or diatomic molecules. During
this funding period, the investigator will extend his studies on glyoxal to
collisions with helium or diatomic hydrogen. He will also study relative cross
sections as a function of center-of-mass energy between collision partners.
Finally, the crossed beam experiments will be extended to deuterated
formaldehyde, a molecular system far different from glyoxal due to its nonplanar
excited electronic state, presence of a dipole moment and extreme anharmonicity
in an active vibrational mode. The research is directed at the problem of
vibrational and rotational energy flow within polyatomic molecules. This is
central to the problem of how molecules acquire the activation energy needed for
reactions. The collision-free vibrational energy flow is a fundamental aspect of
dissociation or isomerization of molecules with high vibrational excitation.
