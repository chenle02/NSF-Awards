This project will create a web-based, spoken dictionary of Eastern Pomo with a
Pomo elder who is the lone fluent native speaker, to meet the speech community's
need for modern documentation of this fast disappearing language. One of seven
distinct Pomoan languages, Eastern Pomo fills a unique gap in this family of
languages and is seriously under-documented. The spoken dictionary will be
constructed within the Pomo Language Repository, an existing, password-
protected, web application that features a searchable database of digital Pomo
language resources. In creating the first digital spoken dictionary of Eastern
Pomo, this project will model methods for contextualizing Pomo language
documentation within a modern conversational learning framework, while providing
an accessible resource for Eastern Pomo learners, teachers and scholars.

The research team for this project will consist of a linguist, Pomo community
members who staff the California Indian Museum and Cultural Center (CIMCC) Pomo
Language Preservation Program, and the speaker of Eastern Pomo. The team will
begin the project by working with CIMCC's database specialist to create a
lexical database, the structure of which will guide the subsequent fieldwork.
The team will then work together to record 80 hours or more of the language data
needed to create the dictionary. Modern documentation of Eastern Pomo is scarce.
With only one fluent speaker remaining, it is vital to create a modern record of
the language practices characteristic of Eastern Pomo to inform on-going
conversational growth in the language as conversation is the heart of language
revitalization and cultural development.
