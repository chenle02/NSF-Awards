Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0406078&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Bennett Chow, Peter Li, &lt;br/&gt;Zhiqin Lu, Lei
Ni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for three years of
meetings&lt;br/&gt;of the Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar, a
series&lt;br/&gt;that is organized by UC San Diego and UC Irvine and
brings&lt;br/&gt;together researchers in geometric analysis and related
topics&lt;br/&gt;from those campuses, Caltech, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC
Santa&lt;br/&gt;Barbara, USC, and other schools in the region. The
organizers&lt;br/&gt;place a priority on the participation of graduate students
and&lt;br/&gt;recent PhDs, especially members of underrepresented groups.
The&lt;br/&gt;Seminar meetings are the unique annual meeting of their kind
in&lt;br/&gt;the Southern California area, and this conference series has
a&lt;br/&gt;valuable history of building connections between
mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;in the region.&lt;br/&gt;
