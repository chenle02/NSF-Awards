Seeing is Believing: An Investigative Microscopy Project for Introductory
Biology Students This is an investigative process oriented microscopy project in
an Introductory Biology Course for majors. This project facilitates learning
basic microscopy and also teaches observation, critical thinking, and research
skills. Students use both light and scanning electron microscopes as
investigative tools. The photomicrography equipment enables students to record
data about chosen specimens and subsequently analyze structure (i.e., measuring
size of various cellular features, etc.). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
provides greater levels of resolution, and the opportunity to do comparative
structural analysis in addition to its function of recording data.
Implementation of this project will improve the quality of the laboratory
experience in an Introductory Biology Course. It will allow beginning students
hands-on access to modern instrumentation, improve research skills, and provide
opportunities for a process oriented learning experience rather than the
traditional cookbook approach.
