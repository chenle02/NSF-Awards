This research is on the test and diagnostic tools for bridging and leakage
faults, and to build a comprehensive fault model for these faults. The approach
is to utilize current monitoring techniques, which provide better observability
than present response generators. This technique is being used to develop
simpler, more efficient, more effective algorithms which will form the basis for
a new set of test tools. Algorithms for computing test strings for partial scan,
test generators for built-in-self-test, fault simulation, and diagnostic tools
are being explored. The impact of these algorithms on circuit design is also
being explored through the building of tools based on the algorithms
