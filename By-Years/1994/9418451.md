In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Professor Weltner of the
University of Florida will study matrix-isolated clusters. Measurements will be
made using Electron Spin Resonance, Electron Nuclear Double Resonance, and Far
Infrared spectroscopy in high magnetic fields. Information to be obtained from
these studies includes structures, ground state symmetry and multiplicity,
energies of low lying excited electronic states, zero-field splittings, spin
densities, and other electronic and magnetic properties. Species to be studied
include the Group IIIA elements, Rare-Earth metal molecules and their oxides and
hydrides, and Transition Metal molecules and their oxides and hydrides. The
information obtained from these studies will allow valuable comparisons with
theory, and has applications in the areas of catalysis and semiconductors.
Professor Weltner will trap small metal particles at low temperature and
determine their structures and electronic and magnetic properties. These metal
clusters exhibit widely varying reactivities and electrical characteristics
depending on size and the particular metal used. The information from this study
will be useful in understanding how catalysts behave, and in designing more
efficient semiconductors.
