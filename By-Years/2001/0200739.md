************Abstract*****************************************&lt;br/&gt;The
principal investigators, Guihua Gong and Liangqing Li, propose to continue their
research on the classification of separable, amenable C*-algebras. They also
plan to study the cross product C*-algebras which arise naturally in the study
of dynamical systems. The methods to be employed include KK-theory, E-theory,
homotopy path with controlled length, and spectrum cutting and
absorption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The passage from a finite to an infinite number
of degrees of freedom in quantum physics led to the mathematical theory of
certain infinite dimensional algebras, called C*-algebras. A C*-algebra is an
algebraic system, similar to that of numbers, with its operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. But unlike the multiplication for
numbers, the multiplication in a C*-algebra is not commutative ---- that is, in
general, X times Y is not as same as Y times X. This important feature
corresponds to Heisenberg uncertainty principle in Quantum Mechanics. The
investigators propose to work on a complete enumeration (or classification) of a
large class of amenable C*-algebras. They expect that progress on the proposed
research will result in important contributions to several mathematical fields
including operator algebras, differential topology, and also to the
understanding of the infinite dimensional world of quantum physics.&lt;br/&gt;
