9315900 Walker This is a project to examine, in detail, the Re-Os systematics of
two suites of ultramafic rocks, the ca. 2.0 Ga Pechenga ferropicrites and the
ca. 150 Ma Gorgona Island komatiites. Both whole rocks and mineral separates
will be analyzed from each location. The resulting information should lead to:
1) a better understanding of where Re and Os are sited in these types of rocks
and what phases or combination of phases provide useful information about
initial isotopic compositions, and 2) a characterization of the long-term Re-Os
histories of the mantle reservoirs from which the rocks were derived. The
Pechenga ferropicrites are associated with extensive Ni mineralization. The Re-
Os systematics of these ores will also be utilized as a tracer for determining
the sources of noble metals contained in the ores and how they were affected by
subsequent metamorphism.
