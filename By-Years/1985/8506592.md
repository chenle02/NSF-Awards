This research involves a collaborative theoretical and experimental study
relevant to microelectronics processing. The results are expected to have
significant applications to an important area of technology and to contribute to
basic knowledge about fundamental atomic and molecular processes in a plasma
environment. The widespread use of plasmas in the dry processing of electronic
devices has renewed interest in the chemistry and physics of low pressure, low
temperature glow discharges. Anistropic etching can be achieved by a synergism
of ion and neutral heterogeneous chemistry. It is of crucial importance to
investigate the plasma electric fields and collisional phenomena which govern
the anistropy of ion transport and influence the plasma-surface chemistry.
