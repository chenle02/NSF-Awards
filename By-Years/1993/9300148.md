The objective of this project is to provide opportunities for eligible
undergraduate students in Science and Engineering to participate in a high
quality state of the art research program in the Materials Research Laboratory
(MRL) at Washington University. This three year program will provide
opportunities for ten undergraduates to participate during a ten week summer
period each year. The undergraduate students will conduct their research under
the supervision of three faculty members in the MRL. The MRL is currently
organized primarily as a graduate program conducting research in a wide variety
of areas with support from government, industry, and the university. The faculty
of MRL is nationally and internationally recognized for their particularly in
the area of composite materials.
