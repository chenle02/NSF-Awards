9361403 Manasson A novel integrated optics device which combines a waveguide
Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a Gunn oscillator is proposed. One potential
application of the device is as an optical clock generator with selfexcited
oscillations of light propagating through the device. In the Phase I project, a
theoretical understanding of the underlying phenomena will be developed, and a
proof-of-concept experiment will demonstrate the device's feasibility. Various
semiconductor materials will be studied for their potential applications in the
device. Up to 100 GHz clock-frequency is anticipated after the full-scale
development of the device in Phase II. ***
