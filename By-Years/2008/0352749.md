The project concerns several closely related problems in the theory of unipotent
elements in algebraic groups, with applications to the structure theory of
algebraic groups and finite groups of Lie type. A new approach to the analysis
of centralizers of unipotent elements will be carried out, based on commuting
pairs of reductive groups as developed in a recent paper of Seitz. New
information resulting from this analysis will be applied to the study of a
certain abelian subgroup canonically associated with a unipotent element, to
obtain new information on saturation, to establish saturation results for
certain sets of unipotent elements, and to study a new partial order on
unipotent classes. These results will be used to study problems on the subgroup
structure of algebraic groups and their finite analogs, in particular the
modular version of the problem of determining conjugacy classes of finite simple
subgroups of exceptional groups over the complex numbers.

The theory of groups is sometimes described as the mathematics of symmetry. It
is a fundamental subject within mathematics and has applications in a variety of
scientific fields. Certain types of groups, those arising from Lie theory, occur
time and again in widely different contexts and so it is important to establish
general results about these groups. This project is aimed at obtaining such
information for algebraic groups and associated finite groups of Lie type. These
groups contain special elements, called unipotent elements, which play a
particularly important role in the general theory. In spite of their fundamental
importance, certain mysteries regarding these elements remain to be understood
and some basic results are in an unsatisfactory state. The project is aimed at
developing a new approach to this important theory, clarifying existing results
and establishing new results. Seitz is in excellent position to address these
problems and has recently obtained new results in the area.
