Wright State University will bring fifty Indian children from eastern U.S.
tribes to a two week concentrated field study program in the Smokey Mountains
with follow up through the academic year. The students selected for
participation will be entering the ninth grade. The integration of other
scientific fields, including mathematic, physics chemistry and hydrology will be
emphasized as tools to study earth resources. In all cases, the various
specialty needs, training necessary and career opportunities will be emphasized.
Through field research projects and study of sites with significant geological
problems we intend to encourage these American Indian children to pursue careers
in the geosciences, either on or off the reservations. We will show them the
excitement of geologic studies and the need for Indian professionals.
Recognizing that all of the students will not pursue earth science careers, we
foresee benefits in this experience for these future Indian leaders. These
benefits include an awareness of the significance of geology in land use.
