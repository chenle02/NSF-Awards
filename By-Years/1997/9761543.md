*** 9761543 McNeff This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
test the feasibility of synthesizing monodisperse, nonporous zirconia
microspheres for use as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) supports
for the analysis of environmentally-impactive substances. Current HPLC supports
limit speed and resolution in the analysis of herbicides and pesticides, and
require large amounts of solvent, because they are porous and cannot tolerate
high temperature. Nonporous zirconia, coated by CVD with carbon, will overcome
these problems. These zirconia microspheres (ca. 1 micrometer in diameter) will
be synthesized using zirconium alkoxides and zirconium salts. The primary
objective is to provide nonporous monodisperse spherical zirconia particles to
produce ultrafast chromatography columns, but the particle synthesis work will
also benefit other industries e.g. ceramic synthesis and catalysis. The primary
commercial benefit of this research will be the reduction of organic solvent
used in reversed-phase chromatographic separations of environmentally impactive
substances. ***
