The research deals with the growth rate controlling in cellular metabolism and
the role that internal or external mass transfer play in controlling or inducing
cellular growth. A modeling approach is taken; experimental techniques are
investigated to verify the model predictions. At first the research uses
relationships of Monod equations. This project is one supported under the
Creativity Awards for Engineering Students.
