9704960 Zhong The purpose of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to
conduct a carefully planned experiment over twelve months to determine the
feasibility of cavitation-mediated gene transfer using ultrasound energy as the
agent to induce the transfer. The method proposed is to use shock wave
lithotripsy (SWL), similar to that employed to fracture kidney stones, to
activate microbubbles and associated microjet formation to deliver genetic
material into target cells. The cavitation-mediated technique to be investigated
is untested and thus the project is exploratory and high risk. However, the
ultimate application of a successful new technology would be as a gene therapy
for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and
degenerative neurological disorders. Other applications for a successful
technology would be found in agriculture. The effect of acoustic cavitation on
cells is incompletely understood and the results from this proposed research
project should add to the knowledge base in this area even if the goal to
provide a significant advance in gene transfer is not reached. ***
