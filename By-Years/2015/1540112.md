High-performance networking is a key enabler of data-intensive science, as
researcher collaborations and the sharing/accessibility of data require large,
fast transfers of data on a national and international scale. This workshop
focuses on regional-level interoperability of campus "Science DMZs", so that
researchers can move data to/from their labs and their collaborators, national
supercomputer centers or data repositories, traversing multiple, heterogeneous
Science DMZs without performance degradation. This capability leverages
substantial investments by NSF, DOE and regional networks, and will advance
data-intensive scientific discovery by advancing collaborations, making data
readily accessible to large communities, and increasing researcher
productivity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It has always been a technical challenge to
achieve high-speed networking performance between end-points where researchers
typically work (instruments, computers, labs). The Science DMZ concept is a
major advance in removing these roadblocks within a campus, and interoperability
between heterogeneous Science DMZs is the next logical step in successfully
addressing performance at both ends. This workshop is to address
interoperability challenges by focusing near-term on a few specific scientific
applications at a regional level, while laying the foundation for extensibility
to other applications and institutions.
