A fundamental problem in computer science is the constraint satisfaction problem
MAX-SAT, which asks: Given a set of Boolean constraints on n bits, what is the
maximum number of constraints which can be simultaneously satisfied by an
assignment to all the bits? Despite its many applications, MAX-SAT is
unfortunately believed to be impossible to solve efficiently. Fortunately, such
problems can often be solved approximately via so-called approximation
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;In the quantum setting, a physically motivated
generalization of MAX-SAT exists, known as LH, which concerns the computation of
important properties of quantum systems at very low temperatures. Unfortunately,
like MAX-SAT, LH is also believed intractable. This project hence asks the
question: Can we compute approximate solutions to k-LH via the framework of
approximation algorithms? &lt;br/&gt;The resolution of this question will yield
deep insight into our ability to approximately compute properties of quantum
systems in nature. The results obtained will be disseminated through a variety
of avenues, including conferences, high school workshops, and engineering public
lecture series aimed at exposing the general public to the frontiers of
research.&lt;br/&gt; At a high level, this project aims to design polynomial-
time approximation algorithms for a variety of classes of the local Hamiltonian
problem (LH), from physically motivated special cases to more general settings.
The techniques used are inspired primarily by ideas from the fields of
approximation algorithms and quantum information theory. Among other results, a
key aim of the project is to obtain insight into how well classically
efficiently representable quantum states can approximate solutions to genuinely
quantum problems involving ground spaces of local Hamiltonians.
