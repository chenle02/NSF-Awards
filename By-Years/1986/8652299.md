The Willamette Science and Technology Center, a science museum located in the
university town of Eugene, Oregon, proposes to design, construct and circulate a
1,000 square foot traveling mathematics and science exhibition, "Kaleidoscopes:
Reflections of Science and Art" to 15 science museums over a three year period,
reaching more than one million visitors. The exhibition will capitalize on
popular interest in this 19th century optical toy to provide engaging and
stimulating examples of mathematics and physics principles revealed in the
exquisite symmetries and surprising patterns of kaleidoscopic reflection.
Interactive exhibit modules will be combined with historic examples and the work
of contemporary artists to appeal to a broad rang of ages and interests of
visitors. Consultants with extensive experience with mathematics and mathematics
education will assist in the design of the exhibit units and in the preparation
of educational materials that will accompany the exhibition. The Smithsonian
Institution Travelling Exhibition Service (SITES), will manage the circulation
and maintenance of the exhibition during its travels and will publish the
related educational materials and make them available to host museums. Project
staff and consultant are highly qualified to carry out this project, which
matches an increasing national interest in revitalizing mathematics education
and a corresponding increased emphasis on mathematics education at the National
Science Foundation. An award $71,310 for FY'87 is recommended.
