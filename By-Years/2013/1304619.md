Indiana offers convenient access to products for two-thirds of the U.S.
population. Ivy Tech and the Purdue University College of Technology (CoT)
collaborate to develop a technology-based logistics program designed to meet the
growing demands of Indiana's employers. Four primary objectives include: 1)
informing Indiana high school and middle school students and Career and
Technology Education teachers about educational and career opportunities in the
field of logistics; 2) developing industry-driven logistics curricula for Ivy
Tech and the CoT at Purdue University; 3) developing smooth student transfer
between the Associate's degree programs in logistics at Ivy Tech and the
Bachelor's degree programs at the CoT at Purdue; and 4) implementing an outreach
and recruitment program to encourage Ivy Tech's Associate's degree students to
continue their education through to a Bachelor's degree. The project works with
industry, the ATE National Center for Supply Chain Technology Education
(NCSCTE). The evaluation includes qualitative and quantitative measures of
student success.
