Mountain building processes (orogenesis) are characterized by crustal
thickening, abundant partial melting, and the formation of continental plateaus.
Geodynamic models show that partially molten crust redistributes mass and heat
in the orogen by flowing laterally in a channel or vertically in diapirs.
Although channel flow and diapiric flow are first-order mechanisms controlling
the evolution of orogens, field-testing of these models is lagging. This project
is concentrating on geologic studies of two exhumed migmatite terrains, the
Okanogan-Kettle dome (North American Cordillera), and the Naxos dome (Aegean
metamorphic core complex). In these terrains, migmatite structures and fabrics
have preserved the memory of channel/diapiric flow and the extent to which the
partially molten crust interacts with the upper crust prior to and during
exhumation of the channel and the domes. The project's methodology includes the
determination of the geometry and kinematics of flow in migmatites using both
field mapping and the analysis of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility.
Thermobarometric and textural analyses of metamorphic assemblages reconstructs
the pressure and temperature histories of migmatites, which are distinct for
channel and diapiric flow. Geochronologic analyses, using in-situ dating (SHRIMP
facilty) of zircon grains crystallized in leucosomes of known relationship to
deformation, date the flow of partially molten crust. In addition, dating of
monazite of known relationship to metamorphic assemblages offers temporal
constraints on the pressure-temperature path. The timing of cooling of these
rocks, approached by argon and fission-track geochronologic methods, evaluates
the genetic relationship between channel/diapiric flow and exhumation. This
integrated methodology applied to two Tertiary orogenic segments evaluates the
role of the partially molten crust during orogeny and the relationship between
crustal flow and plate geodynamics.
