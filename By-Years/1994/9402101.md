9402101 Lindeman The Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS)
on behalf of its member institutions, is encouraging participation in the data
network for all higher education institutions in Indiana and their constituents,
including public libraries, hospitals, governmental agencies, extension centers,
and businesses with research and educational needs for connectivity.
Additionally, IHETS is working with the Indiana Department of Education to
provide experimentation opportunities for schools via linkage with the
Department's dial-access system, IDEAnet. This proposal requests partial funding
for participation in NSFNET through a connection with CICNET, the regional
network attaching to NSFNET in the Indiana Area as well as partial start- up
funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating support to facilitate
the fullest possible participation. The educational institutions that will
participate include: Indiana Institute of Technology, Oakland City College,
Vincennes University Technology Center, and the Allen County Public Library. The
network initially consists of a redundant T1 backbone linking nodes at four of
the larger campuses, 56 kbs DDS end nodes, and connection to CICNET and NSFNET
via Indiana University. Phase 3 will extend to the new component of IHETS formed
in 1992, the Partnership for Statewide Education. The new component of IHETS
will be critical in assuring that students enrolled in all courses have access
to information resources and student services approximately those commonly
available to their peers at traditional campuses. The Allen County public
Library will serve as a model and test site for various forms of connectivity
for public libraries.
