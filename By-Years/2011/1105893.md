Adaptive Optics (AO) is a technique that allows astronomers to correct images
received by a telescope for the distortions introduced as the light passes
through the earth's atmosphere. The technique has made significant advances in
recent years and its use is increasing and becoming routine at most of the
world's largest telescopes. Now that AO is robust and reliable, scientists and
engineers are seeking to apply it to a wider field of view so that larger
objects or clusters of objects can all be viewed with the same high resolution
at once. Dr. Michael Hart, of the University of Arizona, has been pursuing such
a path for the MMT Observatory on Mount Hopkins in southern Arizona. This wide
field will be realized by employing five ground-layer laser guide stars spread
over a two arcminute field of view of the 6.5-meter telescope. By rapidly
measuring the distortions of these guide stars over the field of view and
correcting them with the MMT's adaptive secondary mirror, high spatial
resolution over the entire field is being achieved. With the development effort
nearly completed, Dr. Hart will now begin the last stage of the project to make
the AO system fully robust and integrated with the instruments used by the
scientists who have access to the 6.5-meter telescope. The new capability will
make the observatory more efficient (less telescope time will be needed for
objects of a given brightness) and allow for more detailed studies of structural
details. This work is supported by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences
program for Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation.
