ABSTRACT This project will involve the extensive recording of texts from
speakers of Oneida with the goal of furthering understanding of the
phonological, syntactic, and discourse properties of prosodic units previously
termed "utterance" in the linguistic literature on Oneida and any other prosodic
constituents intermediate between the word and "utterance". The texts will be
tape- recorded, transcribed and translated into English, and then subjected to
instrument measurement to determine pause and intonation patterns. A completed
volume of texts will include morpheme-by-morpheme analyses and glosses. The
project will be carried out in close collaboration with a respected speaker and
teacher in the Oneida community. Such a collaboration will ensure the widest
variety possible in the text sample. The collection of such textual material is
seen as urgent, given the steady decreasing numbers of speakers of Oneida over
the last two decades. It is anticipated that the text volume will benefit
linguistics regardless of theoretical alignment and also community-based
projects aimed at maintaining and preserving Oneida.
