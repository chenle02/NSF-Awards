9350674 Smith This proposal presents a plan for expanding and enhancing
undergraduate laboratory and research opportunities in neurophysiology,
neuropharmacology and introductory neuroscience. This will be accomplished by
purchasing computers with analog to digital conversion and hard disk storage
capability, by buying data collection and analysis software, and by purchasing
equipment enabling hippocampal slice experiments to be conducted. The
acquisition of this equipment will allow us to better meet the heavy enrollment
demands for our lab courses. It will give the 80-100 students who enroll each
year in these courses a greater opportunity for hands-on laboratory work.
Finally, the quality of the laboratories will be enhanced because students will
be able to store data for further analysis, making data analysis and thinking
about data an integral part of the student laboratory experience. ***
