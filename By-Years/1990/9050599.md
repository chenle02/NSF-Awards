There is an urgent need to educate more VLSI and ASIC design engineers to keep
this country competitive in the world market. This project provides state-of-
the-art workstations and appropriate VLSI CAD tools to teach students VLSI
design. Students learn layout techniques, design verification, design
methodology and management, synthesis, testing and other appropriate techniques
needed in VLSI and ASIC design. This laboratory experience addresses the trends
of VLSI technology through the associated software providing majors with the
required experience to pursue careers in VLSI and ASIC design. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
