9358367 Crook The research performed with this NSF Young Investigator Award
involves growth by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of novel semiconductor
structures for electronic and photonic device applications. One current research
program examines the synthesis and properties of interfaces, superlattices, and
alloys formed by combing elemental and III-V compound semiconductors. The Young
Investigators Award will enhance this program by providing funding for
additional experiments to examine the properties of novel materials such as
(GaAs)1-x(Si2)x alloys and GaAs/Si short-period superlatties. A research program
in planar devices formed by patterning of two-dimensional electron gas
structures grown by MBE will be initiated during the period of the award.
Interaction with industry will be pursed for research in these areas, as well as
on related topics such as reproducible growth conditions for MBE. A course on
compound semiconductor devices will be developed and first taught in the Fall of
1993, and other new courses will be developed in subsequent years. ***
