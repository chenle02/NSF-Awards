ABSTRACT

ACI-0305453; PI: AMARASINGHE

There is evidence that streaming media applications are already consuming most
of the cycles on consumer machines. StreamIt is a language and complier
specifically designed for modern stream programming. Its goal is to raise the
abstraction level in the streaming domain., providing a natural, high-level
syntax that conceals architectural details without sacrificing performance, and
provide a language and compiler that can abstract away cognitive complexities of
programming next generation, heterogeneous computing grids. The proposal will
extend the current StreamIt language to include novel features such as variable
rates, multi-dimensional streams, a messaging model and adaptable stream graphs
so that the language can support a wide variety of applications in the streaming
domain, and will also develop a large application base to evaluate the
effectiveness of the language and the compiler. In addition the project will
undertake a substantial compiler effort to create a robust and powerful
compiler. With novel optimizations such as a space-time multiplexer, a stream
graph partitioner, a phased scheduler a constraint scheduler, and liner
transformer, as well as compilation technology necessary for heterogeneous
computational platforms, and for substrates whose available resources can vary
dynamically. Furthermore, the project will develop many optimizing compiler
backends for different communication exposed architectures as well as next
generation computing grids
