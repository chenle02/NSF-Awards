The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop "Cyborgs: A Natural History
of Machines and Humans." The Project will result in a national traveling
exhibit, a web site, and a complement of related educational programs focused on
the boundaries between humans and their machines and on recent scientific
efforts to understand the human body and mind. The 6,000-square-foot exhibit
will open at the SMM before traveling to the six large museums in the Science
Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC), and then will be available for lease by
other museums.
