Rice University, in collaboration with the California Institute of Technology,
Syracuse University, the University of Tennessee, Argonne National Laboratory
and Los Alamos National Laboratory, has proposed renewal of the Center for
Research on Parallel Computation. The Director of the Center is Ken Kennedy. The
goal of the Center is to make parallel computing systems truly usable. As high
performance computing systems become progressively more parallel in their
logical organization, ease of use comparable to conventional supercomputers
becomes essential to high performance computing. The objectives of the Center
cover a broad range of issues. The participants will develop theory and
algorithms that will be needed to parallelize important scientific applications.
They will imbed these algorithms in scalable libraries that can be implemented
on different parallel computer architectures. They will demonstrate the utility
of these software systems, algorithms and libraries in real science and
engineering applications. They will also transfer the knowledge and other
byproducts of this research to the science and engineering community and to
industry.
