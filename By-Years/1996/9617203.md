Robin Hochstrasser of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on ultrafast
dynamics in liquids. Femtosecond (fs) laser spectroscopic techniques will be
brought to bear on two central themes: solvent control of chemical reactions and
the relaxation of molecular excitations. Specific techniques to be developed
include fs transient infrared spectroscopy at low frequencies; terahertz
spectroscopy to probe low frequency motions in molecular pump-probe experiments;
and fs time-resolved X-ray scattering on liquid samples. Focus is on solvent-
assisted uni- and bimolecular reaction dynamics and electronic and vibrational
relaxation. Quantum chemical calculations of the potential energy surfaces and
classical molecular dynamics simulations will also be carried out. The study of
the transformation of energetically excited molecules in condensed phases from
one molecular isomeric configuration to another will significantly expand our
knowledge of how a complex molecule undergoes internal rearrangements and how
these are mediated by a surrounding solvent.
