This action provides for a statistical survey of the scientific and technical
resources utilized by domestic companies in the performance of research and
development (R&D) activities. This survey will produce measures of the dollar
volume of research and development performed, sources of finance, employment of
R&D scientists and engineers, and other characteristics of R&D and S&T in
industry. Under authority granted by the National Science Foundation Act of
1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive economic statistics, as well as
other pertinent information, about scientific and technological resource
utilization and activities. Data collected by the Survey of Research and
Development in Industry, when used in combination with data obtained through
other NSF statistical and analytical activities, provides policy makers with an
overview of R&D funding and performance in the United States.
