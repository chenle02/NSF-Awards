This research project is to further characterize the enzymatic machinery
involved in antigen receptor gene recombination. The research in this field has
been mostly limited to studies of recombination events at the DNA level. This
project will establish an in vitro recombination system to further dissect the
molecular events leading to the formation of a complete V-(D)-J structure. Such
a system will be essential for the enzymatic characterization of the putative
components of the V-(D)-J recombinase. During the planning period the PI will
conduct the necessary preliminary experiments to formulate the appropriate
strategies to establish such an in vitro recombination system. Due to the
overall lack of research in this particular area, it will be necessary for the
PI to conduct an extensive literature search in related fields for enzymatic
assays and reaction conditions which might make the proposed project more
feasible.
