This research in the laboratory of Professor Lee Park at the Williams College
is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
under a Research Planning Grant. Liquid crystalline complexes of ruthenium will
be prepared using pyridine ligands to confer the crystallinity. These
metallomesogenic complexes will then be used as building blocks for one-
dimensional conductors. Initially, cocrystallization of two mixed-valent
complexes will be tried as a conductor. One-dimensional conducting materials
will be investigated as to their bandgap and conductivity. Successfully aligning
transition metal complexes into liquid crystalline arrays may allow these
materials to be laid down in thin films so as to serve as molecular wires in
circuits.
