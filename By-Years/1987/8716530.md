This investigation will address the regional energetics of the Gulf Stream
system by deploying a set of acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCP) pointing
upward from a current meter mooring. The velocity data from the ADCP's will be
used to investigate variations in the structure of the current and processes
governing the instabilities of the system. Additionally comparisons with
satellite imagery will be used to determine correlations between surface thermal
patterns and the underlying velocity. The project is in conjunction with a major
Gulf Stream project, SYNOP, to obtain information on the dynamics of the Stream
in order to gain modeling capability for its evolution. This project will be
closely coordinated with SYNOP, and in particular with mooring experiments of
scientists from the University of Rhode Island.
