The principal investigator will use analysis to study Sobolev connections.
Furthermore, the study of singularities in gauge fields will be extended to
arbitrary compact Lie groups and to more general singular sets of codimension-
two. Lastly, the Morse theory of hyperbolic monopoles will be investigated and
related to that of instantons on the four-sphere. This project involves the use
of advanced analysis to understand aspects of modern mathematical physics. In
many respects this is a golden era in the technical interaction between physics
and the mathematical areas of differential geometry and partial differential
equations. This interplay, which goes back to Einstein and Gauss, was recently
intensified by work of Donaldson who showed that our four-dimensional space-
time could have different shape than earlier assumed.
