This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Terrence Finnegan, will be working with
Professor Orville Vernon Burton in developing user interfaces to very large
databases requiring both database access and statistical analyses. The user of
the system is assumed to be a scholar unfamiliar with the use of high
performance computers. The specific application will be the census database. In
addition to developing the user interface, the research will also incorporate
the information into a Geographic Information System. Visualization tools will
also be developed that are appropriate for the use by history scholars. The
development platforms will be computers owned by the National Center for
Supercomputer Applications at the University of Illinois.
