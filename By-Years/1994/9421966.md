9421966 Sham This project is a theoretical study of the time evolution of the
nonlinear optical processes in solid state systems. The theory requires taking
into account simultaneously the interaction of electrons with intense
electromagnetic fields, the interaction among the electrons, and the interaction
of the electron with its host environment. Special attention is paid to the
interplay between the polarization of light and the spin dynamics of the
electrons. The following systems will be studied: III-V nonmagnetic
semiconductor heterostructures (promising systems for optoelectronic devices),
II-VI magnetic semiconductor heterostructures (important for visible optical and
magneto-optical devices), and light element compounds (exhibit properties of
strongly correlated electrons). The approach adopted is field theoretic, with a
diagrammatic representation. The results are expected to be a unified
explanation for a wide range of observed nonlinear optical phenomena in each
class of these solid state systems, predictions of new behavior, and a deeper
understanding of strong electron correlation through optical processes which can
test electron theories. %%% This work involves modeling the interaction of light
with several solid systems, including layered (composite) semiconducting systems
and light element compounds. This interaction provides a means of measuring the
electronic properties in these systems and forms a basis for making ultrafast
optical devices. The light interacts with the electronic properties in certain
classes to be studied and with magnetic properties in others. The results are
expected to be a unified explanation for a wide range of observed nonlinear
optical phenomena in three classes of solid state systems, predictions of new
behavior, and a deeper understanding of the electron-electron interactions,
which are a key to the theory behind many materials. ***
