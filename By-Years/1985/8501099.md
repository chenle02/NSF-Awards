A theoretical and experimental research program in radiative heat transfer will
be performed. The work will deal with multiple scattering in a two-dimensional,
cylindrical medium that is exposed to a laser beam. The laser beam is incident
normal to the top surface of the scattering medium. Emphasis is placed on
understanding the influence of anisotropic scattering in the thin to moderate
optical thickness range. The integral equations for the source functions are
formulated exactly by using radiative transfer theory, and the expressions for
intensity and flux are derived. Supporting experiments will be conducted with
spherical latex particles as scattering centers suspended in distilled water.
