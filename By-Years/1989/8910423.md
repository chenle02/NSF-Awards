The ultimate objective of this work is to provide a systematic and quantitative
model that can be used to engineer the synthesis of metal oxides from solutions
of organometallic precursors. In the present work, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is coupled with chromatography and solids characterization to
learn details of the kinetics of the key chemical reactions involved in sol-gel
synthesis as functions of the nature and concentration of the (electrolyte)
catalyst. Teactant structure, solvent properties, reaction reversibility,
diffusion limitations, and multicomponent reactions are also addressed. Data
obtained are incorporated into existing quantitative models of sol-gel
reactions. In principle, ceramics, glasses and gels can be made with tailored
chemical properties, shape or mechanical behavior using sol-gel ceramic
synthesis technology, in which organometallic procursos in solution are
polymerized to metal oxides. Realization of this capability depends upon
improved quantitative understanding of the chemistry of these systems.
