The PI and her team will apply 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to
observed collimated outflows from young solar-type stars. They will follow a two
phase approach of 1) investigating launching and collimation on small spatial
scales of less than 1 AU, and then 2) extending the work to simulations of much
larger scales of 10-100 AU. Simulations from the second phase will be compared
to observations of young stellar objects (YSO's) with outflows over similar
distance scales.

The project will also contribute to other topics relevant to stellar
astrophysics, including developing physical understanding and intuition about
material undergoing gravitational infall, constraining models of initial mass
functions and angular momentum. The PI will mentor a postdoctoral researcher and
undergraduate students in participating in this resarch project, and will also
organize and run a public outreach exibit through the Ithaca Science Center.
