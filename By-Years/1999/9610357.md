9610357 The U. S. University Council on Geotechnical Engineering Research
(USUCGER) is a nonprofit and independent organization which represents
universities in the U.S. where geotechnical engineering research is conducted.
Recently, the paradigm concerning the mechanism of funding research has been
significantly altered. While it is believed that the bulk of geotechnical
research is currently being funded by federal agencies, the current trend in
federal funding is the total monies for research is being reduced. The purpose
of this research is to conduct a self- assessment which will provide a benchmark
of the current state of geotechnical engineering research, to disseminate it to
the profession through various mechanisms, and to establish partnerships with
industry. The results will be presented at a workshop of USUCGER members,
representatives of funding agencies, and the end-users of geotechnical research.
