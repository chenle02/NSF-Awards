9617452 McNallan Under an SGER award a study will be made of the feasibility of
directly forming diamond and diamond-like films on the surface of metal carbides
by selectively removing the metal atoms in a corrosion reaction with halogen-
rich atmospheres at elevated temperature; this will be followed by suitable heat
treatment to allow the carbon atoms to form coherent crystalline films. After
optimizing the processing conditions the microstructure and mechanical and
tribological properties of the films will be determined. ***
