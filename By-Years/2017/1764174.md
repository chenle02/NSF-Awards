A fundamental problem encountered throughout mathematics is to completely
classify some type of mathematical object by invariants. Descriptive set theory
gives a general framework for studying such classification problems and
comparing their relative difficulties. The PI proposes research in descriptive
set theory and its connections with geometrical paradoxes and computability. The
main areas of study are constructive solutions to geometrical paradoxes, and the
complexity of classification problems in mathematics viewed through the lens of
definability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes studying geometrical
paradoxes using advances made in descriptive graph combinatorics, and work
classifying the complexity of actions of countable groups in ergodic theory and
descriptive set theory. Recent progress in these fields particularly in the
theory of definable flows in graphs and on the hyperfiniteness of actions of
amenable groups, has led to progress in geometrical paradoxes such as a
constructive solution to Tarski's circle squaring problem. The PI proposes
building on this work to study further problems in this vein such as the
uniqueness of Lebesgue measure as a finitely additive rotation invariant Borel
probability measure on the n-sphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
