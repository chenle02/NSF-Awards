Jianmin Tao of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by the Chemical
Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to
develop improved methods for density functional theory (DFT). In the computer-
aided design of electronic materials, devices, as well as chemical and physical
processes, accurate prediction of electronic properties plays a decisive role.
While many wave function-based methods are highly accurate, their computational
costs are too expensive to be generally useful for practical applications. For
large many-atom systems, DFT is the only method with both the required accuracy
and efficiency and for that reason it is the most widely used electronic
structure method. However, commonly-used density functionals are unable to
achieve universal accuracy. Tao and coworkers focus on developing functionals
with a wider range of applicability. These functionals are being used to study
the properties of diverse systems such as (water) clusters and light-emitting
oligomers and polymers. The work involves both method development and numerical
application. The project also includes summer outreach programs aimed primarily
at undergraduates.

The goal of this research project is the development and application of
nonlocal density functionals (DFT), including a new nonlocal correlation energy
functional for long-range van der Waals interactions. The focus of this effort
is on solving or mitigating some long-standing difficulties that commonly-used
density functionals encounter. A major outstanding problem for DFT methodology
is that a density functional may be accurate for one or more classes of systems,
but not for all systems, or for one or more properties, but not for all
properties. A goal of this project is to develop a density functional with
universal accuracy and wider applicability so that diverse chemical and physical
problems can be solved on the same footing, with the same density functional.
Such a density functional must be nonlocal, because the nature of the Coulomb
interaction is nonlocal. Undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs are
involved in various aspects of this project.
