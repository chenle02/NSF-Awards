Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Present day electronic devices rely on the
flow of charged electrons and holes. However, other types of quasiparticles,
with entirely different electronic properties, can be artificially created and
controlled. These quasiparticles, which include the so called “Majorana
fermions”, have topological properties that protect them against perturbations
from their environment. Over the past few years, the condensed matter community
achieved dramatic progress in understanding and practical implementation of
topological excitations, which promise to revolutionize electronics and to bring
quantum computing closer to reality. This research explores topological states
and excitations formed at the interfaces between two quintessential quantum
states: the integer quantum Hall and superconductor. The project strongly
emphasizes mentoring and education; it involves students across educational
stages from high to graduate school. The students are trained in measurement and
nanofabrication methods relevant for both industrial and academic careers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The interplay of the quantum
Hall (QH) effect and superconductivity is expected to result in novel quantum
states and excitations, such as Majorana fermions and parafermions. This
research uses magneto-transport methods to explore quantum states formed at the
1D interfaces between quantum Hall states and a superconductor. Specifically,
the project focuses on the following major directions: 1) investigation of
chiral Andreev edge states, their coherence and interference properties, and
their relation to Majorana fermions. 2) the study of Josephson junctions made of
“twisted bilayer graphene” with superconducting contacts, in a search for
Majorana zero modes and parafermions. The physics of topological excitations in
superconducting quantum Hall systems presents fundamental interest and may bring
topological quantum computation closer to reality. The project involves
graduate, undergraduate, and high school students who are trained in measurement
and nanofabrication methods relevant for both industrial and academic
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
