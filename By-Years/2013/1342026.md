This award provides support for students to participate in the Twelfth Summer
School on Exotic Beam Physics at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, July 28-
August 4, 2013. The school is designed for graduate students, senior
undergraduate students who are actively involved in research, and postdocs
(within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures
and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an
opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to
nurture future scientists so that the community will have sufficient manpower to
effectively use Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online.

In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a
broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the
elements to the enhancement of national security.
