This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of California. The student will study changes in male identity in
a poor neighborhood of Mexico City, analyzing how definitions of masculinity are
affected by social constraints from employment and social activist situations.
Methods include participant observation, a survey questionnaire of 50
households, and in depth studies of a sample of 25 households. This research is
important because increases in our understanding of gender roles and relations
is important to develop policies affecting out-of-wedlock pregnancies and unwed
fathers' responsibilities to support their children. Case studies such as these,
of individual variations in a social situation known for "machismo", can
significantly advance our understanding of why some men become responsible
fathers while others do not.
