Submitted under the guidelines for Teacher Enhancement, Teacher Retention and
Renewal, this is a 36-month project to offer a graduate leadership program in
middle school mathematics to 100 teacher leaders. The teacher leaders will
complete a 36-hour master's degree in mathematics content and pedagogy, and in
leadership/mentoring. The project will include both residential and on-line
components. It is a collaborative effort among Southwest Texas State University,
Stephen F. Austin State University, Sam Houston State University, the Texas
Statewide Systemic Initiative, the Texas Rural Systemic Initiative, and K-12
partner schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds upon successful
collaborations in pre-service with the intent to provide leaders who can mentor
the new inductees. It will combine face-to-face meetings in the summer and
weekend immersion during the academic year, along with internet coursework and
interactive distance learning. &lt;br/&gt;
