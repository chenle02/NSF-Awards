The Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island will
acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of
shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association
with the R/V ENDEAVOR, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
university. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Computer terminal for
displaying real-time data as it is being collected, -Fluorometer for measuring
chlorophyll and other optical properties in the water column, -CTD pressure
gauge, to enhancement obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and
temperature as a function of depth, -Towed vehicle and digital modem for a side
scan echosounder system for collecting data on seafloor bathymetry and
sedimentary profiles, -Radio ethernet link for enhancing scientific data
transfer and communications amongst the technical support group and scientific
users of the ship, and -Dead Weight tester for testing the tolerances and
calibration of instrumentation before taking them to sea. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-
sponsored research and engineering projects.
