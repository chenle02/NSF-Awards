This research is to continue the valuable program to catalog centroid-moment
tensor (CMT) solutions from global digital seismic data on a routine basis. The
Harvard CMT catalog has become a significant resource for the seismological
community in global tectonic studies. In addition, research will be done on
large deep earthquakes lying away from the most intense seismic activity in
Wadati-Benioff zones, and on better methods for parameterizing source time
functions of earthquakes. These studies are fundamental to seismological
research and the origin and distribution of earthquakes. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
