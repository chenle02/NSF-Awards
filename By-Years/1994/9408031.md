9408031 Leustek Two enzymes, ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase, catalyze the
activation of sulfate in plants leading to the synthesis of sulfur containing
compounds vital for cell function. Isoenzymes of ATP sulfurylase are
compartmentalized in chloroplasts, mitochondria and the cytosol, suggesting that
they may play distinct physiological roles in sulfur metabolism. The objective
of this research is to study the expression of the isoenzymes in order to
establish a molecular basis for the control of sulfate activation. cDNAs
encoding the sulfate activating enzymes were cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana by
complementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP sulfurylase, met3, or APS
kinase, met14, mutants. Four members of the ATP sulfurylase gene family and one
encoding APS kinase have been isolated. It is proposed to further characterize
these cDNAs and to study their expression and function in A. thaliana and
Brassica juncea. Since sulfur-containing peptides play a significant role in
resistance to heavy metals, the influence of heavy metal exposure will be
investigated on expression of ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase. These studies will
help advance our understanding of plant metabolism, growth, development and
response to stress. ***
