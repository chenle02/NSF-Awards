The primary goals of this I3 project are to: (1) strengthen the educational
effectiveness of FBC?s STEM degree programs and associated component projects
through the synergistic integration of STEM research and education; and (2)
broaden participation in STEM research and education among American Indians. To
achieve these goals, the project will bring together five currently active
environmental research and education projects under the common administrative
and programmatic umbrella of the Aaniinen-Nakoda Environmental Excellence Center
(ANEEC). The ANEEC will promote connectivity and synergy among component
projects in a manner that: (1) builds the intellectual capital and research
capacity of the entire institution; (2) increases the effectiveness of each
component project; and (3) provides students with a fully integrated STEM
learning experience in which research and education are embedded in a cultural
and land-based context that fosters student engagement and promotes student
success. Specifically, the ANEEC project will: (1) develop FBC?s environmental
research capacity and intellectual capital through cross-disciplinary STEM
faculty development efforts; (2) coordinate the administration of environmental
research and education projects to enhance their educational effectiveness and
efficiency; (3) infuse Aaniinen and Nakoda cultural perspectives into all
environmental research and education projects; (4) create a shared framework for
providing students with high-quality summer research experiences; and (5) modify
curriculum to establish clear linkages between summer research experiences and
academic year course offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aaniinen-Nakoda
Environmental Excellence Center brings together the NSF/EHR award from TCUP, as
well as other work, around the I-3 integrative themes of the integration of
research and education, and broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;
