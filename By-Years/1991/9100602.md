A major goal of this project is to train and educate the next generation of
scientists. An integral part of the educational program is to provide a
fulfilling research opportunity for undergraduate students. It is strongly
believed that this will stimulate further science interests, instill excitement
with scientific research, and promote future careers in the sciences. This
institution has a long standing history of providing research experience to
undergraduates. Over the past thirteen years many undergraduates have been hired
to work in a variety of research projects during the summer and acedemic year.
These students have continued their careers in physics, astrophysics, computer
science, and electronics. During the past four years alone 15-20 undergraduates
have been hired on a part-time basis to assist with observatory and research
projects. Being selected as a NSF REU site for the summers of 1987-90 has
enabled the normal summer hiring of students to be expanded to a full-scale
summer program for students, which is similar in size to that of the National
Observatories. This is not an apprenticeship program but a tutorial in research
experience.
