SBR-9506005 This dissertation-improvement award provides field equipment and
assistance for the Student's research into demographic, environmental, and
social change in Malawi since the late 19th century. The theoretical argument is
that the outcome variation from interactions of particular demographic and
natural-resource situations is amenable to historical explanation. The central
hypothesis, that a confluence of demographic and institutional changes in the
late-19th century provided the basis for current resource scarcity in modern
Malawi, will be explored via a three-part research design: a social survey,
historical research, and environmental analyses. There are two research sites,
one in southern Malawi (the Zomba district) and one in central Malawi (the
Kasungu district). Field research is to be undertaken from August 1995 through
July 1996. The research seeks to advance population and resource theory by
bridging the Malthusian focus on demographic demand on ecosystems and the
Boserupian focus on social and institutional determinants of resource use and
supply.
