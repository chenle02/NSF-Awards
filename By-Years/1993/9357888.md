processes and industrial society's needs for such minerals. She plans to
continue her efforts to advance knowledge about the Earth's crust and its
contained mineral wealth through her research in geology and geochemistry of ore
forming systems. She also plans to continue her efforts to understand the
processes by which scientific knowledge is formulated through her research at
Dartmouth College in the history and philosophy of modern earth sciences.
