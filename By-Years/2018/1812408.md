This award provides support for graduate students and postdocs to attend the
2018 Gordon Research Conference on Photonuclear Reactions, which will be held at
Holderness School in Holderness, New Hampshire, August 5 - 10, 2018. This
conference focuses on the physics accessible with electromagnetic probes at US
and international facilities, and is especially relevant now that the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has begun its 12 GeV era.

Meetings such as these provide a unique opportunity for junior scientists to
participate in discussions in an informal atmosphere that allows them to
interact easily with senior scientists. For many early career scientists at this
community, it is the first international meeting that they attend. The poster
session and poster prize also are prime opportunities for young scientists to
present and discuss their work, as well as obtaining recognition from the
community. The organizers have committed to broadening participation at the
conference to include underrepresented groups and will advertise the conference
in wide range of forums and professional societies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
