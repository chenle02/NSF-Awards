This multi-user biology equipment proposal requests funds to purchase a
cryostat that will be used in a variety of research projects in the Psychology
Department at University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. The user group
consists of four faculty with active research programs who are members of the
Experimental and Biological Psychology Program (Gallagher, Lysle, Dykstra) and
the Developmental Psychology Program (Gariepy). In addition, three of the users
are members of the Neurobiology Curriculum faculty (Gallagher, Lysle, and
Dykstra). The proposed cryostat will replace an American Optical cryostat
purchased in 1984 at a cost of $5,016, which can no longer be
serviced/maintained. The refrigeration unit of the existing cryostat contains
CFCs that do not meet current standards. Parts for this machine also can no
longer be replaced. The new equipment will provide facilities for the continued
conduct of research projects for which the existing cryostat has been used. In
addition, the new cryostat will have the precision needed for a number of
projects for which the existing cryostat has been inadequate. For example, when
uniform section thickness is crucial for quantitative work (e.g. using iodinated
ligands) the investigators have had to arrange for time on a cryostat in the
medical school. The purchase of a new cryostat with high precision for tissue
sectioning will allow all research to be conducted within our multi-user
facility. The proposed purchase is for a Leica 3000 cryostat with dual
compressor and motorized handwheel ($28,625) and height adjustment module
(additional $2,360). Thirty percent of the total cost will be provided from
equipment funds in the Psychology Department (see attached letter in appendix
from the Psychology Department Chair). As described in the detailed Description
of Research, the applications for which a cryostat is needed range from standard
histological methods to molecular neurobiological research. These latter inclu
de studies using quantitative methods for in vitro autoradiography, mapping of
labelled oligonucleotides administered in vivo and in situ hybridization
histochemisty. In addition to serving the needs of the faculty within the user
group, the equipment will also be extensively used in research training at
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels.
