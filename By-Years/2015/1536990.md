This project is concerned with improving business operations through the
development of enhanced workforce management techniques. The goal is to
determine how workers should be assigned dynamically to tasks in the presence of
uncertain demand and processing requirements for various products and services.
The main novelty is the incorporation of synchronization constraints on worker
assignment. For example, the completion of certain tasks may require a team of
workers, whereas other tasks require one worker at a time. In both cases,
workers must synchronize their schedules in that they must be simultaneously at
either the same or different tasks. This project involves the development of
easily implementable, robust, and dynamic policies for assigning workers to
tasks in real time, taking into account such synchronization constraints on
worker assignment. Potential application areas include health care delivery, job
shop scheduling, call centers, project management, and parallel computing. If
successful, this award will yield valuable insights and concrete guidelines for
how the performance of a large class of production and service systems can be
improved at low cost by better utilizing the available workers and other
resources.

The planned research involves modeling businesses as queueing networks and
workers as servers. The research objectives will be achieved through sample-path
analysis, Markov decision processes, fluid limit analysis, computer simulation,
and linear programming. In particular, for networks with general topologies and
infinite buffers, fluid limit analysis will be used to identify what fraction of
time the servers should spend in the various possible server configurations.
Then dynamic server allocation policies that come arbitrarily close to being
optimal will be developed. On the other hand, systems with finite buffers will
be analyzed using Markov decision process techniques, where there will be
constraints on server assignments. The proposed research involves the rigorous
analysis and control of queueing systems with flexible, heterogeneous servers
when the schedules of different servers must be synchronized (e.g., to account
for needed collaboration or non-collaboration). The focus is on maximizing
system capacity (throughput), but other performance measures will also be
considered, including holding costs.
