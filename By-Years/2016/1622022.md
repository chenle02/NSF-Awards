The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve imaging systems used in surveying
and surveillance. Specifically, the project intends to overcome the long range
resolution problems created by air turbulence which is the primary limitation on
resolution at long distances. The project anticipates creating a light weight,
ultra-high resolution camera system deployable on land, sea and air drones to
speed search &amp; rescue, identify crop diseases, improve oil and mineral
exploration success, rapidly identify infrastructure problems and improve
homeland security operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the limitations placed on
long range imaging by air turbulence using a novel non-classical approach. Using
sun as the light source, this camera may achieve a spatial resolution of 200
micrometers for any object on Earth, which is insignificant for short distance
imaging, however, taking a picture of a target at 10-kilometer, a classic camera
must have a lens of 90-meter diameter to achieve a theoretical 200-micrometer
resolution. Thus, the turbulence free camera will provide "panoramic"
photographs with micron-level resolution at large distances. The research will
convert a successful lab scale camera system performing non-classical imaging
into a fully functional prototype for use in real world environments.
