The BioInformatics and Bio-Modeling (BIBM) conference focuses on leading edge
questions in the field. The conference agenda is a varied program with topic
paper areas, tutorial programs, and special interest group meetings that align
with recent funding trends within the ABI program. In addition to research
findings, the program also incorporates hands-on workshops of the newest
informatics tools to be developed. The conference provides an interactive forum
in which researchers can share ideas, learn new techniques, and forge
professional relationships with other colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A panel
on Bioinformatics Training and Education at the conference will help to share
resources and lessons learned in bioinformatics training and workforce
development. The panel will feature representatives from academics, industry and
government to discuss different career paths. The conference program also
includes mentoring activities. The organizers will invite 20-30 (20 funded by
this award) students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the conference, with
a well-articulated diversity recruitment plan that targets gender, minority, and
disability participation.
