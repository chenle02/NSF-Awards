9423237 Hough Transitional systems offer political elites a choice of
participating in newly formed institutions or participating in the vestiges of
the old system. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation
examines the decision of individual elites to enter electoral politics in
transitional systems and the strategies they pursue to secure office. The goal
of the project is to obtain a clearer picture of who participates, their
inclination to engage in collective activity, and the mechanisms that define
individual commitment to institutional structure. The project will draw a link
between the strategic behavior of candidates in the campaign period and their
behavior within newly emerging institutions such as parties and legislatures.
