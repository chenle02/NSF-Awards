0202177 Cannon The objective of this research is to develop granular activated
carbons tailored for the removal of organic taste and odor compounds from water.
In particular, methyl isoborneol (MIB) and geosmin impart musty tastes and odors
to drinking water even when they occur at concentrations as low as 5-10 parts
per trillion; although these compounds pose no health risks, their presence
invariably causes complaints and safety concerns among consumers. Activated
carbon adsorption offers an important approach for removing geosmin, MIB and
other odorants. The research will be conducted in three sequential tasks: (1)
fundamentals-oriented bench scale testing, including methane-steam thermal
treatments of the carbon with characterization of diffusion rates versus
reaction rates during thermal treatment, (2) coordination with pilot-scale
manufacture of the tailored GAC and (3) pilot scale evaluation at a municipal
water treatment facility. The research will test the hypothesis that, using a
methane-steam heat treatment process, increased odorant removal corresponds to
increased pore volume, decreased surface acidity and increased graphene plane
elongation. If successful, this project will result in activated carbons
tailored to the effective removal of MIB, geosmin and other organic compounds.
This project is supported under the GOALI program of NSF; the PIs will work
closely with NORIT Americas, Inc. in the developmental work and with the Passaic
Valley Water Commission (NJ) in the pilot-scale evaluations.
