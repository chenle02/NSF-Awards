This project is for the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research projects in the Department of Physics. Valuable practical
experience will be provided to the student participants. The project is being
conducted in an unusual observatory in the auroral zone at Fairbanks, Alaska and
at the Plasma Physics Laboratory at UCLA. These facilities are complementary
permitting both probing of the auroral ionosphere and simulation of various
nonlinear processes in the natural plasma. This project is supported under the
Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate
supply of scientists for the future.
