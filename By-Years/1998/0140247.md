The Plasmid Biology 2002 Conference will be held in Pittsburgh in June 2002.
Plasmids represent a unique group of genetic elements found in prokaryotes,
eukaryotes and archaeon. In addition to their use as models for basic biological
studies, plasmids are also important tools in the biotechnology industry,
including their use in applications relevant to medicine and agriculture.
Plasmids are a major source for genetic diversity amongst various organisms and
are responsible for the spread of a variety of genes in nature. Plasmid Biology
2002 represents a continuation of the symposium held to discuss the highlights
of major advances in this field every two years. This meeting deals with all
aspects of plasmid biology, including their replication and maintenance,
transfer, their role as a source of a horizontal gene pool, evolution, and
ecology. Approximately 200 scientists are expected to attend. There is no
similar meeting that has an in-depth discussion of the various areas of plasmid
biology. This meeting serves the international plasmid biology community and
provides an excellent forum for exchange of ideas that are critical for the
continued advances in the field. Participants in the meeting have traditionally
included leaders in the field as well as younger scientists such as graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows. Oral presentations by young scientists are
encouraged and are designed to stimulate their enthusiasm for this field. NSF
funds will help defray travel expenses of graduate students and postdoctural
fellows.
