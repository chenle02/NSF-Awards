This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department at Indiana University acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer which will
be used in research investigations in the following areas: (1) metallo-organic
chemistry; (2) metal carboxylate chemistry; (3) materials-related chemistry and
organometallic chemistry; and (4) nucleic acid catalysts (ribozymes and
deoxyribosymes). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
