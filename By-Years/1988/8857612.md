This award provides support to Dr. John Campbell under the National Science
Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards program. The objectives of
this program are to provide research support to the Nation's most outstanding
and promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to
improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand
for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and
industrial research and teaching. This award will allow the investigator to
pursue his research in the study of macroeconomics, financial economics, and
applied econometrics. There are several major broad research questions that are
central to his research interests. One issue is what determines long-term asset
prices. Another is what determines aggregate savings behavior. A third question
is what are the long-run implications of business cycle fluctuations. All of
these are extremely important areas for research with important policy
implications for the U.S economy.
