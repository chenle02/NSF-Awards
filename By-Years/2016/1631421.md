This proposal requests funding to partially support a workshop that will promote
greater communication between the Science of Science and Innovation Policy
(SciSIP) academic community and science policy decision-makers within the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goal of the workshop is to enhance the
quality and relevance of SciSIP research by: (1) making S.ciSIP researchers more
aware of the key policy issues and problems confronting NIH leadership, (2)
enhancing understanding of both public and administrative data generated by NIH
that may be useful for SciSIP research, (3) increasing NIH leadership?s
understanding of how both public and administrative data might facilitate SciSIP
research, and (4) identifying the major hurdles to data access for SciSIP
researchers and propose solutions to resolve them.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop addresses this question by
bringing together SciSIP researchers and officials at NIH, one of the largest
funders of extramural basic science, in a structured format intended to
concentrate discussion on key issues that require greater understanding on both
sides. The outcome of the workshop will be smoother interaction between the
research community and NIH officials and greater access to data necessary to
advance the SciSIP research agenda.
