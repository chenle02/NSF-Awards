Under a Research Initiation Award contact mechanics and stress analysis
techniques will be used to analyze repeated abrasive contacts of ceramic
materials. The generation and evolution of plastic zones and microcracks will be
modeled as many microevents of sharp sliding indentation. The combined results
will be used to develop a predictive model for abrasive wear of ceramic
materials.
