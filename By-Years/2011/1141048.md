The Board on Science Education of the National Research Council (NRC) will
conduct a project to begin the planning process on core ideas for K-12 standards
in the behavioral and social sciences. This effort will complement the report
that the NRC recently released that focused on the design of K-12 education
standards in the physical, life, and earth sciences. The central planning
activity will entail convening a group of invited experts and stakeholders and
commissioning papers that will help in clarifying the current state of
behavioral and social science education in the K-12 curriculum and in
determining the feasibility of developing a conceptual framework for such
standards.
