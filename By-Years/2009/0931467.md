TITLE: EXP-SA: Nanofibril Films for Dual-Sensing Explosives
Detection&lt;br/&gt;PI name: Ling Zang&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Southern Illinois
University at Carbondale &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0730667&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will build upon
unique molecular assembly techniques pioneered in the PIs' laboratories. By
controlling the nanoscale morphology of fluorescent materials, they have
demonstrated efficient vapor phase explosives detection that is independent of
film thickness. By modifying the molecular structure and improving fabrication
of the assembled arylene-ethynylene macrocycles (AREs), they can optimize the
fluorescent quenching-based sensory response. An alternative transduction
mechanism is also proposed which relies on measuring conductivity changes in the
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
