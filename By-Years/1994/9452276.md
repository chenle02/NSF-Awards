9452276 Morgan Recent developments in molecular technology have produced a
revolution in research on the evolutionary relationships of organisms. Also,
major evolutionary questions in all groups of living organisms are now using
molecular techniques and data such as gene sequences. This project therefore
enhances the evolutionary education of our students through course work in which
they learn how modern evolutionary research is conducted. They also conduct the
research themselves, employing the most useful modern molecular methods and
instrumentation such as sequencing apparatus and a temperature cycler for
amplification of genes. The project is expected to significantly enhance the
evolutionary education offered to undergraduate students and will add breadth to
our curriculum. It also gives students the opportunity to learn firsthand how
evolutionary research is conducted, and allows them to use and become familiar
with current molecular methods.
