This study is to examine the abnormal adhesive interactions between sickle blood
cells and the endothelial cells of arterial wall under physiological flow
conditions. A well characterized model system using a flow chamber will be
utilized to study this interaction under well quantitated conditions. The study
will be aided by the use of digital processing of video-taped images showing the
interactions between the red blood cells and endothelial cells deposited on
glass slides. Utilizing engineering technology in a novel way, this study will
contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease.
The grant will also allow the professional development of an exemplary role
model for underrepresented minorities.
