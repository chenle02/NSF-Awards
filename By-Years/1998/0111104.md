John Weeks of the University of Maryland is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the properties of nonuniform
fluids. This work concentrates on ionic systems, and addresses the following
topics: 1) research in the theory of ionic liquids focusing on regimes where
molecular and intermediate length scales play an important role along with long-
range Coulomb interactions, 2) further development of the theory of hydrophobic
interactions and application to new experiments describing the density
distribution of water near hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, 3) detailed
examination of the relationship between this new theoretical approach and
density functional theory, and 4) development of new technical extensions and
improvements in the theory by incorporating known data for bulk systems and
exact sum rules. This may be required for quantitative results in some of the
applications, ionic liquids in particular, and is expected to facilitate the
development of simple semi-empirical approaches that make use of experimental
data to help uncover new qualitative effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems in
the area of nonuniform fluids are of great current interest due to their
practical importance in biophysical and industrial applications. Experiments
have shown that the static and dynamic properties of nonuniform simple fluids,
particularly when confined to small pores or slits, differ dramatically from
those of uniform systems. Nonuniform solutions containing ions such as salts and
proteins play a key role in biological processes. The nonuniform charge
distribution associated with double layer formation is believed to stabilize
aqueous solutions of macromolecules and colloids.
