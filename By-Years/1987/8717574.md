Dr. Ho's work will focus on quasicrystals and superfluid helium three. In the
area of quasicrystals, he will study the equilibrium and growth shapes of
icosahedral and decagonal quasicrystals, and bond-oriented glasses, the
stability of quasicrystals, and the structures and the diffraction patterns of
the decagonal phases. In the area of superfluid Helium three, he will study the
structure and the properties of Helium three in very confined geometries.
