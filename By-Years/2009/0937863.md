We seek to establish a new model for online educational communities, based less
on the digital library model of information gained by searching a collection.
Instead, we focus on the value added by community-driven content through
members' discussions, reviews, and ratings of content items. To gain critical
mass for community input, we must actively lower barriers to participation by
disseminating information from both the content and the community into the
notification streams that community members routinely use. This includes
traditional dissemination mechanisms (web-sites for collections, forums, email,
and online blogs and newsletters for notification) and newer notification
streams (social networking sites where users can subscribe to receive
notification as part of their everyday online life).&lt;br/&gt;Our target
educational community is the AlgoViz project (http://algoviz.org), which aims to
promote the use of Algorithm Visualizations (AVs) in the classroom. Despite
being widely viewed as potentially improving CS education, the rate of AV use
has progressed little from the mid 1990s. Known impediments could be overcome if
existing knowledge about best practices in AV use were distributed by an
effective community of AV developers and users. Improved AV use in the classroom
potentially affects the educational outcomes for tens of thousands of students
every year. A clearinghouse of available AVs, with community-based rating and
review, and interaction between users and developers, will make it easier for
instructors to adopt quality educational&lt;br/&gt;materials. Our techniques for
lowering barriers to contributing user-driven content to educational collections
should be applicable to many educational communities.
