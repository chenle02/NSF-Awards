9523902 Stucki This is an interdisciplinary study of the bacterial reduction of
structural iron (Fe) in clay minerals. Bacteria and alumino-silicate clay
minerals are two of the most abundant and most chemically active constituents of
soils and aquatic sediments. Both have been independently identified as major
players in determining the rates of degradation., accumulation, and transport of
toxic metals and organic pollutants in the environment; but little is known
about their interaction mechanism(s), how this affects their behavior, and the
potential for exploiting bacterial-clay reactions to achieve optimal performance
in natural environmental systems. Oxidation and reduction (change of
electrostatic charge) of Fe in the clay crystal structure is one type of
interaction that potentially is of very great significance, but little attention
has been given to it. Studies using inorganic reducing agents in the laboratory
revealed that changes in Fe oxidation state profoundly alter the chemical and
physical behavior of the clay. Does the same thing happen in the environment
when clays and bacteria interact? If so, to what extent and at what rate? Does
the bacteria alter other compounds, such as metals and organic acids, during the
oxidation-reduction process with clays? What are the optimum conditions? The
overall goals of this study will, therefore, be two-fold: (1) to identify the
optimum conditions under which bacteria reduction will occur in soils and
sediments; and (2) to determine the effect of bacterial reduction on clay
properties and on clay-organic and clay-metal interactions.
