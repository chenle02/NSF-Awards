The principal investigator will further develop the machinery recently created
to solve the Burnside problem in periodic groups for even exponents greater than
1 in order to obtain a complete description of finite subgroups of free Burnside
groups; to solve the word problem for free Burnside groups in subexponential
time; to investigate various properties of subpresentations of standard
presentations of free Burnside groups and splitting automorphisms of these
groups; to construct explicit examples of infinite simple 2-groups and
2-generated infinite 2-groups of bounded exponent all of whose proper subgroups
are locally finite. A group is an algebraic object having a multiplication
defined on it. Groups can have an infinite number of elements or a finite number
of elements. Recently, this researcher has provided a solution to the famous
Burnside problem for even exponents, a problem which has been open since the
turn of the century. This award supports an effort to exploit the techniques
developed for the solution of this problem. The work has connections to several
areas of mathematics, as well as computer science.
