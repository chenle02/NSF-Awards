9313847 Stolfo We study solutions to the performance bottleneck in expert
databases using the PARADISER 10 distributed rule processing environment as our
testbed. We purpose an approach that combines statically computed restrictions
on the rules of a rule program for partitioning the workload of rule evaluation
among an arbitrary number of rule program replicas evaluated at distinct
processing sites, and dynamic load balancing protocols that update and
reorganize the distribution of workload by modifying the restrictions at
runtime. (Rules are not redistributed.) Our techniques utilize one form of
"meta-data", namely, statistics gathered on the attribute values and size of
relations of the underlying database (e.g., number of distinct values of an
attribute, number of tuples in a relation etc.) in the algorithms that compute
the restrictions on the rules. We analyze the dynamic load balancing protocols
in terms of efficiency and scalability criteria, which provide guidance on the
expected behavior of the protocols with increasing database size. The proposed
research falls into three main categories: (a) workload distribution paradigms
among processing sites to ameliorate the performance degradation resulting from
scaling up of database size, (b) a suite of load balancing protocols for dynamic
"logical" reorganization of the underlying database, and their scaling
characteristics, and , (c) experimental validation in the PARADISER expert
database environment, using a suite of benchmark rule programs. A fully
operational and transferable rule processing environment will be constructed
that embodies these results.
