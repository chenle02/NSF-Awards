The idea of median filters can be generalized so as to lead to nonlinear filters
that include as a special case order statistic filters (Ll- estimators). Such
filters can be very efficient in processing signals of nongaussian nature and
can be constrained to be robust against the presence of occasional impulsive
disturbances. The coefficients of the filter can be computed adaptively using
extension of LMS and RLS algorithm. This project is involved in deepening the
understanding of the properties of the generalized filters, particularly when
used in an adaptive signal processing framework. Preliminary results show very
promising performance. The impact of the study can be considerable in the signal
processing practice since all linear digital filters (recursive and
nonrecursive) could be upgraded with small computational increase to be also
order statistic filters. Robustness and improved performance would easily be
gained in presence of nongaussian signals.
