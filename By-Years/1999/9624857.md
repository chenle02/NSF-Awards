This research focuses on operating system support for collaborative information
systems, in which multiple users or programs cooperate to maintain a shared
information resource on a computer network. The central focus is development and
evaluation of a "network virtual store", a virtual memory based storage
repository for networked clusters of 64-bit computers. The network virtual store
represents a convergence of distributed file systems, software-based distributed
shared memory systems, and "object-oriented database systems" supporting
transactional access to persistent data structures. The goal of the project is
to explore new storage management approaches for group computer- aided design
systems, scalable database servers, and other applications that require high-
performance access to recoverable state in a distributed environment. ***
