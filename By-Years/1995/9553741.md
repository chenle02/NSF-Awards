Texas State Technical College at Harlingen proposes the development of a
Digital Imaging Technology Program to provide specialized skills and training to
students in the emerging field of digital imaging technology. Explosive new
digital imaging technologies are dramatically changing the graphic
arts/electronic imaging industry. Although the technology is here today, the
ability of work sites across the country to keep up with newly emerging methods
has been impeded by lack of knowledge and inadequate training of personnel in
digital imaging and its benefits. This project proposes the development of
digital imaging curriculum and focuses on the creation of a leading edge digital
imaging laboratory/studio to facilitate the use of nontraditional learning
approaches that encourage interactive learning, team building, and creative
problem solving among students and instructors. Other key components of the
project include extensive collaborative efforts with secondary learning
institutions, the Tech Prep/School to Work Initiative, and regional, state and
national industries. The population to be served by the project includes
students in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas--a predominantly Hispanic populated
area. Distance learning techniques will be used to provide access to
artistically and technically oriented high school students in remote areas of
the state who can benefit from such training early in their career development
process.
