This project will investigate the phase and dynamic behavior of nematic liquid
crystal mixtures using both statistical theory and computer simulation. Specific
objectives include development and verification of a novel Monte Carlo method
for evaluating the isotropic-nematic transition in binary mesogenic systems, use
of simulation to examine and quantify effects of solute characteristics on the
existence and location of the transition, use of simulation to distinguish
between two different theoretical approaches to modeling nematic mixtures, and
use of simulation to examine transport properties in nematics as a function of
structure and existence of the isotropic-nematic transition. Liquid crystals
have widespread technological relevance, from computer and watch displays to
high definition television, biomimetics, and fundamental understanding of cell
membrane properties. This project will bring tools from recent advances in
statistical thermodynamics and advanced computer simulation technology to bear
upon the fundamental understanding of liquid crystals behavior.
