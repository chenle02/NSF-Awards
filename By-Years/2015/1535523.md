This grant to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will provide travel funds
for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in computer science to attend
the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in 2015. The HFL brings together Laureates
of the most prestigious awards in computer science and mathematics to spend a
week interacting with 200 early career researchers. In addition to the
scientific exchanges with the Laureates and each other, participants at the
Forum gain a valuable global perspective on computer and mathematical
sciences?early career researchers represented 47 countries at the 2014 Forum.
Modeled on the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, the HLF provides graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers with extraordinary access to a group of
scientific role models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual
conversations. Such experiences can have a profound impact on the development of
an early career researcher. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Oak Ridge Associated
Universities (ORAU) will recruit a highly qualified and diverse applicant pool
for the Forum. There are many exceptionally promising early career researchers
who have little or no opportunity to interact with the Laureates of the major
prizes in the computer and mathematical sciences. The HLF is a unique
opportunity for these individuals, one that can energize and steer future
research. The recruitment and selection of participants will emphasize the
potential benefits of the opportunity for the researchers, as well as the
overall goal of ensuring a broadly inclusive group of participants. ORAU will
provide logistical support both prior to and during the forum and also continue
to perform an assessment of participant experiences to document the impact of
the Forum.
