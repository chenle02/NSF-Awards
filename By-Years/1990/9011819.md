This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. It continues the research that was initiated the
day following the Loma Prieta earthquake, namely to collect the perishable data
on the seismic performance of soil nailed walls in the San Francisco Bay area.
Soil nailing is a construction procedure used to shore vertical soil cuts for
temporary or permanent purposes. Soil nailing differs from conventional soldier
pile and tie-back shoring systems in many ways. The technique was first used in
California in the San Francisco area, where numerous temporary and permanent
walls have been constructed in the past 5 to 6 years. The major concern in
California with soil nailed walls is their performance during earthquakes. The
main objective of this follow-on project is to analyze the data collected so as
to obtain a better understanding of the behavior of soil nailed walls when
subjected to seismic forces. Data collected following the earthquake are being
compared with the pre- earthquake data to determine the changes in the wall and
soil movements, and in the nail resistance. The performance is being evaluated
with respect to soil conditions, wall geometry and construction, and ground
motions.
