Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;This project brings fosters computer science
education research by providing educators the opportunity to conduct principled,
large-scale teaching and learning research, to bring them together and build
upon expertise in research theory, design, and methods, and to support
practioners when they engage in high-quality computer science education
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project comprises a set of integrated
activities leading to a practioner designed experiment kit consisting of the
detailed design of a piece of research, from methodology to analysis, which is
situated within a theoretical framework. Practioners develop their kit during a
week-long workshop in the first year, implement it with support during the
academic year and re-convene to discuss results and plan for dissemination in
the following summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to the
improvement of the computer science education research community by developing
educators skills and by exposing them to the relevant theory and methods of
educational research.
