EAR-0242797&lt;br/&gt;Caffee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Purdue Rare Isotope
Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab) measures 10Be (t1/2=1.5 Myr), 26Al (.705
Myr), 36Cl (.301 Myr), and 129I (16 Myr) in a variety of sample matrices,
including rock, soil, water, and air. The goals of the proposal are to complete
an upgrade program that will substantially enhance the capabilities of PRIME
Lab. As an NSF facility our goals are 1) to measure 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, and 129I
for NSF-sponsored geoscience investigators; 2) to perform separation chemistries
for those investigators lacking the facilities to do so themselves; 3) to
improve the precision of all measurements, to increase the throughput of the
facility, and to develop techniques allowing the measurement of radionuclides
not routinely measured; 4) to host vibrant in-house research programs involving
the application of these radionuclides to a variety of geoscience programs,
including the development of new geoscience applications; and 5) to meet the
educational requirements of our university mission by training both
undergraduates and graduate students (from Purdue University and other
universities) in all aspects of the measurement and application of these
radionuclides. During the first year of the proposal our emphasis will be on
completing the hardware improvements however we anticipate successful productive
runs on all radionuclides. During the second year of the proposal we anticipate
increased productivity in terms of the number of samples analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;***
