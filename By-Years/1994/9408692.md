9408692 Bazzaz Partial financial support is requested for a workshop to be held
in Basel-Luenberg, Switzerland, during the period of 14-19 August 1994. The
workshop is one of a series of workshops and symposia organized by the Global
Change in Terrestrial Ecosystems program of the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Program. This workshop will bring together leading researchers on the
effects of global change on populations and communities. The workshop will
include both experimentalists and modelers. This is an area of research that has
not been emphasized previously, but the scientific community is now poised to
greatly expand research efforts in this direction. The workshop aims to review
and analyze the state of knowledge, and identify critical questions and future
directions. The results will be published in a book edited by the organizers.
%%% This conference is the first to focus directly on how global change will
affect population and community level phenomena. The conference includes some of
the world's leading experts on these topics. The proceedings from this workshop
should provide a clear focus for future global change research.
