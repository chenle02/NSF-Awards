This research is concerned with studies of zinc-selenide/zinc- iron-selenide
quantum well structres and zinc-iron-selenide epilayers of high quality which
have been grown by molecular beam epotaxy (MBE) technique. These structures have
the unusual property that the hole confinement is determined by an externally
applied magnetic field. This situation leads to a novel situation concerning the
different types of excitons which has never been observed in a dilute magnetic
semiconductor. The zinc-selenide/zinc-iron-selenide system offers a unique
opportunity to tune the quantum well potential and control the carrier
confinement using an external magnetic field. Magneto- reflectance and magneto-
luminescence spectroscopy measurements will be made exploring the parameter
space of this system (layer thickness, iron concentration, number of wells) as
well as the dependence on temperature and magnetic field. These magneto- optical
studies will also be extended to doped systems.
