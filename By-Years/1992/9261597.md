This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the
use of a computer mouse as a position encoder for science experiments. This use
of the mouse would allow for the representation of circular motion and other
interesting problems. The mouse interface is now built into all computers. Thus,
this use of the mouse would not only make available a powerful measuring device,
it would also be a piece of equipment that is low-cost, easy to use, and not
restricted to a specific computer model. The potential for its impact in science
classrooms is only limited by the imaginations of the teachers.
