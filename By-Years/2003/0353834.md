This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is co-funded by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award
provides support for an REU Site at the University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK).
Nine students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a ten-week summer
experience in research related to wireless biosensors. Students will have an
opportunity to engage in research projects in the interdisciplinary field of
wireless biosensor technology as a part of research collaborations established
between the UTK and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. The program will help
students recognize their academic potential and encourage them to attend
graduate school in order to be poised to take advantage of career opportunities
in research. It is anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on
the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents
engaged in research-related careers at U.S. universities, government agencies,
and private-sector organizations.
