This award provides partial funding for a Workshop that investigates the
technology and applications of the electronic packaging technique called
MultiChip Modules (MCMs) that are particularly relevant and of interest to the
university community. MCMs represent the next generation in packaging. Currently
packaging is a (if not the) major factor limiting system performance, cost
reduction, and new applications. However, the technology is capital-intensive,
and heretofore has been beyond the reach of most universities. Progress has now
opened an opportunity window for university involvement, and this workshop is
intended to investigate how to exploit this opportunity.
