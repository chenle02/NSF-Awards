9423596 Cornell The project's primary objectives are to develop near-term (on
going) and longer-term procedures for succinct, explicit, yet rigorous,
representation of the probabilistic analysis of nonlinear behavior of realistic
multi-degree-of- freedom (MDOF) structures and to demonstrate their
applicability in the domain of building practice by applying them as existing
structures. The concept of the load reduction factor, R, for multidegree-of-
freedom structures will be studied; this R-factor captures the post-elastic,
dynamic interaction of the structures and the earthquake record. This task will
determine the degree to which this R factor depends on even magnitude and
distance, and hence when it might require Site-specific analysis. Dependence on
damage measure and frame/foundation issues will also be studied. In most cases
existing (linear single degree-of- freedom based) seismic hazard maps will be
adequate for application of these procedures; may contain the dominant portions
of the hazard-related issues. The procedures will reflect the additional
uncertainties in nonlinear response and capacity. The project will provide new
understanding about nonlinear behavior of structures and their dependence on
seismological factors. It will produce significant answers to the building
design profession's need for a set of practical procedures; it will provide to
current building design formats that are internationally consistent both
mechanically and probabilistically. ***
