Transport and distribution networks come in a number of forms, from animal
cardiovascular and respiratory systems to communication and industrial
infrastructures. Practical issues abound: prediction of local spikes, estimation
of perfusion, and impact of structural changes such as vessel occlusion. The
complexity of such phenomena can be illustrated by the well-known Braess'
paradox: adding links to a transportation network might not improve the
operation of the system! In spite of recent successes, our understanding of
network flows is usually limited to small deterministic problems, while most
applications correspond to large uncertain ones. The goal of this project is to
enable improved predictions in biological and technological transport and
diffusion networks. For instance, can one predict how cerebral blood flow will
be affected if one of the carotids becomes narrow or blocked? Will the
vasculature allow for re-routing? If so, with what probability and how fast?
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main challenge in this research project is the
presence of uncertainties. For many applications, only partial information about
the systems is available. For instance the size or even the presence of a
specific vessel might be uncertain or the status of a router unknown. The
analysis of such problems requires the creation of novel mathematical tools and
numerical methods to describe how uncertainties propagate through vast and
complex networks. The computational tools to be constructed will provide
information, usually probabilistic in nature, regarding phenomena that are
difficult, expensive, or impossible to measure.
