This project concerns new research in the theory of reputation in repeated
games, a branch of noncooperative game theory that has a wide range of
applications in Economics, including to analysis of monopolistic practices,
commitment in monetary policy, reputation in debt markets, credibility in
information transmission and breakdown in credence good markets. The PI and his
collaborator develop a new method to study reputation effects in two-player
repeated games with equally patient players, imperfect monitoring and one-sided
incomplete information.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Recall that the reputation effect
is the phenomenon that the patient limit of the set of equilibrium payoffs of a
repeated game changes dramatically when the game is perturbed by small amounts
of incomplete information in the form of an ex ante small probability that one
of the players is committed to a given strategy. In the benchmark case in which
a long-run player faces a sequence of myopic short-run players, it is well known
that reputation effects select the Stackelberg payoff in the patient limit under
fairly general conditions. This provides a foundation for the intuitive idea
that "reputation substitutes for commitment." The case where both players are
forward looking and comparably patient, while clearly important, is not nearly
as well understood. Existing results show that reputation effects are elusive
when players have equal discount factors and monitoring is perfect. The
investigator and a collaborator propose a methodology to study the case in which
there is imperfect public monitoring, that is, the players observe a noisy
public signal about their actions. The methods are used to show that, unlike the
perfect monitoring case, when the informed player is imperfectly monitored and
the stage game has common interests (a class of games that includes well known
models of nuclear disarmament and currency attacks), reputation effects select
the Stackelberg payoff in the limit as the common discount factor tends to one.
