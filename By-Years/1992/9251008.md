A computer laboratory classroom is being used full-time and exclusively for
undergraduate mathematics instruction. Through the laboratory, instruction will
be enhanced, providing significantly improved versions of calculus courses that
are taken primarily by undergraduate majors in mathematics, engineering, and the
physical sciences. The computer equipment will be used to significantly enhance
student conceptual understanding of the fundamental mathematical ideas. By
incorporating computer graphics and symbolic algebra software into the lectures,
students can focus on the main ideas instead of the routine algebraic
manipulations that most students associate with mathematical activity. In
addition, experimental versions of undergraduate courses in multivariable
calculus, ordinary differential equations, and linear algebra will be developed.
During each of the fall and spring semesters, about twelve sections of first-
year calculus courses (totaling 480 students per semester) will meet in the
laboratory at least weekly, and four sections of the more advanced courses
(totaling 160 students per semester) will be taught exclusively in this
laboratory.In the summer, the laboratory will provide a greatly expanded, full-
time facility for the Arizona State University Minority Youth Program, the goal
of which is to increase the supply of students from traditionally under
represented ethnic groups majoring in mathematics and science. During each
summer 200 high school student participants will be taught in this facility.
