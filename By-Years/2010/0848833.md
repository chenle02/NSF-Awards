The synthesis of larger acene-like molecules (heteroacenes) is planned. In the
heteroacenes, some of the aromatic C-H groups are substituted by pyridine-type
nitrogens. The groups will probe the influence of an increasing number of
nitrogen ring atoms on the optical, electrochemical and electrical properties of
the heteroacenes. To increase the solubility (of the proposed acene-types) and
enforce mutual overlap of the aromatic molecules in the solid state,they will
install (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl groups as substituents. The trialkylsilyl groups
facilitate the solution-phase processing of the heteroacenes. The synthesis part
will be expanded towards halogenated azapentacenes as these are of great current
interest as electron transport materials and can be made readily by
intermediates that are prepared en route. A broad investigation of the thin film
formation of the heteroacenes on solid supports is planned. These thin films
will be examined by microscopy and spectroscopic methods; the groups plan to
modify the underlying surfaces by organic ligands to control the stacking and
packing of the proposed heteroacenes to optimize their electric properties
parallel and perpendicular to the surface and envision potential applications in
organic electronics. The proposed heteroacenes are electron conducting materials
for n-channel thin film transistors. The heteroacenes should have similar
electric properties to pentacene (the most important organic semiconductor).
They can transport electrons instead of positive charges (holes). Heteroacenes
potentially allow the construction of organic electronic devices with reverse
polarity and reverse flow of current. Such reversed-polarity thin film
transistors are of broad importance as drivers in advanced light emitting diodes
and solid-state lighting devices. The PI has established a track record for
working with minority high schools and has taught an advanced organic chemistry
class at an HBCU (Clark Atlanta). It is planned to continue these activities
during this grant period.
