The overall goals of this research are to achieve rate enhancements of several
thousand fold, and to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) for the activation
process. This research will therefore provide new insights into the factors that
govern enzyme activity in organic solvents, and will enable enzymes to play an
expanded role in industrial processes, including chemicals and pharmaceuticals
synthesis, polymer synthesis, drug discovery, and waste treatment, among other
emerging applications of biocatalysis. Moreover, the same techniques that lead
to improved enzyme function in organic solvents are likely to be of use in the
stabilization of dehydrated protein systems, which is a critical issue in
biotherapeutic protein formulation and delivery. Thus, this work has broad
impact, ranging from biocatalysis to drug discovery to biopharmaceutical
formulations.
