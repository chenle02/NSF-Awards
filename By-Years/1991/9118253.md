The principal investigator will carry out a combined field and laboratory study
of Archaean anorthosites from the high-grade gneiss complex of West Greenland,
utilizing a variety of geochemical techniques. The work will result in new
insights into the nature of magmatic differentiation of anorthosite bodies and
place new constraints on their parent magma compositions. The work will also
bear on general problems related to the early crustal evolution of the Earth.
