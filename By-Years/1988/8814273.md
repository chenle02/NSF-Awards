This award will support cooperative research between Professor C.W. Berisford of
the University of Georgia, Dr. D.L. Dahlsten of the University of California,
Berkeley, and Dr. F.D.Morgan of the University of Adelaide, Australia. The
investigators will study the effects of insect parasites and predators on the
pine bark beetle in Australia and, in so doing, will also develop a reliable
sampling technique for future evaluations of this type. The Australian
environment is a uniquely suitable one for this study, since the pine bark
beetle is the only species of bark beetle there, and its interaction with
parasites and predators can therefore be studied without the confounding effects
of competitor species. The project combines the experience and expertise of the
three inves- tigators; those from the U.S. are experts on the parasites and
predators of the pine bark beetle, and their Australian collaborator has been
directing a biological control program for these insects. The work has the
potential to increase our understanding of the biological control process for
agricultural pests, as well as of some basic aspects of classical biological
control, such as single vs. multiple introductions of biological enemies.
