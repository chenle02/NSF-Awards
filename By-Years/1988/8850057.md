The Chemistry Department at Midwestern State University (MSU), which has 10
years experience in working with high school students (Project SEED), has
designed an eight-week research projects for 12 high school students with no
more than three students to a professor. The students will also receive formal
career counseling, minicourses in technical writing, research methodology, and
Special Topics in Chemistry. Field trips to several outstanding research
laboratories and participation in two student-faculty panels on philosophy and
ethics are also included. Most of these activities will continue at M.S.U. on
one or more Saturdays each month during the academic year.
