This project permits undergraduate students in computer science to experiment
with practical operating systems programming in a laboratory environment.
Working in teams, students both modify and enhance an existing operating system.
The laboratory that supports this project includes PC-AT clones (with floppy and
hard drives) running the MINIX operating system. The laboratory experience
permits students to gain practical knowledge about operating systems, knowledge
that is often overlooked in a traditional operating systems course. This award
is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
