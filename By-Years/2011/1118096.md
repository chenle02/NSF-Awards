New application scenarios (most notably arising from cloud computing) have given
rise to a host of new security concerns. Unsurprisingly, classical notions of
encryption leave much to be desired for dealing with these new application
scenarios and concerns. Motivated by these concerns, we develop novel encryption
systems that provide vastly greater functionality than classical notions of
encryption. In particular, we focus on two broad research directions: Functional
encryption and Efficient Secure Encodings of Computation. In functional
encryption, instead of encrypting a message to an individual user, one can
encrypt a general function f. If a receiving user possesses certain credentials
X, then it obtains a secret key SK-X corresponding to those credentials. When
this user obtains a ciphertext that is an encryption of f, by applying the
decryption algorithm it obtains f(X), and no more. Efficient Secure Encodings of
Computation is a totally new notion that has fundamental applications to novel
expressive encryption schemes including functional encryption with public keys
(recently introduced by the PI under the terminology ?Worry-Free Encryption?),
and most notably controlled Homomorphic Encryption -- where expressive
homomorphisms are possible on ciphertexts, but the initial encryptor can control
what homomorphisms are allowed.
