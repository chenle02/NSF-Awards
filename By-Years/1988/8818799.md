The aim of the seminar is to investigate the apparent discrepancy between recent
rapid and pervasive technological change and the long-term fall in the rate of
growth of total factor productivity and of gross national product. The seminar
will permit the findings of recent and ongoing U.S.studies to be integrated into
an international empirical and analytical framework allowing for a comparison of
results, an analytical confrontation with European and Japanese approaches. The
above issue will be examined from four main angles: the measurement of technical
change and the calculation of factor produtivity; the management of the
productive resources, the organization of firms in the face of current change
and obstacles to the diffusion of new technologies; the relationships, interface
and interactions between current major technological development and its
structural impact on the orgnization of the manufacturing service sectors;
economic growth modelling, macro/micro relationships and macro-economic policy
for technical change and growth. The seminar will map out areas of economic and
social research that is required for improved policy making to facilitate the
diffusion and adoption of new technologies and their subsequent development. It
is also anticipated to provide the U.S. with new information on measuring
economic returns to R&D.
