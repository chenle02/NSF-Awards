Risk is a central fact of life in the rural areas of less developed countries.
There is a vast, mainly theoretical literature that explores the consequences of
risk for individual behavior and the evolution of institutions. In the absence
of complete insurance markets, households utilize a variety of economic
strategies in order to mitigate the consequences of risk. The purpose of this
project is to analyze the joint saving and credit market decisions made by
households as they attempt to cope with risk in a social setting characterized
by an important, but incomplete mutual insurance network in northern Nigeria.
Saving and credit transactions take on a special role when insurance markets are
incomplete by allowing households to smooth their consumption streams in the
face of random income fluctuations. This issue will be analyzed using data
collected in a nine-round survey of the region in 1988-1989. This rich data set
will permit an investigation of the ex post strategies adopted by households in
response to the recent receipt of random shocks. The analysis will be based on
joint estimation of the effect of random shocks on net asset sales and net
borrowing, taking into account the structure of the credit market revealed in
earlier work. An understanding of the magnitude of the consumption- smoothing
motivation for asset accumulation is a prerequisite for a more general analysis
of the level and composition of rural investment. In addition, the findings
should contribute to current discussions regarding interventions designed to
reduce the vulnerability of households to drought.
