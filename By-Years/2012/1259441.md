STEM Scholars Connect is a comprehensive program that leverages strong
partnerships with regional employers, transfer institutions, the local school
district and community-based organizations with S-STEM scholarships and academic
support services. STEM Scholars Connect is providing up to 60 academically
talented and economically disadvantaged STEM Scholars with financial support
that allows them to pursue STEM education full-time and enrichment activities
that are designed to increase their rates of completing associate degrees in
STEM fields.

Intellectual Merit: The STEM Scholars Connect project is addressing the national
imperative to recruit and retain undergraduates in STEM disciplines. This is
accomplished by implementing best practices, such as peer mentoring and cohort-
building activities, providing opportunities to engage in research, offering
scholastic support services that include a first-year STEMinar and interacting
with industry professionals to explore STEM career pathways. The STEM Scholars
Connect project provides a model for other community colleges to adapt and
implement to increase graduation rates of students pursuing STEM majors.

Broader Impacts: By encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups,
displaced workers, refugees and financially disadvantaged students, the STEM
Scholars Connect project increases access to educational and professional
opportunities for diverse students, thereby diversifying the STEM workforce.
Dissemination of lessons learned from this project will inform better strategies
for broadening the participation of underserved and underprivileged students in
STEM disciplines.
