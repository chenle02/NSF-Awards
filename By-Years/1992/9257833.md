This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will support the
identification, observation, and measurement of planetary nebulae in galaxies
other than our own. The principal investigator, Dr. Robin Ciardullo, will use
these observations to study the large scale motions in these galaxies, study the
late stages of stellar evolution, and determine a better calibrated distance
scale for the Universe.
