The goal of Dr. Spergel's project is to synthesize the growing body of
observational data that suggests that our Galaxy, the Milky Way, has significant
non-axisymmetric structure. Improvements in infrared technology have enabled
astronomers to observe the galactic center at wavelengths not obscured by dust.
These observations suggest that our Galaxy is barred. Radio wavelength surveys
of gas motions in our Galaxy reveal significant non- circular motions that are
likely due to this bar. Dr. Spergel plans to develop analytical and numerical
techniques to construct a three-dimensional model of the Milky Way that is
consistent with the observations. Improvements in our understanding of orbital
dynamics in triaxial systems as well as improvements in numerical techniques and
computer hardware will facilitate this study. Dr. Spergel also plans to study
the dynamics of corrugation waves and spiral density waves excited by the bar
and the galactic spheroid and to explore how these waves alter gas motions in
the Galaxy. Ultimately the goal of this research is to better understand the
morphology and dynamics of the Milky Way and to provide insight into its origin
and evolution.
