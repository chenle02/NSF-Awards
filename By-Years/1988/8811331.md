This project is concerned with the development and analysis of efficient
numerical methods for solving approximately two and three dimensional time-
harmonic inverse scattering problems in the intermediate frequency range in
which computation is required and asymptotic methods are unsuitable. The class
of problems considered is important in many areas of science and technology,
including nondestructive evaluation and seismosology.
