9618147 Oltman-Shay The PIs hypothesize that the group structure of wind waves
generates infragravity waves (0.005 to 0.05 Hz) in a natural surf zone. In this
project they will investigate the dynamical importance of the wind-wave-group
structure by analyzing existing field data to determine the vertical velocity
structure, and particularly the vertical velocity variance in the infragravity
wave velocity field.
