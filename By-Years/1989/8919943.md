Brain activity is the combined effect of excitatory and inhibitory nerve cells
acting in concert. An imbalance of their activities can result in neurological
problems such as stress, anxiety or even seizures. The major inhibitory system
in the brain is composed of nerve cells which release a chemical signaling
molecule, gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA). This compound acts on other nerve
cells by inhibiting their activity. Many drugs that are used as sedatives, anti-
anxiety agents or anti-epileptics are thought to act by increasing the activity
of the GABA inhibitory nerve cells. This research project will investigate the
control of the GABA inhibitory system. There is some evidence that an enzyme,
phospholipase A2, interferes with the proper function of the GABA system. This
project will test whether the activation of this enzyme negatively influences
the GABA inhibitory nerve cells. The results could provide insight into the
factors contributing to stress, anxiety and seizures and help identify
therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these ailments.
