9452261 Vilches Upper division (Junior and Senior) laboratories are, or should
be, the initial training ground in modern experimental methods. We have been
developing three lines of related experiments where students will be able to
learn not only the technology of an individual experiment, but also how
knowledge on a particular theme is acquired through the use of complementary
information from many probes. The three lines of experiments follow electronic
properties of solids, phase transitions and critical phenomena, and spectroscopy
themes. By purchasing an instructional X-ray generator, a Fabry-Perot
interferometer, a video data acquisition system, and a few additional items we
will be able to fully implement our development plan.
