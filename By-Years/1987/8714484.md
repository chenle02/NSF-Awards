This grant provides funds to support travel expense for several non US
scientists to attend and present talks at the 1987 Gordon Research Conference of
chemical Oceanography, an important forum for a broad exchange of ideas and
information in the expanding field of marine geochemistry. The central theme of
the summer 1987 meeting is non-steady state variation in key processes that
control chemical distributions in marine environments Significant work in this
area has been accomplished by a number of distinguished foreign scientists which
have agreed to participate in the meeting. Benefits from participation of
internationally recognized foreign participants to the U.S. Community are
obvious. Many current marine geocheimcal research programs incorporate a global
scale perspective and will benefit from increased international exchange of
ideas. The Gordon Research Conference provides a unique opportunity for
developing closer contacts with distinguised leaders for a number of countries.
