This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Miami University to acquire an electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas including the following: (1) the study of the chemical reactivity of
and the conditions necessary to generate radicals from a series of carcinogens,
(2) the characterization of metal binding sites in proteins, (3) the
characterization of sol-gel processes for gas phase sensors, and (4) the study
of metal binding sites in proteins involved in meiosis. An electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain information about
the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to
obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often
essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical
reactions.
