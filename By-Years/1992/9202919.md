This proposal is submitted to the FY-92 Instrumentation Competition conducted
by the Division of Social and Economic Science of the National Science
Foundation. It requests support to purchase a computer array for large-scale
data processing and numerical analysis required by fourteen research projects.
The Principal Investigators in those projects constitute a multi- disciplinary
User Group from the Departments of Economics, Sociology and Psychology, and the
School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, plus the Population
Research Center and Chapin Hall Center for Children at NORC. While the
requesting projects represent a range of scientific interests and substantive
problems, they have a unified need for similar algorithms to identify models of
individual, group, or organ subsystem behavior. The commonalities can be
summarized under four general headings: 1. Linear estimation using large
samples; 2. Non-linear function optimization, often using large files; 3.
Simulation and Monte Carlo estimation; 4. Solution of differential equation
systems. Importantly, the computer array itself is an assembly of state- of-the-
art components using low-cost technology with natural extensions to processing
power rivaled only by super-computers. Its advantages for social science
computing in cost-performance, ease-of-use, flexibility, and robustness are
unmatched.
