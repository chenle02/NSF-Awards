This action funds Christiana Chang of University of Houston to conduct a
research project, entitled "Effects of temperature on electronic plastic
sensors," during the summer of 2012 at Chiba University in Chiba, Chiba
Prefecture, Japan. The host scientist is Professor Ning Hu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development and
experimental verification of accurate numerical models of carbon nanoparticle
enhanced polymers, an emerging class of multifunction materials which can be
used for sensing applications. This research contributes to basic understanding
of the sensing mechanism working principles and in the design of such materials
for the development of highly sensitive, robust, structurally integrated carbon
based sensors.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
