9616440 Rabalais Ion Beam Deposition (IBD) will be used for the isotopic
structuring of thin films to explore fundamental issues in diffusion and
interfacial reactions in silicon. Almost all previous studies of silicon self
diffusion have used indirect methods to obtain experimental information. Self-
diffusion mechanisms of interstitial and vacancy migration in silicon and group
III nitrides will be studied, and the structural, electrical, and optical
properties of isotopically engineered materials will be obtained. %%%% This
information is of increasingly critical interest to silicon microelectronics as
the dimensional tolerances for fiberoptic and optoelectronic device structures
fabricated by ion implantation or diffusion get ever smaller. ***
