DEB-0107604 &lt;br/&gt;Pennings&lt;br/&gt;Ecologists have long hypothesized that
herbivore pressure is more intense and that plant defenses are better developed
towards the tropics than at higher latitudes. Although some indirect evidence
supports these ideas, the large geographic scale of the problem has hampered
attempts at more direct studies. My recent work in Atlantic coast salt marshes
directly demonstrated that southern marsh plants are less palatable to
herbivores than are northern plants of the same species. The current project
will test the hypothesis that herbivore pressure in these communities is greater
at lower than at higher latitudes. Herbivore pressure will be assessed by
planting "standard" plants into marshes in each geographic region and observing
herbivore damage, and by herbivore counts. A second goal of the project will be
to determine whether the plants require cues such as climate or herbivore damage
in order to develop latitudinal differences in palatability, or whether these
differences are "pre-programmed". These alternatives will be compared by growing
plants from both geographic regions side by side in a common greenhouse. By
overcoming several of the logistical problems that have plagued past studies,
this project will bring a new level of rigor and understanding to the study of
latitudinal gradients in plant palatability.&lt;br/&gt;
