The objectives of this project are to isolate and characterize a protein in
plant stem cell membranes that is involved in the transport and action of the
plant growth regulator, auxin. Auxin is synthesized in the growing tips of
plants and is transported through stem cells rather than being carried by a
circulatory system. It is transported through these cells in a unidirectional
fashion, from the apex to the base. This transport is required for auxin
stimulation of the elongation of these cells. Naphthylphthalamic Acid (NPA), an
herbicide, binds specifically to a protein in cell membranes, inhibiting auxin
transport. This NPA-binding protein, which is located largely on the lower ends
of stem cell membranes, is thought to be involved in unidirectional auxin
transport. Establishing the structure of this protein and understanding its role
in auxin transport will aid in understanding the mechanism of this transport
process and in understanding the auxin-controlled coordinated growth and
development of plants. This proposal will use a radioactive analog of NPA,
5'-azido-NPA (Az- NPA) to radioactively label the NPA-binding protein, purify
the radioactively labeled protein, and determine the amino acid sequence of the
amino terminal portion of the isolated protein.
