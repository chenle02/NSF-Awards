Theoretical work and software simulation indicate the potential to use light to
change transistor threshold values. By this technique a circuit can be placed
into a mode ready for testing, with all switching devices activated to the same
voltage level. In this research, the logical and electrical behavior of MOS
transistors as the optical effect changes threshold values is being studied.
Also being studied are changes in the electrical properties of switching devices
(inverters and transmission gates) due to optical effects. Experiments on
fabricated devices to determine if a stable optical threshold control can be
designed are being performed. Also being investigated are methods of detecting
the presence of defects through changes in signals at the output lines. This
proposal was submitted under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program.
