PI's will continue research on the role of intrinsic factors in evolutionary
rates and modes of marine invertebrates, centering on the bivalves and shelled
gastropods in two regions: the Neogene (including Recent) of the eastern Pacific
and the Late Cretaceous of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain. PI's will refine
databases on developmental modes and geographic, stratigraphic and bathymetric
ranges, add data on body size and population densities and collect more data on
patterns of extinction, survival and rebound for European mollusks around the
Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary. PI's will test hypotheses on: separate and
combined effects of geographic range, developmental modes, body size, population
density, and preservation potential on evolutionary rates and patterns; relation
of those patterns to bathymety and latitude; evolutionary trends in body size
and the frequency of Cope's Rule (broadly vs narowly defined); and similarity of
survivorship and rebound patterns at the K-T boundary in Europe and North
America, and their relation to the background patterns as listed above.
