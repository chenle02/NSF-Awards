A multi-disciplinary project for modeling clastic sedimentation occurring in
basins over geologic time scales is planned. The model includes the dynamic
deposition and entrainment of sediments in an arbitrary three-dimensional
region. The governing equations are the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations coupled with a parabolic transport equation for each species of
sediment. The computational domain is composed of two free surfaces, an air-
water interface and a water bed interface, as well as artificially imposed
boundaries that limit computation to the region of interest. Among the
computation difficults are handling of the free surfaces, the very large
geologic time scales, and the treatment of turbulence. The complexity of the
system necessitates development of parallel algorithms for the solution of the
model equations. The research team includes Professors M.J. Wheeler and
B.Ramaswamy of Rice University and Professor R. Glowinski of the University of
Houston and hydrologists from Texaco Corporation.
