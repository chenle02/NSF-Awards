9315257 Allen This award of $200,000 is for curriculum development in Machine
Vision. The goal is to create hands-on laboratory modules that effectively
describe and explain new algorithms in machine vision in interactive, live image
environment. These modules will be implemented on standard UNIX-based graphics
workstations using public domain toolkits based on X-windows. They will be
entirely portable and usable in any classroom at any university. The modules
will be developed by leveraging off of two important and current developments: a
common software environment for image understanding being developed by ARPA, and
recent progress in multimedia authoring tools for creating interactive computer
tutorials. The proposed work entails designing the components, interface, and
layout of the modules; evaluating different toolkits and interface construction
kits; testing and distributing a number of modules to other sites; and
evaluating the use of the module format and authoring facilities by other
researchers.
