This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education
research award to Carnegie-Mellon University in collaboration with Drexel
University will employ researchers to develop and deploy novel interactive chat-
based tutorials to enhance learning in several core mechanical engineering
courses. The tutorials will support self paced instruction in which students and
dialog agents can engage in tutorial conversation. This capability will allow
real-time interventions which can help students develop intuition and will also
support technical communications needed for collaboration with geographically
distributed teams. This research could provide a fundamentally new resource for
engineering education and will yield insight into adaptive tutorial strategies
that can most effectively support self-paced learning. It has the potential to
greatly advance capabilities for interactive learning, distributed learning, and
distributed technical collaboration which are all needed to better educate
engineers for jobs in the global workplace.&lt;br/&gt;
