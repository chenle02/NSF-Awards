Unique laser-based measurements in integrated optical structures will be used by
Professor Bohn of the University of Illinois-Urbana to monitor the structure of
monomolecular thin film assemblies, in this project supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry program. The goal of this work is to provide a better
description of the orientational distribution of molecular assemblies prepared
by Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or by self-assembly methods. Three experimental
approaches will be developed. First, fluorescence anisotropy and linear
dichroism measurements will be applied to static monolayers at high sensitivity.
Second, the order of the assembly will be characterized under dc electric field
perturbation. Third, the dynamic response of the thin layer will be examined by
monitoring optical response to variable frequency electric field perturbations.
The waveguide optical probe methods developed in this project provide a unique
structural capability for characterizing order in these important molecular
assemblies. %%% Determination of the degree of order in monomolecular thin films
is the goal of this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry program. A detailed understanding of the structure of these thin film
materials is crucial to the design of improved bioactive sensors and trace
separation methods, and may impact the development of improved corrosion
coatings.
