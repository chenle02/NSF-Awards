The Tennessee Technological University will initiate a four-week, residential
and commuter Young Scholars project in Engineering for 50 students entering
grades 11,12. Fifty students, primarily from the Southern Appalachian region,
will be selected to participate in this enrichment program which will consist of
lectures in the Introduction to Engineering series, Engineering Design, Energy
and Environmental Engineering and extensive research assignments. Participants
will also develop a proficiency in Fortran 77 programming on the main University
computer system and on microcomputers. They will also work in design teams to
develop an engineering design of a device or system. Field trips will be taken
to the Arnold Engineering Development Center (U.S. Air Force), to a TVA power
plant, and to a local industry. A follow-up research project is planned.
