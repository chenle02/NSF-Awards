The principal investigator will continue his research on harmonic maps,
foliations, and manifolds with special holonomy groups. In particular, he will
study rigidity for lattices in certain rank one Lie groups, quotients of rank
one symmetric spaces, and flat vector bundles over Kahler manifolds. This award
will support research in the general area of differential geometry and global
analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between the
geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis
is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a space by
piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of mathematics
in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
