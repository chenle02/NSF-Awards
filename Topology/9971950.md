Proposal: DMS-9971950

Principal Investigator: Peter Ozsvath

The proposal deals with gauge theory in dimensions three and four. Specifically,
in work begun with Zoltan Szabo, we intend to extend techniques used in proving
the symplectic Thom conjecture to finding other gauge-theoretic obstructions to
embedding three-manifolds in four-manifolds. A related goal is to shed light on
the nature of gauge-theoretic invariants -- Seiberg-Witten invariants of closed
four-manifolds, Seiberg-Witten Floer homology for three-manifolds, and relative
invariants for four-manifolds with boundary -- with a view towards obtaining
combinatorial techniques for calculating them.

Work of Simon Donaldson has placed the study of three- and four-dimensional
spaces squarely at a juncture between many diverse branches of mathematics,
including geometry, analysis, and topology. And indeed, his work can be seen as
part of the on-going dialogue with modern theoretical physics, which lead the
physicists Seiberg and Witten to introduce a new equation with far-reaching
mathematical and physical ramifications. The goal of the proposed research is to
study both the fundamental mathematical properties of this equation, and its
interaction with the underlying geometry of the spaces on which it is defined.
