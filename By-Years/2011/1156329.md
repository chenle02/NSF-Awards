An award has been made to Colorado State University to continue an REU Site
program that will provide research training for ten undergraduates for 10 weeks,
during the summers of 2012-2014. Students will participate in a program that
exposes them to a broad range of research areas and approaches in biochemistry
and molecular biology. Students will work with mentors from College of Natural
Sciences (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). Students will be involved in
their own research project where they learn how to formulate and test
hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze results in the context of
the hypothesis, and use state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation.
Interactions with faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and
professional research staff provide a mechanism for learning about the latest
advances in biochemistry and molecular biology. Students receive a stipend, free
housing in a university residence hall or apartment building, a meal allowance,
and an allowance to defray travel to/from the site. At the end of the program,
students will present their research results orally and through a poster, and
produce a final report in manuscript form. In addition to research, students
will engage in activities that will enhance their knowledge of the environment
such as an educational hike in the Rocky Mountain National Park. Field trips to
nearby government labs and biotech companies as well as workshops on GRE
preparation, the ethical conduct of research, and scientific careers are also
planned. The program will use the BIO REU Sites common assessment tool to obtain
feedback and assessment data for improving the program. Students with limited
opportunities for research and those from groups under-represented in science
are especially encouraged to apply. For further information, students may visit
