This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on
automating the identification of individual fish while eliminating mutilation.
The project, named TNT ("the natural tag"), is directed at developing a new
fisheries management tool using the latest image processing/pattern recognition
technology, and it is based on the knowledge that natural marks on animals,
specifically fish, are unique and can be used to identify individuals over space
and time. Proof-of-concept will demonstrate: 1) elimination of fish mutilation
2) larger number of fish 'tagged' per dollar spent, 3) more fish tagged per unit
time, 4) a more comprehensive set of statistical data archived for each fish, 5)
reduction or elimination of 'tag loss', and 6) elimination of tag reading
errors. The first expected outcome substantially addresses the perennial issue
of ethical standards and behavior with respect to mark-recapture science. The
last five deal with advancing the state-of-the-art of fisheries science and
represent immediate improvement of the cost/benefit ratio associated with fish
tagging research and commercial aquaculture in local, state, federal and
international programs. The TNT system will provide fisheries managers and
scientists a higher level of biologically sound and statistically justifiable
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nationally, expected customers of this technology
include Department of Commerce's NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service and
Department of Interior's U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land
Management, the Departments of Fish &amp; Game for each of the 50 states as well
as many universities. Organizations in approximately 35 foreign countries are
target customers also. &lt;br/&gt;
