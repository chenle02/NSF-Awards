Description: This project supports collaborative research by Dr. H. Jain,
Materials Science and Engineering Department, Lehigh University and Dr. D.
Chakravorty, Department of Materials Science, Indian Association for the
Cultivation of Science, Calcutta, India. The research is directed at a better
understanding of ion movement in glass. One objective is to relate the ion-ion
correlation and Two Level Systems (TLS) parameters with some material
characteristics by determining the effect of a systematic variation of
composition on ac electrical and nuclear spin relaxation (NSR) behaviors, the
role of amorphousness will be examined independently. The chemical
characteristics will be modified by doping, and the physical characteristics
will be changed by changing alkali ions. The work by the two scientists should
lead to better understanding of the effect of preparation of glass by sol-gel
and by melt methods on the structural properties and the composition. Scope: The
two scientists are highly qualified to do this advanced research. Their
departments are well known in the respective countries for pioneering research
in materials science. The research is in an area of considerable interest to the
U.S. and to India. The collaboration is highly likely to produce significant
research results. Funding: The project is being supported under two grants: INT
