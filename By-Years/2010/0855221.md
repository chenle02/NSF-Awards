This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the building of a
high-performance computing and data storage infrastructure at Southern Illinois
University Carbondale (SIHPSI - Southern Illinois HPC Infrastructure), a
facility first-of-its-kind not only within the campus but in the greater
Southern Illinois region also. Intellectual Merit: Research activities using
SIHCPI encompass two broad areas - (1) Computational Nanoscience and Engineering
(CNE): Examples include multimillion atom simulations of nanodevices, design of
molecular catalysts, studies of polymer morphology at interfaces, fundamental
studies of the driving mechanisms in non-equilibrium states of matter, and
quantum information processing exploring new properties of atomic nuclei; and
(2) Geographic Information Science (GIS): Involves strategic research to
investigate new algorithms for representation and transformation of massive
dynamic data allowing a cognitive and visual interpretation for analysts by
exploiting invariant geometric properties. SIHPSI serves as a nucleation center
for further addition of HPC resources and offers SIUC?s faculty members a much
quicker time frame (1-2 weeks) to start computing as compared to a custom
cluster configuration which usually takes about 6 months from start to
production. Broader Impact: Research in the CNE area is expected to have
significant impact in a wide range of technological applications including low-
power and fast transistors, coatings, lithography, adhesives to light emitting
diodes and sensors, various smart and functionalized materials, and quantum
computation. The GIS research facilitates efficient data streaming, crime and
health studies, medical imaging, and genome mapping. SIHPSI has an educational
interface that supports ? (1) revamping several courses in the area of
scientific modeling and numerical analysis; (2) developing a new course on
computational nanoelectronics; and (3) training (through summer workshops) a
diverse community of college teachers as well as K-12 students in the field of
scientific computing and data analysis. Materials/modules developed in the
teaching/training activities will be posted on NSF?s nanoHUB.org for use by the
broader community.
