The overall objectives of this project are (1) to develop better understanding
of market-based approaches for controlling environmental risks, and (2) to
develop a theoretical model aimed at explaining the evolution and performance of
market-based risk management approaches. As part of the study, two specific
market-based risk management approaches will be examined: the use of emissions
trading permits and the trading of lead rights. For each case, data will be
collected and analyzed on (1) the rules governing the market; (2) the
performance of the market; (3) the effects of the market on the allocation of
risk; (4) the behavioral responses to the market of key participants in the
decision making process; (5) the factors affecting the emergence of the market,
and (6) the factors affecting the evolution of the market. Despite the
importance of market-based approaches for controlling environmental risks,
little research has been directed toward predicting the emergence and
performance of such markets. This innovative project will develop a theoretical
model that will help predict the actual performance of different market-based
approaches. It is expected that the results of the study will (1) contribute to
the development of an overall theory of market performance, and (2) provide risk
analysts and decision makers with a comprehensive and rigorous approach for
addressing different risk management problems.
