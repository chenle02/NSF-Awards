This research develops new methodological and statistical techniques to handle
`missing data` for survey and other micro-level data sources. In Political
Science most researchers use `listwise deletion` when encountering missing data,
but this wastes valuable information and can bias conclusions drawn about the
political world. While the statistical literature includes some attractive
approaches to the missing data problem, several important theoretical
difficulties with these approaches, and the lack of publicly available software,
prevent these methods from being used. This project generalizes the different
approaches for use with political science data. At the same time this project
develops methods that can be applied simultaneously to both aggregate data
(e.g., electoral results or census counts) and survey research.
