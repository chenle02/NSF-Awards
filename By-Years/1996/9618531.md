9618531 Bright The Conference on Classroom Assessment in Mathematics project
addresses this area of K-12 mathematics through two conferences, in sequence:
(1) the first is a small, working conference for 32 core, invited participants,
to be held in late spring 1997 in Raleigh/Durham, N.C; and (2) the second is a
large, dissemination conference for approximately 250 teachers and leaders of
K-12 mathematics, to be held in Washington, D. C., in April 1998 during the week
of the national NCTM meeting. Those participating in the working conference
include researchers, acknowledged experts in the field of assessment, and
practitioners, who are to address the issues surrounding quality classroom
assessment in mathematics through position and working papers prepared in
advance of the conference. Conference proceedings are to be edited following the
working conference and widely disseminated during NCTM Week. Collectively, the
conferences and proceedings identify research issues and implementation
strategies that support quality classroom assessment as a tool for greater
student achievement in mathematics, and produce recommendations to begin
addressing the issues.
