During the first phase of this NSF sponsored Small Business Innovation Research
project Nonvolatile Electronics, Inc. demonstrated the potential of achieving
high magnetoresistance in thin iron chromium multilayers on gallium arsenide
substrates (at room temperature) having low magnetostriction, low required drive
fields, and low temperature coefficients of resistance. Phase II research will
undertake studies: (i) to create a simplified model to describe the spin valve
effect in magnetoresistive materials; and (ii) to develop cobalt permalloy-
copper bilayers with greater than six per cent magnetoresistance low
magnestorestriction, low temperature coefficient of resistance, and which
requires low drive fields. It is expected the results of this research, if
successful, will have enormous economic impact on the magnetic recording and
computer industries.
