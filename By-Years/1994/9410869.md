9410869 Stone The popular movement and candidacy of H. Ross Perot added an
historic dimension to the 1992 presidential election. By winning 19 percent of
the popular vote, Mr. Perot outdistanced all independent candidates in the 20th
century except Theodore Roosevelt, who ran as a popular ex-president in 1912.
Perot;s success in mobilizing thousands of activists and attracting millions of
votes raised questions about the health of the American two-party system, and
whether he would be able to transform his movement into an enduring third party.
The most important and enduring legacy of the Perot movement will likely be
manifest through the cadre of activists mobilized by his campaign. The Perot
movement will change the parties whether Mr. Perot runs again for president in
1996, and whether he is able to convert his movement into a third party. The
purpose of this investigation is to monitor active participants in the 1992
Perot campaign as they encounter the 1994 congressional elections and the 1996
presidential election. By studying changes in their attitudes, perceptions, and
behavior, and by comparing them with samples of activists in the two major
parties, the investigators will be able to track the Perot movement and its
impact on the two party system.
