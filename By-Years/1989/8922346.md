Land use planning has been advocated widely as an approach to coping with
threats posed by earthquakes and other natural hazards, but the benefits
expected of planning have yet to be documented and few local governments outside
of states with planning mandates have included hazards elements in their
comprehensive (general) plans. State mandates provide a promising means of
increasing the use and effectiveness of local planning for areas subject to
natural hazards, but not much is known about their effectiveness. This is a
comparative study of three states designed to contribute to improved management
of natural hazards by providing answers to four critical research questions: 1.
Are state comprehensive (general) planning mandates producing local government
land use plans which address important hazard mitigation issues, such as
specification of appropriate land uses for areas subject to natural hazards,
protection of lifelines, and identification of opportunities for retrofitting?
2. To what extent are the potential benefits of land use planning for areas
subject to natural hazards being realized in practice? 3. To what extent have
plans and associated policies for hazardous areas been implemented through the
adoption of development management regulations and other measures and the
imposition of appropriate hazard mitigation conditions during development review
and permitting? 4. What factors (including the presence and form of state
planning mandates) are associated with variation in plan preparation and
implementation among local governments? How can knowledge of those factors be
used to devise and implement more effective mandates?
