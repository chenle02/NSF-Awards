CTS-9502437 Y. S. Lin CAREER Mixed-conducting ceramic membranes containing
copper-doped yttria-stabilized bismuth oxides will be synthesized and
characterized. These membranes have high intrinsic permeability for oxygen and
excellent catalytic properties for oxidative coupling of methane. Thin and
ultrathin membranes will be prepared by suspension/slipcasting chemical vapor
deposition and magnetron sputter deposition techniques, respectively. Oxygen
permeation will be investigated for different thickness and compositions of
membranes. Also, a new type of membrane reactor will be developed for the
oxidative coupling of methane. There is potential for the development of energy
efficient and environmentally benign processes for simultaneous separation and
reaction using membranes. The educational plan involves the incorporation of
materials science courses in chemical engineering curricula. New courses will be
developed for training both undergraduate and graduate students in advanced
materials.
