PI: DiMarzio, Charles Proposal: 1510280

This project will develop a new prototype microscope of ultra-high sensitivity
with super-high resolution, yet with the ability to provide 3D imaging at a
large field-of-view and rapid imaging.

The proposal aims to develop a new type of microscopy technique, (coded-
illumination Fourier ptychography), that incorporates the innovations of novel
Fourier data recovery, structured illumination for tissue sectioning, multi-
layer modeling, and spectrum multiplexing. Iteration across data acquisitions is
used to optimize to a final image solution. Increased image dimensionality,
either spectral or spatial, is a highly desired commodity. If these techniques
can be made routine, then many areas of microscopy could benefit. The proposal
reflects substantial outreach to women and significant educational efforts
towards graduates and undergraduates.
