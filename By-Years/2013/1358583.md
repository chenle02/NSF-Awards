The NSF-REU Site in Extremal Graph Theory and Dynamical Systems at the Rochester
Institute of Technology (RIT) will actively engage ten students in each of the
summers 2014, 2015, and 2016 in a research experience in mathematics. Research
projects will be in the areas of graph theory and dynamical systems, some of
which are linked to mathematical biology. Projects will include both applied and
theoretical topics. Applied projects will include development and analysis of
functional connectivity models of the human brain, and modeling of cardiac
arrhythmia. Projects with a theoretical focus will include problems from
extremal graph theory, graph labeling, and delay differential
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All students will work directly with RIT faculty
for the entirety of the program and will receive mentoring in mathematical
research practices, as well as in written and oral communication. The program
will have a heavy emphasis on networking with other mathematicians and will
include a "Researcher in Residence," where an expert from outside of our
university visits the program and works with the students. Results from research
projects will be disseminated through publications in refereed journals,
presentations at national and regional mathematical meetings, and at the
students' home institutions. Students will be encouraged to pursue graduate
studies and employment in the mathematical sciences. During the program students
will participate in an Ethics in Science Workshop. The REU program will
intersect with RIT's Summer Mathematics Institute where each of the REU students
will present to more than 50 mathematics high school teachers from New York
State. The recruitment efforts will target students from universities, liberal
arts colleges, and community colleges. The PI aims to have 80 percent of the
participants from outside of the host institution, with an emphasis on drawing
students from colleges without Ph.D. programs or have limited research
opportunities.
