In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Vladimir Gevorgyan of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Illinois at Chicago will develop transition metal-catalyzed
methodologies towards multi-substituted aromatics and heteroaromatics. Although
several methods for construction of benzene rings exist, the known catalytic
processes suffer from regioselectivity problems. More selective methods require
employment of stoichimetric organometallic reagents, thus severely limiting
broad application of these methodologies. These limitations will be addressed in
the proposed project through the development of highly efficient Pd-catalyzed
[4+2] and formal [2+2+2] benzannulation reactions toward regioselective assembly
of a multisubstituted benzene ring. Studies toward new pre- and post-
benzannulation cascade transformations will dramatically expand the scope of
this methodology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research, which is at the
interface of organometallic and organic chemistry and catalysis, will also
provide multidisciplinary training at the undergraduate and graduate level. In
addition, Professor Gevorgyan is actively engaged in promoting careers for women
in the STEM disciplines. The proposed work is expected to have broader impacts
in the health related area by providing new effective routes to biologically
important intermediates, and in materials science by allowing easy access to
valuable building blocks, which could be utilized in the rapid assembly of
complex frameworks and conjugated materials. Moreover, the herein proposed
development of "one-pot reactions" may reduce the cost of chemical products and
avoid the production of chemical waste, providing both economical and
environmental impacts.
