With the recent advances in atomic structure calculations and experimental
techniques, atomic lithium has emerged as a promising system for exploring
atomic and nuclear structure at new levels of sensitivity. The relatively simple
atomic structure of lithium provides an experimentally accessible system that
can be calculated at a high level of accuracy. This project provides a
comprehensive investigation of the atomic structure of lithium utilizing an
optical frequency comb. The development of optical frequency combs has made it
possible to effectively count the optical cycles of light, resulting in absolute
optical-frequency calibration. In addition to its optical-frequency measurement
capabilities, frequency combs provide a powerful source for direct excitation of
atomic transitions. The intellectual merit of this work is to provide
significant improvement in the knowledge of the structure of atomic lithium and
to further expand and develop techniques of precision spectroscopy by use of
optical frequency combs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work
is the development of an undergraduate research program that will provide
students with the opportunity to perform cutting-edge research. The experiments
are carried out at Oberlin College, a four-year liberal arts college that has a
history of diversity and integration of teaching and research, and are performed
solely by undergraduate students and the principal investigator. As a result,
the work serves a dual role of advancing scientific discovery while training and
teaching undergraduate students. The nature of the work complements the teaching
responsibilities of the principle investigator and allows the integration of
research into the classroom and teaching laboratories.
