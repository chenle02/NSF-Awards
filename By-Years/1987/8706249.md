A novel, computationally inexpensive model will be developed to study, at the
two-point level, the combined two-species chemical reaction in homogeneous
turbulence. Time splitting will be used to decouple convective and diffusive
effects over short time intervals; closure approximations will then be applied
to each of these phenomena in isolation over the same brief intervals. The
convective and diffusive closure approximations will be examined individually
and collectively, along with reaction, by reference to direct numerical
simulation solutions to the same problems at moderate to low Reynolds numbers.
