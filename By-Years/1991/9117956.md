The Turkana Basin of Kenya and Ethiopia has long been known as a critical
locality for the understanding of vertebrate evolution in East Africa. The
geologic record of the basin spans a broad range, including Cretaceous through
Holocene sediments with intercalated volcanics. Cretaceous through Oligocene
history has yet to be characterized, but Miocene to Holocene strata are well-
known. They record the stratigraphic evolution of the basin from a volcanically
active, localized sediment trap, to an integrated fluvial basin with periodic
lacustrine phases, and finally to a structurally-controlled rift basin. Research
over the past decade on the context of vertebrate evolution in the basin has
greatly altered our perspective on the history of the region and development of
the East African Rift. Within the stratigraphic and temporal framework
established for vertebrate studies, it is now possible to examine in detail the
evolution of the region in terms of its volcanic, tectonic and sedimentary
history, and to reevaluate the history of geologic processes in this portion of
Africa. We intend to focus our attention on the unstudied southern portion of
the Turkana Basin, and to investigate exposures in the Loiyengalani region, the
Chalbi Desert, on Mt. Kulal, and in the Suguta and Kerio Valleys. Understanding
of the geologic record from these regions is critical to evaluating the history
of major geologic events in the basin, including basin integration, hydrographic
connections, and structural development.
