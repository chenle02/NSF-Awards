Many retailers sell products both online and in brick-and-mortar stores. In such
omnichannel systems, the retailers need to decide what products to offer at what
prices in which channels, and how online orders will be fulfilled, either from
distribution centers or from store inventory. This project will use mathematical
models to optimize retailers' decisions in omnichannel systems. Specifically,
researchers will identify policies that retailers can use to identify the
assortment of products to be sold in each channel and their prices while
accounting for fulfillment considerations such as inventory imbalance and
expedited shipping. This project has the potential to positively impact retail
operations of companies of all sizes. In addition, it will provide educational
opportunities for doctoral and master's students, as well as undergraduate
students. The latter will participate in this project through the university's
Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objective
of this research is to develop algorithms and identify policies that are optimal
or near-optimal for decisions arising in retail operations with multiple
channels. These decisions include (1) assortment and inventory policies that
prescribe which products, and how many units per product, should be stocked in
each store and distribution center; (2) fulfillment policies that prescribe from
which store, or distribution center, online orders should be fulfilled; and (3)
pricing policies that dynamically adjust the price of products sold in certain
channels to maintain a balanced system-wide inventory distribution. Researchers
will formulate these problems as mathematical programs and use their solutions
to construct near-optimal policies. Existing literature typically only considers
the problem of optimizing retail operations in brick-and-mortar stores without
considering the online channel. By considering both these channels, this project
will contribute to the emerging academic literature on retail operations.
