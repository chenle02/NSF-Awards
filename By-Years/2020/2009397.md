Models of the formation of galaxies over cosmic time predict that large galaxies
should host smaller, satellite galaxies. Observations of these satellites
disagree with the number and size predicted by the models. Since these
satellites are smaller and fainter than their host galaxies, the number of known
systems is small. This project will conduct a survey of nearby host galaxies to
get a better census of satellite galaxies and therefore better understand if
there is a disagreement between models and observations. The project will also
try to improve the standards for admissions to graduate school in astronomy with
an effort to increasing diversity in the field. They will also provide public
outreach for observational astronomy using the Discovery Channel
Telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use the Sloan Atlas, combined
with the SDSS to identify satellite galaxies of 82 host systems. They will also
use the Discovery Channel Telescope to increase the number of satellites with
known spectroscopic distance. The project will produce a sample of about 1,300
satellite galaxies about these hosts. The sample will be used to perform
statistical studies of the intrinsic clustering, spatial anisotropies, and
luminosity functions of these satellite galaxies. The results will be compared
with the Illustris TNG cosmological simulations. The PI will work with the
department to develop a protocol for explicitly including holistic approaches
for graduate admissions with the goal of increasing diversity in the graduate
student pool. The PI will also host open night observing sessions for the public
at Boston University every clear Wednesday night. Additional scientific literacy
outreach will be done at the DCT with a 3-day "Space Beyond Earth" event held
for BU alumni.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
