9357226 Ashoori This is a New Young Investigator Award for research on the
condensed matter physics of nanostructures. The work employs a spectroscopic
technique developed by the principal investigator, to quantitatively probe
quantum levels in nanostructures. The new technique is termed single-electron
capacitance spectroscopy, and allow the detection of small numbers of electrons
confined to quantum dot nanostructures. The technique will be used to study
problems in localization, many-body phenomena, and defect level structures in
nanostructures. %%% This is a New Young Investigator Award for research on the
condensed matter physics of quantum "dot" nanostructures: collections of
hundreds to thousands of atoms. The work employs a spectroscopic technique,
developed by the principal investigator, to quantitatively probe quantum levels
in these nanostructures. The new technique is termed single-electron capacitance
spectroscopy, and allow the detection of small numbers of electrons confined to
quantum dot nanostructures. The technique will be used to study problems in
localization, many-body phenomena, and defect level structures in
nanostructures. These phenomena are of fundamental interest and potential
technological relevance to ultra-small-scale electronic devices. ***
