The Geology Department is purchasing SPARC based graphics workstations, and
electronic measuring devices to bring three dimensional visualization,
processing of data, and quantitative field methods into the undergraduate
curriculum. The graphics work stations, networked to a server with computer
graphics, displays three dimensional models with interactive graphics that
allows students to vary parameters and boundary conditions for a variety of
geologic problems. Students create, render, and manipulate topographic models;
geophysical or satellite data sets are superimposed on graphic models and some
systems, such as avalanches or beach processes, can be animated on top of
digital
