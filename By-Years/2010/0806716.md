The Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MaPS) Cohort of Scholars Program at
Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) has created a support system consisting
of scholarships, faculty mentoring, and peer support to address financial and
academic issues affecting the retention and graduation rates of the typical NEIU
student. NEIU is an urban commuter university in northwest Chicago, and is the
only four-year federally-designated Hispanic Serving Institution in the Midwest,
with a highly diverse student population and many first-generation college
students. The MaPS program is recruiting a cohort of 14-18 incoming freshmen who
are interested in the STEM disciplines and in need of financial assistance, and
providing them with scholarships of up to $10,000 per year for four years. As
they matriculate at NEIU, each student is assigned a faculty mentor from the
disciplines of Mathematics, Physics or Earth Science who closely mentors,
advises and monitors the student throughout his/her academic career. To further
guide the scholars into the STEM professions, they are encouraged to engage in
research experiences and participate in regional and national conferences.
NEIU's student support services offer supplementary academic and social
activities for the cohort, providing the scholars with shared experiences so
that each one graduates with the motivation and intellectual ability to either
attend graduate school in his/her chosen major or find employment in a STEM-
discipline field. The three-fold support system of faculty, student services,
and cohort bonding built into the MaPS program draws on lessons learned from the
Chicago Math Scholars program, a previous NSF-funded project at NEIU, and
responds to institutional goals to raise retention and graduation rates in the
STEM disciplines. The MaPS Program is linked strongly with NEIU's McNair
Scholars Program and with bridge programs to the doctoral degree with other
Chicago-area institutions.
