Dissertation Research: The Herbivore-medicated Indirect Effects of an Invasive
Plant on a Co-occurring Native Plant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Richard K.
Grosberg &amp; Jennifer Lau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive plant species have
become a prominent feature in many California natural areas. Invasive species
can have strong effects on native plant population growth and persistence.
Several studies have addressed how competition with invasive plants affects
native plant populations; however, little research has addressed the indirect
effects of invasive species on co-occurring natives. Indirect effects are those
effects that are mediated by additional organisms. The proposed research
investigates the herbivore-mediated indirect effects of the invasive plant
Medicago polymorpha on the native plant Lotus wrangelianus to discern how the
presence of invasive plant species affects the ecological and evolutionary
responses of native plants to their herbivores. Such studies that link community
ecology and evolutionary biology can yield valuable insights into how novel
community interactions influence both ecological and evolutionary processes.
