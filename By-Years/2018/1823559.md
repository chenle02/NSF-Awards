More and more companies and institutions are moving their products and services
into the cloud, increasing the number of compute cycles spent in data centers
significantly. The explosive growth of such cloud computation has delivered
great value to society at the cost of increasing the environmental footprint on
our world. This project can improve the energy efficiency of data center systems
through the design and optimization of cloud application-specific
microprocessors. The research will be infused into the undergraduate curriculum
at University of California Santa Cruz, educating the next generation of
students on designing energy efficient, data center specific architecture and
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop machine learning
techniques to predict datacenter application behavior and apply them to
processor microarchitecture. In particular, a new cross-layer approach will be
developed to improve the instructions-per-cycle (IPC) performance of data center
workload-optimized processors. It will explore and develop solutions for a
number of challenges including offline learning of data center application
behavior, leveraging machine learning models for instruction prefetching and
branch prediction, and building resource and power efficient hardware to
leverage the machine learning models at execution
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
