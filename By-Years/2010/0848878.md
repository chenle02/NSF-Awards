This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues
development of a major improvement in the cost-benefit equation of learning
computer programming. The approach integrates a new programming paradigm
particularly suited to real-time, high-interactivity applications, with advances
in program liveness and visualization, and game-based learning of essential
concepts and skills. The strategy is to draw learners onward and upward through
continued creative empowerment, while also facilitating more direct engagement
with the core intellectual content of computer programming. The research
objectives of this Phase II project address: 1) continued language development,
2) creativity toolset development, 3) development of learning games, 4) a
learning environment architecture with an underlying model of learning pathways,
and 5) evaluation activities including measurement of learning outcomes.

If successful, this Phase II project will lead to products that will engage over
half a million learners in mastering fundamental computational topics and
bending them to creative purposes, thereby addressing the following major
national priorities: - workforce preparation and technological fluency; -
rebuilding computer science enrollment and retention at the college level; -
alternative, hands-on pathways into algebra and mathematics for students who
struggle with traditional instruction; - cultivating technology-based creativity
among young people.
