The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division supports this award to
Northwestern University to design, synthesize and develop novel multifunctional
fluorophores that combine fast unidirectional internal photoinduced electron
transfer with efficient fluorescence from the charge-separated species. With
this award, Professor Michael Wasielewski will study molecular structural
features to tailor optical and electronic properties of these materials as
desired. Molecular design incorporating perylene derivatives will be used to
design molecular switches for potential applications in molecular devices.
Graduate students will greatly benefit from training and research opportunities
provided by this award in materials chemistry and in photophysical property
characterization of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, ultra fast
optical gating of electrons in synthetic molecular entities will be studied
using photoexcitation. Molecules will be designed, synthesized and derivatives
incorporated, and these molecules will be characterized by time-resolved
femtosecond laser spectroscopic methods. Design of molecular switches with
potential application in molecular devices will be one of the out come of these
studies. Students will greatly benefit from training and research opportunities
provided by this award in materials chemistry, and in characterization of
photophysical properties of materials.
