Implementation projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead
to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students
receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Grambling State University seeks to
establish the foundation for building STEM student success, particularly for
mathematics and physics students. The goal of the project is to prepare students
for graduate school and careers.

Activities that are part of this project are: to redesign selected mathematics
and physics courses by infusing problem-based learning; to support peer
mentoring, mentoring and social integration of mathematics and physics
undergraduate students; to develop interdisciplinary big data science courses;
to infuse big data science concepts into existing chemistry courses; to provide
professional development to faculty who will implement the new strategies; and
to conduct an outreach program to high school students focusing on big data. The
activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned through this
project can serve as a model for other small liberal arts institutions.
