This grant is for the continuation and new development of research activities in
the general areas of biophysical fluid mechanics and nonlinear waves. This
theoretical, numerical and experimental work covers two major areas. One is
centered about organism propulsion that ranges from flagellar and ciliary
locomotion of protozoans and bacteria in the low-Reynolds-number category to the
swimming of fish and flight of birds and insects in the high-Reynolds-number
regime. The other major interest is concerned with nonlinear wave phenomena in
general. In the latter class, emphasis has been put on (1) extending
unidirectional propagation of waves (like those modeled by the KdV equation) to
2- or 3-dimensions, and (2) including external forcing disturbances. These
extensions actually originated from our previous research on tsunami generation
and the terminal effects on coastal waters.
