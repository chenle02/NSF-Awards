(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We approach quaternionic analysis from
the point of view of representation theory of the conformal group SL(2,H) and
its Lie algebra sl(2,H). While some aspects of representation theory of compact
groups were used in quaternionic analysis before, using representation theory of
non-compact reductive Lie groups is entirely new. With this representation
theoretic approach we intend to&lt;br/&gt;1) Develop split quaternionic analysis
which, in particular, will allow us to understand better a subtle aspect of
representation theory such as the separation of the discrete and continuous
series of unitary representations.&lt;br/&gt;2) Extend the methods of split
quaternionic analysis to higher dimensions in the context of (split) Clifford
analysis. This theory will yield new results relating solutions of the wave
equation, representation theory and index theory of Dirac
operators.&lt;br/&gt;3) Study instantons from the point of view of quaternionic
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;This approach should lead to deep geometric connections with
index theory of Dirac operators and also to a direct proof of the completeness
of the ADHM construction of instantons.&lt;br/&gt;4) Develop a general theory
relating Feynman integrals, homology and representation theory. This theory
should explain why many integral formulas appearing in quaternionic analysis
often have the form of a Feynman integral taken over various homology cycles,
typically non-compact ones. &lt;br/&gt;The PI will collaborate on this project
with Igor Frenkel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quaternionic analysis can be thought of
as a higher dimensional analogue of complex analysis. It was significantly
developed by R.Fueter in 1930's.&lt;br/&gt;Since then quaternionic analysis has
generated a lot of interest among mathematicians, some results were extended
from complex to quaternionic analysis, there were found many applications to
physics, but the theory of quaternionic analysis largely remains underdeveloped.
We propose to develop quaternionic analysis from the point of view of
representation theory (a branch of mathematics that studies symmetries). This
approach has already been proven very fruitful and allowed to push further the
parallel with complex analysis and develop a rich theory. It will provide more
insight into the relationship between representation theory, geometry,
quaternionic analysis, physics and PDE's. Along the way we expect to obtain new
results and explicit realizations of representations of reductive Lie groups.
