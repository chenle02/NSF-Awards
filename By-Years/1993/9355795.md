9355795 Wheeler Two Day Planning Session for Institute for Science/Math
Educational Change The proposer requests funding to conduct a two day planning
meeting (conference) at the at Montana State University (MSU). National leaders
who are advocates for educational change in science and mathematics will be
convened to meet with leaders at MSU to discuss the active involvement of
scientists and mathematicians in designing an educational change initiative for
MSU. Native Americans will be involved to assure that the focus on improving
education includes knowledgeable expertise and representation of Montana's
largest minority group. Participants will develop a working "blueprint" to guide
implementation of the University's efforts to coordinate and enhance the reforms
funded by Education and Human Resources (EHR). The recommendations resulting
from the conference will guide MSU and will be shared with the various NSF
initiatives and projects across the state and those who may benefit from them
outside Montana. ***
