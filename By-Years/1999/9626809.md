9626809 Dugger The document, Rationale and Structure for the Study of
Technology, produced by the International Technology Education Association,
identifies six components that are the basis of technological literacy for all
students. They are designing and developing, determining and controlling
behavior, utilizing, assessing, contextual relationships, nature and evolution
of technology, and technological concepts and principles. Using this as a basis,
this project develops standards for what technological concepts and processes
students should understand and be able to apply in grades K-12 with benchmarks
at grades 2, 5, 8 and 12. The standards are compiled by a small central staff.
Three teams, consisting of representatives from technology education, both
teachers and technologists, as well as representatives from science,
mathematics, and engineering some of whom were involved in developing other
standards, provide the content. Input and consensus is developed by
presentations to diverse groups interested in education, newsletters, and the
WWW. Third party evaluation is used to monitor the content and the process to
assure that the standards are useful in a variety of contexts.
