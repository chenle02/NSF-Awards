The university is enhancing its Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing (AIM)
laboratory by developing an Intelligent Factory--one of three components in the
AIM laboratory. The other two components of the laboratory are the previously
created Artificial Intelligence (AI) Processing Center and an Intelligent
Manufacturing Cell. Hardware acquisitions for the Intelligent Factory include a
PC-based computer with a network to serve as factory controller, an automated
storage/retrieval system, two robotic manipulators, and two additional PC-based
computers. This equipment is being combined with hardware that includes five
robotic manipulators with PC-based controllers, a computer controlled conveyor
system, and a vision system. The Intelligent Factory supports two courses:
Flexible Manufacturing Systems and Improving Manufacturing with Artificial
Intelligence Techniques. Students use the Intelligent Factory as an independent
facility and in conjunction with the AI Processing Center. Through these
applications, students study the operation and control of a realistic Computer
Integrated Manufacturing environment. All three components of the AIM laboratory
are connected via a computer network.
