This award is a planning/pilot graduate training project to involve one faculty
member and three graduate students for one year in laying the groundwork for the
development of a science and technology studies graduate program in design. STS
scholars have recognized how technologies embody cultural, social and political
values. But seldom have they applied such perspectives that inform actual design
projects. The award will allow for the teaching of an interdisciplinary course
on design involving STS and Engineering faculty, the development of a series of
interdisciplinary courses on design, and the participation of three graduate
students. The project will explore ways to integrate STS and design, as well as
on-campus design and industry design. Moreoever, the project will explore ways
of building bridges to engineering faculty. Activities for graduate students
will not only involve classes, but also field work to non-academic sites and a
colloquium series.
