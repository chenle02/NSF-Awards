Proposal Number: CTS-0219271&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gupta, Ram
B&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Auburn University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Supercritical fluid
based polymer nanoparticles for biomedical
applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has
enhanced the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process for micron sized particle
formation by including an ultrasonic transducer in the precipitation vessel to
interact with the solvent jet creating mush smaller particles in the sub-micron
range. The technique is innovative and further knowledge of the fundamental
mechanism of operation would provide the information to optimize the
method.&lt;br/&gt;
