Nearly all the animals that inhabit the ocean are "cold-blooded" or ectothermic,
meaning their body temperatures match the temperature of the ocean around them.
This has important consequences for their physiology and more broadly for the
way marine ecosystems function. When ectotherms warm up, their metabolism
increases; meaning they breathe more rapidly, and eat more just to stay alive.
This is bad news for prey since a warm predator is a hungry predator. But
warming also enables prey species to crawl or swim away more quickly when being
hunted. Thus, everything speeds up in warm water. Energy flows more quickly from
the sun to seaweeds (via photosynthesis), to the herbivores, then on up to the
large predators at the top of the food chain. The research team is testing these
ideas in the Galápagos Islands to determine how temperature influences marine
ecosystems. Ongoing work in this iconic natural laboratory is helping marine
ecologists understand the role of temperature and how this and other ecosystems
could function in the future as climate change warms the ocean. Other broader
impacts of the project include student training and on-site outreach to tourists
and the local community about ocean warming and some of the lesser-known species
that inhabit the Galápagos. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of this project
is to understand the effect that temperature has on patterns and processes in
upwelling systems. Specifically, the team is measuring the temperature-
dependence of herbivory and carnivory in rocky subtidal habitats of the
Galápagos. They are performing field experiments to measure the relative and
interactive effects of temperature, herbivory, and nutrient flux on the
productivity and standing biomass of benthic macroalgae. Additionally, they are
using in situ predation assays across spatial and temporal temperature gradients
and mesocosm experiments to determine the relationship between ocean temperature
and predation intensity for predator-prey pairings including whelk–barnacle, sea
star–urchin, and fish–squid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
