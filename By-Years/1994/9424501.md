9424501 Udwadi This project will conduct theoretical and experimental studies to
investigate the effects of time delays on the control of structural systems
subjected to strong earthquake ground shaking. Both collocated as well as
noncollocated control configurations will be considered. A general control
methodology and guide lines will be developed. Stability conditions for
vanishingly small gains, in the presence of time delays, when actuator and
sensor are collocated, will be found for (a)undamped, (b) classically damped,
and (c)nonclassically damned structural systems. The time delays which cause
instability for collocated feedback control will be utilized to achieve
infinitesimal gains stability for noncollocated feedback control systems. All
analytical results will be applied to a simple five degree-of-freedom system for
numerical verifications. This study will help understand the effects of small
time delays, which are inevitable in the feedback loop, on the stability of the
closed loop control systems. The results will have immediate and direct
application to the robust control of a wide variety of structural and mechanical
systems in dynamic environments, especially in the suppression of vibrations
generated by earthquake ground shaking. ***
