Institution: U. Colorado Boulder&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EIA -
0244168&lt;br/&gt;PI: Shivakant Mishra&lt;br/&gt;Title: REU Site - Research
Experience for Undergraduate Students in Cybersecurity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project establishes an REU site focusing on research experiences for
undergraduate students in the area of cybersecurity and infrastructure
protection. The site is administered by faculty members and researchers from the
Computer Science, Telecommunications, and ATLAS (Alliance for Technology
Learning and Society) departments at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and
Computer Information Sciences Department at the Florida A&amp;M University,
Tallahassee, FL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site involves 10 undergraduate
students in cybersecurity-related research for&lt;br/&gt;ten weeks during
summer. The site has a specified evaluation plan. The site addresses the current
shortage of cybersecurity professionals. The project establishes mechanisms to
increase the participation of underrepresented groups via collaboration and
active interactions with minority institutions (Florida A&amp;M University,
Dillard University, and University of Houston-Downtown) and EPSCOR institutions
(University of Nevada at Reno and University of Wyoming at
Laramie).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;
