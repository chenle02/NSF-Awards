This project involves a summer institute in research design in cultural
anthropology. Experts in research design and in the link between data and theory
will teach a set of 12 graduate students chosen competitively from Ph.D.
programs throughout the US during a period of 3 weeks. Course content will cover
a broad spectrum of issues focusing on the link between theory and the
development of research objectives, concepts, definitions, variables, measures
and hypotheses; the relationship between quantitative and qualitative approaches
in the ethnographic context; systematic data collection procedures; probability
and non-probability sampling; statistical distributions and elementary data
analysis with an emphasis on concepts (e.g., sampling distribution theory); and
an introduction to data structures and management in both a qualitative and
quantitative context; and strategies of hypothesis testing. This project is
important because it will provide an introduction to research issues in
scientific anthropology for graduate students who may not be receiving an
adequate exposure to their issues in their respective departments. The results
of the 3 year workshop should be to increase the level of competence among
students to do significant research projects for their dissertation research,
and to become more proficient social scientists in general.
