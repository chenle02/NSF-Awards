In the eye of many animals is a tissue called the retinal pigment epithelium,
which contains dark pigment in cells that can disperse or aggregate the pigment.
The relative dispersal is related to the amount of darkness and to the circadian
day-night cycle, and is part of the process of light adaptation for vision. This
research planning grant project is to get preliminary data on how the
photoreceptors in the retina communicate the relative light levels to the
pigment epithelium. A compound known as cyclic-AMP is known to act within cells
as a second messenger to alter cellular functions in response to a signal
received at the cell surface. This study tests the novel hypothesis that cyclic-
AMP may serve directly as an extracellular second messenger as well. Microscopy,
cell fractionation, and biochemical analysis are used to determine pigment
localization and its possible mechanisms using the eye of a fish as a model
system. This work will be important to this minority scientist's career
development, it will have an impact on undergraduate training at this
institution, and the results will be important for visual neuroscience, for the
biology of circadian rhythms, and for cell biology.
