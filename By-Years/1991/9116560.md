Daylength and other photoperiodic cues regulate reproduction of many animals in
shallow-water marine habitats. The depth to which such cues are important in the
sea has not been investigated, but it is known that numerous deep-sea and
bathyal invertebrates also reproduce seasonally. Seasonal reproduction in these
species correlates with numerous potential environmental signals, including
seasonal flux of nutrients, but the actual cues that entrain seasonal
reproductive cycles have not been investigated experimentally for any deep-sea
invertebrate. Using submersibles, Dr. Young will test two potential factors that
could control reproduction in bathyal echinoids living on the slope in tropical
seas: seasonal flux of macrophytic detritus, and daylength cycles at very low
light intensities. He will also investigate the relationship between food
supply, growth, fecundity, and timing of reproduction using in situ experiments
in which food is manipulated in enclosures on the sea floor.
