1724998 Brezinsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to provide partial travel
supports to students who will attend the 10th International Conference on
Chemical Kinetics, to be held in Chicago, May 21 to 25, 2017. This award is
anticipated to support 50 students, each with $200 to offset their travel costs.
Attending a conference is essential to enrich the educational experience of
graduate students. The experience in interacting with other participants will
stimulate novel ideas and further motivate students to pursue advanced research.
In particular, this international conference will bring together experts across
the world. The participating students from the U.S. institutions will gain rare
opportunities to learn from many international experts. Such an experience will
be very valuable and can help advance the research capabilities of the U.S.
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This biennial conference brings together
experts from university, research laboratories, and industrial organization to
exchange knowledge in theoretical and experimental chemical kinetics. This
cross-disciplinary meeting highlights the importance of fundamental
understanding of elementary reactions to the full range of chemical
investigations in both gas and condensed phases. The presentations also include
studies of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions and polymer engineering. This
conference provide a unique forum to discuss how the same reactive species and
reaction motifs manifest under very different reaction conditions. Particularly,
gas phase chemical kineticists and liquid phase catalyst scientists can learn
from each other. The results of such learning will further expand scientific
understanding of the complex chemical reaction paths and outcomes. These
knowledge will help engineers design cleaner and more efficient combustion or
energy conversion devices, which will benefit the environment.
