9712191 Mountain This award will support a detailed, high resolution seismic
study of the New Jersey margin. Significant research effort has focused on this
margin in recent years with objective of NSF support on understanding history
and amplitude of sea level change during the Tertiary. Series of holes has been
drilled on-shore New Jersey (EAR and OCE support) and Ocean Drilling Program has
focused on drilling offshore sediment sequences. Additional ODP drilling planned
for July of this year in mid-shelf region. Office of Naval Research also
supporting large project in area to examine acoustics and physical properties of
shallow sediments. Present project has series of objectives, including
seismically tieing land drilling to offshore work; mapping spatial variability
in imaged Tertiary sediments; examining sea-level fluctuation in seismic data;
and surveying shallow water sites for potential future drilling. Principal
investigators at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and Rutgers University have
been leaders in focusing community research effort on this margin. ***
