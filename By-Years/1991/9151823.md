A UV-VIS spectrophotometer, an HPLC, and a GC instrument will be incorporated in
courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and a new course to be
developed in chromatography. The courses serve primarily to instruct students
preparing for technical careers in basic science. The new course in
chromatography will be developed in collaboration with scientists at a local
research institute.
