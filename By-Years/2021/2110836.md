The paradigm of learning from data is playing an increasingly important role in
science and engineering. The interplay between machine learning and mathematical
optimization has been most fruitful, and one prominent area is stochastic convex
optimization (SCO). However, there is relatively little work on the fundamental
questions such as generalization and stability analysis, and the existing
studies often focus on the standard classification and regression with smooth
losses. Furthermore, data collected and used for the learning often contains
sensitive information such as financial records from fraud detection or genomic
data from cancer diagnosis which presents an urgent need to develop privacy-
preserving SCO algorithms with theoretical guarantees. These provide motivation
for the project which aims to study the fundamental properties of machine
learning inspired SCO algorithms including their stability, generalization, and
differential privacy. Students will be involved and trained in interdisciplinary
aspects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives of the proposed work are
divided into three thrusts. The first thrust focuses on the study of stability
and generalization of stochastic gradient methods (SGM) for solving SCO problems
associated with non-smooth losses. The second thrust is to develop and study SGM
algorithms for SCO problems which can prevent the privacy leakage using a well-
accepted mathematical definition of privacy called differential privacy. The
third thrust is to study the stability, generalization, and differential privacy
of SCO algorithms for pairwise learning which involves more complex losses than
the standard classification and regression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
