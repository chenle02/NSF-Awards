This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research addresses
the next generation of model-based vision systems, which should demonstrate the
recognition in monocular image data of complex curved objects selected from a
large database of models. This will require major progress in the areas of shape
representation, modeling, and matching. This research focuses on a novel shape
representation and its application to automatic model construction from sets of
range and video images and to object recognition, including aspect graph
construction, pose computation, and indexing into a database of models. In this
research, arbitrary smooth 3D shapes are represented by a set of characteristic
surface curves having the properties that they determine the structure of the
image contours and its catastrophic changes, and there is a natural
correspondence between some of these curves and monocular contour features such
as inflections and bitangents.
