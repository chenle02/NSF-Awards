*** 9760416 Yang This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses
on developing self-lubricating materials. In certain applications involving high
temperatures and vacuum environments, liquid lubricants cannot be used
effectively and reliably. Self-lubricating materials can provide an alternative
lubrication method for these applications. This program seeks to develop
composites with microstructure in nanometer scale. It is expected that nano-
composites will feature friction coefficients low enough to be commercially
significant. Other anticipated benefits of the proposed material include
superior wear resistance, hardness, corrosion resistance, and low density.
During Phase 1, research will be conducted to demonstrate the proof-of-concept
that nano-composites with significantly lower friction coefficient can be
synthesized. Phase II will develop, optimize and field test nano-composites.
Phase III will commercialize the technology. Self-lubricating materials are very
attractive for applications that require high temperatures and low pressure
environments. Potential applications include advanced gas turbines, space
vehicles, satellite launch seals, high performance aircraft, and uncooled
engines for automobiles. Self-lubricating nano-composites would enhance energy
efficiencies, extend life, improve system reliability and reduce environmental
impact. ***
