The performance of the ultra-thin air bearings which exist between the flying
head and the hard disk in magnetic information storage systems will be modeled
numerically by second-order finite-difference solutions of the full Reynolds
equation. Effects of cross flow and of surface roughness orientation and shape
will be included in the model with the aim of determining which surface
roughness scheme will permit the lowest flying height, and thus the greatest
energy storage density.
