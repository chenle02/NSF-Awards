All-optical switching devices are crucial to realize optical computers which
offer ultra-fast information processing. To date, many switching concepts have
been investigated, but most suffer from speed, efficiency, reliability, size and
cost limitations. Optivision, Inc. proposes to design, fabricate and evaluate a
novel all-optical switching device based on nonlinear bimodal fiber-optic
interferometry using LP01-LP02 modes. A bimodal polymer fiber (BPF) is spliced
through two bi-tapers between two single mode fibers (SMFs). The field access
for high sensitivity to the polymer refractive index is the particular bi-
tapers to be exploited. This results in a coupling-beating- coupling structure
in the SMF/BPF/SMF arrangement with the beating of LP01-LP02 modes optically
controlled by a Kerr-like nonlinear polymer. The Kerr-induced nonlinear
differential phase shift in the BPF controls the optical coupling at the BPF/SMF
interface. The fabricated switch will be configured as a building block for
logic gate operations. Using fiber-optic amplifiers, these all-fiber logic gates
can be cascaded and have large fan- out. In addition, they will be fast,
compact, with low power consumption and low cost, and are compatible with the
fiber optic networks of the future advanced photonic communication and computer
designs to satisfy expected heavy demand on the information handling capacity.
