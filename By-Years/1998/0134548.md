Research world-wide on biosensing is motivated by numerous applications in
environmental and food testing and clinical diagnostics, for example. However,
the important problem of detecting in parallel a large number of molecular
species from the very small samples typical of most collection procedures
remains an elusive goal. This CAREER research plan focuses on solving this
problem by merging the science of nanophotonics with waveguide biosensors and
microfluidics for the development of a new class of molecular detection
array.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immobilization of metallic nanoparticles onto
discrete zones of an optical waveguide surface makes the parallel detection of a
large number of molecular species feasible. In each zone, capture molecules
tethered to the nanoparticles preferentially bind to a particular molecular
species through an affinity interaction. Strong localization of light about each
nanoparticle allows for dramatic improvement in optical signal transduction,
thereby facilitating the detection of small numbers of molecules bound within
each zone.&lt;br/&gt;Microfluidics will be used to deliver small sample volumes
to each sensing zone and passive mixing structures will be studied in order to
increase the molecular binding probability within each
zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan focuses on the creation of a
summer optics workshop for secondary school physics and science teachers. As
more demands are placed on teachers, and as technology continues to advance at a
rapid pace, teachers need a way in which to further their knowledge of science
and hands-on teaching methods. Detailed lesson plans and laboratory exercises
will be developed for deployment in the classroom, with the goal of improving
student understanding of and instruction in optics and the sciences, and
encouraging students to pursue careers in engineering and science. Participation
of teachers from Hispanic and Native American schools will be strongly
encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;
