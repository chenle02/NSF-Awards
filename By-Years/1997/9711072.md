Abstract - Dwyer This is a study of fundamental processes in chemically reacting
hydrocarbon droplet groups and spray systems. Numerical simulations are
performed with a simplified droplet dynamics flow system that incorporates many
features of a more complex spray system but allows for a physical interpretation
that can be and is confirmed experimentally. Emphasis is on those physical and
chemical processes influencing pollutant formation, notably nitric oxide, excess
hydrocarbons, and soot. The simplified flow system is fully three-dimensional
and relies on multiple line droplet arrays in configurations that involve
interactions with cold walls and the formation of droplet clouds. The program is
designed to give the basic flowfield information needed by statistical models of
diesel engine sprays such as the KIVA computer code and also to give fundamental
information on the vaporization and ignition of droplet groups. This program is
designed to provide information needed to reduce major pollutants produced by
spray systems in diesel engines.
