This project investigates the formation and fate of organic nitrogen compounds
in a moderately polluted forest environment. Such compounds may play a crucial
role in nitrogen cycling and sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide -
interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the ambient atmosphere are
understood poorly and present an area of study not widely considered at this
time by those concerned with carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems.
Specifically, the project will develop the capacity for measuring fluxes of some
selected alkyl nitrates - (isomeric) isoprene nitrate(s) and peroxyacyl nitrates
including peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), producing standard(s) for absolute
calibration of isoprene nitrate, and characterizing the fate of organic nitrates
through deposition within a forest environment. This project will be conducted
at the Program for Research on Oxidants: Photochemistry, Emissions, and
Transport (PROPHET) field site at the University of Michigan Biological Station.
Kinetics of organic nitrate reactions with the hydoxyl radical (OH) will also be
investigated in the laboratory. With regard to broader impacts, the project will
characterize some potentially important forest-atmosphere interactions, offer
insight into the role of nitrogen cycling in the carbon cycle within terrestrial
forest ecosystems, and improve present understanding of forest biogeochemistry.
The project will provide scholarship and capacity building through technology
transfer to a number of young scientists, many of those women, and through
institutional and PROPHET program outreach - through the larger NSF Integrative
Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) and Biosphere Atmosphere
Research and Training (BART) programs - facilitate broader community education
and involvement.
