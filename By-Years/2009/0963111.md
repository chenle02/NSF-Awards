Hot Flow Anomalies (HFAs) are phenomena observed near the Earth's bow shock that
are marked by strongly heated plasmas and substantial deflections in the plasma
flow direction. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the
characteristics of HFAs, understand how particle heating occurs inside HFAs, and
determine their impact on the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The first year will
be a systematic survey of hot flow anomaly events to determine the
characteristics of HFAs observed upstream of the bow shock and in the
magnetosheath. During the second year, the project will determine how the
electrons and ions are heated and how the energetic particles (&gt;25 keV) are
accelerated inside HFAs. During the third year, the impact of HFAs on the
magnetosphere and ionosphere will be determined. The project will use a variety
of data sets including data from the THEMIS, Cluster and Geotail spacecraft when
they were located near the bow shock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of
the proposed work lies in the fundamental information it will provide about
HFAs, which can significantly modify the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction,
generate shocks, and energize particles efficiently. The study will advance our
understanding of the structure and characteristics of HFAs, the physics
underlying particle heating inside HFAs, and their impact on the magnetosphere
and ionosphere. The interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere is
a key element in space physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will form the
core of the Ph.D. thesis for a graduate student from an underrepresented
minority at the Center for Atmospheric Research, University of Massachusetts,
Lowell. The scientific results will be highlighted on the THEMIS science nugget
website which was developed for members of the public who are interested in
THEMIS science results but may not have space physics backgrounds.
