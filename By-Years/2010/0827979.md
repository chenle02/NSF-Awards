The utterances of human languages have syntactic structure -- phrases being
built from subphrases -- and their meanings have structure as well -- predicates
applying to arguments, for instance. In fact, core cases of syntactic and
semantic structure are so closely related as to suggest a direct correspondence
between them. The syntax-semantics interface, that is, the formal architecture
defining the relation between syntactic structure and semantic representation,
ought to manifest this correspondence. This research advances the understanding
of the syntax-semantics interface by using the formal concept of synchronization
to characterize the relationship between syntactic and semantic grammars. The
grammar synchronization method forms the basis for a model that, when properly
calibrated, may simultaneously offer theoretical simplicity, computational
plausibility, and the ability to capture the intricacies of the syntax-semantics
interface for human language. The research will permit formal comparison of
current linguistic theories of the syntax-semantics interface, bringing a
dispersed area of research in linguistics and computer science into sharper
focus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By constructing and comparing grammar fragments
that handle a wide range of linguistic constructions, the investigators will
study the trade-off between computational efficiency and linguistic sufficiency
inherent in a range of choices of formal structures for syntactic and semantic
grammars and their synchronization. The end result will be a clearer picture of
the computational implications of the relationship between the structure and the
meaning of human languages and a method of expressing that relationship that
permits efficient computation. As such, it serves as a step towards successful
engineering of systems that can perform tasks such as interpreting sentences of
English or other languages.&lt;br/&gt;
