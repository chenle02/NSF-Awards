This is a request for a Minority Career Advancement Award by Dr. Sanchez. He has
designed a set of experiments to continue studying a steroid-receptor-associated
heat shock protein, hsp56. He wants to examine the effects of an
immunosupressant drug, FK506, on the binding capacity of the steroid receptor.
These studies will lead to advances in understanding the basic pharmacology of
immunosuppressants and the general areas of both steroid receptors and hormone
action.
