A lot of effort in the recent past has been expended on theoretical
development, algorithmic investigation, computational testing, and chemical
engineering design and science applications of the local optimization algorithms
for nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
problems. There now exist a number of local optimization algorithms and their
efficient implementations that are used for small, medium, and large scale
problems. There has been much less systematic study on the theoretical
developments, algorithmic methodology, computational testing, and application to
chemical engineering design and science problems of global optimization
approaches. The goal of this research is to develop and apply theoretical,
algorithmic and computational techniques for global optimization problems (GOP)
that arise in a variety of chemical engineering design and science applications.
The PI will investigate several classes of global optimization problems using a
primal-relaxed dual global optimization algorithm. In particular, he will focus
on: (1) new properties and new formulations of the relaxed dual subproblems; (2)
the design of phase and chemical reaction equilibrium systems; (3) the process
synthesis of separations, heat recovery networks and reactor systems; (4)
bilevel linear and nonlinear optimization problems arising in process design and
control; (5) optimum structure(s) determination of clusters of atoms and
molecules; and (6) the development of a parallel primal relaxed dual, GOP,
approach.
