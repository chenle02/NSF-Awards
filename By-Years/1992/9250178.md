This project is designed to enhance the learning process in the undergraduate
economics curriculum at Texas Christian University through the use of an
Economics Computer Classroom. To accomplish this, the project must achieve two
objectives: 1) the establishment of two regularly offered introductory computer
courses (one in microeconomics and one in macroeconomics) and an upper-division
advanced computer course; and 2) the incorporation of new analytical and
statistical software packages into the department's upper-division courses and
honors program that will provide hands-on computer experience for students. The
classroom will provide enrichment opportunities for students from other social
science departments as well as economics majors. The computer classes and the
enhancement of the upper-division curriculum will give students increased
exposure to current computer technology and software.
