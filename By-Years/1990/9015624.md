This project enhances the state of the art in electromagnetic geophysical
tomography, an adaptation of Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) used
successfully in medical diagnosis. Geophysical tomography, based on mechanical
waves, has been used to study rectangular regions up to 1000 meters on a side,
as well as to analyze deep earth structures. Sources have included airguns,
explosives and earthquake data. The method's capabilities have been augmented
using geophones, called seismic cones, to detect the arrival of artificially
generated waves to determine geophysical characteristics. This approach is
referred to as the seismic source cone penetration test (SS-CPT). However, the
seismic cones have several limitations. This research proposes evaluation of a
method to address these limitations. This field evaluation will take place at
well documented sites in California where extensive geotechnical investigations
have already been performed to establish site stratification.
