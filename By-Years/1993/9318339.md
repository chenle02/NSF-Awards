9318339 Kavvas The objectives of the project are to develop: a physically-based
two dimensional climate model (over zonal and meridional directions)describing
the physics of atmosphere-ocean-land interactions; an understanding of the
relative importance of various possible drought-causing mechanisms over the
United States and the northern hemisphere. Also, to use the model for examining
the feed-back processes in the evolution of droughts including anthropogenic
termination; and for performing Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the
characteristics of initiation, evolution and termination of droughts and to
develop the corresponding probability distributions. The results from this work
will advance the quality of forcasting the onset, evolution and duration of
droughts and may eventually benefit the well being and economic development of
people exposed to droughts. ***
