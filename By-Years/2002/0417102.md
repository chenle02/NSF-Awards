The introduction of double-stranded RNA into eukaryotic cells leads to homology-
dependent gene silencing, a process termed RNAi. In nematodes and plants, RNAi
initiated in one location can spread systemically to silence the targeted gene
throughout the organism. Furthermore, in the nematode C. elegans, dsRNA present
in the environment can be transported into animals to initiate RNAi, so-called
environmental RNAi. To investigate how gene-specific information can be
transported between cells Dr. Hunter performed a forward genetic screen to
identify genes required for systemic RNAi. Dr. Hunter is now characterizing the
proteins specified by these genes to understand how double-stranded RNA is
transported between cells. Understanding how intercellular RNA transport is
accomplished and regulated in C. elegans may provide insight into why this
activity is important to C. elegans and how to accomplish this in mammals, which
may have significant therapeutic applications. The initial analysis identified
systemic RNAi defective (sid) mutations in five genes. Two of these genes have
been cloned and characterized. sid-1 encodes an apparent channel that allows
passive transport of dsRNA into cells. sid-2 encodes an intestine limited
transmembrane protein required for environmental RNAi. Functional analysis of
SID-2 indicates that it may be the receptor for uptake of double-stranded RNA
from the environment. The first objective of this project is to complete the
analysis of the three remaining mutants. The second objective is to repeat the
mutant hunt, but broaden the selective criteria to identify additional genes
that may have essential roles for viability or fertility or that have tissue
specific roles in RNAi. The broader impacts resulting from these activities
include the training of postdoctoral investigators, Ph.D. students, and
undergraduate thesis students as well as the potential applications that may
unfold from a deep understanding of how dsRNA is trafficked between cells and
tissues.
