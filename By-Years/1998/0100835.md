Rodriguez&lt;br/&gt;0100835&lt;br/&gt;This US-Chile award will provide support
for cooperative research to Dr. Sergio Rodriguez of Purdue University to work
with Dr. Zdenka Berticevic of Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria and Dr.
Monica Pacheco of Universidad de Santiago in Chile on theoretical studies of
extended and localized electronic states in semiconductors and their low
dimensional structures.&lt;br/&gt;The project will attempt to develop a
theoretical understanding of recent experiments with diamond dopands that should
have implications for the development of wide band-gap semiconductors useful in
many electronic devices. The collaborators will investigate the production of
quantum dots in semiconductors making use of complementary facilities and tools
at their respective institutions. &lt;br/&gt;
