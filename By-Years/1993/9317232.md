9317232 Steckler Although tectonic models are useful in the study of continental
deformation, the outcome of many are strongly dependent on the choice of input
valves. This project will attempt to develop a method to predict which valve of
the flexural rigidity of continental lithosphere to use in various situations.
The model will involve the use of a finite element routine incorporating
rheologic modeling through the yield strength envelopes and will be tested or
calibrated from existing examples. Results should improve the choice of flexural
rigidity used in future tectonic models.
