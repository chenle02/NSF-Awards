9416288 Shapira This Americas Program award will support a two-year research
collaboration between Dr. Donald Shapira, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) ,
and a group of physicists from the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The
award will fund travel to Mexico and related expenses of Dr. Shapira and three
other U.S. scientists. The goal of the research is to establish a dynamic model
that describes the fusion process of two heavy ions over a large range of
energies. This project will perform a series of exclusive measurements of a
large fraction of the products from collisions between two heavy nuclei. The
measurements will be done with a unique high-granularity logarithmic detector
system, in conjunction with an array for charge particle detection. Both
research instruments, together with a new data acquisition system, are located
at Texas A&amp;M University, where the measurements will take place. The
establishment of a dynamic model that adequately describes the fusion process of
two heavy ions is still an unsolved problem and would be a major accomplishment
The development of such a model requires both experimental and systematic
studies. This project will carry out the systematic studies. ***
