An introductory course in modeling of dynamic systems, with special emphasis on
chemical and ecological problems, will be developed. The target student
population will be first- and second-year social-science and humanities
students, but upper-division students and interested science majors will not be
excluded. Rather than placing emphasis on mathematical methods and techniques
used in modeling, attention will be centered on salient aspects of complex-
system behavior as illustrated by models constructed using the commercially-
available software-package STELLA II. Relatively straight-forward models dealing
with chemical reactions will be used to introduce fundamental features of
complex-system dynamics. Problems of ecological and demographic interest, at
moderate level of difficulty, will then be covered. The origin and behavior of
"deterministic chaos" will be treated using examples from both chemistry and
ecology. In the last third of the course, students will work in small groups (or
individually) developing their own models, each related to a specific problem of
current interest, preferably in fields of the students' major academic interest.
Opportunity will be provided for some outstanding students to use less "user-
friendly" software such as ODEPACK to deal with models involving "stiff"
differential equations. The last exercise of the course will be a poster-
session, at which individuals and groups will present their project-models to
other members of the class, and to guests. The main aims of the course will be
to facilitate development of the students' insight with respect to types of
functioning to be expected of complex networks of relationships, and therefore
in important natural systems, and also to engender an appreciation of the power
and limitations of modeling techniques.
