This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of Arizona in developing a Chemical
Crystallography Resource Center. The x-ray equipment purchased for the Center
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) x-ray
structure determinations of model heme complexes, (2) design, synthesis, and
characterization of organic crystals, (3) synthesis and characterization of
organic toxicants, (4) redox chemistry of thioethers with adjacent carbon-metal
bonds, and (5) covalently linked oxo-Mo(V)/Fe(II)porphyrin centers. The X-ray
diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the
precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and
it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules.
