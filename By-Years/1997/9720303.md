The investigators are using several Fabry-Perot instruments to study
thermospheric and mesospheric small scale structures in wind and temperature. In
addition to mapping horizontal vectors of upper mesospheric wind, they obtain
wind observations at the highest possible time resolution. Then, they study
vertical wind characteristics and associated occurrences resolving
spatial/temporal ambiguities. Thus, the specific objectives of their research
are (1) imaging the vector wind field in the upper mesosphere, (2) obtaining
temporal and spatial variances in upper mesospheric winds, temperatures and
emission rates, as well as the spectral characteristics of fluctuations, and (3)
testing the hypothesis that there is no statistically significant variation in
distributed variance of wind or temperature emission rate measurements as a
function of position in the all-sky view.
