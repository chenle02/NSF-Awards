This research proposal is concerned with the efficient implementation of the
Icon programming language. The main problems are: o The generation of efficient
code for expressions in Icon, which may produce sequences of results and perform
goal-directed evaluation with novel control structures. o The detection and
handling at compile-time of operations that otherwise would have to be dealt
with at run-time. o The representation of a wide variety of data and aggregates
of data with sophisticated access mechanisms. o The dynamic allocation and
collection of space for such data over a range of computer architectures. These
problems will be approached by designing conceptual models, developing
algorithms, and implementing the results. Tools for measuring the performance of
the results will be developed and used in conjunction with design and
implementation. The goals of this research are: (1) to provide a production-
quality implementation of Icon, which will be valuable in its own right, (2) to
provide fundamental insights into implementation techniques for such programming
languages, and (3) to provide models, algorithms, and tools for such
implementations.
