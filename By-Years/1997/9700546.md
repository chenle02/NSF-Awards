This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, explores the interaction of halogen molecules with the well
characterized Al(111) surface. It is particularly concerned with the abstractive
dissociative adsorption which can occur with halogens, especially interhalogen
molecules. Professor Kummel and his students at the University of California at
San Diego will combine molecular beam scattering and scanning tunneling
microscopy methods to probe the detailed dynamics of the interaction of these
molecules, with a view to understanding the long range charge transfer process
which accompanies dissociative adsorption. Oriented beam methods will also be
used to probe the interaction of pendular states of the interhalogens with the
low work function aluminum surface. An understanding of the dissociative
adsorption of simple, high electron affinity molecules such as chlorine when
interacting with low work function metals such as aluminum is the focus of this
research project. Probing the dynamics of this interaction using scattering and
surface microscopic methods will provide information about the mechanisms of
these reactions, which are important in the processing of electronic materials,
and in corrosion processes.
