Dr. Wojciech Pulawski of the California Academy of Sciences proposes to
continue his career-long study of the sphecid wasps. The genus Gastrosericus
occurs across tropical Asia and Africa but has never been thoroughly studied
using a consistent and modern approach. The habitat occupied by these wasps is
continually diminishing, and careful study must be accomplished before they are
extinct. Dr. Pulawski proposes to collect new representative samples of the
genus in Thailand, Pakistan, and Africa, to describe their morphology, behavior,
and ecological habits, and to use these data to reconstruct their evolutionary
and biogeographic history. The proposed work has implications beyond the
confines of a single genus of wasp. Dr. Pulawski is amassing a unique data
resource, from which he will eventually be able to distill the evolutionary
pattern of an important and widespread tropical group. This history can then be
compared to evolutionary and biogeographic histories of other groups (both wasp
and non-wasp), in order to test hypotheses of causal processes.
