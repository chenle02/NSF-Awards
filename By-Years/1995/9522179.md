Abstract: Professor William A. Goddard at the Beckman Institute of the
California Institute of Technology is supported by a grant from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research involving theory and
simulation on problems relevant to new catalysts and chemical processes. The
goal of the research is to determine a set of general concepts and principles
that will form the basis of mechanistic understandings. These understandings
would make it possible to predict some of the properties of new systems without
measurements or calculations. The strategy to achieve this goal is to make use
of ab initio quantum mechanical, QM, results combined with molecular dynamics,
MD, studies of reaction kinetics. The need to perform these QM and MD
calculations on realistic models of systems of practical industrial interest is
given high priority. The work is divided into method development and the
application of QM and MD to specific catalytic problems of industrial
importance. This research is supported under the NSF Grant Opportunities for
Academic Liason with Industry (GOALI) initiative. There is enormous opportunity
for theory and simulation to aid in designing, developing, and engineering the
catalysts and chemical processes important to industry and society. With
reliable simulations to reduce the number of experiments, U.S. industry could
save many millions of dollars per year and could cut years off development
cycles by focusing on the most promising catalysts and processes. To help
provide the scientific basis for designing, characterizing, and optimizing new
catalysts, the supported research involves a broad attack on the mechanisms of
several industrially significant catalytic processes. This theoretical work
involves the use of both ab initio quantum theory and molecular dynamics
simulations. These studies will demand size and time scales which stretch
current methodologies and, hence, considerable emphasis is placed on developing
new methods.
