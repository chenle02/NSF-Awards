This project includes the research activities to obtain theoretical and
practical results on mechanisms that are incentive-compatible, scalable and
distributed. Specifically, distributed algorithmic mechanism design with
insights from game theory is proposed for three related problems in networking:
interdomain routing, web caching and peer-to-peer file sharing. The research
program on interdomain routing will develop a fundamentally new approach in
which many of the routing-related incentive issues are handled by incentive-
compatible protocols rather than bilateral contracts; such protocols can more
effectively address the system-wide issues of efficient routing and conflicting
policy requirements. Within this project also the recently developed techniques
for digital-goods auctions will be applied to the peer-to-peer file sharing
problem and to the design of incentive-compatible caching mechanisms. This
project will help to understand better the behaviors of large-scale, distributed
information systems formed by autonomous components such as Internet, and
develop incentive-compatible algorithms for these systems
accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
