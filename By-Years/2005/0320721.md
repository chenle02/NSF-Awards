0320721&lt;br/&gt;Burken&lt;br/&gt;The PIs represent all academic schools and
colleges on the UMR campus, assuring that this instrumentation will be prominent
in interdisciplinary research for decades, fostering productivity, funding, and
knowledge to be widely disseminated. Specific research topics to which the new
instrumentation is of overriding importance include: 1) Heavy metals
sequestration in natural systems and constructed wetlands, 2) Uptake and
volatilization of VOCs in phytoremediation systems, 3) Heavy metals transport in
plants, 4) Degradation of chlorinated compounds by genetically engineered-root
colonizing bacteria, .GEM-Phytoremediation., and 5) Extremophile bacteria in
bioremediation. Many other research projects of environmental nature will be
enhanced, though not sharing the natural systems focus. Broad access of
instrumentation will be granted to faculty members and students across the UMR
campus. Biological Sciences faculty and students will observe the greatest
impact, as there are no greenhouse facilities available currently, even though
many teach botany/plant physiology courses and perform plant-associated
research. Additionally, student researchers from many departments will learn to
utilize the state of the art equipment. These students and new ones attracted
with advanced facilities will be trained to investigate environmental problems
not yet imagined.
