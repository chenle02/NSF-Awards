Patricio Aviles will continue his work on partial differential equations
connected with problems on differential geometry and mathematical physics. This
work concerns four areas: the Yamabe problem in complete Riemannian manifolds;
liquid crystal problems; harmonic maps between two manifolds; singularities of
positive solutions of semi-linear elliptic equations. The compact Yamabe problem
was solved by Schoen. Aviles will try to extend his work with McOwen where they
made some progress in dealing with the case of complete manifolds. The liquid
crystal work involves minimal surface theory and concerns an investigation of
the size of singular sets of limiting configurations. The third topic focusses
on the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between complete manifolds of
negative curvature. Interest in positive solutions of semi-linear elliptic
equations is motivated by study of the Yangs-Mills equations. Aviles is going to
study non-isolated singularities.
