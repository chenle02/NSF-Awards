The purpose of this travel award is to allow Academician N. A. Shilo, member of
the Presidium and Councillor to the President of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Science, to visit Dr. Patricia Anderson at the University of Washington-Seattle
and Dr. Paul Colinvaux at the University of Ohio-Columbus to discuss the
possibility of initiating a new research program on the paleoclimatic and
paleovegetational history of the northern Urals and Novaya Zemlaya Island. He
would also be able to participate in a small workshop to be held in Seattle on
"Paleoclimates of Beringia" with the group involved in cooperative research
since 1989 that included pollen and geochemical analysis of lake sediments
collected on two field expeditions. The Soviets expect to sponsor an American
team in 1991 to core lakes in the northern Urals, an area with little knowledge
of the past climate or vegetation. That would complement the ongoing project in
the Soviet North East. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and
the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research
on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
