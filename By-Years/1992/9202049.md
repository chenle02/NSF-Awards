Gindikin will investigate multidimensional problems in integral geometry and
analysis on affine symmetric spaces. The first part of this project will be to
construct local inversion formulas and to relate them to the representation
theory of Lie groups. The second part of the proposal will consider analysis on
homogeneous cones and Siegel domains with an aim towards developing explicit
realizations of results from representation theory, including Plancherel measure
and spherical functions. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical physics, especially
quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
