The addition of a laser system to the existing one-component laser velocity
system at Davis will make possible the simultaneous measurements of two
projections of the velocity. In this manner, axisymmetrical or two dimensional
unsteady phenomena will be completely characterized. Several areas of research
are thus opened to accurate investigation: turbulent, corrugated, unsteady
flames. The results expected from this new capability will permit the resolution
of a number of flame phenomena which have been so far identified qualitatively
only. A more extensive data base will be built, which will inseminate a broad
range of combustion studies. A grant of $39,555 to be matched by the University
California is hereby recommended for CBT-8706435.
