The PI will continue his work on developing techniques to address important
problems in the field of random motion in random media, such as invariance
principles, large deviations, etc. In addition, the PI intends to broaden the
impact of his research by also applying the theory of diffusion processes to
computational neuroscience. As a first step, the PI proposes to study the
widely-used integrate-and-fire model with noise and adaptation. The primary
questions include existence and stability of stationary solutions in response to
a constant or periodically varying input. The proposal also has an educational
component; see below.

Traditionally, many physical systems are modeled with a diffusion process. It is
often the case that the medium in which the diffusion occurs possesses certain
inhomogeneities (e.g. an electron moving in an allow, waves diffusing in rocks
underground, etc). The inclusion of this property makes the model far more
realistic and reveals a wide variety of new effects, not present in constant or
periodic media. The main goal of the PI's work is to further the understanding
of the consequences of this disorder in the medium. Another part of the PI's
research stems from his belief in the need for a stronger involvement of
mathematical sciences in the explosive growth of biological research. In
particular, the complexity of neuronal network models used in Neuroscience makes
their modeling a computationally and analytically challenging task. A recent
technique for analyzing a class of such networks allows to view the population
dynamics as a certain diffusion process. The PI proposes to extend this
technique to a wider class of neuronal models, including a feedback (adaptation)
mechanism. The results will be applied to specific neurobiological problems,
such as localization of moving sound sources and contrast adaptation in vision.
The third component in the proposal is educational. The PI will develop new
courses, run seminars and workshops involving local budding scientists, organize
undergraduate work on research projects, and actively involve graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows in his ongoing research.
