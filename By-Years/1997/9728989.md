Emotions reflect an appraisal of situations, and they help people to respond to
situations in particular ways. However, appraisals may be modified, and
emotional response tendencies may be overridden. These emotion regulatory
processes permit people to manage their emotions, to influence which emotions
they have, and to choose how these emotions are expressed. Such emotion
regulation is essential to healthy adaptation, and so pervasive that it is often
taken for granted. Emotion regulation clearly has consequences for the person
who is doing the regulating, but it also may have important consequences for
others. The current project examines the social consequences of two important
forms of emotion regulation. The first, antecedent-focused emotion regulation,
is exemplified by reappraisal, in which one reinterprets one's situation so as
to reduce its emotional impact. The second, response-focused emotion regulation,
is exemplified by suppression, in which one inhibits emotion-expressive
behavior. Behavioral, physiological, and self-report measures will be used to
examine the social consequences of reappraisal and suppression. The long-term
objective is to better understand the nature and consequences of emotion
regulation. Such research could have important implications for understanding
emotion and emotion regulation, and will lay the foundation for interventions
promoting healthy forms of emotion regulation. ╝Á/¢Á ┐&gt;┤Á╝¢¥/&gt;┤╣&gt;À ?Â
