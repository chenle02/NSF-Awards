This action provides international travel support to enable the Principle
Investigator to travel to Taiwan to conduct research activities. The primary
focus of the investigation is the seismic optimization design of structures.
During the one-week period major universities and local investigators will be
visited. Technical discussions and research experiences data and results will be
exchanged. Seismic data generated at the SMART strong-motion array in Lu-Tung
will be collected and used as the basis to design a field experiment project for
collecting the needed structural response data.
