Comparative studies have revealed the presence of a large number of genes that
are associated with nitrogen fixation in the obligate aerobe Azotobacter
vinelandii but are not present in the facultative anaerobe Klebsiella
pneumoniae. A number of these nif-associated genes have also been discovered in
Rhodobacter capsulatus, Anabaena, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum and they are,
therefore, likely to be involved in nitrogen fixation under aerobic or
microaerobic conditions. In this project we will attempt to isolate and
characterize all of the remaining nif-associated genes from A. vinelandii. Also,
experiments designed to determine the physiological function of each nif-
associated gene product will be performed. Our approach will involve the
isolation of a set of mutant strains, each individually deleted for a specific
nif-associated gene. Also, deletions within nif-associated gene products will be
placed in combination with other characterized nif-specific mutations. Such
specifically constructed strains will be examined for; a) diazotrophic growth
abilities, b) accumulation of nif-specific mRNAs, c) accumulation of nif-
specific gene products, d) nitrogenase component protein specific activities, e)
response to molybdenum deprivation, and f) ability to recover from or cope with
various diazotrophic growth conditions.
