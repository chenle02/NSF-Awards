This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled
"Coordination of nuclear division in a fungal cell with thousands of nuclei."
This research studies the regulation of nuclear division in the multinucleated,
filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii. In this organism, neighboring nuclei display
independent cell cycles resulting in asynchronous mitoses within a common
cytoplasm. Using cell biological and molecular genetic approaches, the research
evaluates the key molecular controls of the unique cell cycle.
