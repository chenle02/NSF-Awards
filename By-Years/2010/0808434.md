IOS-0808434&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical mediation of prey preferences by
spider-hunting wasps within an evolutionary
framework&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While spiders are predators, they are
themselves heavily preyed upon by mud-dauber wasps. Different mud-dauber species
preferentially capture particular groups of spiders, but the bases for these
preferences are not well understood. Spider web architecture has been considered
to be a defensive behavior against wasp predation, with three- dimensional webs
thought to provide more effective physical barriers than their two-dimensional
counterparts. Surprisingly, initial results from our experiments indicate that
the mud-dauber wasp, Sceliphron caementarium, does not base its foraging
decisions on web characteristics. Rather, it uses chemical cues present on
spiders and /or their webs to recognize its prey. The proposed study will
address chemical mediation of prey preferences by wasps within an evolutionary
framework. The results of this work will provide insights into whether other
mud-dauber wasps use chemical cues to recognize spider prey, and whether all
spider taxa taken by Sceliphron will share similar chemical profiles. This
research will also help us to understand whether changes in chemical profiles of
spider families may have allowed spider diversification via escape from wasp
predation. The demonstration that prey preferences of spider-hunting wasps are
mediated by spider chemicals is a significant contribution to our understanding
of predator-prey interactions. This study will have broader impacts by providing
educational and research opportunities to elementary school and undergraduate
students through development of lesson plans designed to teach ecological
concepts using mud-dauber nests.
