This award provides funding for the conference “Groups, Actions, and
Geometries”, which will take place at Tufts University in Medford, MA, from
8/7/2023 to 8/11/2023. The event will bring together graduate students,
postdocs, and faculty interested in the study of infinite groups via geometric
and topological methods. While the field is relatively recent, it has already
delivered major contributions to other areas of mathematics. This event will be
an opportunity to make further progress, strengthen the community, and train a
new generation of mathematicians. A major feature will be the interaction
between early career and more senior researchers via dedicated networking,
mentoring, and collaborative activities.

Three mini-courses and nine research talks will introduce the next generation
of promising mathematicians to the most exciting topics and active researchers
in geometric group theory. The tentative topics for the mini-courses are: 1)
virtual algebraic fibering of groups, an algebraic analogue to topological
fibering of manifolds; 2) Artin groups, a family of groups vastly generalizing
braid groups and right-angled Artin groups; 3) locally compact groups, a
powerful framework for the study of finitely generated groups acting by
isometries on metric spaces. The principal aims of the conference will be to
facilitate in-person interactions between participants, attract and maintain new
mathematical talent and encourage a diverse group of early career researchers.
To this end, the conference will feature problem sessions attached to the mini-
courses, poster presentations for early career participants, thematic lunches,
and a panel discussion. With more than half of the speakers and organizers of
this conference from underrepresented groups in mathematics, the conference
organizers are proud to represent the diversity of their field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
