The Einstein Equations have seen extraordinary developments in the last few
years, such as results on the formation of black holes, investigations into the
uniqueness and stability of the Kerr solution, and advances in our understanding
of cosmic censorship, quasi-local mass, deformations of initial data sets and
properties of marginally trapped surfaces. Highly fruitful connections with
other geometric PDE's, such as Yang Mills, wave maps, the Yamabe equation,
various parabolic flows, as well as connections to other nearby areas, such as
harmonic analysis, have led to an array of exciting new discoveries. This
activity has attracted many geometric analysts to the wealth of problems and
potential applications of the geometrical techniques developed. The special
session on Mathematical Relativity organized by the PI's at the fifth conference
on Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems in Akko, Israel, May 22 to 26, aims to
gather leading specialists and younger researchers in mathematical relativity
and geometric PDE's, to discuss these problems and recent results in order to
promote collaborations and further progress.

With the advance of several experimental projects on relativistic gravitational
physics, it is highly important todevelop a wealth of theoretical models. In
order to assure that mathematical relativity continues to have a strong impact
on, and interaction with, the experimental efforts, these models should mature
and be able to make quantitative predictions on a number of subjects such as
gravitational collapse, gravitational waves and other phenomena associated with
strong gravitational fields. This special session will encourage further
collaborative research into these topics and also draw young talent to this
field. The participation of graduate students and young Ph.D.'s will ensure the
continued vitality of the discipline.
