Dr. Jennie E. Burnet of the University of Louisville will undertake research on
rescuer behavior, community-level resistance to violence, and rescuer motivation
during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The study's central question is: how and why
do some people put themselves at great risk of harm in order to rescue others
during communal violence? The study will compare rescuer behavior among
different ethnic and religious groups in that country to identify the intrinsic
factors (such as character, identity, religious belief, and religious practice)
and extrinsic factors (such as geography, proximity to victims, opportunity, and
community structure) that make rescuer behavior possible. The researchers will
investigate the potential impact of social network characteristics on resistance
to genocide and will attempt to identify aspects of faith, practice, leadership,
or community structure that led to community-level resistance to genocide in
certain locales.

Using social science research methods, the project will gather life history
narratives, key informant interviews, testimony about the genocide, and social
network data from more than 250 Rwandans in eight communities in Rwanda. A range
of actors, including publicly recognized rescuers, bystanders, perpetrators, and
victims will be interviewed.

This research will contribute to the scientific understanding of rescuer
behavior, resistance to communal violence, and the impact of religion on these
behaviors. It will also assist policymakers in developing interventions to
improve resistance to communal violence. The project will contribute to basic
understanding of the Rwandan religious communities and the connections between
Rwandan local social movements and global religious communities. Finally, this
study can offer a timely contribution to national and international policy
debates about religion and violence.
