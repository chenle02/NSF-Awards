Professor Michael D. Seymour and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Hope College are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Some of the projects involve investigating the
role of ferritin in biological iron storage, synthesis of tin and lead alkoxides
as precursors to electroconducting thin films, and developing flow injection
"amplification" for trace analysis. Communication skills will be emphasized by
student presentations at the beginning and end of the program, and by
preparation of a written report after the project has been completed.
