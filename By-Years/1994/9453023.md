9453023 Taylor The American Museum of Natural History is developing a 10,000 sq.
ft. Hall of Life's Diversity that will interpret biodiversity, what it is, why
it matters to humans, why it is under threat, and what can be done to mitigate
the current pattern of extinctions. The hall will have the following sections:
a) the Crisis Center that will serve as the orientation place for the exhibit
and where the core principles of the exhibit will be interpreted, b) four
interactive habitat models that depict major ecosystems, c) the Spectrum of
Life, in which specimens, models, photographs, and interactive multimedia will
be juxtaposed and will serve as a field guide to the array of animal and plant
life on the planet, d) a Resource Center that is devoted to educational
activities, and e) a theater/classroom space. The intended audience for the
exhibit is people of all ages and learning styles. The exhibit will illuminate
the crucial role that science plays in our everyday lives and will promote
science literacy among adults and children. In addition to the main exhibit,
there will be a broad menu of complementary programming including traveling
versions of the exhibit, a teacher resource guide, and a teacher-training
institute. The exhibit and complementary activities are to be coordinated with
New York State's State Systemic Initiative program.
