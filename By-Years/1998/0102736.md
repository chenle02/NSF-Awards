This individual investigator award will provide support to a young professor at
Clemson University for his research on the mixed state of type-II
superconductors. In particular he will attempt to measure the amount of charge
bound inside a vortex line in a type-II superconductor. Recent transport models
for the mixed state of the high temperature superconductors have invoked a
nonzero vortex charge as an explanation for the anomalous behavior seen
experimentally. In the high temperature superconductors, the value for the
vortex charge is expected to be enhanced over its value in conventional type-II
superconductors. A novel technique utilizing the measurement of the mixed state
thermoelectric Hall effect (Nernst Effect) will be employed in this effort. The
expected sensitivity of this technique means that a null result will be as
important as a finite value. The charge will be measured in the cuprate
superconductors as a function of stoichiometry, temperature, and magnetic field.
This research will increase our understanding of these technologically useful
materials. The students working on this project will develop skills that will
help them find jobs in academia, government or industrial laboratories. %%%
Superconductors are materials that have zero electrical resistance and thus can
carry an electrical current without loss. The technologically useful
superconductors are known as type-II. These materials have what is known as a
"mixed state." In the mixed state an external magnetic field is able to
penetrate the superconductor in quantized (fixed) amounts, resulting in
vortices. Recent theories to explain the observed anomalous behavior of the
electrical and thermal transport in the mixed state of the high temperature
superconductors invoke the notion of a non-zero electric charge for these
vortices. The charge of a vortex has never been measured. In conventional, low
temperature superconductors it would be too small. However it may be possible to
measure this value in the high temperature superconductors. This individual
investigator award will provide support to a young professor at Clemson
University for his attempt to measure the charge bound inside a vortex in a high
temperature superconductor. The project will utilize a newly developed,
sensitive technique to make this measurement. The technique has enough
sensitivity that even a measured value of zero for the charge will be
significant and have implications for the theories of the mixed-state. This
research will increase our understanding of these technologically useful
materials. The students working on this project will develop skills that will
help them find jobs in academia, government or industrial laboratories.
