This proposal, from a RUI institution in an EPSCoR state, developing tools and
documentation, aims at reducing the learning curve and lowering the preparatory
barriers that inhibit scientists from taking advantage of multi-processor
computations. The project, proposing a 100 node Beowulf cluster, is expected
to:&lt;br/&gt;a. Assist in the conversion of single processor applications to a
parallel computational environment, and&lt;br/&gt;b. Reduce learning time and
code porting time for scientists to effectively utilize the computational power
of multi-processor systems.&lt;br/&gt;The work spans two colleges, Engineering
and the Arts and Sciences, and enjoys participation across six academic
departments. Various problems, including topics in hydrology, seismology, civil
engineering, atmospheric fluid mechanics, oceanic currents, wave propagation,
mathematics (numerical methods and solving ODE's in parallel), electromagnetics,
neural networks, will be ported to the cluster and include,&lt;br/&gt;a.
Inelastic Wave Propagation, Soil Dynamics, Soil Permeability, Atmospheric
Modeling,&lt;br/&gt;b. Parallel Computation, Character Recognition.&lt;br/&gt;c.
Hydraulic Tomography, Waveform Relaxation Methods,&lt;br/&gt;d. High-Energy
Astrophysics, and Nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;The interaction between a team of
computer scientists, client scientists, and students should result in a user
paradigm facilitating the conversion of the diverse scientific problems. The
platform should serve as an asset for future research and educational
activities.&lt;br/&gt;
