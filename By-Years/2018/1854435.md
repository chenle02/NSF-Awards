This project addresses the problem of inverse rendering: recovering 3D shape,
material, and lighting from a single image. Inverse rendering is a fundamental
problem in computer vision; it recovers the basic properties of a visual scene,
and serves as a foundation for higher-level scene understanding such as
recognizing objects, actions, and functionalities. Despite its fundamental
importance, inverse rendering remains difficult. Solving inverse rendering can
significantly advance computer vision and benefit a wide variety of applications
from autonomous driving to assisting the visually impaired. This project
develops new machine learning algorithms to advance the state of the art of
inverse rendering. In addition, the project contributes to education and
diversity by integrating research results into courses at various levels and by
recruiting underrepresented groups to participate in this research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances inverse rendering technologies
using computer graphics and machine learning. In particular, the research team
develops two machine learning systems that co-evolve as adversaries: a rendering
system that learns to compose 3D scenes and renders images using a graphics
engine, and an inverse rendering system that learns to recover shape, material,
and lighting from the rendered images. To develop the rendering system, the
research team investigates new learning algorithms for adaptive, automatic scene
composition. To develop the inverse rendering system, the research team
investigates new learning algorithms that integrate neural networks and physics-
based vision.
