This research is in the area of control of structural vibrations. Flexible
mechanical systems are widely used in spacecraft, buildings and bridges,
material processing devices, and elsewhere. Vibration of such systems limits
their utility in many applications. This project addresses this topic and
focuses on the modeling, analysis, and experimental evaluation of noncolocated
vibration control of flexible mechanical systems. It utilizes the time delay
approach to eliminate structural instabilities. The research comprises four
phases, including (1) formulation of a noncolocated control system in the
frequency domain, (2) development of the time delay approach for noncolocated
control, (3) analysis of the noncolocated control system and design of
stabilizing controllers, and (4) experimental verification of the control system
model and time delay approach. This is a multidisciplinary problem requiring
expertise in dynamics, structural analysis, and control system design.
