The objective of this work is to develop a new class of computer-based methods
for the estimation of properties of organic compounds from their molecular
structure. It is planned to develop the ABC approach which is based on the
contributions of Atoms and Bonds in the properties of Conjugate forms of a
molecular structure. Although conjugates are extensively used in organic
chemistry to draw qualitative conclusions on the stability and chemical
properties of a compound, they have been completely ignored in property
estimation for chemical engineering purposes. Although an initial focus will
entail simple thermodynamic properties, such as the heat of formation, the
quantum-mechanical basis of this approach should permit the estimation of other
physical properties, fractional charges on individual atoms of the compound, and
electron densities and strengths of individual bonds. These properties of
molecular fragments will in turn lead to quantitative prediction of
intermolecular interactions and chemical properties of compounds. Thus, ABC will
ultimately allow accurate and general estimation of a wide variety of
properties, and thus more efficient analysis and design of products and
processes.
