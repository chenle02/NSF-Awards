This award supports a planning committee effort to consider strategies by which
behavioral and social science journal editors might help to reduce misconduct in
their sciences. The planning effort will examine prior research and related
efforts, consider how to broaden involvement to include a wide range of
behavioral and social science disciplines, and define the problems and
activities that would respond to them appropriately. Two committee meetings are
planned. The first will develop an understanding of the current status of
ethical, legal, methodological, editorial and public policy issues with respect
to scientific misconduct in the behavioral and social sciences. It will plan the
work activities for the second meeting and make assignments for work to be done
preceding that meeting. At the second meeting, the committee will develop a
needs assessment and a set of recommendations for action and activities that
should follow. Afterwards, staff and committee members will work together to
prepare a report that will summarize the current status of efforts to minimize
misconduct in the target sciences, identify gaps in the current effort, and
recommend further actions to address the problems. The report will be
disseminated to relevant governmental agencies and officials and to behavioral
and social scientists and journal editors. This project focuses on an important
issue. The principal investigators and planning committee members are very well
qualified; planning activities are appropriate and feasible; the sponsoring
organization is very appropriate; results will provide an important basis for
actions that can help to reduce misconduct in the behavioral and social
sciences. Support is highly recommended.
