The goal of this S-STEM project is to guide high-achieving STEM students in
becoming academically and civically-engaged scientists (ACES). The underlying
premise of this proposal is that as the US increases the number of STEM
professionals in order to excel in innovation, it is equally important that
those STEM professionals see their chosen vocations as giving them a
responsibility to serve their community, nation, and world as citizens. The ACES
program will support a diverse cohort of 10-11 STEM students who will be awarded
scholarships each year. As freshmen, scholars live in a residential cluster,
enroll in common courses together, and explore what it means to be civically-
minded scholars. As seniors, scholars complete an individualized honors research
project with a faculty member. Each ACES cohort completes community engagement
projects every year that allow them to apply their STEM knowledge and their
leadership skills. They will also participate in mentoring programs and career
development opportunities.

The specific measurable objectives of this project are to: (1) recruit diverse
students to STEM fields, (2) retain 85% of scholarship recipients in a STEM
field, (3) increase civic mindedness and engagement among participants, and (4)
achieve a STEM placement for 90% of the program graduates. The ACES program will
enable scholars to develop professional relationships with their peers and
community partners, and articulate what it means to be a civically-engaged
scientist to a variety of audiences. As a result of this program, ACES students
will be able to actively engage with community issues by applying their
scientific body of knowledge and skills. Assessment and evaluation of the ACES
program will contain both formative and summative components using both direct
and indirect evidence-based measures.
