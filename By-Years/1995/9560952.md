This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop an
improved method for polarizing cold, thermal, and epithermal neutrons. It has
long been realized that neutrons can be polarized by passing them through a
dense, spin-polarized, gaseous 3He target. Because the thermal neutron-
absorption cross section of polarized 3He is 10,000 times larger for the anti-
parallel spin case then for the parallel case, a sufficiently thick polarized
3He target efficiently transmits neutrons that are in one spin state and
strongly attenuates the others. This type of transmission polarizer has several
advantages over currently available reflection polarizers (`supermirrors`).
Unlike supermirror polarizers, the 3He filter can be applied to epithermal
neutrons and can be used as a polarization analyzer in a number of standard
neutron-scattering instruments, including Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS)
spectrometers, which presently have substantial private sector applications. Two
methods have previously been used to spin-polarize 3He. The first is spin
exchange with an optically pumped alkali species (rubidium vapor) which is an
extremely slow method, taking up to a day to achieve full polarization. The
second is direct pumping of metastable 3He which has only been attempted at very
low pressures (&lt;2 torr) and thus must have an added capability to pressurize
the polarized gas. The physics of the direct method bears great similarity to
that of excimer lasers with which Science Research Laboratory has a long
history. This project will develop a high pressure ( 1 ATM) highly polarized
(&gt;75%) 3He neutron-spin filter that will find application in polarized
neutron scattering and other areas. The apparatus will employ a proprietary
method for polarizing the 3He quickly and directly at high pressures, avoiding
the problems faced by other methods, and making for a low cost, reliable device.
The feasibility of this concept will be investigated in detail in the proposed
Phase I program. Phase II will consist of a proof-of-principle demonstration of
a neutron-spin filter. It will be followed by a privately funded Phase III
program in which a commercial prototype instrument will be developed. If this
research is carried over into Phase II and Phase III, the 3He Neutron Spin
Filter will allow for efficient thermal and epithermal neutron polarization.
Such a polarizer will find applications at thermal and epithermal neutron
facilities in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Asia as an upgrade to established
neutron-scattering instruments. Other applications exist as well in nuclear
physics and in MR imaging.
