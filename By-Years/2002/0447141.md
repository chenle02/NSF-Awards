A grant has been awarded to the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station under the
direction of Dr. Lee Fitzgerald for partial support of the geo-referencing of
the herpetology division of the Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collections (TCWC).
The herpetology collection was established in 1938, contains one of the most
extensive holdings of Latin American and Texas specimens to be found anywhere in
the world, including specimens from locations where collection activities have
since become difficult or, in some cases, impossible. In recent years the
collection has been electronically cataloged for on-line use, been used
increasingly for research, teaching, and public outreach, and been partially
geo-referenced through active participation in the NSF sponsored HerpNET
National Database Project.

Biological collections are a foundation for advancing understanding of complex
ecological changes over space and time. Given the critical need to address
environmental and social problems related to biodiversity, ecological processes,
and environmental change, it is important to preserve, expand, and improve
existing natural history collections. The geo-referencing activities of this
project will allow researchers from around the world to better utilize the
collections of the TCWC. Improvements made now to the TCWC herpetology
collection will support research on biodiversity and organismal biology; those
research activities and the scientific questions they address will continue to
benefit from collection improvements long after the life of this project.

This collection supports research, teaching, and outreach. In addition, it
serves to catalog biodiversity. Natural history collections are increasingly
used by diverse user groups in almost every scientific discipline, medicine, and
teaching. Improvements to the TCWC herpetology collection will continue those
important functions, as well as provide valuable opportunities for undergraduate
and graduate students to participate in the use and development of natural
history collections, specifically herpetology collections.
