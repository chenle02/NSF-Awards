With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Program supports the research of Professor Craig A. Ogle and Dr.
Michael D. Murphy of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North
Carolina, Charlotte, NC. The project will apply NMR spectroscopy and the rapid
injection NMR technique to the study of two very important chemical reactions,
anionic polymerization and the addition reactions of organocuprates. Although
both of these reactions are scientifically significant and highly important
economically, there are many consequential unanswered questions concerning their
mechanism. The use of the rapid NRM technique will allow the determination of
the structure and nature of the reactive intermediates in these important
reactions.

With support from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, this project
will train undergraduate and masters students in the use of sophisticated
analytical instrumentation and modern experimental design. The potential
economic impact of this research could be significant, leading to new products
and methodologies in both the polymer and the pharmaceutical industry.
