0243994 Abolmaali&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a three-
year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of
Texas at Arlington (UTA) for six students per year during eight weeks in the
summer to conduct hands-on laboratory and field research in structural,
geotechnical, and construction engineering. Each student will work with one of
four small research teams focusing on (1) The Seismic Performance of Partially
Restrained Connections, (2) Repair Performance Evaluation of Fiber-Reinforced
Polymer Composites, (3) Novel Measurements in a Geotechnical Engineering
Laboratory, and (4) Residential Foundation Repair Methodology. The REU
experience is designed such that the students experience the research process
through developing improved materials and testing procedures; manufacturing and
testing structural components and systems; collecting and analyzing field data;
collecting and analyzing data using state-of-the-art laboratory measurement
techniques; and writing and presenting papers. Each research team will include
faculty members from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at
UTA and industry-based professional advisory members of the Construction
Research Center at UTA. Both formative and summative assessment and evaluation
of the REU Site will be performed. Outreach to local K-12 schools by the
principal investigator to inform local students and teachers about REU Site
activities, along with involvement of local K-12 math and science teachers in
biweekly REU site meetings will be done to encourage students to consider
enrolling in civil and environmental programs after high school and to promote
professional development of K-12 math and science teachers. &lt;br/&gt;
