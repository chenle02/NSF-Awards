An Integrative Approach to Teacher Enhancement in Chemistry is a 20 month
program aimed at enhancing the capabilities of 20 high school chemistry teachers
from a five county region in the vicinity of Louisville, Kentucky. These
teachers will participate in two five-week summer workshops and three one-day
in-service meetings. The workshops will emphasize training in chemical structure
and bonding, chemical demonstrations, simple computer simulations and computer
assisted instruction in chemistry. Participants will receive two units of
graduate credit for each completed summer workshop. These teachers also will
provide in-service training for other chemistry teachers in the area.
