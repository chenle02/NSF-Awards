Developing a professional mobile phone application is cumbersome and expensive
in practice. To create for such an application an optimized user interface,
professional graphic artists (i.e., non-programmers) design each screen of the
user interface, for example, as pixel-based designs in Photoshop. Programmers
then manually convert these screen designs to application source code. This
conversion is labor-intensive and typically needs to be done several times
during a project, as during a project user interface designs are often optimized
iteratively. This project explores the commercialization of the first technique
to automatically perform this conversion from pixel-based screen design drawing
to working user interface source code. The project is expected to benefit both
professional mobile application developers and students. The tool may save
professional developers time and teach students how screen elements can be
implemented in source code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To satisfy consumer demand for
customized user interface (UI) designs, mobile application UIs often deviate
from standard UI components and provide their own UI designs. While many
graphical UI builder tools exist, they are not well suited for such custom UI
designs and expert graphic designers prefer pixel-based design tools. On a given
screen design graphic, the project team's prototype tool identifies UI elements
such as images, text, containers, and lists, via computer vision and optical
character recognition (OCR) techniques. The prototype further infers a suitable
UI hierarchy and exports the results as source code that is ready for
compilation and execution on mobile computing devices. The generated UI closely
mimics the UI of a corresponding real application, both in terms of pixel-by-
pixel screenshot similarity and by the similarity of their runtime UI code
structures. During the I-Corps program, the team will focus on contacting
potential customers, gathering their feedback, and using it to further enhance
the proposed prototype.
