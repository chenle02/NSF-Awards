The role of coastal upwelling fronts and jets in general coastal circulation
will be examined through numerical experiments on a supercomputer using a
primitive-equation, three-dimensional, time-dependent numerical model.
Potentially, cross-shelf exchange may be inhibited or enhanced in the presence
of fronts and this project will lead to insight about the conditions that favor
each process. Additionally the time scales for various mesoscale frontal
features will be described.
