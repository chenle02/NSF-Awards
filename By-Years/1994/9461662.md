This SBIR Phase-I program addresses a crucial, unsolved problem in
nondestructive evaluation (NDE). Structures as diverse as aircraft, pipelines,
reaction vessels, bridges, and buildings can develop defects that are hidden
from view by many millimeters of metal. Such defects include cracks or voids in
thick structural members, interfacial corrosion in layered structures, and
cracks radiating from fastener holes in the second or third layer of a lap
joint. Existing NDE techniques are inadequate for detecting such structural
problems. Quantum Magnetics, Inc. propose to develop an improved eddy current
system that detects deeply buried defects, using low-frequency electromagnetic
fields that penetrate deeply into the metal. This system will combine two recent
developments: (1) extremely sensitive magnetoresistive magnetometers, and (2)
the Three-Sensor Gradiometer (TSG), an elegant noise rejection technique
originally developed for superconducting SQUID magnetometers. Quantum Magnetics
is uniquely qualified to develop this new system, because of its expertise in
measuring the AC magnetic response of small samples and making ultrasensitive
magnetic measurements in noisy environments.
