Quantitative precipitation forecasts in the warm season have historically been
much poorer than in the cool season. To a large degree, this is because a
sizeable fraction of warm season precipitation comes from mesoscale convective
systems (MCSs) and these systems are poorly resolved by the current operational
models. Recent observational and budget studies indicate that numerical
prediction of these systems will require physical processes such as
precipitation drag, melting and evaporation to be incorporated into very fine
resolution mesoscale models. The convective parameterization scheme used with
such models must include moist downdrafts and realistic moisture detrainment for
propagating deep convection. Part of the proposed work focuses on the model
development necessary to successfully simulate MCSs. A second portion focuses on
the use of the model as a diagnostic tool to help understand the structure and
dynamics of MCSs, particularly the development of warm core vortices in the
"stratiform" region. The final portion concentrates on observing-system
simulation experiments in order to help define the observational requirements
(including assimilation of profiler data) for understanding and predicting
mesoscale convective systems.
