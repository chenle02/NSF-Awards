IBN: 9724083 PI: PHILLIPS There are many animals believed to use geomagnetic
information for orientation and navigation behavior, but the identity of the
sensory mechanisms that might be responsible for magnetic detection remain
largely unknown. Behavioral and neurophysiological evidence suggest that there
may be more than one magnetoreceptive mechanism. This project utilizes
salamanders as a model system for studying magnetic homing behavior, to
characterize and localize putative magnetosensory mechanisms. Behavioral
experiments involving altered magnetic fields and different particular
environmental light will be used to determine whether a magnetic effect might
act on photoreceptors or instead directly on some magnetically sensitive
particles in the body. Results will be important in providing some answers for
this very controversial topic in sensory neurobiology.
