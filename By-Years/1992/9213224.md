This professional development fellowship will enable the recipient to immerse
herself in the research activities at the Ames National Laboratory in three
major areas: materials chemistry, condensed matter physics and metallurgy and
ceramics. Over the course of two summers, by participating in lab group
meetings, discussing research and research results and publications with group
members, and attending symposia at scientific meetings, this historian of
science and technology will gain scientific and technical literacy to help her
in her research. The research involves an exploration of the relationships
between the process of scientific research and its organization, management, and
funding. To explore this relationship the investigator will examine the history
of scientific activity at Ames Laboratory. In its forty-five year tenure the
facility has expanded and become more complex. However, small-scale, single-
investigator laboratory-based research continues to define its msision. The
investigator will also be able to conduct oral interviews with present and
former laboratory personnel, to chronicle their recollections of the history of
Ames. During the academic year, the investigator will research other aspects of
the project, including Frank Spedding's papers and the archivals resources at
the laboratory, Iowa State University, the Department of Energy and its Chicago
field office. The internship will help to put those sources in context, while
research during the academic year will raise new issues for discussion with the
laboratory scientists during the second summer. Results from this research will
be of benefit to policy makers and scientists as institutional bureaucracies and
mechanisms of management and funding for science are restructured.
