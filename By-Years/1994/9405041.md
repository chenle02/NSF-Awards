Scalettar 9405041 We propose to investigate hardware and algorithmic bottlenecks
in parallel and vector supercomputers within the context of a central problem in
condensed matter physics and material science-monte carlo simulations of
interacting electron systems. This work will provide an evaluation of the
direction parallel architectures and algorithms need to develop, at least for
this important class of computational physics problems.
