The project is proposed by a partnership that includes Washington University,
St. Louis, five near-urban school districts in St. Louis (Ferguson-Florissant,
Maplewood-Richmond Heights, Riverview Gardens, University City and Webster
Groves) and two informal science centers, the St. Louis Science Center and the
St. Louis Zoo.

The partnership effort is to improve the mathematics and science achievement of
preK-12 students beginning with a particular focus on grades 4-8. The school
districts are responsible for the education of approximately 29,000 students and
the project will impact several hundred teachers each year.

A goal is to enhance student achievement, and this is accomplished by: improving
capacity to provide a challenging math and science curriculum for every student;
developing exemplary teacher support from pre-service education through the
induction years; improving teacher quality, quantity and diversity using
innovative recruitment strategies, and; narrowing the achievement gap between
under-represented minority students and Caucasians in math and science. To
achieve these goals, the partnership is designing and implementing a six-part
infrastructure for teacher professional development and a materials management
and community support system, which is to be sustained for the long-term.
