ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient optical frequency conversion in
nonlinear crystals is made possible by phase matching - the coherent addition of
the nonlinear response upon propagation through the crystal. Today, optical
frequency conversion is exploited in many areas, ranging from laser fusion to
laser pointers. However, in order for phase matching to occur a crystal needs to
be many wavelengths in size, which is not compatible with nanoscale
architectures. A strong local nonlinear response therefore relies on intrinsic
material nonlinearities. This research program investigates the high optical
nonlinearities of plasmonic nanostructures made of noble metals such as gold and
silver. These structures make it possible to generate light locally at shifted
frequencies and to exploit multispectral interactions in nanoscale devices,
without the need of phase matching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program
investigates the nonlinear response of discrete and well-defined metal
nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanorods and particle hybrids (dimers,
trimers). These structures function as optical antennas - they localize and
enhance the incident fields and they facilitate the release of the nonlinear
response. The goal is to identify, understand and exploit configurations that
yield high nonlinear efficiencies. Many nonlinear interactions, such as harmonic
frequency generation or nonlinear four-wave mixing, are coherent processes and
hence the phase-sensitive interplay of local fields is important for a strong
response. The investigators study the interaction of frequency-converted fields
with single quantum emitters, such as quantum dots, molecules, or ions. The
ability to generate light locally through nonlinear processes provides new
opportunities for nanophotonics and active plasmonics.&lt;br/&gt;
