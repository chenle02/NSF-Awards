H. Berny Schlegel is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program to carry out computational program developments and applications of ab
initio classical trajectory calculations. Methodological improvements include
Car-Parrinello-based density matrix propagation, Born-Oppenheimer trajectories,
and reaction-path following techniques. Specific research areas include organic
light-emitting diode materials, molecules with nanotubes, and chemical vapor
deposition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will expand the range of
applicability of electronic structure methods to problems of current interest,
such as stability issues in organic light-emitting diode materials being readied
for marketing and control issues in chemical vapor deposition processes that
produce industrial coatings.
