9314421 Williamson This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will
support the collaboration of Craig Williamson of Lehigh University and Esteban
Balseiro of the University of Comahue in Argentina. The project aims to
investigate the impact of UV-B radiation on high-elevation lakes in the southern
Andes. Loss of stratospheric ozone is resulting in global increases in incident
UV-B radiation. Investigations of marine systems suggest that naturally
occurring fluxes of UV-B radiation can harm water column processes. Freshwater
ecosystems may be more predisposed to damage by UV-B radiation than marine
systems, yet little work has been done on UV-B radiation in lakes. This
project's goals are to model UV-B attenuation in lakes; investigate the possible
impact of UV-B on the chlorophyll-phosphorus relationship; and examine shifts in
zooplankton communities in lakes differentially affected by UV-B radiation.
These studies will complement the U.S. group's research on UV-B impacts in north
termperate lakes and the Argentine group's research on Andean lakes. The results
are likely to improve understanding of the importance of UV-B radiation in
lakes, and will strengthen international collaborations for future studies of
the effects of UV-B radiation on the environment. ***
