This award supports the design, development and implementation of a software
application to automate (1) the task of previewing a series of transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) thin sections at lower magnifications to identify a
suitable region of interest for reconstruction, and (2) the process of acquiring
final high-resolution images from the chosen area at high magnification. To
achieve this goal, a robotic grid handling system will be combined with an
automated imaging and targeting system to develop an application that will be
capable of handling a series of 96 grids at a time. The performance of the
overall system will be evaluated using a 3D phantom constructed specifically for
this purpose. The utility of the system will be demonstrated using serial
sections of pancreatic beta cells. The technology developed for this project
will have an impact on any project requiring reconstructions from serial
sections. In particular, automation will be absolutely critical to projects
proposed for developing whole cell atlases at nanoscale resolutions. The
availability of high-resolution cellular atlases will have a lasting impact on
the development of biological teaching materials for all levels. Although a cell
biological project has been chosen as the primary driver of this technology
development effort, the system once it is in place is also likely to have a
significant impact on the neurosciences, where TEM serial reconstruction is used
for tracking and visualization of structures through large volumes of dendritic
fields.
