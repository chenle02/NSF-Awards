This proposal is for support for the Cold Spring Harbor three week summer course
in Molecular and Developmental Biology of Plants. This is a continuation of the
course that has been funded by the National Science Foundation since its
inception eight years ago. The intention is 1) to teach molecular techniques to
scientists who are already involved in research with plants so that they can
bring this orientation to their own future research, and 2) to teach key
experimental systems in plant biology to scientists who are familiar with
microbial or animal systems and with to work with plants. Lectures in the course
are given by the organizers and by invited lecturers who are working on current
research frontiers, and are leaders in their field. Laboratory sessions focus on
methods to obtain and characterize transgenic plants and to study gene
expression. laboratory sessions will be taught by the course instructors, and by
invited lecturers who bring their laboratory materials with them. %%% This
course has served has a valuable training opportunity for researchers entering
the field of plant molecular biology.
