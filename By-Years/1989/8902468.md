This proposal represents an interdisciplinary effort of four independent
research groups the Departments of Chemistry and Material Sciences to establish
a commonly used pool of research instrumentation for the characterization of
polymeric materials. Specifically, funding of instrumentation for the testing of
thermal and mechanical properties of polymers is provided.
