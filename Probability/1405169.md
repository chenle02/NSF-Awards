This project is devoted to the study of stochastic analysis in infinite
dimensions. In particular, this research will provide a better understanding of
Gaussian-type measures on infinite-dimensional curved spaces. The proposed
research is motivated by physics. For example, infinite-dimensional spaces such
as loop groups and path spaces appear in quantum field theory (QFT). The PI
proposes to formalize and study some of the notions used in physics, such as
measures on certain infinite-dimensional spaces. For example, it is common to
see computations in QFT literature involving integrals over infinite-dimensional
spaces with respect to a fictitious infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure with a
Gaussian density normalized by a constant which is infinite. Mathematically this
measure can be interpreted as a Wiener measure on a flat space, or as a heat
kernel measure on an infinite-dimensional curved space. In addition, this
research will connect diverse fields: stochastic analysis, geometric analysis,
representation theory and mathematical physics. This project is focused on
elliptic and subelliptic diffusions in infinite-dimensional curved spaces, such
as infinite-dimensional groups, loop groups and path spaces. The questions of
existence and uniqueness of solutions of the SDEs and smoothness of solutions
will be studied. In general these infinite-dimensional spaces do not have an
analogue of the Lebesgue measure or a Haar measure in the group case. In
addition, geometry of these spaces will be studied in connection with smoothness
properties of heat kernel measures in both elliptic (Riemannian) and subelliptic
(sub-Riemannian) settings. The smoothness is interpreted as a Cameron-Martin
type quasi-invariance. It is an interesting question in itself, and in addition
it can give rise to unitary representations of the infinite-dimensional groups.
One part of the proposal is devoted to studying of Brownian and energy
representations of path groups. In addition, smoothness of finite-dimensional
hypo-elliptic heat kernels will be studied. This project will use new techniques
coming from harmonic analysis on such spaces. The educational component of the
proposal is manifold: a number of projects involve graduate students of the PI;
in addition the PI is involved in mentoring and educational activities from the
middle school to postdoc levels.
