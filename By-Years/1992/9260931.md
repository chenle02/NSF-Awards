This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop an electronic raised-pin device that will provide visually-impaired
readers with a Braille interface to a computer. Such an interface represents a
significant advance beyond voice simulation systems. The tactile display device
would provide 25 lines of 40 characters each, thereby allowing the reader to
scan a block of text, moving forward, backward, and skipping over text. Previous
attempts to develop such a device have produced no more than two lines of
display, for which two- handed Braille reading is unworkable. The proposed
research would explore ways of creating high pin density without a bulky or
heavy support system or excessive current demands. The project addresses the
need for blind scientists to have a computer controlled large tactile display
enabling them to scan large amounts of information and reflect on parts of the
whole.
