This equipment will be used for several research projects, and will aid in the
analysis of proteins and organic acids. The research projects include light
scattering studies on protein folding and aggregation, effects of downstream
processing conditions on protein conformation and enzyme activity changes, and
novel separations for protein fractionation and purification. Each of these
projects require rapid and accurate analyses of the protein solution or
fermentation broth samples.
