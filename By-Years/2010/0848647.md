Since the end of the Cold War, the global resurgence of identity politics has
expressed itself in a great deal of violence. But it has also had another side:
a tendency for ethnic groups to behave ever more like corporations and to market
their cultures, both processes being deeply inscribed in the law. The objective
of this project is to investigate the conditions under which ethnic groupings
seek empowerment by incorporating themselves, by deploying their sovereign legal
status for economic ends, and by copyrighting their cultural practices,
knowledge, designs, performances as intellectual
property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve this objective, the project
undertakes a broad, comparative documentary study of manifestations of the
phenomenon, glossed as "Ethnicity, Inc.", in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Africa,
and conducts two in-depth, exemplary case studies in South Africa, where the
phenomenon is growing very rapidly. The methods used combine detailed archival
analysis of selected cases from across the world (using largely unpublished
materials) with ethnographic fieldwork (based on participant-observation and
extensive interviewing). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary questions this
project seeks to answer: Under what conditions do ethnic groups legally
incorporate themselves and become businesses? By what means and mechanisms,
legal and other, do they go about doing so? Is there any discernable
relationship between resort to ethnic business and the presence or absence of
ethnic violence? What is the effect of the commodification of cultural products
and practices on the lives of those who ?own? them, on the exercise of authority
over them, and, more generally, on ethnic group membership? In short, who
benefits, who loses? The projected importance of the study lies in its effort to
contribute to the establishment of an interdisciplinary field dedicated to the
critical study of new developments in the political economy of culture and
identity.
