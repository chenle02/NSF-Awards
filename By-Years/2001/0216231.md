This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
scanning automultiscopic 3-D visualization system. Current 3-D systems have very
limited field-of-view or require intrusive headgear with head tracking to
emulate look-around, and introduce inconsistencies between binocular convergence
and eye accommodation. This project will develop a new class of 3-D displays
based on proprietary liquid crystal scanner panels that time-sequentially
project a large number of perspective images over a wide field-of-view into the
view space in front of the display. The device will be a fully functioning full
color, high resolution 3-D display system with large screen, large look-around
field-of-view with many-perspective-image scanning at a flicker-free rate, using
a high speed video projection system.

The proposed 3-D system will be used for visualization of multidimensional
scientific and medical data, for 3-D design and simulation, training and
education of government and civilian personnel in a collaborative 3-D virtual
environment, and for telepresence and teleoperation
