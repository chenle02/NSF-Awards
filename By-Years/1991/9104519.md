This research is concerned with the geometric structure of conformal field
theory. The principal investigator will study the following topics: (1) binary
trees and the Lie bracket; (2) determinant line bundles and vertex operator
algebras; (3) a geometric proof of duality for more than two twisted elements;
(4) an abstract form of the geometric definitions of finite dimensional Lie
algebras, vertex operator algebras and higher dimensional quantum field theory;
(5) exponentiating vertex operator algebras; (6) exponentiations of vertex
operator algebras and elliptic cohomology. The research supported concerns an
important focus of current mathematical activity, where group representation
theory, quantum field theory, and algebraic geometry all come together. This
work has important implications for theoretical physics, as well as several
areas of mathematics.
