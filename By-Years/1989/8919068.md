This work will continue ongoing research concerning the construction of a theory
and the related computer algorithms for the efficient assessment of knowledge.
The key concept of the theory is that a knowledge structure, that is, a basic
set of Q of questions or problems in a given domain of information, equipped
with a distinguished family of subsets called the knowledge states. The
interpretation of these concepts is that the knowledge state of a student is the
set of all those problems in the basic set Q that the student is capable of
solving. A probabilistic version of these concepts has been developed,
permitting an analysis of the data with standard statistical techniques. The
knowledge assessment routines were developed in the framework of Markov chains
theory. The focus of this work will be the application of the theory in one
particular case, namely, the Regents Competency Test in Mathematics of June,
1987. Other aspects of the research include investigation of a number of
technical questions regarding the combination of distinct knowledge structures
and practical adaptation and implementation of knowledge assessment procedures.
