Economics faculty are participating in three day workshops to learn
instructional techniques that utilize laboratory experiments by undergraduate
students who are enrolled in principles of economics and intermediate theory
classes. These techniques demonstrate to students the basis and applicability of
economic theory and provide valuable feedback to instructors on student
perceptions of theory. Utilizing computer facilities at the Economic Science
Laboratory at the University of Arizona, the faculty participate in established
experiments and learn the techniques for designing experiments for undergraduate
instruction. The objective of the workshops is to add a new dimension to
instruction and to improve the teaching and understanding of undergraduate
economics. The workshops are being conducted during the Spring and Summer,
1991.//
