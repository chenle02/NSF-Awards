This award supports Dr. Mickey Gunter of the University of Idaho to collaborate
in geological research with Dr. Thomas Armbruster of the Laboratory for
Chemistry and Mineral Crystallography of the University of Bern, Switzerland.
They share an interest in zeolites, a mineral group with unusual internal
structure and valuable applications. Dr. Gunter's experience in mineralogy and
zeolite chemistry is complemented by Dr. Armbruster's expertise in
crystallography and the relationship of optical properties of minerals to their
crystal chemistry. In addition, Dr. Armbruster's laboratory in Bern, where the
joint work will be carried out, possesses state-of-the-art instruments and
computers that are necessary for the proposed research. In 1990, Gunter and
Armbruster performed crystal structure analysis on clinoptilolite, a mineral
form of a zeolite, at five different hydration levels. Their current plans are
to expand that work by measuring optical characteristics at various hydration
levels. These data will help them to understand the effects of water on the
optical properties of this mineral and to develop a simple method to correlate
the properties to dehydration level. This will lay the groundwork for future
optical studies on this mineral and other zeolites with different liquids
occupying the channels. Zeolites are a large mineral group with an unusual
structure comprised of channels in a framework. These channels give them
commercially important uses as "molecular sieves," for applications such as
water purification, petroleum refining, and radioactive waste treatment. For
example, the subject of the proposed joint work, clinoptilolite, can absorb
radioactive cesium and was used recently in the cleanup of Chernobyl. Very
thorough characterization of zeolites will lead to a much better understanding
of their crystal chemistry and physical properties and may make it possible to
improve the "sieving" properties of these minerals.
