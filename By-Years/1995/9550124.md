9550124 Fulton This project provides funds to initiate planning for a combined
grades 7-12 science and social studies curriculum on global change. A March
conference brings together teams to review the available materials, discuss the
role of networking in information exchange, and begin planning a statewide
global change curriculum. An April meeting of a smaller working group will write
a proposal for materials development to be submitted to the NSF. Building on
existing efforts in the state, this proposal focuses on statewide data and its
compatibility, extending the data by providing analysis and public impact
information, and team progress. Cost sharing is extensive and includes 75% from
the state.
