The lithosphere is the Earth's rocky outer shell. Lithospheric 'plates' drift
over the Earth, carrying the continents, and large earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions occur where the plates interact. Hence, understanding the lithosphere
is central to our understanding of how the Earth works. The oceanic lithosphere,
which covers some 70% of the Earth, is central to our understanding of global
geodynamics and plate tectonics, but our understanding of its character
(including composition and thickness) and the factors that control them is poor.
Variations of seismic and electrical properties of the Earth are indicators of
compositional variations. The aim of this project is to use the most up-to-date
seismic and electromagnetic methods to address two fundamental questions about
the lithosphere that lies beneath the Pacific basin: What factors control the
seismic structure of the lithosphere, and what defines the base of the
lithosphere? The broader impacts of this work include improved understanding of
factors such as the composition of the lithosphere that affect volcanic
eruptions, great earthquakes and tsunamis that threaten heavily populated areas
in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and elsewhere around the Pacific Rim.
