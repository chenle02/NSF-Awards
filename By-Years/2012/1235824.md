This project will support experimentation with the eXtensible Session Protocol
(XSP) and the Phoebus network accelerator platform across various GENI
substrates and platforms. XSP and Phoebus are innovative network initiatives
that enable improved network performance and functionality. Phoebus will provide
dramatically improved performance across networks with diverse technologies and
characteristics, including emerging ultra-high speed optical networks as well as
ubiquitous wireless networks. XSP provides the scaffolding to address the
various well-known limitations in the Internet architecture including support
for enhanced security, separation of location and identity in the routing
infrastructure, and dynamic network service qualities driven by the
user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will deploy a novel session layer
framework on a wireless testbed, as well as in a high-performance environment,
like the Supercharged PlanetLab Platform. Security mechanisms and the
performance effects of the Phoebus performance inlay will be evaluated. A novel
session rendez-vous technique will be developed. Graduate students will gain
critical research experience working on this project.
