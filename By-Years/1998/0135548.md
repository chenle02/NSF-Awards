Project Abstract SES Proposal 0135548 The Level Expert: Cornelius Vermuyden and
the Drainage of the English Fens Eric Ash, Independent Scholar

The goal of this research project is to investigate one of the largest and most
important engineering works undertaken in seventeenth-century England: the
drainage of the English fens. The research focuses primarily upon the career of
one of the principal engineers responsible for the drainage, Cornelius
Vermuyden, and his relationships with the English investors who employed him.
The construction of such large-scale drainage works (spanning parts of five
counties in eastern England) required a great deal of hydraulic expertise, a
rare and valuable commodity in early modern England. Vermuyden's expertise made
him an indispensable asset to his employers, and a key agent of London's
increasingly centralized economic and social control of the realm. Over the
course of nearly five decades, Vermuyden assisted various land speculators in
London (including the king and his advisors) in acquiring thousands of acres of
what had up until then been commonly-held fenland. He then oversaw the drastic
alteration of the lands' ecology, in return for a share of the profits resulting
from the speculation over the drained lands' increased agricultural value. In
overseeing the drainage works, Vermuyden played an important role in bringing
the fens under the more direct (and profitable) control of London administrators
and investors.

This award supports full-time archival research in the Harvard University
Libraries, with its microfilm copies of English manuscript collections,
including the State Papers Domestic and the Lansdowne Manuscripts, as well as
printed primary sources, during the summers of 2002 and 2003. The award also
supports travel to the United Kingdom to enable the PI to examine manuscript
collections at the British Library not available on microfilm. Other research
includes visits to Cambridge, East Anglia, and the Wash, the location of a
number of important seventeenth-century drainage works, in order to examine
relevant archival manuscript collections and to make a personal survey of the
former fenlands that are to be the focus of project.

The evolution of the idea of technical expertise during the early modern period
and the rise of powerful, centralized administrations in early modern European
states are both issues that have received considerable attention in recent
historiography. This project will seek to shed greater light on both stories by
uniting them through the activities of a single individual, Cornelius Vermuyden,
in whose life and career they were inextricably linked.
