Lay Abstract PI: Trimmer, Barry A. Proposal Number: IBN-9723507 The objective of
this research is to understand how reflex movements are modified and adapted for
different tasks so that they are appropriate for different behaviors. Detailed
analysis of movement is combined with electrical recordings from muscles both
before and after different training regimes. Once the changes are described, the
central nervous system mechanisms that mediate these changes are investigated by
recording the electrical activity of individual nerve cells and by manipulating
the chemical receptors on those nerve cells during behavioral training and
during sensory stimulation. This research links adaptive changes in behavior
with the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and plasticity. Its results
contribute to understanding how basic rhythmic movements, such as those involved
in walking, are modified as a result of experience so that the behavior can be
appropriately expressed in a variety of situations and challenges.
