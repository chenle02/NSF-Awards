This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of biosensors. This research is designed to develop novel
microsensors which can provide real-time information about dynamic changes in
the concentration of amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters and metabolites
which occur in the extracellular fluid of the mammalian brain. It is proposed
that these species will be detected indirectly through their interaction with
other species which produce a measureable response. Initial detection schemes
will use enzyme dehydrogenases contained within a 100-um diameter dialysis fiber
in combination with electrochemical and/or laser-induced fluorescence detection.
Such an approach should allow detection of chemical species at the subfemtomole
level. This five year continuing grant to the University of California at
Riverside for the support of Professor Kuhr as a Presidential Young Investigator
is designed to promote his rapid and effective growth as an independent
researcher in the area of analytical biosensors.
