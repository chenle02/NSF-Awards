9316066 Warner The PI has undertaken a study of the magnetic petrology of lower
crustal rocks. The general long-term goal is to increase our understanding of
lower crustal magnetization through the study of xenoliths, crustal cross
sections, etc. He will analyze xenolith samples from convergent volcanic arcs
(Aleutian and Japanese islands) and continental rift zones (Rio Grande and West
Antarctic rifts), and investigate the effects of prograde (amphibolite to
granulite facies) metamorphism in a traverse through lower crustal rocks exposed
in the Kohistan arc, Pakistan. The samples will be analyzed via a dual approach
involving magnetic property measurements (initial susceptibilities, natural and
saturation isothermal remanence, Curie points, magnetic hysteresis, etc.),
supplemented by petrographic and microprobe studies. ****
