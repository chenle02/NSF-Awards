In accordance with its proposal submitted April 18, 2003, Boston University (BU)
requests funding from the National Science Foundation over a 24-month period for
a continuing grant in the program for persons with disabilities' demonstration,
enrichment, and information dissemination (DEI) track. These funds will be used
primarily to make its existing summer biotech program more accessible to
students with disabilities. Partnering with a local non-profit group will bring
science experiences to both disabled and non-disabled students as these groups
work in tandem.
