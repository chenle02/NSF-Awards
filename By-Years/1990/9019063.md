The principal investigator will tackle the problem of structural prediction for
membrane proteins using both a synthesis of existing cross disciplinary
techniques and a new set of targets for the estimation of distribution
parameters. Membrane proteins are important in the transport of materials into
and out of cells. It is a commonly recognized goal of biochemistry to understand
function and mechanism at the molecular level in terms of structure.
