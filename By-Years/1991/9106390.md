This research program continues work in a second phase evaluation of the
performance and safety of buildings designed according to the recent provisions
recommended by the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and the Structural Engineering
Association of California (SEAOC). Research will concentrate on sensitivity of
risk to uncertainty in structural resistance, in particular the contribution of
nonstructural components; appraisal of current code procedures; and development
of alternative procedures for more risk consistent design. Additional building
types, i.e., eccentric braced frame and dual frame systems, will be studied.
Based on the results of the risk study, the Rw factors for different building
types will be carefully examined and if needed alternative values of Rw will be
commended which are more consistent with safety required for different building
types. Also, design procedures will be developed which provide a given amount of
damage control through drift limitation. Knowledge to be gained in the seismic
behavior or representative building types, cladding, and nonstructural elements
to be studied will be most positive. Results are anticipated to have an
important impact on building code development.
