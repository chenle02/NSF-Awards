This award supports a conference designed to encourage interdisciplinary work
between social scientists, demographers, and statisticians. The conference
honors the late Clifford C. Clogg, Distinguished Professor of Sociology and
Professor of Statistics, Pennsylvania State University and is co-sponsored by
the Government Statistics and Social Statistics Section of the American
Statistical Association and the Methodology Session of the American Sociological
Association. The conference will have invited sessions in the important areas of
Labor Force Demography, Demographic Methodology, Latent Variable Models in
Social Science, Official Statistics, Categorical Data Analysis, Mixture Models,
Analysis of Missing Data, and Model Selection Indices and Strategies. In
addition, contributed sessions and poster sessions allow new researchers to
share their research with the invited participants and other attendees, and will
provide a unique opportunity for continuing existing collaborations and
stimulating new interactions between these disciplines.
