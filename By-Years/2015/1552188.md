The effects of the solar eclipse in 2017 on the ionosphere will be studied using
a combination of GPS receivers, the SuperDARN radar system, HF-band amateur
radio, and plasma modeling. The large array of information to be used will
include data accumulated by amateur radio operators, and involve graduate
students and the Virginia Tech amateur radio club as well as the American Radio
Relay League (ARRL). Analysis of this information is expected to constrain
models and enrich our understanding of ionospheric behavior. &lt;br/&gt; The
long path length over US soil of the 2017 eclipse affords an exceptional
opportunity to focus significant diagnostic capabilities on the ionospheric
effects of eclipses. Details of E and F-region variability will be exposed, and
the natural laboratory provided by the eclipse will be used to study geophysical
plasma diffusion, convective motion, and production of irregularities and waves.
In coordination with more quantitative data from other sources, the amateur
radio data will be used to constrain models in order to reconstruct the temporal
evolution of the plasma density and the spatial extent of eclipse effects on the
ionosphere.
