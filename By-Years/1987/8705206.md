Researchers at U of Texas-Dallas will purchase a 32-node hypercube computer for
development of new tools for parallel computation. Both theoretical and
experimental work is planned. Central topics include: (1) Design,
implementation, and analysis of parallel algorithms in various fields. (2)
Development of efficient communication protocols for communicating with
independent processors and algorithms for optimum assignment of tasks to
processors. (3) Study of new parsing techniques and languages for parallel
processing. This is an important research area, in which support is recommended.
