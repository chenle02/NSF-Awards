ABSTRACT Most, if not all, languages have constructions which require 'negative
licensing', constructions whose occurence depends on the appearance of an
expression of negation somewhere else in the clause. This project explores the
phenomenon of Negative Licensing in several languages with differing clause
structures, highlighting the differences in Negative Licensing which follow from
the different ways in which these languages express the universal semantic and
pragmatic category of negation. The Research provides a fruitful testing-ground
for current theories of the relationship between the syntactic structure of a
sentence and its semantic structure. There is considerable evidence that much of
the crosslinguistic variation in Negative Licensing phenomena can be attributed
to the surface position of negation in different languages. The investigators
use the pattern of Negative Licensing as a probe in the investigation of the
role played by the negation-element in the syntactic organization of the clause.
The project will result in detailed analyses of the system of negation in
several dialects of English, in Irish, and in several other languages in
addition to increasing our general understanding of the typology of clause
structure in the languages of the world.
