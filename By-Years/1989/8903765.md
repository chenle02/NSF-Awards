This project, part of the Physical Chemistry Program, deals with the reaction
dynamics of polyatomic ions which have been prepared with excitation in selected
vibrational modes. The goal of the project is to develop an understanding of the
effects of different modes of nuclear motion on reactivity in polyatomic
systems. A novel flexible ion guide will be constructed which avoids the usual
problems and expense associated with conventional instruments in which the
entire detector assembly is rotated. The reagent ions will be prepared by
multiphoton ionization through Rydberg intermediate states. Integral cross
section measurements will be used to survey new reactive systems, and to
determine accurate vibrational and collision energy dependences and branching
ratios.
