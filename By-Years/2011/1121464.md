This effort is conducting a workshop to create a broad-based characterization
&amp; measurement of the technological literacy of American undergraduates and
the potential effectiveness of technological literacy courses. The workshop is
utilizing and refining existing assessment tools to: 1) measure increases in
technological literacy for undergraduates; 2) develop new shared assessment
tools &amp; related standard learning outcomes; 3) investigate how increased
technological literacy impacts actions &amp; attitudes; and 4) identify factors
that promote the institutionalization of technological literacy courses. The
combined results will help create a means to characterize and measure the
technological literacy of American undergraduates and gauge the potential
effectiveness of technological literacy courses.
