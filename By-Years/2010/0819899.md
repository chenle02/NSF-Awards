Critical infrastructure industries have received increased attention for their
susceptibility to domestic hazards, including natural, technological, and
terrorism events. Critical infrastructure industries provide supportive
resources for the U.S. economy, national security, public health and safety. In
a crisis or disaster, a failure in one critical industry can have cascading
effects on the others, hindering emergency response and community recovery. The
challenge is to understand what factors motivate, facilitate, and hinder
workplace adoption of disaster-protective behaviors. Effective workplace
preparedness is more than a business continuity plan. An effective plan factors
in the perceived hazard susceptibility, efficacy of risk-reduction measures,
social network influences, and characteristics of management and employees. This
study explores these factors within an occupational health and safety model to
understand how social influences, threat appraisal, and decision making interact
to influence the adoption of disaster-protective behaviors.

Data collection will include key informant interviews, and management and
employee questionnaires with private, critical infrastructure industries in
Southern California. Private industries, unlike the public sector, receive
little federal assistance in workforce preparedness; therefore, implementing
protective actions in the private sector are contingent upon corporate threat
appraisal and decision making. The private sector also employs 76% of the U.S.
workforce and, in a disaster, employee availability is critical to providing
communities with the necessary goods, services, and revenue for recovery. This
makes the private sector also an optimal environment to assess whether workplace
protective measures influence employees? home-readiness plans with the potential
of diffusing these preparedness behaviors into the greater community.
