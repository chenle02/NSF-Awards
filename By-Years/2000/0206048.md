AST-0206048&lt;br/&gt;Crotts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernova 1987A, the closest
SN seen in nearly four centuries, and the most intensely&lt;br/&gt;studied ever,
is rapidly turning into a SN remnant as the ejecta from the explosion
now&lt;br/&gt;strikes the circumstellar envelope shed by the star over the last
million years. We propose&lt;br/&gt;to observe this process using a combination
of optical, IR and UV programs, plus further&lt;br/&gt;space-based studies
(supported by NASA). These will allow us to map the structure of&lt;br/&gt;the
envelope, both in its unperturbed state and as it is destroyed by the ejecta.
This&lt;br/&gt;will allow the first complete study of SN remnant formation
evolution ever undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;Our previous observations of the 3-D
structure, velocities, density and composition will&lt;br/&gt;establish the
nature of the pre-explosion nebula and the mass loss processes that created
it,&lt;br/&gt;while the excitation of this nebula by the X and EUV flux created
in the collision will allow&lt;br/&gt;us to re-analyze it once more. In addition
to these unprecedented studies of a SN remnant,&lt;br/&gt;will continue to use
light echoes from the SN explosion to explore the interstellar&lt;br/&gt;medium
in the 30 Doradus star-formation region, to study the echo of the UV pulse
from&lt;br/&gt;SN shock breakout through the progenitor star's surface, and to
accurately determine the&lt;br/&gt;distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud { a
fundamental rung on the extragalactic distance&lt;br/&gt;ladder.&lt;br/&gt;***
