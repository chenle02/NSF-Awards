This project improves two undergraduate laboratory courses, Ecology and
Molecular Biology, offered by the Department of Biology. Central to the proposal
is the use of computers in analyzing data obtained from field studies in the
ecology lab and from nucleic acid sequences in the molecular lab. The project
provides students with a modern experimental approach to the study of two very
fundamental areas in biology. Equipment necessary to upgrade the molecular
biology lab to include nucleic acid experimental manipulation is also being
obtained.
