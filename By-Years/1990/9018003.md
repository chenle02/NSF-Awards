The long-range goal of this research is to identify, clone, and sequence genes
encoding allorecognition determinants from the colonial hydroid, Hydractinia.
Work to date has shown the feasibility of producing isogenic colonies which
differ in their histocompatibility responses. During this grant period, the
applicants propose to: 1) continue ongoing analysis of the transmission genetics
of fusibility in this hydroid, 2) produce, in bulk, tissues from isogenic
colonies which differ in their fusibility responses, and 3) generate cDNA
libraries from these tissues. This effort will yield the materials necessary to
pursue subtractive hybridization as a strategy for isolating the genes of
interest. It is well known that vertebrate animals have well developed immune
mechanisms for rejection of foreign tissues, but little is known about such
mechanisms in invertebrates. The proposed research represents a collaborative
effort between an invertebrate zoologist and a molecular immunologist. Their
ultimate goal is to accomplish the first unambiguous characterization of the
molecules involved in an invertebrate self-recognition (tissue-type) response.
The results of this research ultimately should resolve the long- standing
question of the phylogenetic relationships of invertebrate and vertebrate self-
recognition and immune-like defense responses.
