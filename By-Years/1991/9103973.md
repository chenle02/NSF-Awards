This research will focus on interactions of phospholipases A1, A2, and
phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C(PI-PLC) with lipid membrane
systems. These enzymes play key roles in the production of bioactive lipids
(prostaglandins, leukotrienes, platelet activating factor), in signal
transduction across membranes, and the release of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-
anchored proteins from membranes. Major points to be addressed are the
mechanisms of action, substrate specificities, interactions with lipid
interfaces, and the nature of the activation by the lipid interface. Kinetics
will be studied using thiolester substrate analogs in continuous
spectrophotometric assay systems with mixed- micelles of detergent and
substrate, with vesicles of anionic phospholipids, and in monolayer systems.
Protein-lipid interactions will be studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, and by
penetration of proteins into monolayers of non-hydrolyzable phospholipids. The
kinetics of recombinant PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus will be studied in micellar
systems using a continuous spectrophotometric assay with thiophosphate ester
substrate analogs. Minimal substrate requirements will be determined. A
comparison of phosphoinositide phosphotransferase (production of inositol
1,2-cyclophosphate) and inositol 1,2-cyclophosphate phosphohydrolase (production
of inositol-1phosphate) activities will be made. Recombinant hepatic lipase
(phospholipase A1) and mutants (at the putative lipid-binding and active sites),
and recombinant placental phospholipase A2 will also be studied. //
