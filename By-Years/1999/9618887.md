This research in gesture, speech and gaze investigates automatic discourse
segmentation of multimodal communication data. The goal is to discern discourse
structure from video and voice analysis of data that one can legitimately expect
from common video and its audio track. The research will address the
interpretation of gesture, speech, and gaze in discourse management, utilizing
psycholinguistic models to explain how these modalities combine to express
discourse structure; specifically, by developing algorithms for recognizing
'catchments' as empirically grounded thematic segments based on the partial
recurrence of prosodic, gaze and gesture features during natural discourse. The
research will be integrated into a hierarchical model that is both amenable to
computational implementation and reflective of human communicative realities.
The approach involves experiments designed to discover and quantify cues in the
various modalities, and their relation with respect to discourse management; the
development of computational algorithms to detect and recognize such cues; and
the integration of these cues into a cogent discourse management system. The
team, comprising psycholinguistic, machine vision and signal processing
researchers, gains strength from its interdisciplinary scope. Technology
developed will have significant impact on natural language understanding, human-
computer interaction, and discourse and video databases.
