This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a mass spectrometer
to be installed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at San
Diego State University. The University is committed to providing the remaining
funds needed. San Diego State University's Department of Geological Sciences has
a strong training program for undergraduates and up to the master's level that
includes practical work with advanced geochemical techniques. The Department
also has made several recent appointments in isotope geochemistry (the PI and
co-PI of this award), and the University has put considerable resources in
establishing an Institute of Isotope Geochemistry. The research projects of the
PI and co-PI are supported by NSF and other agencies and require the analytical
capabilities of a modern mass spectrometer. The instrument will also be used in
two laboratory courses open to undergraduate students (Isotope Geochemistry and
Groundwater Geochemistry). This award is made under the auspices of the NSF
program Research in Undergraduate Institutions.
