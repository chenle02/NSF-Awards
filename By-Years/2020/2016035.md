An award is made to the University of Arizona to developed a hyperspectral light
sheet microscopy technique for live 3D imaging of multiple markers in cells,
tissue and embryos. The broad goal of this project is to promote cross-
disciplinary education in bioimaging, educate imaging science among students,
especially those with biological and biomedical background and underrepresented
minorities in the STEM field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific research
component of the project aims to advance imaging techniques in the biological
and biomedical field for the study of the fundamental Rules of Life. The
research will greatly advance the multiplexing ability of live 3D imaging and
allow the study of complex biological processes in their native setting. The
imaging tool developed in this research will be disseminated through scientific
publications, workshops, conferences and open-source sharing of system designs
and software. This research will provide a path to study new biological
questions that are not possible to study before, which in turn will advance our
understanding on development, disease progression etc. and provide guidance for
developing treatments and improving human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
