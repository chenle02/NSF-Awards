This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
problem of new non-destructive testing methods. The research will try to develop
a smart composite based on inductive coupling. Objectives include successful
integration of magnetic material into the composite without causing delamination
and successful transmission of the signal out of the composite. The result will
be a low-cost alternative to embedding sensors in composites and will be geared
especially for thick composites.

Commercial applications may include all types of composites where monitoring is
important. This technology will be especially useful for civil structures where
thickness of composites has often limited monitoring in the past.
