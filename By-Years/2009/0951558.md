In this study, the PIs are analyzing data recorded by the hundreds of
seismometers that constitute USArray; however, instead of studying signals from
earthquakes, the PIs are analyzing seismic energy that is created by the
interference and interaction of ocean waves. This process generates an ambient
field of background noise, often referred to as microseisms, that can be used to
image Earth's interior, and to detect changes in Earth structure related to
volcanic and tectonic processes. In particular, the PIs are using the USArray as
a giant, seismic antenna to locate and characterize microseismic sources
throughout the world's oceans. Interestingly, many of the source regions occur
in the deep waters of ocean basins, far away from the reflecting coastlines that
are traditionally considered to be the dominant source of microseisms. Analysis
of microseismic energy from these deep water sources has the potential to
illuminate those portions of Earth's interior that are poorly sampled by
earthquakes, which overwhelming occur in narrow belts along the boundaries of
tectonic plates.
