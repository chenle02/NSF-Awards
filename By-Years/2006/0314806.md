The Mathematics and Science Partnership of Greater Philadelphia (MSPGP) focuses
on improving secondary mathematics and science, grades 6-12, in an "open loop"
environment typical of sprawling, densely-populated greater metropolitan areas
containing hundreds of school districts and dozens of institutions of higher
education. In an effort to build the required linkages that address issues such
as bringing strong local successes to scale and preventing program erosion over
time, the MSPGP brings together as core partners 46 school districts and 13
institutions of higher education in eight Pennsylvania and four New Jersey
counties in the region outside of Philadelphia. The MSPGP model includes a "Core
Connector" organizational structure that provides a way to facilitate and grow
partnerships between grades 6-12 teachers and administrators and faculty from
higher educational institutions. To assess the progress of mathematics and
science programs and college/university preservice programs, the MSPGP uses
five-stage "On the Road to Reform" rubrics and customizes project activities to
each circumstance depending on where any particular partner is on the journey.
