The objective of this work is to develop adaptive software cache management
techniques that will allow programs written for shared memory multiprocessors to
be executed efficiently on distributed memory machines. These techniques will
facilitate a system that overcomes the architectural limitations of shared
memory machines, while maintaining their advantages in terms of ease of
programming. Translation from the shared memory programming model to the
distributed memory hardware is done by runtime software, with the aid of hints
provided by the user or by the compiler. The runtime system implements an
adaptive cache coherence mechanism that exploits semantic information about the
expected or observed access behavior of particular data objects. Preliminary
measurements on a adaptive caching outperforms static cache coherence
mechanisms, while extracting only limited cost when coherence is implemented in
software. These experiments will be extended to include a broad range of
programs.
