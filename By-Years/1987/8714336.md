The theme of this conference is the variety of interactions between algebraic
K-theory and dynamics which have been emerging over several years. The aim is to
bring together workers in dynamics and K-theory/topology of manifolds so that
common interests may be explored and new problems on the borderline between
these subjects may be proposed and considered. This conference will provide the
first unified account of the important work of F. T. Farrell and L. E. Jones on
the K-theory of nonpositively curved manifolds and related problems. F. T.
Farrell of Columbia University will be the principal speaker and will deliver a
series of ten lectures.
