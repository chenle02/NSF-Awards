John Beem will continue his research in Lorentzian geometry. This is an area of
differential geometry which provides the mathematical foundations of relativity.
It involves the study of indefinite or Lorentzian metrics in place of the more
usual Riemannian metrics. Beem will study conditions which imply the stability
of geodesic incompleteness. This has already been studied in the context of
certain big bang models. He will also investigate the influence of
pseudoconvexity on geodesic systems. Pseudoconvexity arises in the global
solvability of pseudodifferential equations and is useful in geometry as an
internal form of completeness.
