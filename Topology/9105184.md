Mary Ellen Rudin has exercised enormous influence on the field of set-theoretic
topology, especially since the publication of her lectures on the subject at a
regional conference of the American Mathematical Society in 1972. The occasion
of her retirement - merely from teaching, not from research or the communication
of knowledge - provides an opportunity to reflect on where the field has been,
where it is, and where it should be going. The mechanism proposed is a
conference at which many of the invited speakers will discuss precisely these
questions for the subfields in which Rudin has been significantly involved.
These comprise a large fraction of the entire field of general topology. Rudin's
1972 lectures set the agenda for set-theoretic topology for more than 10 years;
this conference, dedicated to Mary Ellen Rudin and her work, to be held at the
University of Wisconsin in June, 1991, should have a similarly stimulating
effect.
