A continuation of the study of evolution of Indian Oceanmonsoon and Arabian Sea
upwelling. The record of the development of this system will be extended from
the present 1 m.y.B.P. to 3.5 m.y.B.P. in order to determine the relative
importance of solar radiation, uplift and glaciation for the monsoonal system.
Modelling results for the same interval will be compared to faunal and isotopic
results to test the influence of global climate models and compare these records
with those from Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
