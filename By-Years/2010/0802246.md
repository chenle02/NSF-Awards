&lt;br/&gt;The sieve theory offers tools for selecting subsequences of
particular interest from a larger sequence which is typically more accessible by
other means. For example in the recent developments prime numbers were captured
in polynomial values of degree four. The proposal goes further to solve problems
not only concerning prime numbers but also for solving some diophantine
equations and estimating the rational points on some cubic surfaces. In more
theoretical aspects of sieve theory the goal of the Proposal is to investigate
the intrinsic limitations of the methods (parity barrier of sieve) and to find
ways to break these limits. Sieve ideas when enhanced with arguments of harmonic
analysis (spectral methods) become powerful and versatile tools which can even
exceed the capability of the Grand Riemann Hypothesis. The Proposal makes a few
suggestions in this direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sieve methods turned out to
be very attractive for researchers working in cryptography. Although this
project does not address such applications directly, it seems likely that
advances in the theory of sieves will open new possibilities. The implementation
of Fourier analysis to sieve methods creates a lot of demand in modern harmonic
analysis and will certainly have valuable impact on shaping the latter. These
developments in the interface of combinatorial ideas and analysis will be quite
inspiring for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
