It is generally recognized that protecting online privacy is important, with
modern society manifesting this concern in many ways. Preliminary research
indicates that third parties, with modest crawling and computational resources,
and employing simple data mining heuristics, can potentially combine online
services and publicly available information to create detailed profiles of the
users living in any targeted geographical area.

This research investigates measures that can significantly improve privacy
protection of users, while not degrading their overall Internet experience. The
focus is on less-trustworthy third parties (e.g., data brokers, advertisers,
spammers, malware distributors, and pedophiles), who can scrape, aggregate and
infer information from many different online and offline sources. This research
has two interrelated research thrusts. First, it explores to what extent third
parties can collect, aggregate, and statistically process information from OSNs
and other online and offline sources to create profiles. This thrust is
developing rigorous statistical methodologies and probabilistic models for
estimating the degree of potential privacy leakage. Second, this research
investigates a variety of privacy policies that governments can establish, and a
wide range of measures OSNs can take, to reduce the privacy risk. For promising
combinations of policies and measures, this research quantifies the trade-off
between privacy protection and usability.
