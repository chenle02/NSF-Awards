This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer
of capacitor technology, derived from The Center for Dielectrics and
Piezoelectrics expertise and discoveries in new insulating materials. Our glass
capacitor technology has market-valued features including miniaturization and
high-temperature operation. These features provide more compact and reliable
power conversion systems in electric vehicles and higher temperature electric
systems for energy exploration when compared to the leading polymer film
capacitors in this market space. This glass capacitor technology is important
because it will lead to higher performance, lower cost and more reliable hybrid
electric and plug-in electric vehicles.

The innovation ecosystem that will be enhanced includes Penn State University,
PolyK and the Department of Energy. Penn State provides fundamental process and
property knowledge of glass materials. PolyK is a startup company with a focus
on the development and commercialization of advanced dielectric materials and
smart materials. The Department of Energy Office of Vehicle Technologies
supports industry and national labs in the development of power electronics for
hybrid vehicles. The potential economic impact is expected to be the development
of new high-temperature capacitors over the next three years. Graduate and
undergraduate students will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation
experience through learning about the supply chain from materials to components
to systems. In addition, students will learn about the intellectual property
process from the invention disclosure to the issued patent.

This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from
research discovery toward commercial application. This project will establish
the scientific and engineering foundations to deliver power electronic
capacitors with high energy densities and reliable operation under harsh
environments. Over the past decade, the display industry has revolutionized the
production of thin glass sheet by down-draw methods. A quite unexpected
application has been found for thin glass dielectrics in the energy conversion
arena. The research challenge for new energy storage materials can be distilled
into a single figure-of-merit energy density, which captures the vital materials
parameters of relative permittivity and dielectric breakdown strength (electric
field). Recently, it has been discovered that glass has among the highest energy
densities (up to 35 J/cm3) among all dielectric materials, which will allow for
significant capacitor miniaturization. Glass becomes very flexible as the
thickness decreases to the point where roll-to-roll processes becomes possible
for manufacturing capacitors.
