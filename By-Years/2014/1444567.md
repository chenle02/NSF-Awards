Dogwoods have long been cultivated for their showy flowers and fine-grained
wood. Recently, the market value of dogwoods and related hydrangeas has
increased as demand for woody ornamentals grows in the U.S. To advance the
breeding potential of these economically and culturally important trees and
shrubs, scientists can use genetics and advanced genomics to study critical
agronomic traits such as flower characteristics, disease resistance and stress
responses. New sequencing methods will be combined in this project to produce
the first genome sequences for dogwoods and hydrangeas, allowing the research
team to identify new markers and tools for breeding traits of interest. The team
will study how some cultivars of flowering dogwood are resistant to damaging
diseases such as powdery mildew. This information will be important to the
nursery industry and will advance the broader understanding of how plant
families have adapted and responded to diseases over time. The project will
train students, teachers and breeders, and will reach out to the public by
engaging citizen scientists to collect data on bud-break and flowering times for
dogwoods in the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will generate a
high-Â­quality reference genome assembly and annotation for flowering dogwood
(Cornus florida) cultivar Appalachian Spring. This resource, along with genome
sequence and gene space assemblies for Asian kousa dogwood (C. kousa) and
Hydrangea macrophylla, transcriptome atlases and high-density genetic markers,
will provide a foundation for research and marker-assisted breeding for
dogwoods, hydrangeas and other woody ornamentals. As members of the Cornales,
dogwoods and hydrangea occupy a strategic position in the angiosperm phylogeny.
Establishing sequences and analytical methods for the flowering dogwood genome
will be an ideal catalyst for advancing comparative genomics across other
angiosperm woody ornamentals, including members of the Asteraceae, Solanaceae
and Convolvulaceae. In addition, the project will investigate the molecular
basis of powdery mildew resistance through comparative analyses of mRNA and
microRNA expression profiles in resistant and susceptible accessions of C.
florida and C. kousa. All genome sequences and other data will be made available
through the National Center of Biological Information (NCBI), the iPlant
Collaborative http://www.iplantcollaborative.org and the Dryad Digital
Repository http://datadryad.org.
