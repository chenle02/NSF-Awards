satisfaction and employment attachment of clergy in two Protestant denominations
(United Church of Christ and Christian Church). Previous research has found
three explanations for sources of job satisfaction and attachment of clergy
employed in parish ministry. These include: (1) internal satisfaction--clergy
have a strong service orientation and are responding to a "higher calling" to
the ministry, (2) internal and external satisfaction--along with internal
satisfaction there is the external family support and congregational paternalism
involving discretionary benefits, and (3) professional model--the clergy are
employees of organizations and work conditions influence job satisfaction and
attachment like any other employees. This research will empirically assess these
validity of the three explanations through developing an integrated model of
clergy satisfaction and attachment that combines variables from all three. Data
will be collected through a mail survey of a probability sample of approximately
2,400 clergy.
