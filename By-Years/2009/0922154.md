"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decision analysis
offers a system for helping decision makers understand, assess, and model their
preferences. It assumes, however, that people's preferences are coherent and
unique. Psychologists and behavioral economists have documented a variety
circumstances in which people's choices exhibit biases and inconsistencies
particularly when they face novel decision situations. Similar inconsistencies
arise when decision analysts work with decision makers to assess their
preferences and trade-offs, because the methods the analyst uses are often
unfamiliar to the decision makers. In these kinds of situations, decision makers
in a sense "construct" their preferences. Because the construction process can
depend to a great extent on the particular questions posed by the analyst, a
variety of different biases can arise. Those biases can be amplified in novel
decision domains for which the decision maker's preferences are still maturing.
&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to understand the interplay between
learning about one's preferences in novel domains and learning about the process
of assessing one's preferences. Laboratory experiments will provide a basis for
developing a behavioral model of the preference-assessment process. In turn, the
model will show how to create methods that allow an analyst to assist a decision
maker in learning about and expressing his or her preferences in a consistent
way in new situations while avoiding biases due to the questions and approaches
used. These methods will be field tested in the context of deciding how to
