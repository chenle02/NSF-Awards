The storage and transmission of digital information is now ubiquitous in our
society and plays a valuable role in the modern information-technology
infrastructure. Error-correcting codes are a key part of infrastructure
components that efficiently and reliably store and transmit digital information.
Spatial coupling is a new technique for designing error-correcting codes that
has been shown in some cases to achieve near-optimal performance with low-
complexity decoding. This research focuses on the design and analysis of
innovative techniques for the storage and transmission of digital information
based on spatially-coupled codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is broken
into three broad thrusts. The first thrust focuses on generalizing recent proof
techniques for spatially-coupled codes to include a wide class of inference
problems on spatially-coupled graphical models. The second thrust considers the
design of universal spatially-coupled codes for multiuser communication problems
including the noisy Slepian-Wolf problem and multiple-access communication. The
third thrust targets source and channel coding problems with side information
and focuses on nested spatially-coupled codes with enhanced message-passing
decoding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial coupling also appears to be a general
principle that is broadly applicable to problems involving message passing and
inference on factor graphs. Therefore, this research is expected to have an
impact on science and engineering disciplines beyond communications such as
signal processing and machine learning.
