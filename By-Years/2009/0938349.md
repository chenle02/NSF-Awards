Continuing support is provided for the international oceanographic activities of
the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) that are relevant to U.S.
interests in marine sciences and the Division of Ocean Sciences. Support of
these international activities through SCOR began in 1987. The SCOR provides an
international, interdisciplinary, non-governmental focus for ocean research and
makes it possible for national ocean science communities to (1) participate in
international research projects, (2) identify important ocean science issues and
create working groups to address the issues, and (3) participate in capacity-
building activities (40% of SCOR national committees are based in developing
countries).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds provided by NSF for the activities of
international Scientific Steering Committees (SSCs) of large-scale ocean
research projects ensure SCOR oversight of these projects in terms of SSC
membership, terms of reference, and scientific directions and progress. The
proposed support from NSF is especially important for SCOR involvement in and
oversight of the major ocean projects. Funding is requested for partial support
of the SSCs of the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) project, the Surface
Ocean ? Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS), the Global Ecology and Oceanography of
Harmful Algal Blooms (GEOHAB) program, the Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and
Ecosystem Research (IMBER) project, and the GEOTRACES project. These activities
also are supported by other international and national sponsors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These major programs
have origins in U.S. and have turned to SCOR to provide a forum for
international planning and coordination. SCOR's impact has and will continue to
be evident in the standardization of measurement protocols, sharing of data,
coordination of ship time, and the enlargement of field studies which would be
impossible without international coordination.&lt;br/&gt;
