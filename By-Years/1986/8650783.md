The gathering of quality local weather data for undergraduate classroom and
student project work has been enhanced by the acquisition of additional new
equipment including surface and upper-air wind observing equipment, vertical
temperature profile observing equipment, and atmospheric long-wave radiation
emission observing equipment. Undergraduate science education is improved
through demonstrations and direct experience with field work, thus affording a
better understanding of atmospheric processes.
