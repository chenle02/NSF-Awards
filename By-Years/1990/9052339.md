This award provides funds to the Political Science Department at the University
of Iowa to help purchase equipment to support a computer classroom which takes
advantage of the confluence of advances in high speed microcomputers, advances
in graphical capabilities for data analysis, and advances in interactive
educational software to provide individualized, interactive instruction in
quantitative analysis. This approach to teaching undergraduates political
science is grounded in the understanding that student interest in technical
tools does not emerge in a substantive vacuum; rather, it emerges as an offshoot
from a desire to answer a real-world problems posed by the discipline. Both the
initial interest in technical knowledge and the subsequent enthusiasm for its
utility are intimately tied to the substance of political problems "discovered"
by students. Hence, the Department is intent on keeping this technical education
in the courses where those problems are in point. The computer classroom should
launch many students on an intellectual voyage of discovery, a voyage where
their new technical knowledge could permit them to study politics and public
policy in ways previously beyond their reach. The grantee is matching this award
with non-Federal sources.
