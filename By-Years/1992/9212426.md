Cells in the brain communicate with one another by releasing chemical
messengers, called neurotransmitters, which activate specific receptors on the
next cell. Understanding the brain thus requires a knowledge of the identity and
function of these neurotransmitters. Yet, despite thirty years of research on
the mammalian visual pathway, the neurotransmitters used by the cells remain
largely unknown. Receptors for the excitatory amino acids are involved in this
neurotransmission, but evidence suggests that neither of the obvious candidates,
aspartate or glutamate is the neurotransmitter. N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG)
is an endogenous brain peptide that acts at an excitatory amino acid receptor.
Evidence is mounting that NAAG may be a neurotransmitter for retinal ganglion
cells. Dr. Tieman's experiments are directed at this question. The lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) is one of the areas of the brain that receives input
from the eye. Dr. Tieman will examine the responses of LGN neurons to
stimulation of the input from the eye and to direct application of NAAG. If NAAG
is the neurotransmitter, then these responses should be the same.
Immunocytochemistry is a technique that uses antibodies to localize specific
chemical compounds in brain. Dr. Tieman will use this technique for NAAG
combined with a variety of other techniques, such as electron microscopy, to
better characterize both the cells that contain NAAG and NAAG's distribution
within these neurons. For example, if NAAG is the neurotransmitter for retinal
ganglion cells, then it should be localized at the synapse, which is part of the
cell that is specialized for communicating with the next cell. Results obtained
from these experiments should help to clarify NAAG's role in the visual system
and provide a better understanding of intercellular communication in the
brain.***//
