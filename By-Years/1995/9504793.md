This project will culture benthic foraminifera to determine what the
environmental variables affect the uptake of trace elements (Ba and Cd) into the
shell. Three genera used for paleoenvironmental analysis will be studied, with
experiments to examine the effects of bottom water chemistry, growth rate,
alkalinity, pressure, and depth in the sediment.
