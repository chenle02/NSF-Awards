Theoretical modeling and numerical simulation is to be applied to three areas
in river morphology: incisional channel networks in cohesive soils, formation
and finite-amplitude stability of sediment bedforms formed by flows over them,
and sediment grain size sorting from flow shear and pressure forces. Sediment
transport and river configurations are an important element in a variety of
Civil Engineering and environmental problems.
