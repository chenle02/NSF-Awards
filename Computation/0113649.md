This project develops a new technique for estimation of the state of a
stochastic dynamical system, given some partial and imperfect information from
measurements. Unlike traditional linear estimation methods, such as least-
squares variational methods or Kalman Filter approach, this new technique is
capable of handling highly nonlinear dynamics--and thus non-Gaussian
statistics-- in a way that approaches the optimality of the formally exact
solution by Kushner, Stratonovitch, Pardoux (KSP). Just as KSP, the new method
computes the conditional statistics of the system given the measurements.
However, when applied to problems of interest in information technology, such as
large-scale geoscience or environmental data assimilation, the new method does
not lead to functional stochastic equations that are hopelessly intractable to
solve, as does KSP. The approach pursued in this project is instead to
approximate the conditional statistics by means of a variational formulation,
which yields the conditional mean as the minimizer of an appropriate cost
function and the covariance as its Hessian. The cost function proposed is
calculated by a Rayleigh-Ritz or moment-closure scheme, which should render the
problem tractable to numerical computation. The main research that will be done
is to develop suitable statistical techniques to model the system for the
Rayleigh-Ritz calculation, to work out efficient algorithms for the numerical
optimization of the cost function, and to compare with existing suboptimal
estimation schemes. In many areas of the geosciences of practical importance, it
is crucial to combine information from observations with the results of a
sophisticated numerical model to produce the best estimate of the past or future
state of the system. In the case of a chemical or radioactive spill observed by
monitoring a few well sites, one wants to track the contaminant plume backward
in time to its source. This must be accomplished with only statistical knowledge
about the properties of the aquifer and groundwater flow field and with the
measurements themselves subject to error. In numerical weather prediction, the
goal is instead to combine the latest observations from satellite arrays with
the output of large-scale, meteorological computer models to predict the future
state of the weather. Again, the models contain stochastic or chaotic elements
which prevent perfect prediction based upon partial and imperfect information.
The modeling methods and numerical algorithms developed in this project should
provide a practical scheme to compute the best estimate in the face of such
randomness in the model and uncertainty in the observations.
