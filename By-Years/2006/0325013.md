&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to develop and implement a middleware
that allows mining and analysis of distributed data. The research will address
an increasing interest in the exploration and mining of the large volume of data
that is generated by the business, scientific, engineering, academic and defense
communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel techniques will be developed in the
following areas:&lt;br/&gt;Data and Policy Management Services: These services
will provide organizational level access restriction capabilities for the owners
of the data while allowing users to access a more efficient transport of
data.&lt;br/&gt;Data Mining and Exploration Services: This framework will
include a library of data mining tools that will work effectively for example
if: data is distributed on multiple sites, the user has varying privileges
depending on what site they are accessing, a user wants to trade off computing
time versus accuracy or a user wants to access the site
remotely.&lt;br/&gt;Scheduling and Replication Services: System administration
will be based upon policies at the participating organizations and their
established privileges for users. Computation and data will be scheduled jointly
to optimize metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This combination of distributed
computing and data mining will be made widely available to students,
researchers, and other interested groups in government, industry and education.
