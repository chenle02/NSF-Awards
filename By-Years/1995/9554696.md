"Enhancement of Faculty Design Capabilities" proposes a series of design
education workshops and a National Conference on Engineering Design and Design
Education. The two-week summer workshops, to be held in 1996 and 1997 at
Southern Methodist University, are offered for all engineering disciplines and
faculty that intend to or are presently teaching design in engineering courses
to undergraduate students. The workshops strive to address needs of faculty from
two-year and four-year institutions who teach non-design, or engineering
science, courses and desire to include design into the course work. Topics
addressed in the workshops include design methodologies, design content, design
constraints, design tools, and teaching design through a multifaceted format
using lectures, laboratory sessions, discussion sessions, and industrial tours.
Participants will develop a design plan, design problems, design projects, and
design case studies while working individually, in single-discipline teams, and
in multi-discipline teams. Faculty leaving the workshop will have a design plan,
design materials for courses, a plan of implementation at the home institution,
ald a network of design faculty with whom to interact. These workshops will
guide faculty to a different way of thinking, a freshened approach to processes
and procedures of design synthesis. It is anticipated that the National
Conference on Engineering Design and Design Education to be held in Spring, 1997
will mark the creation of a continuing forum for exchange of ideas between
engineers and educators on engineering design and design education which can be
continued on a two-year cycle.
