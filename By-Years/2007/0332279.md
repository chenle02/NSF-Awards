This project is an NSF sponsored CBMS conference on the subject of graph
C*-algebras, featuring Professor Iain Raeburn as the principal lecturer, to be
hosted by the University of Iowa during the week, May 31 to&lt;br/&gt;June 4,
2004. Graph C*-algebras have played a very important role in operator algebra
during the last 20 years. During the past 10 years, the subject has blossomed
substantially. Graph algebras and the technology&lt;br/&gt;surrounding them
appear in almost every aspect of operator algebra. The theory of graph
C*-algebras has achieved a certain level of maturity and organization that makes
this a propitious moment to collect in one place a presentation of it and to
give a general survey of their wide impact. Further, the basic theory of graph
C*-algebras is now very much accessible to graduate students and other novice
researchers in the field. The CBMS conference is intended to attract a large
array of young mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
