Western Illinois University is creating a Macintosh equipped
classroom/laboratory to be used with Maple-based curricula materials in calculus
and linear algebra. These materials, which utilize the computer algebra system
Maple, have been piloted in experimental sections of calculus with good results.
The faculty are revising and expanding the curricular materials. More students
are now being included in the laboratory approach to teaching calculus than was
possible before this laboratory was established.
