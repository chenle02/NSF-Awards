9500903 Jeffries The Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site" at SRI
International will be continued. This activity recruits nationally, and allows
students to spend the summer participating consequentially in a range of
important experiments in atomic and molecular physics. The setting is unique,
being in a large not-for-profit research center, which gives students experience
in non-academic research. ***
