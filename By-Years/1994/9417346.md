Arnett, David AST 94-17346 In massive stars neutrino cooling accelerates the
last stages of evolution to the point that direct simulation of the
hydrodynamics of convection is feasible with high performance computation. The
first multidimensional simulations of the late stages of the evolution of
massive stars have just begun and will be systematically extended by this work.
The hydrodynamic simulations will be continued to later times to provide a
direct connection between observations of SN 1987A and other nearby corecollapse
supernovae and what the star is actually doing. ***
