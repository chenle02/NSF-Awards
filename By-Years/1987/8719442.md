This doctoral dissertation will support a comprehensive field analysis that
integrates data from the three component basins of the Manix Basin in the
central Mojave Desert, thus making possible an accurate determination of late
Quaternary lacustrine fluctuations. The purpose of the project is to contribute
to our knowledge of changes in regional landscape. This project seeks to
investigate and integrate various landform changes to produce the first
comprehensive picture of landscape development for the basin. This new research
at the time scale of the intermediate level of a glacial cycle has been made
possible by the growth of absolute dating techniques and increased knowledge of
geomorphic processes and process response systems. The study is expected to
yield important new information regarding cyclic landscape evolution and the
long-term stability of graded processes.
