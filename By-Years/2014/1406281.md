The project will concentrate on the moduli of geometric structures on manifolds.
This subject arose from several threads in the 19th century: (1) symmetries of
crystals, which developed into the theory of crystallographic groups; (2)
conformal mapping, and the corresponding holomorphic differential equations and
their monodromy groups, which led to the classical theory of uniformization; (3)
classical differential geometry of surfaces, generalized to Riemannian geometry,
and later to Lorentzian geometry influenced by Einstein's theory of gravitation.
The notion of a geometry itself was algebraicized by Felix Klein, who
interpreted a geometry as the properties invariant under a transitive action of
a Lie group. The present study investigates the possible ways of putting a
geometric structure on a topological manifold in terms of the fundamental group
and the Lie group. The goal is to describe when a given topology (often
described by a combinatorial object) can be given the given geometry. In several
cases, there is a complete classification of geometric structures, and the
moduli space itself enjoys both a rich geometry of its own and symmetries of its
own, which lead to intricate dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific goals and scope of this project involve flat projective and conformal
structures, especially in dimension three. The recent classification of complete
affine 3-manifolds leads to many questions about more general structures. In
particular the proposal asked which groups which admit proper affine actions; at
present the only known hyperbolic groups are free groups. The methods involve a
combination of dynamical systems, algebraic group theory, topology and geometric
group theory and representation theory. Other important questions include
finding obstructions for a 3-manifold to admit a projective structure; at
present only one such closed 3-manifold is known. Computer experiments can help
in this direction, and projects in the Experimental Geometry Lab can suggest new
examples of geometric structures.
