This research is focused on the automatic generation and verification of cutter
paths for machining sculptured surfaces. The initial phases of the work will
seek to generalize work done collaboratively with the Ford Motor Company on
sculptured-surface cutter-path verification. The main problem here is detecting
under- and over-cutting due to improper cutter selection; a z-buffer approach
will be used, and algorithmic efficiency is a central concern. Later phases of
the research will focus on efficient data structures for representing machined
sculptured surfaces, and on alternative approaches to the automatic cutter-path
generation problem.
