This project will investigate a nondestructive test method which will be used to
detect and locate flaws in concrete structures. Method under investigation is
the impact-echo technique which has proven successful on plate-like structures
such as slabs and pavements. Analytical studies, together with experimental
investigations, will be conducted to verify the technique for beams and columns.
