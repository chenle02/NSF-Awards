Abstract for the Award DMS-0245530 of Yu

Graph connectivity is a fundamental concept in graph theory. Many important
problems in graph theory either involve connectivity or can be reduced to
problems about graphs with a certain connectivity. The PI will study graph
contractions and graph decompositions which preserve a certain degree of
connectivity. This will have potential applications to structural graph theory,
including graph minors. Another aspect of the proposed research is the study of
long cycles (including Hamiltonian cycles) in graphs with a certain
connectivity. The PI proposes to study the existence of (and determine
algorithms for finding) long cycles in graphs. Some of those problems are
related to a problem in geometric knot theory about the lengths of knots and
links.

Graph connectivity may be viewed as a type of network reliability, and hence, is
important in computer science and combinatorial optimization. Finding long
cycles in graphs is an important problem in mathematics and computer science; it
includes the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Many problems in this proposal are
long-standing open problems, which have attracted much attention from experts in
graph theory and computer science. Solutions to these problems will either lead
to the development of new techniques or provide tools for solving other
problems. Several problems in this proposal were motivated by problems in other
areas, including network reliability and lengths of circular DNAs (lengths of
knots). Further understanding of these problems will be useful for understanding
the interplay between graph theory and computer science and between graph theory
and knot theory.
