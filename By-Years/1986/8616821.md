This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of a Beckman LS 5801 series
liquid scintillation counting system for data analysis in the research programs
of four investigators in the Department of Botany. This instrument will be used
for research in molecular cytology, developmental botany, plant physiology, and
biochemistry. More specifically it will be used to quantitate data involving the
use of radioisotopes for preparation of labeled hybidization probes and for
direct incorporation into various plant metabolites.
