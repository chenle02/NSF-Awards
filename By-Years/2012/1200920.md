The award provides support to defray the expenses of participants in the 28th
Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM), which will be held March 9 and 10, 2012,
at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. SEAM, which started in 1985, is
well-known for disseminating and exchanging the latest ideas and developments in
classical analysis, complex analysis, and operator theory. Topics of the main
lectures generally reflect the major current developments and interests in
analysis and operator theory. SEAM encourages participation of junior faculty,
post-docs, and graduate students, and all are invited to present talks. The
meeting's intimate format fosters collaboration between younger and more senior
mathematicians; this exchange of ideas has continued to inspire significant
scientific advances in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEAM has served as the
first significant research experience for many beginning researchers and
advanced graduate students, providing them the opportunity to interact with
established colleagues. The organizers of the conference are committed to
providing support to encourage the participation of women, minorities, and other
young mathematicians to facilitate their development as researchers and
educators.
