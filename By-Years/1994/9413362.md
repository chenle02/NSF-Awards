9413362 Petrenko This project is co-funded between the Condensed Matter Physics
and Polar Glaciology Programs. The project will investigate the characteristics
and physical mechanisms of the photoplastic effect (PPE) in ice: pure and doped
ice demonstrate significant and persistent hardening under the action of
ultraviolet illumination. The fundamental mechanism of PPE in ice is not
understood, and is of importance from a fundamental solid state physics
standpoint as well as geophysical and environmental viewpoints. Both laboratory
and field experiments will be conducted. Emphasis will be placed in microscopic
processes which are studied by internal friction, dislocation currents,
conductivity and photoconductivity, etching and replicating of dislocations
emerging on the surface of the ice, and spectroscopic study of photochemical
products accumulating ice under illumination. The project also includes a modest
theory component. The results are intended to determine the fundamental
mechanism of the PPE in ice, and whether or not ultraviolet solar irradiation is
essential in forming plastic properties of natural ice and snow. % % % This
