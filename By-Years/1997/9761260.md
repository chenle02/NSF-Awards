This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the following
objectives: (1) To genetically manipulate C. Flavigena to synthesize increased
amounts of the KUSP1 polyglucan and (2) investigate the feasibility of new
applications of the polymer. C. Flavigena is a gram positive bacterium; hence
its useful beta-1,3-polyglucan product should not be contaminated with
lipopolysaccharide endotoxins. The polymer is insoluble at neutral pH and
soluble in mildly alkaline solutions; hence its gellation is easily controlled.
Modern molecular biological techniques will be employed to develop a KUSP1
`over-producing` strain. In parallel we will examine the applicability of
KUSP1-based gel systems for electrophoretic applications. The successful
completion of this study will result in a ready supply of this polymer at an
attractive cost for the commercial applications listed: a) Enhanced oil recovery
via `in situ gellation` of the polymers in reservoirs, b) Encapsulation of
medicines for `controlled release`, c) Encapsulation of agricultural chemicals,
and d) Gelling agent/thickener/stabilizer in food products. This award is
supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
