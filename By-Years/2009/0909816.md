Behavior is known to be influenced by natural genetic variation among
individuals, yet the precise physiological mechanisms that alter behavior as a
result of this variation are poorly understood. The solution to this problem
depends both on identifying genes responsible for natural variation in
behavioral responses and on understanding the physiology of how those genes
affect neural function. Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living soil-dwelling
nematode, is an ideal organism to address the effects of natural variation on
behavior. It has a relatively simple nervous system and a fully annotated
sequenced genome, and wild isolates of this species show extremely different
temperature preferences. This study will use genetic crosses to map and clone
the genes responsible for natural variation in behavior. Microfluidic devices
will then be used to create a precise temperature choice environment, allowing
the physiological basis of these differences to be analyzed using calcium
imaging of individual neurons. This work has broader impacts via
interdisciplinary graduate training, involvement of undergraduates in research,
and community-oriented scientific education through a Campus Educational
Network. This will be among the first studies to identify specific changes in
multiple genes that work together to cause variation in the physiological
mechanisms of a complex behavior. These connections are necessary to begin to
understand the vast diversity of behavioral responses within the natural world,
as well as within human populations.
