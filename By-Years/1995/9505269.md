A computerized database of verified diatom names will be produced. This database
will integrate and make accessible to the general scientific community disparate
references and resources that contain information on diatom nomenclature. Names
appearing in the major published catalogues of diatom names as well as the
unpublished New Species File of the Academy of Natural Sciences will be entered
during this 3-year project into database tables for diatom genus names and names
within diatom genera. Each entry into the database will be verified against the
original reference in which the name was proposed. The information will be
searchable by name, authority, date of publication, individual or groups of
references and status of the name. The estimate 75,00 records will be made
available to diatom collections, state and federal agencies and individual
scientists by request as well as over World Wide Web and Gopher servers on the
Internet. The project will be part of the information infrastructure to support
a wide range of research disciplines relation to biotic surveys and invent
ories, including Taxonomy and Systematics, Ecology, and Paleontology, including
pure and applied projects.
