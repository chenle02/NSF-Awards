In 2008, the NSF ADVANCE program awarded a grant (HRD-0819407) to the University
of Washington ADVANCE Center for Institutional Change (CIC) to implement the
"On-Ramps into Academia" workshop series. The series aims to provide Ph.D. level
women in industry, consulting, and government research labs with the information
and resources necessary to make a successful transition back to academia as
faculty.

The next workshop will be held October 18-20, 2009 in Seattle, WA. Of the
fifteen applicants to date, eight have Ph.D.s in Computer Science and an
additional woman has a Ph.D. in Technical Communication with a focus on Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI). This supplement requests travel support for the
these women in Computer Science to attend the On-Ramps workshop.
