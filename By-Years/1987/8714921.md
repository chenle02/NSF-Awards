The process of concrete deterioration has not been fully investigated with
respect to the damage caused by the heat of hydration. This project will
investigate the formation of microcracks during curing and early drying and the
resulting permeability of water into the material. The objective is to determine
the best curing process and to assess the quality of the concrete after the
curing is completed.
