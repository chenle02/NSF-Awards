This engineering education research award to Drexel University in collaboration
with Purdue University, Texas Engineering Experiment Station, and Northeastern
University will employ researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of using a
fully instrumented real functioning bridge called the "Learning Bridge" to
provide a comprehensive laboratory experience for civil engineering students.
The project will add sensing, monitoring, and data transmission capability to
the bridge for use by academic institutions and develop internet portals to the
learning modules which will use this data. This research would both create a
unique and much needed infrastructure resource for civil engineering laboratory
development and also advance understanding of how civil engineers learn about
multi-domain systems. Most of the sub-disciplines of civil engineering will be
integrated by exposing students to a complex infrastructure system linking
social and technical concepts from the beginning of the undergraduate program.
This work will contribute to better preparation of engineers to fill engineering
jobs.
