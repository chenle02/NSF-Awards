9409528 Chang A study of the mixed lubrication regime which lies between the
micro-elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes will be conducted. The
modeling will be based on using the full surface roughness for the asperity
interaction determinations and a roughness with the short wavelength components
filtered out for the calculations of the hydrodynamic pressure distribution.
Thermal effects and three-dimensional roughness effects will be included in
tests of the algorithm's robustness. The model will be validated in tests with
tribological surfaces coated with ceramic coatings or with solid lubricants. ***
