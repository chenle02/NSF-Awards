This is a three-year "Accomplished-Based Renewal" project that seeks to extend
and broaden on previous work carried out by the PI to design growing season
climate predictions for the agriculture of the midwestern part of U. S. A. The
research will also examine the use of climate information (including
predictions) by U. S. A. agribusiness. This research project is important
because it will contribute toward the creation and synthesis of unique
hydrological, thermodynamics, economics and crop data sets to benefit the
agricultural industry of North America.
