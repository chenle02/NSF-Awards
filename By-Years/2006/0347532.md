This research aims to develop theory, algorithms, and interactive visualization
tools for mining a variety of high-dimensional data stemming from real world
application areas, ranging from medical images to satellite data. The research
aims to develop a unified framework for unsupervised feature selection, identify
and characterize clustering criteria for different clustering objectives, create
new similarity metrics that reflect the spatial and temporal nature of data in
specific domains (e.g., earth science images), define measures of feature
relevance/irrelevance, and incorporate feature selection into hierarchical
clustering methods. The new algorithms developed will benefit a variety of
application domains; in particular, it will directly aid physicians studying the
severity of emphysema and cystic fibrosis lung diseases, and help scientists
discover interesting patterns of the earth surface. This project integrates
research and education by providing hands-on research experiences to both
undergraduate and graduate students in the classroom and in the lab. Moreover,
the PI plans to work with the Society of Women Engineers and the Connections
program to inspire female high school students to pursue careers in engineering
and computer science and to insure that under-represented groups are involved in
this research.
