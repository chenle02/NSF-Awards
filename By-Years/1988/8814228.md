A bottom-tethered time-series sediment trap experiment and preliminary
laboratory and analysis program will be conducted to GOFS with a coherent body
of information on the quality and quantity particle fluxes in the interior of
the North Atlantic along the 20 degree W meridian. A synchronized time-space
matrix will be formed using 3 fixed trap depths: 1000 m. 2000 m in depth, and
700 m above the floor, at two GOFS 20 degrees W stations: at approximately 33
degrees N, and 47 degrees N. A unit sampling periods will be 2 weeks and the
experiment will be continued without interruption for at least 2 years. The cups
are pre-poisoned with buffered formaldehyde preservative and, except for during
the collection phrase, are positively sealed from ambient sea water throughout
the period of deployment. The proposed GOFS array matrix will be deployed using
SYNCTISE mooring deployment techniques and will be maintained during two 3-week
periods of shiptime, prioritized for array deployment, on a medium/large-sized
research vessel each year. The proposed experiment will result in the collection
of 144 unit samples each year making up the GOFS time-space matrix from the
North Atlantic 20 degree W transect.
