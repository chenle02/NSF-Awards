In the past thirty years super-massive black holes (millions or billions of
times the mass of our sun) have been observed in the centers of numerous
galaxies. Many stars orbit these black holes and emit gravitational radiation
which causes the star to spiral inward and eventually to be swallowed by the
super-massive black hole. The characteristics of the gravitational radiation,
from both the inspiral and the eventual in-fall of a star, will be theoretically
determined. The analysis of data from future gravitational radiation
observations will then provide tremendous insight and understanding of strong
gravitational fields, the stars in the centers of galaxies and the super-massive
black hole itself.

Our place in the universe can only be studied via physics and astronomy. These
fundamental sciences catch the attention of the best and the brightest of
students. As they see for themselves how mathematics coupled with careful
experiments or observations drives the progress in fascinating areas of science,
such as black holes and gravitational radiation, these best and brightest will
become the next generation of leaders in science and industry.
