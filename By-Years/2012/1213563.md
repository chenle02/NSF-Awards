This award funds the research activities of Professor Matias Zaldarriaga at the
Institute for Advanced Study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astronomy and physics have a
long and shared history. Advances and discoveries in one field have had profound
consequences on the other. This is particularly true for our understanding of
gravity. These days the major common arena has moved from the study of orbital
dynamics to cosmology. The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the
Universe is perhaps one of the best examples of how the two fields are currently
intertwined. The study of the beginnings of our Universe is another rich
frontier. The work of Professor Zaldarriaga will improve our theoretical
understanding of the early universe and the observable consequences of our
current models. It will improve our modeling of the astrophysics of several
cosmological probes and will further our theories for the late time evolution of
the universe, thus helping address the outstanding mysteries of dark matter and
dark energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has considerable broader impacts,
including the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Astronomy
is a subject of broad appeal to the public; cosmology and the origins of our
universe in particular. Professor Zaldarriaga will continue his outreach efforts
which include public lectures, visits to middle and high schools and a lecture
series at a senior citizen center.
