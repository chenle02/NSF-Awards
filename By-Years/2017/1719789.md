This award supports the participation of junior researchers in the research
conference "Bayesian Inference in Statistics and Statistical Genetics" to be
held at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, August 16-20,
2017. Bayesian inference for high-dimensional data has received considerable
attention from researchers in a wide variety of fields, including climatology
analysis, genomics and proteomics studies, time series analysis, and
neuroimaging. Further, there is an increasing demand for Bayesian inference in
other related fields due to the rapid evolution of high-performance computing.

The purpose of this conference is to stimulate research collaboration in the
development, analysis, and application of statistical techniques for complex,
high-dimensional data arising in real world applications. The conference will be
an excellent forum for exchanging cutting-edge research results, highlighting
current research trends and open problems, exploring visions of future work, and
stimulating cross-disciplinary research in various areas. The conference will
feature plenary talks given by internationally recognized specialists, invited
presentations by junior researchers, and a contributed poster session.
