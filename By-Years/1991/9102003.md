The principal investigator will continue his research in the area of
probability theory that treats sums of independent, identically distributed
(iid) random variables. This is a classical area of research, with applications
to statistics as well as other areas of probability. The investigator will work
on several problems: large deviation estimates for the probability that the sum
of iid random variables is small in absolute value, the rate of escape problem
for random walk, limit theorems for trimmed sums.
