The third Gordon Conference in the series, "Protons and Membrane Reactions",
will bring together investigators concerned with proton-mediated energy
transduction in a large variety of biological systems. Emphasis will be on
mechanisms of proton movement and transfer in lipid bilayers and proteins. This
is intended to be a work-shop style meeting with about 100 participants.
