Research in parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) protocols is characterized
by a large number of unrelated empirical studies, a small set of analytic
studies and to date no realizable approach that is optimal or universally
practical. This research project is extending a framework incorporating a low-
cost network that supports rapid dissemination of critical synchronization
information. Such a framework should, at a minimum, provide speed-ups for all
existing protocols. More promising, however, is its potential to support
adaptive protocols-those that employ aggressive processing selectively. Among
all protocols, these have the greatest likelihood of having provably minimal
expected execution times. Success in this research could lead to the
construction of PDES engines that would simulate arbitrary applications in
minimum expected execution times. Further benefits could be gained from
framework-supported, application-dependent performance enhancements based on
"look-ahead" and "future lists."
