The research will involve the analysis and design of high accuracy mechanical
systems. Such systems include machines to perform finishing tasks on
construction sites such as: 1) Wallbots, robots to assemble steel track and stud
walls; and 2) Scaffbot, robot to perform maintenance and assembly tasks on
vertical exterior surfaces of ships and building. Also included are machines to
advance the state of the art of precision surveying and navigation, such as: 1)
Acall, a machine to calibrate accelerometers, for the National Bureau of
Standards, to achieve accuracies of one part per million. This type of accuracy
is needed to allow slow moving vehicles to use inertial systems to navigate for
extended periods of time. 2) Molecular Measuring Machine, a machine being
designed with the National Bureau of Standards with the capability to measure
the position of atoms on specimens centimeters in diameter.
