DMS 9625412 Efromovich This research on curve estimation focuses on optimal
adaptive nonparametric time series estimators that are: (i) asymptotically
efficient for different loss functions, (ii) well performing for the case of
small sample sizes in comparison with peer oracles based on underlying curve,
(iii) efficiently data-compressing for problems arising in environmental
problems like monitoring quality of water or the analysis of global change via
marine magnetic anomaly; (iv) robust to distribution of noise and long
covariance observations. The asymptotic analysis is based on the study of local
empirical processes, modern probabilistic results for mixing sequences and sharp
data-driven estimators of spectral density. Data-driven estimators for the case
of small sample sizes are explored both theoretically via oracle inequalities
and numerically via intensive Monte Carlo study. %%% The research involves the
development of optimal methods for the recovery of images that arise in
different scientific problems including: (i) secretion of hormones such as
insulin secretion where no other methods have been successful so far due to
noisy, long-dependent and indirect data; (ii) monitoring quality of water based
on the analysis of large, correlated and sparse data sets that have undergone
efficient, computationally intensive data-compression; (iii) timing of
geological events, including plate motions and climatological variations; (iv)
testing and modeling properties of new materials. ***
