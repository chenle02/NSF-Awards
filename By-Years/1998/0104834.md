PROPOSAL #0104834&lt;br/&gt;TEXAS ENGINEERING EXP. STA.&lt;br/&gt;XIONG,
ZIXIANG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ambitious project explores several new
directions in the algorithmic design and architecture of challenging multimedia
communication systems. A unified approach is taken for transmission of
multimedia data over heterogeneous networks (e.g., the Internet) and noisy
channels (e.g., a wireless LAN) based on scalable source coding. Topics covered
in the project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Scalable multimedia data compression
based on efficient arithmetic coding of bit planes of transform coefficients.
For image coding, the wavelet transform is used like in the new JPEG-2000
standard. The focus is on introducing progressiveness in the traditionally non-
progressive trellis coded quantization scheme. The 3-D wavelet transform is
adopted for fully scalable video coding. A new nonuniform modulated complex
lapped transform (NMCLT) is applied for audio coding. To achieve high arithmetic
coding performance, a significant amount of effort is invested in high-order
context modeling of the NMCLT or wavelet coefficients. In addition, new methods
are studied for masking quantization noise of the NMCLT coefficients for audio
coding and exploring the motion information for 3-D wavelet video
coding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Scalable transmission of Internet multimedia via
optimal packetization and joint congestion and error control. A dynamic
programming based optimal packetization scheme for scalable multimedia bit
streams is&lt;br/&gt;studied. Suboptimal but low complexity packetization
schemes are also investigated. Congestion control is used to determine the
available transmission rate and an end-to-end optimal error control scheme
devised&lt;br/&gt;to mitigate the effects of pack loss. This is achieved by
optimally trading off scalable source coding and unequal error
protection.&lt;br/&gt;
