The team will study the gaseous outflows, or winds, from about 500 galaxies.
Winds are thought to cause important changes in galaxies. The team will use
ultraviolet observations to examine the properties of the winds. They will look
for so-called scaling laws, a powerful approach that could not be taken before
because not enough observations were available. The team will use models and
simulations to try to mimic the properties of the winds. Senior team members
will train junior members. The team will bring Latino students and families to
Lick Observatory. During these visits, talks and displays for the public will be
presented in Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will investigate galactic
winds at redshifts of 0.7 to 1.5, a key cosmic era during which galaxies assumed
their modern forms. Their goals are to (1) use rest-frame ultraviolet spectra to
conduct a census of the properties of galactic winds; (2) establish scaling laws
for galactic winds, aided by abundant ancillary data; and (3) use models and
simulations to mock the observations and thus identify viable theories for
galactic winds.
