This award will enable collaborative studies between Professor D. Fennell Evans
of the University of Minnesota and Professor Kozo Shinoda of the Yokohama
National University, Japan. Dr. Evans will make two visits to Japan over a two-
year period to carry out research on the structure and physical properties of
amphiphilic microstructures and microemulsions and on the mechanism of
solubization and detergent action. Experimental procedures will include
solubility, x-ray and light scattering measurements, and the use of video
enhanced microscopy. This research will address some fundamental questions in
surface science which are important because of the role played by amphiphile
molecules in many industrial processes and in almost all biological
transformations. Both Professor Evans and Professor Shinoda are respected
leaders in the area of colloid chemistry. The research will benefit from the
parallel interests and unique strengths of the individual laboratories of these
two investigators.
