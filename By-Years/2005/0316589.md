The focus of this research is concerned with the property of helical chirality
using redox systems integrated with organic materials for the synthesis of
electro-active materials. Porphyrins, pthalocyanines and oligothiophenes will be
integrated with methionine-based redox switches to afford materials able to act
as photochemical switches. For the characterization of materials, the study will
take advantage of stopped-flow circular dichroism, fast voltammetry with
microelectrodes, scanning electrochemical microscopy, fluorescence and electron
transfer kinetics

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. James W. Canary of the Department of Chemistry at New York
University. Professor Canary will focus his research efforts on preparing new
compounds that will be engineered to produce novel optical switches. In terms of
broader impacts, the project has potential for the development of industrially
important devices. The project will also be used as the basis for curriculum
development at the undergraduate and graduate level and the PI is active in
outreach activities.
