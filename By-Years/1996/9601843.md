This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at Lawrence University acquire a inductively coupled
plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) evolution of the Galapagos Island
Chain (2) late quaternary history of the Lake Winnegao Basin East-Central
Wisconsin (3) recent anthropogenic effects on the Lake Winnebago Basin (4)
investigation of electronic and vibrational band structure of the semiconductor
Ge1-(x)Snx, and (5) zooplankton nutrient supplies in freshwater and marine
environments. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is an
analytical technique that uses a high temperature discharge generated by
inducing a magnetic field in a flowing conducting gas to determine with high
precision, quantitative multi-elemental analysis. It is used in
interdisciplinary fields including environmental science, material science and
geochemistry for high quality elemental analysis.
