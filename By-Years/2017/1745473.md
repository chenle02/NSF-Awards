In describing a general set of worker competencies, the Department of Labor
presents an array of skills and competencies that include personal skills,
academic competencies, workforce competencies, industry-wide technical
competencies, and occupation-specific technical skills. The conference, Meeting
of the 21st Century Skills Collaboration, will assemble NSF-ATE funded
collaborators and industry colleagues to initiate an effort to validate
interventions and measures associated with the development of professional or
21st century skills aligned with worker competencies that cut across technician
education. In terms of intellectual merit, the joint industry-academic forum
will initiate an effort to address gaps in practice and the research,
specifically in (1) translating what employers say is missing from new graduates
into performance measures and (2) validating what professional development
interventions improve student performance in the workforce. With a rigorous
future-oriented agenda, the project's broader impact is in its continuous
engagement of stakeholders in coordinated effort to investigate and improve the
development and measurement of 21st Century skills.
