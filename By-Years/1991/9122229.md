This research consists of continuing work in three different areas: survey
research which attempts to assess possible impediments affecting the ability of
the remnants of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to adjust to the market; the
behavior of real estate prices and returns; and studies of the correlations
between asset prices and their relation to underlying economic fundamentals.
Research regarding the heretofore communist economies will involve developing
questionnaires and surveys concerning the expectations of future government
interference in the economy and the impact that such expectations may have on
inhibiting entrepreneurial activity. Indigenous entrepreneurial behavior will be
critical in determining the success of the transition to a market economy, and
this work will represent an important first step in understanding the
determinants of entrepreneurial behavior and the prospects of a successful
transition. The second area of work will test for efficiency in the operation of
real estate markets and the forecastability of real estate prices and returns
using methods that are guided by theory derived from structural models of the
real estate market. This work is at the border of structural modeling and the
kind of modeling suggested by empirical finance. The third area of work is
directly in the finance area and will involve extending previous work on the
time series properties of long term interest rates in comparison with those of
stock prices and dividends. The work involves relating correlations among
different asset prices and correlations among market fundamentals that underlie
such prices. Specifically, the implications of the information pooling model
will be tested to see if its explanation of asset price co-movements is actually
consistent with the data. These two areas of research are important because they
will shed light on the operation of two markets critical to the performance of
the U.S. economy, the capital market and the real estate market.
