The goal of this project is to develop the tools needed for performance-directed
integrated design and control of complex applications running on distributed
computational systems. Its target computational systems are complex,
incorporating the difficult heterogeneity, latency, and adaptive properties of
computational grids. Its target applications are at the cutting edge of
computational science: very large, complex applications with adaptive
characteristics that do not allow their optimal system configurations or
computational requirements to be estimated prior to run time. Each application
will be viewed as a composition of components, with a formal, high fidelity
model of performance to be designed for each component. The approach is to use
model-based adaptive run-time control, based on these composed performance
models, to control the execution of the application to meet specified
performance goals. The control strategy will make real-time changes to
parameters that modify the behavior of both application and computational
platform.
