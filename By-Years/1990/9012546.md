The gravity-driven separation of solid particles from a suspension in tanks with
inclined walls and the related fundamental phenomena are the object of this
project. The previous model describing the accelerated settling process in the
presence of inclined surfaces fails in low viscosity fluids. The reasons are the
waves formed along the suspension-clear fluid interface. This aspect will be
investigated both experimentally and theoretically. This proposal is a
continuation of a previous research work sponsored by NSF, in which Dr. Acrivos
has obtained significant scientific results on two-phase flow mechanisms, with
application to suppersettlers in mineral processing and waste water treatment.
