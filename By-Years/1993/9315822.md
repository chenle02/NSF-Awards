Research Initiation Planning Grant proposal will seek to develop a research
project to determine the extent technology such as PCs is used to help
introduce, reinforce, practice or facilitate the learning of school topics? In
addition, this study will seek to determine the extent technology is used for
entertainment purposes versus supporting extracurricular activities such as
musical training programs. There is a dearth of information regarding the affect
technology has on early childhood development. Demographics are available which
show a positive correlation between income, ownership of a home personal
computer (PC), and the eduction of parents, among other traits, and children's
school performance. Yet, very little is known regarding how home technology such
as PCs or video cassette recorders (VCR) or even television (TV) is used to
promote learning. This study seeks to explore the present usage of technology in
American homes with children.
