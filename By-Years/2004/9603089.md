9603089 Wen This award supports the participation of American
scientists/engineers in a U.S.- Japan seminar on Infrastructural and
Environmental Risk Assessment and Rehabilitation to be held in Kyoto, Japan from
November 22- 23, l997. The co-organizers are Professors Y. K. Wen of the
University of Illinois and Jun Kanda of the University of Tokyo in Japan. The
seminar will address theme topics on environmental loads, environmental hazards,
risk assessment, infrastructure retrofit and inspection. The emphasis will be
focused on bridging the gap between analytical and numerical methods and
practical applications to civil infrastructrural systems under natural and man-
made technical hazards by stochastic simulation. Environmental problems due to
pollution will also be considered. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese
experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work,
and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. The workshop
proceedings will be prepared, published, and distributed to industries,
government and academic institutions. ***
