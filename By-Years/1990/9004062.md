Two senior investigators and two postdocs will study various aspects of
differential geometry and Riemann surfaces. One will establish the finiteness of
string theories to all orders of perturbation theory. This will require the
development of holomorphic supergeometry and new parametrizations of Teichmuller
space suggested by Feynman diagrams. The second investigator will work on
problems in complex differential geometry. This will include a study of
Hermitian symmetric domains, holomorphic mappings between them, and their
classification. One postdoc will analyze homomorphic immersions between compact
complex hyperbolic space forms. The second will derive further estimates for
eigenvalues of manifolds with conelike singularities. Four investigators will
study various aspects of differential geometry. Several of the problems to be
studied have their origins in string theory. This theory has been used to
describe complex interactions between elementary particles. In this theory, each
particle is represented by a string which vibrates in ten dimensional space.
These investigations are part of a continuing effort by mathematicians and
physicists to use this new theory to explain the results of high-energy particle
experiments.
