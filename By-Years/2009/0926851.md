CMMI ? 0926851: Nonlinear Mechanics of Graphene-Based Materials&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Rui Huang, University of Texas at
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The
objective of this project is to develop a theoretical framework for monolayer
graphene based on nonlinear continuum mechanics and atomistic modeling. Within
the framework, the fundamental mechanical properties of monolayer graphene and
its derivatives will be systematically studied. First, a nonlinear continuum
theory will be developed for two-dimensional sheets under arbitrary deformation
in the three-dimensional space. Next, atomistic modeling approaches will be
developed to simulate and deduce the fundamental mechanical properties of
monolayer graphene. The continuum theory and atomistic modeling methodology will
then be combined to study carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons as two basic
forms of graphene-based materials. Finally, integrated graphene structures with
graphene monolayers interacting with supporting substrates will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a wealth of exceptional physical
properties, graphene holds great promises for a variety of applications,
including graphene-based composite materials, nanoelectronics and
electromechanical resonators. The research on mechanical properties of graphene
will complement the already abundant research activities in material science and
condensed-matter physics that have largely focused on its electronic properties.
It is envisioned that fundamental understanding of the mechanics of graphene-
based materials will open new perspectives for both fundamental physics and
practical applications. In addition, education and outreach activities will be
incorporated within the proposed project to enhance its societal impacts.
