Project Overview

This project is to develop research infrastructure. It will create digital
access to Darwin's Botanical Manuscripts, a prodigious collection of never
published research documents. They comprise the largest surviving body of
Darwin's experimental designs and data. Each manuscript will be transcribed and
annotated; in addition, it will be presented side by side with its corresponding
high-resolution, full-color digital image. The material will form an integral
part of the Darwin Manuscripts Project's website (http://darwin.amnh.org).

Intellectual Merit

Darwin's Botanical Manuscripts represents an enormous reservoir of research
narratives that are amenable to study by scholars in history, philosophy, and
social studies of science. The collection opens up thousands of primary
documents for close examination of Darwin's observational and experimental
practices. Models of scientific method, discovery, and explanation can be tested
and expanded against Darwin's large bodies of empirical research. The collection
offers opportunities to study the ways that theory and experiment interacted
over the course of Darwin's many botanical projects. It offers, as well, new
perspectives on Darwin's own representations of his scientific practice. The
study of social interactions with colleagues who contributed to the execution of
Darwin's research can also be put on a more concrete basis than has been
possible to date.

Broader Impacts

Darwin's Botanical Manuscripts is a treasure trove of experiments that can be
readily repeated and have the potential to be used in the improvement of STEM
education. Access to digital images of Darwin's handwritten experimental designs
and data can enhance the educational value of such exercises. Many experiments
were extremely simple and used common plants. Some also used homemade apparatus
(like a bell jar) and relied on equally simple manipulations, such as weighing
and counting. Darwin set up most of his experiments in order to test/confirm a
strong hypothesis. Therefore, the rationale and underlying concepts can be
plainly explained. In addition, the PI is working as part of a team on a
proposal to create a robust education program based on Darwin's experiments.
