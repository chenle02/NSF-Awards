9701209 Tessier Aging, as measured by the physiological deterioration of
animals as they grow older, is the subject of much current research. Why aging
occurs and what underlying genetic mechanisms are associated with aging are also
topics of considerable research. Traditional laboratory genetic work has
confirmed much of the theoretical work. However, relatively few scientists have
examined genetic variation of aging in wild populations, or the ecological
context in which this variation exists. The proposed research will address these
gaps in our knowledge through life table experiments and detailed descriptions
od sources of natural mortality. Daphnia, a common freshwater crustacean, will
be studied because its ecology is well known and it will reproduce clonally.
This mode of reproduction allows sampling of the natural genetic variation in
the lab, where life tables can be constructed under controlled conditions. Thus,
rates of aging for natural populations can be estimated without interference
from extrinsic mortality. Aging rates can be compared to data from field
estimates of mortality rates. Sources of mortality (e.g., predation, disease,
habitat seasonality) can then be used to examine the relationship between
intrinsic lifespan (and other aging indicators) and the expected wild lifespan.
The research will also test theoretical predictions that rapid aging could be
indirectly advantageous in certain ecological contexts. The investigators will
characterize early life history traits (e.g. growth, maturation) and look for
tradeoffs with rates of aging. A high rate of aging should be sustainable only
if there are correlated advantages early in life, such as accelerated growth.
Conversely, poor reproduction or growth early in life should be sustainable only
if it benefits an animal through longer life.
