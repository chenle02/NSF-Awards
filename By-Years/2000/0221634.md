The Principal Investigator has conducted a reconnaissance, land-based seismic
experiment designed to address questions about whether a mantle plume is
associated with the Galapagos hotspot, whether the plume penetrates the mantle
transition zone, the location of the hotspot/plume, the lateral dimensions of
the hotspot/plume, and the form of hotspot-lithosphere interaction. The present
project will thoroughly analyze the seismic data, publish the results, and
support scientific and educational collaborations with the Instituto Geofisico,
Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Quito, and the Charles Darwin Research Station,
Puerto Ayora. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
