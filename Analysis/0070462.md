" Reflection Principle in Higher Dimensions: Geometric, Analytic and Algebraic
Approaches"

Principal Investigator - Sergey Pinchuk

The proposal is focused on the following problems of analytic continuation: (i)
Continuation of proper holomorphic mappings between domains with real analytic
boundaries; (ii) Analyticity of continuous CR mappings between real analytic
manifolds; (iii) Propagation of holomorphic and CR mappings along manifolds. The
existence of biholomorphic and/or proper holomorphic mappings between certain
domains ( or CR mappings between manifolds) imposes significant restrictions on
these domains ( manifolds ) as well as on the mappings. These restrictions give
rise to various, sometimes unexpected, phenomena of analytic continuation in
several complex variables. The goal of the proposed research is to solve some
concrete old problems and to provide a further progress in the study of analytic
continuation and related areas. The main method of investigation is the
reflection principle, which will be combined with other methods from analysis,
geometry, algebra and differential equations.

Complex analysis has been used as a powerful tool in mathematics and its
applications for a long time and has a tendency to a larger role in certain
areas. For example, the famous "edge of the wedge" theorem, which is now one of
the main ingredients of the reflection principle, was discovered by a physicist
N. Bogolyubov with respect to his research in quantum field theory. Another
important object in theoretical physics - the Heisenberg group - is closely
connected with the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the unit ball in the
2-dimensional complex space. I believe that this research program will be useful
not only for complex analysis but also for the strengthening its ties with other
areas of mathematics and sciences by means of potential applications. It will
also influence mathematical education at Indiana University via involvement of
graduate students.
