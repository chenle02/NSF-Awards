This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Rose Finn (Siena College) will
quantify the relative importance of the physical mechanisms that cause galaxies
to evolve from blue, actively star-forming galaxies to red, passive galaxies by
studying the gas and stellar properties of galaxies in 10 low-redshift groups
and clusters. All 10 groups and clusters have or will have optical photometry
and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, infrared data from the
Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer camera on board the Spitzer Space
Telescope, and radio data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array
Survey. This combination of data provides a powerful probe of the disk gas and
its depletion. The results will enhance our understanding of how the environment
affects a galaxy's supply of cold disk gas, a central question in galaxy
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this project, Dr. Finn will also
work to increase the number of Siena College graduates who pursue careers in
physics, astronomy, and related fields by facilitating curricular changes in
high school and undergraduate physics courses, by involving undergraduates in
research for 3 of their 4 years, and by introducing an astronomy concentration
within Siena's existing physics major. In addition, Dr. Finn will develop a new
assessment tool that measures a student's ability to think independently and
solve real-world problems.
