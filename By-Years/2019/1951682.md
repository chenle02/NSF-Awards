Movement in primates is, in part, controlled by brain circuits that involve
three parts of the brain: the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus.
Activity changes in these circuits contribute to the abnormalities seen in
movement disorders such Parkinsonâ€™s disease. While activity changes in the basal
ganglia are well defined, little is known about parkinsonism-associated changes
in the primate basal ganglia-connected motor thalamus and cortex. To understand
these changes in humans it is important to study the circuit dysfunction in
primates, as these neuronal regions differ in both connections and composition
from other species such as rodents. This project aims to enhance understanding
of these network dynamics in ways that cannot be accomplished with conventional
modeling approaches that often use an unwieldy number of coupled equations. Once
the dynamics are described, new treatment approaches directed at normalizing
thalamic activity in parkinsonian subjects may be developed and optimized for
safety and effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical models of brain
circuits are helpful to understand these abnormalities within the basal ganglia-
thalamocortical network of connections. This project will generate a new
multiscale model of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways that will
reflect the nonlinear nature of individual neurons while taking advantage of the
inherent features of each nucleus. The first objective will be to create a fully
functional thalamocortical loop model that can locate and examine the
bifurcations between healthy and diseased brain activity states. Of particular
interest are the trajectories in parameter space that could allow a parkinsonian
subject to return back to the stable healthy state, allowing possibilities for
researchers to identify new therapeutic opportunities. Next, since the primate-
specific thalamic interneurons cannot currently be targeted with certainty in
vivo, the model will be used to examine the roles that these interneurons have
on the system. Finally, the model will be validated using an extensive dataset
of neuronal recordings from healthy and parkinsonian nonhuman primates.
Comparison to the recorded data will restrict the analysis of the mathematical
model to a physiologically plausible region of the parameter
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
