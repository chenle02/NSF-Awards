Striga asiatica (witchweed) is a major parasite on corn, Sorghum, millet and
rice. This parasitic angiosperm attaches to the host root and invades the host
vascular system through a specialized organ termed a haustorium. The development
of this unique structure by the parasite is initiated in response to a specific
chemical signal from the host. An inducer of Striga haustorial development has
been isolated from Sorghum and identified as 2,6- dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone
(2,6-DMBQ). Dr. Timko proposes to examine the biochemical and molecular genetic
mechanisms involved in haustorial induction and development. Using a combination
of in vivo and in vitro approaches he has begun to define the changes in the
transcriptional and translational activities of Striga radicles following
induction of haustorial formation by 2,6-DMBQ. He will construct cDNA libraries
from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from uninduced radicles, induced radicles, and mature
haustoria. By differential screening procedures he will identify differentially
expressed gene products. These cDNAs will be structurally characterized and the
nature of their biochemical factors affecting the development of attachment
competency and intrusive growth on host plants. These studies will provide the
basis for the future stages of its development. %%% The Striga-host interaction
offers an unique opportunity to study the molecular control of plant
developmental processes as well as the molecular aspects of plant-pathogen
interactions. An understanding of the early events of Striga-host interactions
can lead to the development of control methods for Striga and other root
parasites.
