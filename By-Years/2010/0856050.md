This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award supports several projects that study quantum
effects related to cosmology and black holes. One of the most important ideas in
cosmology today is that early in its history the universe underwent a process of
extremely rapid expansion called inflation. Quantum effects would have been very
important both during and shortly after this period of inflation. Many
calculations of such effects use a classical (not quantum) treatment of gravity
and a quantum mechanical treatment of everything else. The validity of this
semi-classical approximation will be investigated both in the cosmological
setting and near black holes.

The completion of these investigations will drive progress in our understanding
of various phenomena ranging from the expansion of the universe to the effects
of quantum fields on black holes. For example, if quantum fluctuations
destabilize an exponentially expanding universe, predictions of its future and
most inflationary scenarios will be affected. There is a long history of
undergraduate and graduate students working with the PI on these types of
projects and gaining training in both numerical and analytical research
techniques.
