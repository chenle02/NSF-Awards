Prop #: 0321700 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Steven Rabalais&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the Research Vessel
Pelican operated by Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium and dedicated to
use in support of marine research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support for such
items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval
of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Steven Rabalais is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to
acquire an Appleton deck crane, a dynacon levelwind, and emergency escape
breathing devices (via a group purchase). ***&lt;br/&gt;
