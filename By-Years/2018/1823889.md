Humans often have to engage in the process of changing and refining existing
movement patterns, when engaging in normal behaviors as well as in
rehabilitation. The goal of this project is to examine this process of "motor
re-learning" in complex motor tasks. This project is significant because it will
advance theoretical understanding of the principles that drive motor re-
learning, and illuminate how these principles can be used to develop new methods
of training in healthy individuals. The project includes study of re-learning in
violinists, generating outreach and broadening participation in STEM research,
and building knowledge of motor learning in musical performance. The project
will involve an educational component that provides training to graduate and
undergraduate students in conducting research. The knowledge to be gained may
have important implications for enhancing movement rehabilitation in individuals
with physical disabilities, thereby advancing fundamental science supporting the
national health and welfare. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Learning one motor skill can
exert a powerful influence on subsequent motor learning. These effects can
either promote or hinder learning, and can persist for months or years. Motor
learning is complex, as even behaviors that seem quite simple can depend on
coordination of multiple joints and multiple muscles. This project will alter
this dependence, using a human-computer interface. Humans will learn to move a
cursor on a screen using gestures. The experiment will change the function
mapping the gestures into cursor movement, across or within training sessions.
The expected findings will advance theories of motor learning, which largely
ignore the existence and influence of previously learned coordination
patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
