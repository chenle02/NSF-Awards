This proposal is for a planning grant to the School of Engineering and Computer
Science at California State University, Fullerton which could lead to the
establishment of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Systems
Science. The Center will be devoted to the development of analytical and
computational solutions for complex engineering systems with direct application
in Southern California industry. The Center will initially focus on optimizing
of information processing in the aerospace industry. The planning grant will be
used to generate interest and support for the aerospace companies to develop a
suitable research plan which will be the basis for a proposal for the
establishment of an I/UCRC on Systems Science at Cal State University. The
Program Director recommends the award of $25,000 to the California State
University for a planning grant to study the feasibility of establishing an
I/UCRC for Systems Science.
