This project concerns questions in algebraic geometry, one of the central areas
in modern mathematics, with multiple connections to other areas (from complex
analysis and topology to number theory) and with important applications in
fields as diverse as coding theory, computer algebra, phylogenetics, and string
theory. The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic
varieties, geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial
equations. The variation of algebraic varieties of a given type is captured by
"moduli spaces," whose points represent these algebraic varieties. This project
is centered on moduli spaces whose points represent stable pointed rational
curves, themselves algebraic varieties with a very rich structure. These moduli
spaces form building blocks for more complex moduli spaces that play a key role
in theoretical physics. The project has three different themes, related to the
classification of algebraic varieties, establishing new connections with number
theory, and deepening connections with physics. The ultimate goal is a broader
understanding of algebraic varieties from three different perspectives.

The projects stem from open questions surrounding the moduli space M(0,n): what
are its effective cycles, what is its arithmetic intersection theory, and what
is its derived category. A first project concerns the birational geometry of
blow-ups of toric varieties. Until recently, very little was known about the
failure of the Mori Dream Space property for blow-ups of toric varieties at a
single general point. With recent new techniques, there is hope for further
progress towards longstanding open questions on linear systems of curves on
surfaces. The investigator also aims to develop the Arakelov theory of M(0,n)
and establish a connection with birational geometry. Finally, the project aims
to construct equivariant, full, exceptional collections on M(0,n) and related
moduli spaces. Applications include an explicit understanding of the derived
category of a range of other algebraic varieties.
