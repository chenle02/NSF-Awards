This grant is to study the solar wind near the sun using a variety of radio
propagation methods. The results of this "radio probing" will be compared with
other ground-based coronal observations and with in-situ observations from
space-craft. The basic objectives are to understand the mechanism(s) of coronal
heating and of solar wind acceleration, and the relationship between large scale
photospheric structures and large scale solar wind structures. Ultimately, such
understanding is necessary to understand the coupling between the sun and the
earth, enabling us to understand and even to predict conditions in the space
environment around the earth. The radio-remote-sensing observations detect the
results of phase modulation of radio waves passing through the solar wind in
various ways. This phase modulation is linearly proportional to the electron
density. Thus one observed the effects of electron density fluctuations. The
simplest observation is to measure the solar wind velocity. However, the
velocity is not the only information one can derive. One can also estimate the
spatial spectrum of these density fluctuations and how they are couples to
velocity fluctuations. One can see the effects of plasma waves in these
observations and test their consistency with theoretical wave spectra. One could
use these methods to provide ground-based support for the ULYSSES polar-orbiting
space-craft. The ULYSSES mission will provide perhaps the only opportunity to
directly observe the solar poles in this generation. #
