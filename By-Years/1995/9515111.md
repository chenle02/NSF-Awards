Weiner, Daniel West Virginia U. This project employs the digital technologies of
geographic information systems (GIS) to carry out research on land and agrarian
reform in South Africa's Eastern Transvaal Central Lowveld. The research employs
a methodology whereby regional political ecology is integrated into the GIS
production process. Land use, resource access, property rights, and local
knowledge, as well as, other socio-economic and environmental data are analyzed
within a common framework in order to assess current and future land use
patterns as historical products of a set of production relations and socio-
environmental histories. The research offers an innovative blending of
technology and theory and enhances the analytical capabilities of regional
political ecology. Within South Africa, the project will contribute to a deeper
understanding of the rural reconstruction process by incorporating the
differentiated knowledge of local communities into the GIS production process.
