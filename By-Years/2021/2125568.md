The lack of progress in broadening the participation of African American women
in the academy, industry and tech entrepreneurship remains at the margins
despite years of interventions and initiatives frequently intended for women and
minorities. Innovative approaches are warranted to address seemingly intractable
issues and ensure progress. This project combines data collection, quantitative
analysis, social and behavioral sciences and simulations to elucidate factors
that underlie the career trajectories of African American women. These findings
can, then, provide insights for the development of meaningful strategies and
interventions to increase the participation and career success of African
American women in engineering and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
