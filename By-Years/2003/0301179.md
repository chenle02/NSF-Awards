The investigator will study several problems related to the geometry of curves
mapping to algebraic varieties. In particular, he will use the geometry of the
space of relative stable maps to the projective line as a tool to study the Chow
ring of the moduli space of curves. He will use the space of twisted stable maps
to study the behavior of Gromov-Witten theory for Deligne-Mumford stacks. He
will study the geometry of rationally connected varieties. These projects have
different objectives, but are unified by the central role played by the
deformation theory of morphisms of curves and intersection theory on moduli
spaces.

This project is rooted in the very classical mathematical study of Riemann
surfaces. Questions in this area can now be studied much more fruitfully due to
the influence of ideas from string theory. These techniques have made accessible
a host of quantitative and qualitative questions about the geometry of solutions
to systems of polynomial equations. The investigator will take advantage of
these physical insights to pursue purely mathematical questions in algebraic
geometry.
