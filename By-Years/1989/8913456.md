This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Carlton Caves of the
University of Southern California and Dr. Gerald J. Milburn of the Department of
Physics, University of Queensland, Australia. An overall objective of this
research is to advance characterization of photons. Characterization of photons
are a partial function of the properties -- which determine the optical
frequency mode -- of particular detectors. Development of a theory of continual
optical-frequency measurements is therefore necessary to advance
characterization of photons. Without such theory, it becomes difficult to find
quantum limitations to high- precision optical detection of photons. The
specific objective of this project is to develop a theoretical framework for
describing and analyzing continual quantum-limited detection of optical fields.
The project continues collaboration of U.S. and Australian researchers who have
made significant contributions to development of this theoretical framework.
Expectations are that the project will improve the framework; contribute to the
foundations of quantum physics; and, in addition, lead to advances in
applications in modern optics and optical communications theory.
