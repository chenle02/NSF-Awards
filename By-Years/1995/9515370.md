This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden collaborative research between Kevin
E. Smith of Boston University and Joseph Nordgren of Uppsala University, Sweden.
The objective is to investigate electronic phenomena in organic conductors using
a powerful new electronic structure probe: soft x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy
(SXF). The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the
electronic structure of quasi-low dimension solids and experimentation. This is
complemented by Swedish expertise in the area of SXF spectroscopy. The
experiments will take place at two major European synchrotron radiation
facilities, including the new MAX II facility at Lund, Sweden and the DORIS III
ring at Hasylab in Hamburg, Germany. The project will advance understanding of
the basic physical processes in complex solids and provides the opportunity to
learn a new spectroscopic technique.
