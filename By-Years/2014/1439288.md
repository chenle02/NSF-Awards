The proposed technology is related to chemical modification of 'recombinant
proteins' that are defined as a new combination of genes that forms DNA. Typical
customers of the proposed technology will include biology or medicine
researchers working on determination of protein structure, functions, and/or
attempting to develop a novel technology based on chemically modified proteins.
The anticipated customer of the proposed technology will be interested in a
standard procedure for chemical modification of proteins that provides the
desired product without laborious purification steps, guarantees no or minimal
changes in the structure and functions of the protein, and can be assigned to
any person possessing standard laboratory skills or to s robotic synthesizer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology is related to chemical
modification of recombinant proteins, a process that is commonly used in
biotechnology. It uses a hexahistidine tag, a short sequence present in the
majority of recombinant proteins and commonly used for their purification by
affinity chromatography, as a site for the covalent modification. Current
methods for chemical modification produce mixtures of products that require
substantial efforts of highly experienced personnel, optimization of reaction
conditions, identification of reaction products, and purification of starting
materials and products. The critical advantage of the proposed technology of
covalent modification is its versatility as it can be applied to essentially any
recombinant protein containing the hexahistidine tag. A large number of these
proteins are commercially available and many thousands more can be expressed
using the existent DNA vectors. Another major advantage is the possibility of
conducting chemical modification of recombinant proteins in the presence of
other proteins thus skipping the complicated purification stage.
