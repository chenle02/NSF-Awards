The California Earth Science Academy (CESA) will provide a comprehensive
training program in earth science concepts (60% geology, 15% astronomy, 15%
meteorology, 10% oceanography) and instructional strategies for teachers of
grades 4-12. Four week summer workshops will enroll 36 and 30 teachers as SJSU
and CSU-San Bernardino respectively. Teachers will be selected from the counties
around these two sites. Graduate credits earned in the program are an integral
part of an MA degree in Natural Science/Geoscience. Thirty teachers, selected
from previous summer workshops will be Leader Teachers and subsequently offer
workshops to peers far removed from any CSU campus. The summer workshops
emphasize earth science content and pedagogy along with field trips and hands-on
activities. Academic year follow- up includes short workshops, classroom
support, field trips, and communications via CESA-NET. Leader Teachers will take
an active role in the second summer's activities after participating in
leadership activities the first summer. The Leader Teachers will conduct
workshops for their peers supported by CESA project mini-grants and LEAs. The PI
for the project is Dr. Ellen Metzger from SJSU. Cost sharing equals 14% of the
NSF award.
