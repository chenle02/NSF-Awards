WGBH in collaboration with The Children's Museum will demonstrate how video
technology can be used as an effective tool for teacher training in science. The
children's Museum current NSF project is developing a set of curriculum
materials and teaching strategies to increase the effectiveness of science
education in the middle schools and to encourage minority and female students to
continue in science. It brings together Bernie Zubrowski of The Children's
Museum, who has run successful "hands-on" science education sessions for 25
years, teachers in Boston public schools, and the Massachusetts Pre-Engineering
program, providing minority scientists in the classroom as participants and role
models. This combination provides an unusually fertile opportunity for
documentation and instruction. The WGBH project will produce three forty minute
teacher training videotapes designed to support teachers who are attempting to
implement this new type of instruction in their middle school classes. The
training tapes will be augmented by supporting print material -- a 24 page guide
for teachers viewing the tapes as well as a 16 page guide written for college
and university instructors who train teachers. A full range of dissemination
activities is also planned. The cost sharing for the project will be sixteen
percent of the NSF portion.
