The objective of this project is the integration of vision and force feedback
for the synthesis and execution of error-tolerant robot motion plans.
Specifically, a purely geometric representation of visual constraints in terms
of visual constraint surfaces is explored. A visual constraint surface is a
ruled surface defined by an object feature (such as an edge) and its projection
onto the image plans of a supervisory camera. Control schemes are planned to
facilitate: motion that complies to a visual constraint surface; motion that
terminated on contact with a visual constraint surface; and, motion that is
simultaneously constrained by visual and physical constraint surfaces.
Extensions to existing preimage style motion planners will make possible the
synthesis of motion plans that exploit execution-time feedback from vision and
force sensors. While much work has been done in the areas of motion planning and
control with force feedback and motion control using visual feedback, to date
there has been no reported system capable of creating motion plans based on
visual feedback or capable of integration of both force and vision sensing for
motion control. This research addresses each of these issues.
