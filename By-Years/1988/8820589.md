The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a major component of the Southern
Ocean ecosystem, yet little is known about the physiological ecology of this
species. This project will examine the degree and consequences of food
limitation in the adults and larvae. The response of adults and larvae to long
periods of starvation are different; the adults can survive periods of
starvation of over a year, whereas the larvae only survive a few months.
Experiments will focus on the effect of different food levels on development and
growth. A seasonal energy budget will be constructed from data gathered on rates
of ingestion, fecal pellet production, growth, molting, reproduction and
metabolism. This project will combine laboratory and shipboard measurements to
determine the energetics of this important member of the Antarctic marine
community.
