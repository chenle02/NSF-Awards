This research effort is designed to research and test teacher inservice
materials and programs that will promote and support change and innovation in
the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools. This Phase I project will
focus on high school geometry, and address the new NCTM Standards with an agenda
based on a discovery approach to mathematics realized through cooperative
student learning. The proposal describes an inservice model which addresses the
issues of applying new pedagogical directions to existing classroom, schoolwide,
and district structures; assessing inservice results with metrics of both
student and teacher-participant performance; and establishing a mechanism by
which the inservice's dissemination can financially and motivationally self-
perpetuation process.
