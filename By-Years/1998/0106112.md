0106112 Hibbard 0106050 Hames 0106091 Miller The timing and nature of accretion
of the Carolina Zone to Laurentia is one of the more significant and least
constrained tectonic problems in modern southern Appalachian geology. The
original suture has been overprinted and obliterated by subsequent Alleghanian
motion along the western margin of the Carolina zone, precluding direct
investigation of the suture. The Gold Hill Shear Zone is a prominent feature in
the western part of the Carolina Zone and may record features produced by the
suturing event that have been preserved due to the distance of the shear zone
back from the actual terrane margin. The project involves an integrated
structural and geochronologic study of the Gold Hill Shear Zone in an attempt to
understanding timing, kinematics and crustal affinities of the original suture
and collision of the Carolina Zone with Laurentia. Results will help develop
reconstruction of the Appalachians and their exotic terranes.
