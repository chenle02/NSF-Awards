9452227 Joyner Hampden-Sydney College, a four-year liberal arts college in
Virginia, offers baccalaureate programs in the natural sciences in biology,
chemistry, physics, and interdisciplinary areas. The physics department
maintains an unusually large enrollment in physics with more than 30% of the
student body enrolled in a physics course, due in large part to an aggressive
laboratory program at all levels. This project will upgrade the laboratories in
four courses which follow the introductory course. The areas selected are
nuclear, low temperature, and X-ray fluorescence. The use of the requested
equipment in these four courses is expected to increase our retention of majors
among students coming out of the introductory course. We also expect a
measurable impact on the number of majors coming out of these introductory
courses: a goal of 5% physics majors in a graduating class does not seem
unreasonable, given our present 3% ratio. (At 5%, our major productivity would
be ten times the national average of one-half percent.) The requested equipment
will also be available to students in our two local high schools and in the
local community college, on a late-afternoon basis.
