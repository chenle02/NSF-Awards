The overall goal of this project is to determine the predictability of large-
scale atmospheric patterns on timescales of one to two weeks and rapidly
developing midlatitude storms on timescales of one to two days. Sources of error
in predicting these phenomena using numerical models can come from the model
itself or from errors in the initial data used at the start of the prediction.
This research will attempt to distinguish between the two, examining cases of
rapidly developing storms (explosive cyclogenesis) and persistent periods of
high amplitude atmospheric wave patterns known as atmospheric blocks. The work
represents a continuation of research begun under a previous grant. The
principal investigator will employ a more sophisticated and more complete
version of a general circulation model than he used previously. This research
ultimately should contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric dynamics
and to improving short and medium range weather prediction.
