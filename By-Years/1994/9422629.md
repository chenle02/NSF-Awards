ABSTRACT Zhang &amp; Faghri University of Rhode Island CTS-9422629 Experiments
and computer simulations will be conducted to study the effects of vibration on
phase change and sedimentation. Of particular interest is determining if the
heat transfer rate can be enhanced or diminished under a wide range of physical
parameters and by the selection and control of the Vibration frequencies and
amplitude. Three types of materials will be investigated: Those having a
solid/liquid density ratio less than, equal to and greater than one. If the heat
transfer rate can be modified by vibration, potential applications exist in, for
example, materials processing, metallurgy, crystal growth, and casting.
