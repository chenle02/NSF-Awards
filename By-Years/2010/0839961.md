Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to investigate a
microplasma MEMS device that is capable of achieving efficient hydrogen
production from hydrocarbon fuels. The project will develop understanding of the
microplasma-based reforming processes and will also lead to practical designs of
micro-reformers for fuel cell applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve the design and fabrication of a
microstructure that will generate plasmas for hydrogen production. Major
challenges include: the generation of a suitable plasma at atmospheric pressure,
and ensuring its stability, durability, and efficiency. Microplasmas, which
differ from conventionally-scaled plasmas in a few important ways, are
attractive in this respect. Both theoretical and experimental studies will be
conducted by a multi-disciplinary team, which includes three investigators. The
effort will benchmark the microplasma approach to all other methods of hydrogen
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Both undergraduate and
graduate students will be involved in this project. Because of its
interdisciplinary and collaborative nature, as well as its societal relevance,
this research effort will serve as a appealing vehicle for education. The
project will involve RIT's co-operative education program.
