This goal of this proposal is to develop advanced techniques to calculate
accurate and computationally efficient photometric redshift distance estimators,
and to mitigate photometric uncertainties and systematics on clustering measures
for galaxies found in large numbers in current and upcoming surveys. The
computer codes will incorporate machine learning techniques with a combination
of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The methods developed will
be applicable to the massive surveys to be undertaken by the future Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will, among other things, place precise
constraints on Dark Energy.

Broader impacts of the work include training of a postdoc, a graduate student,
and undergraduate students, and development of a course in Data Science to be
available on line. All computational tools developed will be made available to
the general astronomical community.
