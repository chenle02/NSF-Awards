This workshop will convene a small group of persons with diverse expertise in
social science fields relevant to the new initiative for Capacity Building in
Science, which has been launched by the International Council of Scientific
Unions. According to the ICSU initiative, capacity building in science is
intended to enable less-developed nations and regions to make use of science and
technology for the well-being of their citizens. This is a central concern of
scholarship in Science and Technology Studies, and poses a challenge that the
field must rise to meet. The workshop will bring together a small group of
knowledgeable scholars to critically examine capacity-building proposals that
have been developed, to make recommendations for further development of the
initiative, and to propose ways to involve the larger STS community in the
capacity-building initiative.
