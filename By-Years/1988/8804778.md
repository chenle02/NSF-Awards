The role of urea in soybean nitrogen metabolism will be examined by comparing
normal plants and mutant plants lacking one or both urease isozymes, namely the
abundant embryo- specific urease and the ubiquitous urease. The former isozyme
is synthesized exclusively in the developing embryo while the latter is found in
all soybean tissues examined. While urease-negative plants are viable they
exhibit leaf-tip necrosis associated with urea buildup. This project examines
the sources of the urea and the effects of blocking urea assimilation on soybean
yield. Radiolabeled urea accumulation from guanido-labelled arginine and from
allantoin will be measured. The effects of the urease blocks on assimilation of
ureides (allantoin and allantoic acid) and of arginine in cultured cells and in
hydroponic plants will be studied. Field trials of urease-negative plants will
assess protein and seed yield. In addition to the urease mutants already in
hand, new mutants will be screened for lacking arginase and allantoinase. Upon
determining the tissue specificity, it will be determined if these mutational
blocks prevent urea accumulation in the affected tissues in urease-negative
backgrounds and whether they affect arginine and ureide assimilation,
respectively.%%% These studies will add to our knowledge of the metabolism of
ureides and arginine in soybean. The former are an important transport form of
fixed nitrogen while the latter likely has a nitrogen storage role in addition
to its role as a polyamine precursor.***//
