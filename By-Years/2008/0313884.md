0313884&lt;br/&gt;Lee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports planning and
development of U.S.-Korea research cooperation in the area of intelligent sensor
systems for robotic applications. Dr. Sooyong Lee of Texas A&amp;M University
will facilitate the participation of five American graduate students in the East
Asia Summer Institute- Korea program. Each of the students will work during the
summer in a Korean laboratory, thus gaining international research experience
and setting the stage for future research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
