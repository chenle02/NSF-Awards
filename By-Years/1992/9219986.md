The mechanics of emplacement of huge thrust sheets to form mountain belts has
remained one of the most poorly understood aspects of tectonics. It has been
long recognized that fluids have played a critical role in the emplacement
process through the reduction of the tectonic stress but the exact explanation
of how this happens remains unsolved. Attempts at physical modeling of this
phenomena have been insightful but have lacked a realistic consideration of
hydrologic and thermal conditions. This project will construct models that
address the above issues that will predict fluid pressures along fault zones and
within fault bounded blocks. Results will have important implications for the
development of most mountain belt systems of the world.
