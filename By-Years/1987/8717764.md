This grant supports accelerator-based nuclear physics research by a group of
experimentalists located at the University of Wisconsin. Emphasis is on the
study of hadronic and weak interactions in few-nucleon systems and in light
nuclei, using reactions initiated by intense beams of polarized ions. Examples
of experiments under investigation include: beta-decay asymmetry measurements on
polarized nuclei produced with these beams, to distinguish Gamov-Teller from
Fermi contributions; triton and helion bound state wave function determinations,
to test calculations of nuclear three-body bound states; and several experiments
addressing parity and charge-symmetry nonconservation in nucleon-nucleon and in
light nuclear systems. The work is being carried out at the University of
Wisconsin EN tandem accelerator laboratory, the Indiana University Cyclotron
Facility, and at the SIN injector cyclotron in Zurich. These experiments
explore, in a precise and highly sensitive manner, the interface between the
fundamental interactions of physics and the properties of nuclei, nuclear
reactions, and nuclear transitions.
