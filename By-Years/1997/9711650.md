D Asaro 9711650 Mean and turbulent properties of the upper ocean boundary layer
and its atmospheric and wave forcing will be measured during an Autumn season in
the North Pacific. The resulting data will be used to study the boundary layer
turbulence and its relationship to entrainment and mixing at the mixed layer
base. Neutrally buoyant, high drag floats will be deployed for a 100 days during
they will profile 4 times a day to get estimates of vertical kinetic energy,
dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy, surface wind stress, heat flux
and directional wave spectrum.
