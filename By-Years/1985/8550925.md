This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and professional
development experiences for 40 outstanding biology teachers nationwide. Former
NSF Honors Workshop participants will help to identify the Summer 1986
participants through a thorough selection process. Documentation of the
individual participant's entering knowledge and the competencies developed
through project activities will contribute to the overall project evaluation.
Upon completion of the project, the participants will become eligible for
membership in the National Network to Implement Human Genetics and Bioethics
education. The project's four week summer component will be offered at Ball
State University and will be followed by an academic year component designed to
assist participants in achieving project goals. The overall goals will provide
the participants with renewal and updating in human genetics and bioethics
education, use Network teachers to implement inservice workshops that will
disseminate knowledge and instructional materials to peers of the 1986
participants, and to evaluate the impact of the National Network in implementing
project goals.
