This Engineering Education Research project will examine the enhancement of
personal creativity and determine how engineering students become more creative.
Subjects will include first-year and fourth-year students and other students
enrolled in classes on creativity. A variety of qualitative and quantitative
methods, including both third-party instruments and methods developed by the
research team, will be used. The study proposes a theory of creativity
enhancement based upon strategic and iterative creating, presentation, feedback
and reflection ? nurturing creation to foster creativity. Applying a set of
strategies in practice develops creative competence, while tasks that spiral
back to familiar cognitive terrain promotes confidence and development of
creative identity. The understanding gained from the research about creativity
enhancement will inform the teaching and learning process, particularly
instructional design and methodology. The results will also provide a framework
for the teaching and learning of creativity for large numbers of students and
provide data to assist in decision making regarding whether development of
creativity should earn a more established position in the engineering
curriculum.
