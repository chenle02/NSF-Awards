Although the most accurate predictions and simulations come from primitive
equation models, most of our physical insights into atmospheric behavior come
from "balanced" models, which represent versions of the basic equations
simplified through a number of approximations. Recently, Dr. Schubert has made
progress in formulating generalizations of the semi-geostrophic theory (a type
of balanced model theory) to include the full effects of the earth's sphericity.
The results open the possibility of extending semi-geostrophic applications from
synoptic scale to planetary scale phenomena. An elegant aspect of the theory
(when formulated in combined isentropic and spherical geostrophic coordinates)
is its simple mathematical structure - one prognostic equation for potential
vorticity and one diagnostic equation or invertibility principle. Under this
award, Dr. Schubert will further develop and apply this theory. One weakness of
the generalized semi-geostrophic theory is that highly curved flows are not
properly simulated. The principal investigator hopes to be able to overcome this
problem through the use of a formulation (mathematically simple) which combines
two special coordinate systems and a non-linear balance approximation. He also
will carry out simulations of midlatitude storm and tropical systems with
several different types of models and systematically compare the results.
