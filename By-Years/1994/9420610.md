9420610 Viney Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which together
constitute the conserved family NOx, play a key role in the chemistry of the
atmosphere, especially in the formation of tropospheric ozone. Natural emissions
of these gases from agricultural soils may be comparable in magnitude in rural
regions to those from know anthropogenic sources. In particular, the role of
nitrogen based fertilizers spread over rural agricultural soils in the
production/emission of NOx is not well documented. Rural emissions similar in
magnitude to anthropogenic sources make development of effective strategies for
reducing ozone concentrations problematic. The objective of this proposal is to
participate in an intercomparison study of methodologies for measuring NOx
emissions from an intensively managed agricultural row crop. This study is to
intercompare chamber and micrometeorological methodologies with extensive onsite
characterization of soil physical and chemical properties, ambient air quality
and atmospheric conditions.
