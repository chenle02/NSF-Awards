The work of this expert panel is intended to inform the current efforts of the
federal government to update the Common Rule, last revised in 1991. The
discussion at the meetings and workshop plus the summary report offers potential
to be transformative for policy making and policy implementation. The proposed
revisions to the Common Rule are coming at a much needed time when new
technologies in computing environments are presenting new opportunities,
questions, and challenges with regard to risks and protection of participants'
identification and privacy. They also come at a time of growing concern about
the efficiency and effectiveness of our system of human research protections, in
part because of the tendency to over-regulate research in the behavioral and
social sciences that generally poses low risks to participants (e.g., non
invasive surveys and interviews, secondary analyses, record reviews, etc.). The
contribution of the NRC work will be to identify, review and assess the most
critical issues; to discuss and suggest regulatory language, guidelines, and
examples for implementation; and to identify areas of evaluation and study that
could be undertaken to assess the appropriateness, quality, efficiency, and
effectiveness of the new rules that will be put into regulation.
