w:\awards\awards97\9704309.doc 9704309 Sarachik This new collaboration between
a woman physicist at CUNY and a chemist at UC San Diego will focus on the
synthesis and study of the magnetic properties of crystals composed of a large
number of identical high-spin molecular clusters, such as Mn12 acetate. Their
magnetic bistability makes such materials strong candidates as elements for
high-density storage of information. The spin- tunneling in a double well
potential that we have recently demonstrated makes them interesting from a
fundamental standpoint, and offers the possibility that materials of this class
could be used as elements for quantum computation. The aim of our studies is to
synthesize new molecular crystals that will optimize properties for
applications, and to gain a better understanding of their behavior. %%% This new

bistability makes such materials strong candidates as elements for high-density
storage of information. Their quantum mechanical properties at low temperatures
are interesting for fundamental reasons, and also offer the possibility that
they can be used in "quantum computers" which require elements that are
simultaneously in a "yes" and "no" state. The aim of our studies is to
synthesize new molecular crystals that will optimize properties for
applications, and to gain a better understanding of their behavior. ***
