The origin of neurons is one of the most fundamental events in the development
of complex animal organization. In the broader sense, it is also essential for
our understanding of the origin of biological complexity and mind. This project
is designed to identify and characterize signal molecules that are responsible
for the development and formation of simple neural circuits and behavior. The
hypothesis to be tested is that neurons arose independently in different early
animals, and therefore the nervous systems of today's animals might include
cells of diverse ancestry. By using the tools of modern genomics and physiology,
these processes can be reconstructed in the descendants of these early animals,
such as ctenophores (comb jellies). These processes can then used to repair or
even design novel neural circuits. The sea gooseberry, Pleurobrachia bachei will
be used as the major ctenophore model. As the broad impact, this research
program will integrate education in Neuroscience with Genome Biology to decipher
the molecular toolkits that controlled formation of the earliest behaviors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approaches and methodology that we will develop can be
generalized to any system. As such, the project will conceptually change the
interpretation of data gained from studying classical animal models, and will
probe unique mechanisms of how to "make" a neuron, a neural circuit, and an
elementary brain. It is essential for charting new directions both in synthetic
biology and regeerative medicine. In addition to their value as models in
neuroscience, comb jellies are significant parts of marine ecology and
biological fishery control. Thus, identification of chemical signaling
components in these animals will advance our understanding of their biology and
contribute to monitoring and controlling the health of marine habitats.
