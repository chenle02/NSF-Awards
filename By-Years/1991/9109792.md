This project in computer networking concerns controlling the use of processing
resources in large communication systems. With user demands growing in number
and complexity, there is a need to develop mechanisms for efficient resource
allocation. The focus is on systems in which the underlying driving parameters
vary with time. The approach addresses two shortcomings in several current
approaches to the optimization of resource control: the assumptions that certain
parameters are governed by known probability distributions, and that the driving
parameters are stationary or constant with time. This approach uses stochastic
optimization algorithms that execute on-line in a system in which the driving
parameters vary with time. Convergence properties of the algorithms using the
relatively new theory of large deviations are studied, and experiments conducted
through simulation allow comparison of different algorithms. It is expected that
the results will contribute to resource control in communication systems as well
as to an increased understanding of time-varying stochastic systems in general.
