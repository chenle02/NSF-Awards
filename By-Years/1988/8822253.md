This project will study the electrical breakdown of dielectric liquids under
continuous stress. The conditions leading to this breakdown is not well
understood and breakdown is usually characterized today according to impulse
testing. Although impulse testing is important, this breakdown mechanism is
known to be different from that under continuous stress, which is the more
common condition. High speed photography of breakdown streamers synchronized
with current conduction measurements will be used for the first time to
understand this pre-breakdown condition.
