The funding from this grant will be used to support students and postdocs so
they can attend the 2012 Multiphoton Processes Gordon Research Conference (the
16th in a series of biennial conferences), which will be held June 3-8, 2012 at
the Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA. This international conference is
well-established, yet continuing advances in atomic, molecular, optical, and
chemical (AMOC) science and related technology preserve its vibrancy. The 2012
meeting is structured around contributed posters and 8 sessions of invited talks
that will focus on topics at the forefront of AMOC science including: High
Harmonic Spectroscopy; Attosecond Electron Dynamics; ATI and Photoelectrons;
Strong Field Processes and Sources; Photoionization delay; X-Ray Imaging; and
Free-Electron Laser Experiment and Theory. The broad range of expertise and
perspectives among attendees provides a unique and stimulating environment for
the development of new ideas in these rapidly evolving areas.
