Four investigators will analyze a range of geometric problems from theoretical
physics, topology, and algebra. The principal investigator will focus attention
on the rigidity "theorems" of Witten, new functors on Riemann surfaces related
to knots on 3-manifolds, and stable bundles. A second geometer/theoretical
physicist will investigate the relationship between the topology of low
dimensional manifolds and gauge theories. "Bosonic" and analytic analogues of
certain "fermionic" constructions arising from BRS cohomology will be the focus
of study for a third investigator. And an algebraic geometer will investigate
the structure of the locus of potentially semi-stable representations in
universal liftings. A group of geometers will investigate several problems which
have arisen from the new gauge field theories of mathematical physics. Of
particular interest will be the recently conjectured interrelationship between
gauge theory and knots in three dimensional space. Mathematicians have long been
fascinated by knots, first as a novelty and now with their sights on
applications ranging from thermodynamics and particle physics, to supercoiling
of DNA. These geometers will contribute to our understanding of the hard
analytical side of these theories.
