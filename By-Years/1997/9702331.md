A central aspect of a natural language understanding (NLU) system is the
creation and manipulation of complex symbolic structures that encode grammatical
knowledge. However, equally important is the ability to weigh numeric
influences, such as lexical frequencies, that determine the preferred
interpretation of an ambiguous utterance. Traditional approaches to NLU have
emphasized the symbolic aspects of language, while connectionist models have
focused on the numeric aspects. In this research, a hybrid connectionist
framework is developed that fully integrates the two types of knowledge within a
uniform computational approach. Within an implemented prototype, symbolic
feature passing encodes the rich grammatical structures of a recent linguistic
theory, while competitive numeric processing captures the influences that
disambiguate an utterance. This project involves a number of extensions to the
model that necessitate significant developments in the integration of symbolic
and numeric processing within a parallel network architecture. Novel algorithms
are explored within distributed symbolic processing and the control of complex
competitive dynamics, especially focusing on the structural and numeric
influences of individual lexical information. The research also investigates the
hypothesis that accurate numeric preference information can be extracted from
large text corpora.
