This is a study of low molecular weight carbonyl compounds in sea water. These
compounds are important because they are involved in many biotic and abiotic
processes in the ocean, including photochemical transformations in the surface
water, air-sea exchange, condensation reactions, surface microlayer enrichment
and microbial transformations. The research will be focused on laboratory
investigations designed to facilitate interpretation of the project's past field
work. These investigations will include experiments on photochemical reaction
pathways, action spectra, reactants, and oxidants. In these experiments low
molecular weight carbonyl compounds will be used as chemical probes. In addition
to this laboratory work, a model of the carbonyl distribution in the upper mixed
layer will be developed and tested.
