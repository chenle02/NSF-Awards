Lie and his collaborators will investigate a number of problems that lie at the
interface of time-frequency analysis and other areas of mathematics such as
additive combinatorics, geometric measure theory, incidence geometry and partial
differential equations. The main objectives for the time-frequency analysis-
themed problems in this project are (a), to develop a satisfactory generalized
wave packet theory and (b), to develop the proper environment for the time -
frequency analysis in higher dimensions. One step in the first direction was
taken by the PI in his Ph.D. thesis, where he introduced a new perspective on
the generalized wave packet theory which later proved beneficial in proving the
boundedness of the Polynomial Carleson operator in dimension one. Some of these
techniques appear to be applicable to the study of the boundedness of the
maximal Schrodinger operator in dimension one. The PI and his collaborators will
investigate several other problems, including: boundedness of the Bilinear
Hilbert transform along curves; boundedness of the higher dimensional version of
the Polynomial Carleson operator; pointwise convergence of the solution to the
free Schrodinger equation in higher dimensions; convergence of the subsequences
of sequences of partial Fourier sums.

This mathematics research project investigates various problems in harmonic
analysis, which is an area of mathematics that has important applications to
problems that arise in other sciences, such as pattern recognition in computer
graphics; electrical charges distribution in physics; wave propagation in
seismology. The techniques to be employed will bridge several areas of
mathematics, including partial differential equations, incidence geometry, and
additive combinatorics. The resulting synergies will enrich the arsenal of
analytical tools and available techniques; these will be presented in graduate
seminars designed with the specific purpose to attract students and young
researchers to this dynamic area of mathematics and its applications.
