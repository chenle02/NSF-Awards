This study will examine the origins and population affinities of the aboriginal
populations of Australia and New Guinea by use of three different genetic
systems: mitochondrial DNA, human leucocyte antigen genes, and short tandem
repeat markers on the Y chromosome. Specific aims of the project include 1)
clarification of biological and historical relationships between Australian and
New Guinean populations, 2) testing for single or multiple episodes of migration
to Sahul (the Pleistocene continent that included Australia, New guinea, and
Tasmania), 3) identifying possible sources and routes for the migration into
Sahul, and 4) testing the concordance of the three genetic systems in
reconstructing population histories. Genetic analyses will involve system
specific considerations such as differences in inheritance pattern, effective
population size, and mutation rates. Phylogenetic, population subdivision, and
demographic expansion analyses of the data from these three genetic systems will
provide rich insights into the genetic history of the occupation of Sahul.
