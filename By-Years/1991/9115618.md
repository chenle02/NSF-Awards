Single-cell techniques for measuring species-specific growth rates and quantum
yield in situ have been developed and tested. The growth rates of individual
species of marine phytoplankton can be determined from data on a species' diel
cycle of DNA replication. The species-specific quantum yield is determined from
single-cell absorption spectra and the spectral distribution of daily integrated
light intensity. These techniques have been tested in field conditions, and the
results agree with related lab studies. In this research, Dr. Carpenter and
collaborators will develop a simpler and more widely applicable method of
measuring growth rates by using cell cycle markers. This new approach will be
less time consuming, eliminate the requirement for sophisticated equipment, and
allow the production of permanent slides for record keeping. A technique for
separating phytoplankton cells from zooplankton and detrital particles will be
developed to make these measurements possible. In addition, these techniques
will be applied to study the causes of phytoplankton succession in Long Island
Sound and to test the hypothesis that the change from a diatom dominated
community to a dinoflagellate dominated one is caused by the alteration of
intrinsic growth rates in corresponding populations.
