The purpose of this continuing project is to develop a set of engineering
principles that can be used to design marine farms for U.S. waters, taking into
account both the biological requirements of the organisms being farmed, and
site-specific climatological and oceanographic conditions. The information
needed to select a farm site, design and install a farm, and print, cultivate
and harvest a crop must, for now, be gleaned from Japanese and Chinese
literature, or books that focus on the cultivation of a specific group of
organisms. During the grant period, we will develop a real-time, on- site
measurement and analysis system to quantify farm performance and immediately
make adjustments at sea. This will greatly speed up the process of identifying
new design principles. It will be possible to measure farm performance and then
change buoyancy, adjust elastic members, and control flow around and through
containers by using velcro-attached fins, damping disks, screens and scoops. We
will use dye and underwater photography to visualize and record flow patterns.
