This project cofunds the initiation of an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center on Measurement and Control Engineering at the University of
Tennessee in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Federal
Laboratory facilities as well as some of its personnel provide an expanded
research base for the Center's research program. Initial research projects for
the Center are: (1) analysis and control on nonlinear, multivariable,
distributed processes; (2) texture-based detection of surface defects; (3)
portable Johnson noise power therometer development; (4) enhanced information
extraction from process sensors; (5) cantilever coriolis mass flowmeter
development; (6) hand-held non-contact yarn velocity instrument development; (7)
multivariable control of polymer processing operations.
