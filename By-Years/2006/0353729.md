This is an international collaborative research project that was submitted in
response to NSF Solicitation NSF 02-135. This international collaboration
focuses on pinning of vortices at state-of-the-art lithographically defined
pinning structures. The vortex state will be studied in both low and high Tc
materials. The collaboration joins a scientists at the UC San Diego and
Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain. Both laboratories will be involved with
the lithographic structures and with transport and other measurements. The
research should shed light on limitations to current transport in
superconducting materials and is of interest from both fundamental and technical
viewpoints. Students will participate in international research activities,
along with traditional and cutting edge training that will prepare them for
careers in academe, industry or government.
