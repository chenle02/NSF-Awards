The present basic-science education of nursing students lacks sufficient course
and content integration and is deficient in analytical and interpretation
skills. This department is addressing this deficiency by improving the
undergraduate science curriculum for nursing students in medical physics, human
physiology, and nursing laboratories by the introduction of an Integrated
Computer System in all three courses. The primary components of an Integrated
Computer System include a computer with CD-ROM and software and hardware
interface for experiments. This system enhances discipline integration by three
activities. First, the Integrated Computer System introduces nursing students to
a system of data acquisition, analysis, and extrapolation in the laboratory that
is identical for all three disciplines. Each course builds upon the analytical
skills developed in the previous course. Second, the Integrated System is
utilized to link learning modules between each discipline. Each course develops
a series of learning modules based upon the same concepts. Each module includes
the basic principles of the concept, laboratory or clinical procedures, data
acquisition and analysis, and conclusion and applications. Each module is
carried with the student to the next course, thus linking all three disciplines.
Third, the Integrated System introduces simulations that can be used in all
three disciplines and greatly extends the traditional laboratory or clinical
conditions. The primary goal of these three methods is to enhance the nursing
student's appreciation and knowledge of concepts that can be applied across
disciplines and thus enhance their motivation and ability to master these
concepts.
