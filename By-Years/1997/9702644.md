ABSTRACT The proposed research is to study laser-liquid interactions that are
relevant to a wide range of applications, including manufacturing, materials
processing, diagnostics, and biological systems. Specific topics of
investigations are laser processing using non-classical heating mechanisms and
laser-based temperature and concentration measurement and mapping. The research
ideas are considered to be novel. The PI has arranged international
collaborators with a leading Japanese researcher. Strong potential industrial
support is evident. The PI's plan on education have activities that involve high
school students, undergraduates, graduates, and teachers themselves. The idea of
mentoring Westinghouse contest students is noted. The PI will also emphasize the
transition from student to researcher/professor for graduate students.
