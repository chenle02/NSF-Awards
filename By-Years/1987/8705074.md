Narrative: The Enzyme Engineering Conferences, initiated in 1971, have become
the leading international forum for discussion and development of enzyme
technology. The program of this, the ninth conference, focuses on recent
advances in enzyme structure research, on site-directed mutagenesis for
alteration of enzyme structure and activity, and on new applications in the
food, biomedical, and chemical industries. Recent advances in genetic
engineering have opened new avenues for understanding and altering the nature of
enzyme catalysis. The conference will bring together scientists, engineers, and
industrialists to explore future applications of these emerging technologies.
The interface between basic science and applications is to be a highlight of the
conference.
