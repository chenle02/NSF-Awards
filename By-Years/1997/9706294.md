9706294 Burbank As important as folding is to mountain belts, an understanding
of the rates and styles of evolution of folds is very poorly known. This
proposal will use the distribution of fluvial terraces in time and space to
address this problem of identifying the rates of fold development in a the
transpressional region of the northern island of New Zealand. Because fluvial
terraces can be dated, and their elevations while active can be calculated, any
deformation of the landscape will lead to permanent abandonment and preservation
of these unused terraces. By identifying a series of such terraces, the
evolution of elevations in time and space can be calculated, thus revealing the
effect of active folding on the landscape.
