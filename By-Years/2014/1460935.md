BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:

The goal of this REU Site project, supported by the Division of Engineering
Education and Centers, is to foster a new generation of diverse researchers who
will engineer new composite materials. These new materials will provide high
performance in extreme environments including the need to manage high thermal
loads for fire resistant clothing and provide impact resistance for body armor
and police protection. Student interns will be paired with individual research
mentors on the NCSU Centennial Campus and will live on the campus for a nine-
week summer training period. The interns will attend weekly interactive research
training seminars and participate in two site visits to advanced composite
industries in North Carolina. The student interns will be better trained to be
competitive in research communication and have the relevant technical skills
needed to meet future research challenges. Recruitment of the student interns
will focus on underrepresented minorities through collaboration with two HBCU
universities and recent veterans through collaboration with Craven Community
College which serves a large number of veterans and active military.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The goal of this REU Site project, supported by the Division of Engineering
Education and Centers, is to foster a new generation of diverse researchers who
will engineer new composite materials, by providing the research and
communication tools for them to be successful. Composite materials are operating
in more extreme environments including the need to manage high thermal loads for
fire resistant clothing and provide impact resistance for body armor and police
protection. The project will expose the student interns to the design of
composite materials specifically tailored for extreme environments, their
specialized fabrication, performance testing, and methods to introduce multi-
functionality through nano-technology. To recruit the student interns, the PIs
will collaborate with three universities and a community college for focused
recruiting of underrepresented groups, along with broad advertising to peer
institutions.
