This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant. The award permits
undergraduate students to participate in a research program in the materials
field under the supervision of faculty members actively engaged in research.
Eight undergraduate students are being recruited from physics departments in the
Southwest United States, with at least three of the openings being reserved for
qualified women, handicapped, and minority students. Students will participate
in a summer program that involves them in research associated with a faculty
member on laser-host materials, electro-optic, photorefractive and colloidal
materials with potential for application in optical systems. The nine areas of
this research include crystal growth, time-resolved site-selection spectroscopy,
optical instabilities, optical characterization of quantum wells and
superlattices, characterization of defect states in compound semiconductors,
thermal transport in optical materials, complex fluids, and colloidal physics
and optical filters. Students will present the results of their research in
university seminars and at national professional society meetings. The program
enhances current research activities as well as adding to the number of
scientifically trained individuals. It is hoped that this hands- on experience
will serve as a stimulus to attract and retain highly-gifted students into
careers in teaching and research.
