Proposal: DMS-9970813 Principal Investigators: Daoxing Xia, Dechao Zheng

Abstract: The principal investigators and colleagues have organized the 15th
Southeastern Analysis Meeting. The conference will be held at Vanderbilt
University in conjunction with the annual Shanks Lectures, which will be
delivered in 1999 by Professor William Arveson of the University of California
at Berkeley. There will be nine plenary speakers at the meeting, all of whom are
well-known mathematicians in analysis. The conference will have special sessions
in operator algebras, operator theory, and harmonic analysis. The scientific
purpose of the conference is to stimulate research in modern analysis and
classical analysis.

The objective of the conference is to bring together not only established and
new researchers, but also advanced graduate students who have begun exploring
the subject. A major aim of the conference is to involve young researchers and
to help them establish their research goals and directions. The participation of
recent Ph.D. recipients and graduate students is a substantial part of the
conference program. The scientific and educational significance of the
conference is evidenced by the wide range of research topics presented, the
diverse participation of researchers from mathematics departments, and the
active participation of graduate students.
