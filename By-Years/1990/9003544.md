The intent of this study is to identify the macromolecules involved in the
regulation of microtubule assembly during the interphase-to- mitosis transition
in developing sea urchin embryos. Unfertilized sea urchin eggs are arrested at
G1 of the first mitotic cycle and have few, if any assembled microtubules
despite a large pool of tubulin subunits. Following fertilization microtubules
of the first cleavage mitotic apparatus are synchronously assembled. Therefore
the developing sea urchin embryo can be viewed as an inducible model system for
studying the regulation of microtubule assembly. It has been recently discovered
that interphase-arrested egg cells contain two novel inhibitors of microtubule
assembly- a minus-end inhibitor and a pH-dependent plus-end inhibitor. The goal
of the proposed research is to isolate and characterize these unique factors
during the cell cycle. Preliminary experiments with such diverse sources as sea
urchin eggs, surf clam oocytes, mouse B16 cultured melanoma cells, squid optic
lobe and mammalian brain tissue suggest that these negative control factors may
exist in all eukaryotic cells, particularly where cytoplasmic microtubules are
rapidly assembled and disassembled in a controlled manner during the cell cycle.
The interconversion of mitotic and interphase microtubule arrays during the cell
cycle is a fundamental problem of cellular morphogenesis. The process is of
obvious importance for cell division but also for developmental processes such
as neuronal growth and plasticity. These studies are expected to increase our
understanding of fundamental mechanisms whereby microtubule assembly is
regulated in the living cell.
