9314729 Dabrowski This award supports a two-year cooperative research program
between Professor Konrad Dabrowski, School of Natural Resources, Ohio State
University, Columbus, Ohio, and Professor Katsumi Tsukamoto, Ocean Research
Institute, University of Tokyo. The objective of the joint research is to see
whether ascorbic acid (vitamin C) affects the survival and performance of
salmonoid fish. Most of the studies will be done on an endemic Japanese species
(ayu) that completes its life cycle in one year, and results with these fish
will be compared to that of other species in the United States. The results of
these studies will be important in determining the role of ascorbic acid in
endurance, protein utilization, and response to stress. This information is of
basic biological interest but is also of great importance to commercial fish
hatcheries. ***
