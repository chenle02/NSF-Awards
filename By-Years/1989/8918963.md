Dynorphin A is a polypeptide which has recently been detected throughout the
mammalian neuraxis, with relatively high concentrations in the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord. It is thought to be the endogenous ligand for the kappa opioid
receptor. However, it is unique among endogenous opioids in that intrathecally
administered dynorphin results in antinociceptive properties in rats and
disturbances of motor function with flaccid hindlimb paralysis. Dr. Lawrence
Isaac will investigate the opioid and non-opioid actions of dynorphin A by
studying the fragments of this peptide and investigating their behavioral
actions. The delineation of the pharmacological effects of dynorphin is
important since this substance can be used as a pain killer if it's neurotoxic
properties are understood and brought under control.
