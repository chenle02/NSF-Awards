The research is in the area of critical phenomena, a branch of condensed matter
physics. The work consists in development of a method for the Monte Carlo
diagonalization of huge matrices. Application is to an array of problems of high
current interest in surface physics. The method is of multicisciplinary
relevance, being related to techniques currently used to investigate the
chemistry of many-electron systems. In addition the proposal encompasses various
topics in the theory of phase transitions both of purely theoretical and of
experimental importance.
