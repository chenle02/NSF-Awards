The psychology department curricula are advanced by the establishment of a
computer laboratory in human experimental psychology. A network of personal
computers is used in teaching the research process and in the application of the
research process in laboratory courses. The beneficiaries of the proposal are:
(a) traditional psychology majors, who are required to participate in a three or
four semester sequence of research courses, and (b) Human Factors and
Psychobiology majors, who have special requirements in research. The proposal
has direct impact on these students through the following courses: Research
Methods, Experimental Psychology, Human Learning and Memory,Sensation and
Perception, Physiological Psychology, Experimental Life-span Psychology, and
Human Cognition. The award will be matched by an equal amount from the grantee.
