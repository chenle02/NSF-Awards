The main goal of the project is to investigate new techniques for establishing
universality limits for random matrices, in the unitary case. A probability
distribution is placed on the space of n by n Hermitian matrices, leading to
possibly dependent entries - as distinct from the case of independently
distributed entries. One then studies the correlation of spacing of m-tuples of
eigenvalues, especially when m is fixed, and the size n of the matrix approaches
infinity. The conjectured limit, which in the bulk of the spectrum involves the
sinc kernel, is called a universality limit, because it is independent of the
point and the underlying measure. One main goal is to prove this universality in
the bulk under minimal conditions on the underlying distribution, using new
techniques developed by the investigator. Another more challenging goal involves
analogous questions at the endpoints of the spectrum, or at points inside the
spectrum, where the underlying distribution exhibits irregularities.

Universality limits first rose to prominence in the work of the physicist Eugene
Wigner. He was trying to model scattering of neutrons off heavy nuclei. Because
of the large number of interactions, it seemed natural to try a probabilistic
model. Remarkably, eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices turned out to be an
appropriate setting, and orthogonal polynomials were a key tool in the analysis.
Subsequently random matrices have been connected with number theory, and the
zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and also with other topics. The project's
outcomes should also be of interest in other disciplines where random matrices
arise. It is also hoped that graduate and undergraduate students will become
involved in the research.
