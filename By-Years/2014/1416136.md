The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to empower individuals to make financially
sound healthcare decisions; helping them navigate the otherwise convoluted and
confusing healthcare cost landscape by enabling them to manage, plan, and better
understand healthcare expenditures and budget for upcoming and future costs.
This project takes a data-driven approach, developing sophisticated, innovative,
and large-scale data mining and machine learning algorithms to automatically
learn a plethora of cost patterns from over a 100 million healthcare records.

The proposed project will provide a user-friendly, engaging interface for
individuals to manage and understand healthcare expenses for themselves and
their families. By bringing together ideas in data mining, machine learning and
natural language processing to enable our technology, we make fundamental
progress in research and development in the field of healthcare informatics. The
anticipated results are the development of an algorithmic suite that can be used
to model and predict the nature of healthcare costs across regional boundaries
and demographic groups in the United States.
