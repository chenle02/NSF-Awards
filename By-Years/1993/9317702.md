9317702 Taylor This project investigates the dynamics of mathematical models of
metapopulations of insect predator-prey interactions. Previous theory has shown
metapopulations can be more persistent than isolated populations, but such
theory has been based on excessively simple assumptions about spatial structure.
This project attempts to make metapopulation models more realistic by including
complex spatial structure in models. The project will also attempt to develop a
better understanding of the causes of metapopulation persistence and
asynchronous fluctuations in population size. %%% This research is important
because it will help in the development of more realistic population models;
most natural populations show some degree of spatial subdivision, yet current
models do not take this into account. The results can be directly applied to
biological pest control and to conservation biology. Improved understanding of
when and why metapopulations persist should enhance our ability to manage pest
populations and conserve populations of endangered species. ***
