This project will explore the application of heterogeneous memory architectures
to reduce power consumption while maintaining adequate response times in
embedded computer systems. The slower response times of memory devices as
compared to the speeds of processing elements is recognized as a major
performance bottleneck. Power used by memory devices, especially static power,
is recognized as a major source of energy consumption in computers. There are a
variety of different types of memory technologies, each occupying a discrete
point in a multidimensional trade-off space represented by parameters such as
memory access latency, memory bandwidth, power consumption, memory lifetime, and
cost of memory devices. Heterogeneous memory systems represent a potentially
transformative development because combining several different types of memory
opens up a much broader range of this trade-off space. The focus of this
preliminary study is on efficient use of heterogeneous memory types in a
scratch-pad memory. Expected outcomes include: 1) A new heterogeneous memory
hierarchy that integrates on-chip Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Magnetic
Random Access Memory (MRAM), Zero-capacitor RAM (Z-RAM) technologies, as well as
off-chip DRAM. 2) a set of algorithms that achieve allocation for optimal memory
access speed or efficient space utilization. 3) a simulation toolkit that
integrates commonly used simulation benchmarks, such as MiBench, PARSEC, and
MediaBench.

The broader impacts of this research include potential for contributing
technology that reduces energy consumption for current embedded computing
applications, and may enable more advanced future embedded computing systems
within energy, power, and thermal dissipation constraints. The project will
integrate research with graduate education, both in the classroom and through
direct participation of students in the research. It will include collaborations
with researchers at IBM, Pacific Northwest Laboratories, and Intel.
