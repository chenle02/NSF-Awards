&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diversity of model systems presents both
challenges and opportunities for applying comparative and phylogenetic
approaches to questions in plant functional genomics. New methodologies are
needed in order to describe features of biological sequences and maps across
multiple organisms that are related by a known phylogeny, as opposed to making
either simple pair-wise comparisons or 'flat' comparisons among multiple
organisms that ignore the presence of phylogenetic structure. This research
focuses on two test applications of phylogenomics: (1) identifying conserved
motifs and residues that define particular lineages within a gene family and (2)
reconstructing genome rearrangement events along a phylogeny in such a way as to
be able to predict gene content and order in sparsely sampled genomes. Because
some of the methodology proposed is computationally intensive and requires the
integration of data from a variety of public sources, this work is complemented
by the development of an online plant phylogenomics database called Phytome. In
collaboration with the Partnership for Minority Advancement in the Biosciences,
an inquiry-based K-12 educational module is developed and delivered to targeted
public schools in North Carolina through a mobile science teaching laboratory.
