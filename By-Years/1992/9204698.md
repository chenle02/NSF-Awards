Flavoenzymes catalyze a wide variety of metabolically significant reactions.
Flavoprotein oxidases are among the simplest of these enzymes, catalyzing the
transfer of a hydride equivalent from their substrates to molecular oxygen to
form hydrogen peroxide. The research proposed here will develop methods
utilizing kinetic isotope effects on steady state and rapid reaction kinetics to
examine the mechanisms of flavoprotein oxidases, using D-amino acid oxidase
(DAAO) as a model. The PI will determine the pH dependence of the V/K values and
of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on the V/K values with
D-alanine, D-serine, and glycine; determine if the maximal observed isotope
effects are the intrinsic values; measure secondary deuterium kinetic isotope
effects in order to determine if carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and flavin
reduction in D-amino acid oxidase are stepwise or concerted; and replace the
native FAD with artificial flavins with different redox potentials and determine
the intrinsic isotope effects. These methods will then be used to evaluate the
results of site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acid residues in DAAO.
They will also be applied to two additional flavoprotein oxidases, tryptophan
monooxygenase and alcohol oxidase, to ascertain their general applicability. %%%
Flavoproteins are a major class of proteins involved in a wide variety of
metabolic processes. Elucidation of the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes
can provide insights into the mechanisms of a number of metabolically
significant enzymes, into the mechanisms of more complex flavoproteins, and into
general biological mechanisms of electron transfer and oxygen activation. This
research will yield information pertaining to the mechanism of flavoprotein
oxidases using kinetic isotope effects to examine the role of specific amino
acid residues in catalysis. General knowledge about flavoprotein carbon-hydrogen
bond cleavage as well as about oxygen activation by flavin and pterin dependent
enzymes will also be generated.
