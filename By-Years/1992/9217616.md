In 1991, the Educational Infrastructure program funded a three-year
collaborative effort between Clemson University, Bowdoin College and University
of Connecticut to investigate two modifications to the first two years of the
undergraduate computer science curriculum. The first modification broadens the
focus of these courses from primarily software development techniques to
consider the breadth of the computer science discipline. The second change
blends the use of scheduled, structured laboratories with the traditional
lecture approach. This approach follows the recent ACM '91 curriculum
recommendations. Project activities will include the development and class-
testing of lecture and text materials, and laboratory materials. The laboratory
exercises will be developed for a variety of educational settings. The results
of the curriculum and materials development will be disseminated through summer
workshops, publications, and presentations at professional meetings. This award
provides additional funds to double the number of participants attending the
first of these workshops.
