9710436 Weir A summer institute in statistical genetics will be held at North
Carolina State University for two weeks in June of 1997, 1998 and 1999. The
institute will consist of a series of two- or three-day workshops designed to
teach current statistical methods to geneticists. As increasing amounts of
molecular genetic data become available, there is an increasing need for
statistical analyses to extract all the information and make inferences. The
need has become urgent in the search for genes affecting both discrete and
quantitative traits, in the interpretation of DNA and protein sequence data for
evolutionary studies, and in the use of genetic profiles for individual
identification. The institute will offer instruction in each of these areas, as
well as in basic statistical concepts. Because long-term progress in
interpreting genetic data is going to require the involvement of people with
advanced statistical training and skills, the institute will also offer a
workshop in basic genetics for statisticians. This application is for funding to
allow students, who would otherwise be unable, to attend the institute.
