This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) grant to examine the social and
economic positions of American Blacks as compared to those of Whites. Many
explanations have been given to explain the discrepancy between the two groups.
Some alternative explanations are: (1) Black dependency upon Federal programs;
(2) social class discrimination; (3) stratification of the work force; and (4)
the high rate of Black female households with children and low incomes. The
planning period will be used by the investigator to analyze the critical
variables that are available in the General Social Survey on Blacks. This grant
will provide support for a well-trained minority sociologist to prepare a
competitive proposal to submit to the MRI research initiation component.
