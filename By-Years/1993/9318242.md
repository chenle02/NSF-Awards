9318242 Bier The goal of this proposal is to understand the function of the
rhomboid (rho) gene that is required for several distinct developmental events
including : early dorsal- ventral pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo,
the formation of embryonic sensory organs, and the formation of adult wing
veins. rho is one of several genes (referred to as ventro-lateral group genes)
required for the formation of these diverse structures. Other ventro-lateral
group genes encode an EGF/TGF alpha type of growth factor (spitz) and the
Drosophila EGF-receptor (egf-r). rho is the only known member of the ventro-
lateral group of genes expressed in a spatially localized pattern corresponding
to the cells requiring the activity of ventro-lateral group genes. rho encodes a
membrane protein (Rho) and may act by amplifying EGF-R signaling in response to
binding the Spitz growth factor. Because the EGF-R signaling pathway has been
highly conserved during evolution it is likely that these studies in Drosophila
will be directly relevant to other species, including humans. The following are
specific research goals for this proposal: 1) Determine the subcellular
localization of the Rho protein. Is the Rho protein located on the cell surface
as predicted for a protein functioning as part of a receptor complex? Is Rho
located at sites of intimate cell- cell contact? 2) Investigate how the Rho
protein functions biochemically and determine whether Rho physically interacts
with other proteins. Does the Rho protein physically interact with other
proteins (e.g. components of the EGF-R signaling pathway)? Is Spi a ligand for
EGF-R? Does Rho mediate differential cell adhesion? 3) Determine whether rho is
dedicated to amplifying Spi-EGF-R signaling or are other signaling pathways also
activated by Rho? Does transcriptional down regulation of components of the
EGF-R pathway depend on rho? ***
