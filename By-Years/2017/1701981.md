The International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software
(ISPASS), a premier forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial research
focused on performance analysis of computer systems and software, seeks to
increase student participation in symposium and the field. The conference will
be held from Apr 23, 2017 - Apr 25, 2017 San Francisco Bay Area, California.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed funding would support the travel of up to 15
eligible US students to the symposium. Support from this grant will be
distributed to students who may otherwise be unable to attend ISPASS. The grant
selection process will give priority to US citizens and permanent residents,
with special consideration to members of underrepresented groups and
participants from universities that do not have a strong tradition in the ISPASS
research domain. Furthermore, support from this grant will also be available to
provide companion funding for attendees with disabilities and/or parental
responsibility for an infant less than one year old. These efforts are
anticipated to broaden the participation in the conference and, by extension,
the research field.
