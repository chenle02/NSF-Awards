Galaxy clusters are the most overdense environments in the universe. As such,
they constitute an extreme laboratory for studying the physical processes that
govern cosmological mass assembly and the formation and evolution of galaxies.
This award will enable a pioneering study of galaxy clusters when the universe
was approximately 3 billion years old, using valuable legacy datasets and new
observations that harness the power of ground-based telescopes (e.g., the Gemini
and Keck Observatories) together with space-based facilities (e.g., the Hubble
Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
emphasizing the close connections between observations and theory, this work
will provide a cornerstone for understanding how galaxies in rich clusters
assemble their stars. It will also provide critical tests of cosmological
structure formation models, and give fresh insights into how inflows and
outflows of gas vary with environment in the distant universe. Ultimately, this
research will lead to a better understanding of when, where, and how star
formation is quenched in cluster galaxies as they evolve into the passive
galaxies that dominate clusters in the nearby universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Principal Investigator and her team will also conduct two pilot programs aimed
at increasing diversity in the science fields. First, the team will produce an
original video series, entitled "I Am Science," which seeks to inspire students
by sharing the personal stories of scientists from all backgrounds. Second, they
will integrate "I Am Science" into the curriculum of the Expanding Your Horizons
program at Texas A&amp;M, in order to bring these inspiring stories to 6th to
8th grade girls.
