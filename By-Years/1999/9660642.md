*** ABSTRACT 9660642 Pirzada This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop a novel process to produce single crystal silicon carbide.
Silicon carbide possesses a unique combination of electrical and thermophysical
properties that make its use in high temperature, high power and high-frequency
electronics applications very attractive. The availability of a single crystal
silicon carbide wafer of the required quality at a reasonable cost will fully
realize the benefits of these devices in many areas of high temperature, high
power microelectronics. During Phase I, the feasibility of this new approach to
producing single crystal silicon carbide will be demonstrated. The technology
will optimized during Phase II with the aim of commercializing the process in
Phase III. Successful development of a cost-effective method for producing
quality single crystal silicon carbide will enable the application of high
temperature, high power microelectronic devices in the automotive, aerospace,
chemical refining, nuclear power, energy production, and other industries. ***
