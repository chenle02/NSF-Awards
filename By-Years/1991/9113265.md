Dr. Heiles will use the 85-foot telescope at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory to
conduct decimeter wavelength studies focussed on the 21-cm line of neutral
atomic hydrogen. The studies include measurement of interstellar magnetic fields
using the Zeeman effect, studies of expanding shells with sensitive observations
of the line wings, studies of H-alpha emitting features in the 21-cm line, and
extensive mapping of interstellar structures. Other interstellar work includes
confirmation of a probable detection of the 327 MHz line of neutral deuterium
and a search for the 310 MHz lines of deuterated hydroxyl. Dr. Heiles will also
continue an intensive monitoring of the synchrotron emission of the planet
Jupiter to measure the properties of the probable short-term variability which
he may have recently discovered.
