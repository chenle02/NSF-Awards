9320054 Hiltner This "TIE" project funds a research project to be performed
jointly by Case Western Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Applied Polymers Research and the State University of New
York - Buffalo's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Biosurfaces. This project is a collaborative study of surface interactions that
will lead to an elucidation of relationships between biomaterial surface
properties and blood protein and monocyte/macrophage adhesion and activation.
The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied Polymers will be
responsible for the biological characterization both before and following
protein adsorption. The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Biosurfaces will be responsible for surface characterization both before and
following protein adsorption and cell adhesion. The researchers are very well
qualified to perform this joint project. Additional funding is provided by the
U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
Office to obtain a non-voting membership in the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Applied Polymers Research. The Program Manager recommends
Case Western Reserve University be awarded $25,000 for the first year of a two-
year continuing award. An additional $10,000 is recommended for one year with
funding provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.
