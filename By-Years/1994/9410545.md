9410545 Ausubel This research will attempt to capture the essential features of
principal-agent relationships by studying a sequential recontracting game
between a seller of a divisible good and a buyer whose type may influence the
number of units that it is efficient to trade. One key aspect of the model is
that the players can make the trade prescribed by the current contract while
still negotiating a new contract. The research emphasis include: - Analysis of
the sequential contracting game under incomplete information. - Extending the
analysis to account for other types of agency problems, such as those
incorporating moral hazard or relation- specific investments. - Application of
the analysis to the principal-agent problem between the shareholders and
management of a corporation, and to other areas of substantive economic
interest. This study is important because the issue of recontracting is
fundamental to our understanding of the imporatnce of property rights.
