9732868 Hopp This grant focuses on development of a theoretically founded
framework for the design and implementation of effective production policies for
workers in agile workforce systems. Such systems include a wide range of
organizations that utilize cross-trained workers and possibly dynamic task
assignment/job-processing to respond to changes in system workload. The scope of
our research includes: (1) constructing a detailed classification scheme for
manufacturing and service environments that identifies key characteristics
germane to the selection of a workforce policy, and (2) creating and analyzing a
series of models with which to predict the performance of various policies in
various environments and thereby gain insight into the factors that determine
their efficacy. The primary focus of the research will be on logistical
efficiency (e.g., maximizing performance in terms of throughput, flowtime, or
work-in-process for a given workforce size). Because this research will be
carried out in close collaboration with several industrial practitioners, real
world considerations such as motivational effects, human factors, and managerial
complexity will be addressed as well. The models and classification scheme
developed through this research will provide benefits that include: (1)
managerial insights into why and where agility in the workforce is effective,
(2) a set of useful analytical models (performance predictors, quantification of
opportunity, and near-optimal policies/organization schemes) to assist engineers
in the analysis/design of agile work systems, and (3) extension of the queueing
and systems modeling technology base to include classes of systems where
machines and labor interact in new ways for productivity improvement. Technology
transfer will occur through practitioner and research oriented publications,
direct contact with industrial sponsors, and teaching efforts to instill well-
founded principles of workforce agility in the minds of future engineering and
manageme nt practitioners.
