Kinzler 9314626 Motivated by the concern how melting near sp/gt lherzolite
transition and magma extraction processes will control major and trace elements
in magmas, the PIs propose a 4-step approach in this project to study magma
generation processes at mid-oceanic ridges. The PIs will perform simple phase
equilibrium experiments at 17-40 kbar, parameterize the results, use simple 2-D
and 3-D transport models to examine how trace element abundances in magmas will
be affected, and, finally, work out the mass and energy conservation of the
models.
