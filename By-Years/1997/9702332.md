This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research and education plans of Patrick J. Farmer at the
University of California at Irvine. The goal of the proposed research is to
understand new biomimetic chemistry of myoglobin (Mb) contained within a film on
an electrode. Such Mb-films have electrocatalytic nitrite and sulfite reductase
activity. By using modified myoglobins, functionally active structural models
for the reductases will be studied by electrochemical methods. Aims of the
research include identifying the nature of intermediates leading to N-N and S-S
products and to probe oxygen atom transfer reactions from reduced Fe-bound N-
and S-oxide intermediates. Modified myoglobins in thin films will be used as
models of nitrite and sulfite reductase enzymes. An undergraduate course aimed
at students interested in health-related careers will be developed and a
training program for graduate students instituted involving collaborative
research, rotations in research laboratories and seminars.
