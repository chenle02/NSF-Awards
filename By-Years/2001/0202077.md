0202077 Rabideau This research involves adding reactive transport modeling to a
grid-free flow model, and the decoupling of ground water flow, advection, and
dispersion. The overall approach is original using modular code design. A
modular grid-free ground water model would be able to handle problems with
multiple spatial and temporal scales. It should eliminate or lessen
computational problems that exist with current finite-element/finite-difference
codes. The code will also take advantage of parallel processing architecture,
which will help in long-term simulations. The proposal presents a well-organized
set of work, and builds on work currently in progress. The model testing and
benchmarking will be done on a problem that involves multiple scales. The PIs
have experience in coding these types of algorithms, and experience in sorption
and vertical barriers.
