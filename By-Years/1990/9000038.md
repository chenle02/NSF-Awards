This research is part of an on-going program by the principal investigator and
associates. Topics in the following areas are to be considered: (1) controlled
Markov diffusions and nonlinear PDEs; (2) asymptotic properties of nearly
deterministic Markov processes; (3) financial economics applications; (4)
singular stochastic control; (5) computational methods in stochastic control;
(6) stochastic calculus of variations; (7) nonlinear estimation. Analytical
methods based on viscosity solution techniques for nonlinear differential
equations as well as probabilistic methods will be studied. These theoretical
studies are the basis for applied problems ranging from decisions at the stock
market level to the control of spaceships.
