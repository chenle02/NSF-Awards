This award supports travel and participation for 15 US-based students and
postdoctoral scholars to the 10th International Conference on Preconditioning
Techniques for Scientific and Industrial Applications, which will be held July
31st to August 2nd, 2017 at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver,
Canada. The conference itself has support from the Pacific Institute for
Mathematical Sciences (PIMS); this award is co-funded by NSF CISE CCF and MPS
DMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific and engineering analysis and simulation
tasks are often modeled as large systems of equations to be solved;
increasingly, these are solved by iterative methods that refine initial guesses.
Preconditioning techniques bias the refinements for faster convergence -- they
can use quite deep mathematical connections to the sparsity and structure of the
matrices that represent the equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
Preconditioning meetings gather participants from academia, research labs, and
industry. (E.g., due to location and topic, a large group are expected from
Boeing in Washington.) The resulting mix of participants leads to a healthy
exchange of ideas ? with practitioners bringing new, harder, problems to the
fore as well as specialized algorithms for handling them, while the algorithms
developers and theory researchers emphasize analysis and rigor in what they
present. This interaction benefits students who may consider careers in any of
these areas.
