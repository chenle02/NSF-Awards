9352317 Frech The introduction of the use of a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer is
filling a major gap in the curriculum in the chemistry department. Two phases of
implementation of the new instrument into the program are being carried out in
order to instruct students at various levels of NMR expertise. In the first
phase, NMR theory and techniques are being presented in a seminar course
required for chemistry majors and available to all interested students and
instrument users. Applications of the instrument specific to the areas of
Organic and Instrumental Analysis are being added to the NMR material already
presented in these courses. A second phase of integration of NMR into the
undergraduate curriculum includes the introduction of specialized experiments
designed for Inorganic, Physical, Biochemistry, and General Chemistry
laboratories. In addition, the NMR spectrometer is serving as a key component in
an Integrated Laboratory capstone course for Chemistry majors as well as in
undergraduate Directed Research projects. Students from several nearby, smaller
universities also are using this instrument for instruction and research
applications. ***
