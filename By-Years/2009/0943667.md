A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Marcus Langseth, a 235' Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic
operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The
award includes the following five items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Sound Source
Umbilicals&lt;br/&gt;2) MCS Digital Air Management Manifolds&lt;br/&gt;3) MCS
Streamer Level Device Upgrade &lt;br/&gt;4) Sound Source Umbilicals x
4&lt;br/&gt;5) Vane Tow Wire &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers. The enhansements to the seismic
source array of R/V Langseth will provide the vessel with heightened abilities
to perform state-of-the-are seismic reseach. She is the only vessel in the world
that is dedicated to scientific research and capable of performing 3D seismic
exploration.
