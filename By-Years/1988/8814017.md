The main objective of this project is to create a computational environment in
which calculus students will use the computer as both a tutoring device and a
computational aid. The system will consist of two components: a powerful user
interface to a symbolis mathematics package and graphical display routines; and
tutorial modules. In this one year planning grant, a study on how the computer
can be best integrated into the calculus curriculum, and a prototypical course
module on the topic of integration will be completed. Students will be
introduced to important techniques using symbolic computation facilities. The
graphical and numerical capabilities will demonstrate several numerical
integration techniques. Real world examples from several client disciplines will
be used to motivate topics. University of Rhode Island will provide 40% of the
project cost.
