This equipment project will provide state-of-the-science instrumentation needed
for advanced research in the analysis and the design of communications and
signal processing systems. The instrumentation consists of a floating point
array processor, a host micro-vax computer, several output devices (graphics
terminals, printer, plotter) and software packages. The equipment will
considerably speed up the computationally intensive tasks associated with
analyzing communication and signal processing systems.
