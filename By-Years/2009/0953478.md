Computer technology is rapidly permeating all spheres of society. A computer
system that affects the lives of thousands or millions of people creates a
massive community of users who have an interest in the correct behavior of that
system. Widespread interconnectivity means that we now have the ability to tap
this potential.

This work confronts the challenge of diagnosing and mitigating concurrency bugs.
A suite of novel instrumentation schemes will be developed for monitoring thread
interleaving patterns. Coupled with statistical debugging models developed
previously, this lets developers identify bad thread interleavings which
constitute root causes of program failure. A new approach to coordinated cross-
thread random sampling keeps overheads low while still providing ample data for
diagnosis. Static analysis will play a role to further reduce instrumentation
load. Prior statistical debugging work was content with diagnosis only, but this
project will develop a speculative locking strategy, guided by the statistical
models, to avoid and thereby mitigate the effects of a variety of concurrency
bugs.
