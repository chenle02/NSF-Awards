This project will support the 14th International Conference on Arabidopsis
Research, which will be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison on June
20-24, 2003. The aim is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas
among researchers of the international Arabidopsis community. The conference
will include sessions on genetics, genomics, metabolism, metabolic regulation,
cell biology, inductive processes, genetic mechanisms, evolution, pattern
formation, cell fate, reproduction, and responses to the biotic and aboitic
environment. An important component of the conference is the presentation of
current research by approximately 42 speakers. Graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers or junior faculty will present the majority of these talks. This
will ensure presentation of the latest results, promote education of students
and postdoctoral fellows and provide important career development for the
selected speakers. This project will primarily support attendance of young
scientists and of researchers from minority-serving institutions.
