The investigator will continue his research in set theory and the foundations
of mathematics. The work on this project will be mostly in the theory of large
cardinals and forcing and will concentrate, among others, on the study of
singular cardinals, stationary sets, normal filters, elementary embeddings, and
iterated forcing.
