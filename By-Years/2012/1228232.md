With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Joel Mague from Tulane University and colleagues Robert Pascal, Bruce Gibb and
James Donahue will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a
CCD detector and a micro-source. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research
training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis
and structural characterization of complex inorganic molecules; (b) probing
limits of synthesis of large, complex inorganic molecules by modular methods;
(c) synthesis of sterically hindered thiolate ligands for the stabilization of
coordinately unsaturated metal centers of biological significance; (d) assembly
and binding properties of deep-cavity cavitands; (e) hydroxycarboxylate
complexes of lanthanide metal; and (f) unusual structure and bonding in complex
aromatic molecules.

A crystal X-ray diffractometer probes a solid sample with a beam of X-rays to
produce a pattern of diffracted rays. This pattern can be deconvoluted to give
the chemical structure of the crystalline material. Thus, bond distances and
angles between atoms in the crystal can be obtained. This information provides
insight into the properties and possible uses of the material. This acquisition
will provide faculty and students with modern instrumentation not currently
available at the institution and advance their research efforts. It will be used
in an undergraduate laboratory course training significant numbers of students.
The instrument will used by researchers at Tulane University, Loyola University
and Xavier University in New Orleans as well as collaborators at other
institutions.
