9552978 Scott ABSTRACT: This funding is for a planning phase of the Genome Radio
Project, a multifaceted project that will produce 17 1/2 hours of radio
programming, plus a variety of printed and electronic ancillary materials,
exploring the science and social implications of human genetic research. The
planning grant will enable the project team to develop further five key areas: o
To work with advisors to define their process of editorial oversight and their
involvement in the program ppoduction process; o To produce a half-hour
documentary pilot program; o To use the pilot program to solidify distribution
agreement with networks and major market stations; o To develop ancillary
materials to accompany the pilot program and to determine mechanisms for the
distribution of these materials; and o To conduct focus group evaluation of the
pilot program and to define specific evaluation plans for the broader series.
