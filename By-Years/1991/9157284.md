This grant supports basic experimental research on: (1) Coastal Erosion -
Investigate Wave/Sediment process in swash zone based on large wave-tank
experiments. (2) Environmental loading on ocean structures - investigate wave
interaction with cylinders through experiments on fluid pressures near surface,
interaction of drag and inertia forces, and effect of wave groups on structure
motions.
