Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty in this project are
developing three creative learning modules in Second Life on topics in computer
security: (1) a learning module to improve students' understanding of what can
be done to help businesses protect themselves against obvious security threats;
(2) a learning module to develop a deep understanding of the inner workings of
complex security software and hardware; and (3) a learning module that promotes
awareness and education of security issues using Second Life as a digital
storytelling platform. This project is based on the results of a prior project
by the Principal Investigators in which they developed a prototype security
learning environment using Second Life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are using
the principles of design science to develop new design theories of a security
education environment and the principles of learning science to develop new
learning theories in three learning dimensions: information states, security
services, and security countermeasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
expected to have a positive influence on general information technology and
security education and training in broader scientific and engineering
communities throughout the nation.
