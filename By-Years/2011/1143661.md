Bess Koffman will travel to Cornell University and Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University for the purpose of exploring possible
postdoctoral research with two potential sponsoring scientists. Dr. Natalie
Mahowald (Cornell) is an atmospheric dust modeler and Dr. Steven Goldstein is an
isotope geochemist. The travel, which includes four days at each institution
will help Ms. Koffman choose between the two different approaches to address
research questions about dust transport, atmospheric circulation and climate in
the southern hemisphere, as she works to establish her future research
directions in paleoclimate science.
