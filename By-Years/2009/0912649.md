This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will develop
underlying technologies that will enable Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) to navigate
inside houses and buildings. This technology, applied to emergency response
situations, will save the lives of police officers, victims, and suspects.
Emergency response teams have been slow to adopt unmanned systems to aid in
hostage situations, search and rescue, fire fighting, and armed standoffs. The
impediment is the capabilities of the available unmanned system. Available
ground robots are halted by rough terrain, large steps, and closed doors.
Current UAVs can only be used outdoors. If UAVs could also take on indoor
applications, they would surpass the capabilities of the ground robots as UAVs
can traverse over any terrain, over any step, and enter and exit a building
through any opening (including high windows). The technologies needed to enable
for small UAVS to perform indoor missions are: indoor flight control and safety
around people, which are the areas of the research proposed.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will prevent the loss of life in dangerous
situations by reducing emergency response teams' exposure to lethal situations,
by increasing the amount of situational information available to emergency
response teams, by reducing the level of anxiety of besieged suspects, and by
allowing remote inspection of places and things that are harmful to
humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;
