This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the
Office of Polar Programs, provides support for a group international travel
award to facilitate participation of U.S. scientists in the 9th International
Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences to be held in Potsdam, Germany, 8 -12
September, 2003. The U.S. Antarctic Program supports many cutting edge research
projects in Antarctica each year and the results of these projects are relevant
to this international conference. The conference affords the opportunity for
U.S. scientists to both present their results and see what other researchers
around the world are doing in Antarctgica. Consequently, a strong U.S. presence
is warranted. Funds to cover airfare for approximately 25 scientists are
provided in this award. Decisions about individuals to be supported on this
award will be made based on competitive applications to present results.
