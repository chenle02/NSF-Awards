The influence of various hydrodynamic effects on the speed, shape, stability,
and extinction limits of premixed flames will be investigated. Asymptotic,
perturbation, and spectral methods will be employed to reduce the flame-flow
interaction problems, which are governed by nonlinear two- and three-
dimensional partial differential equations, to simple approximate problems
tractable analytically or numerically. The dynamics of premixed flames
propagating through single and multi-scale systems of eddies and the associated
cascade renormalization concept of turbulent flame speed will be emphasized. The
influence of rotation on counterflow premixed flames will also be studied, with
the analysis compared to recent experimental observations. The rapid development
of computational facilities is making it possible to apply sophisticated
mathematical analysis to more complex, and realistic, combustion problems. The
theoretical research being performed with this grant will tackle highly relevant
problems associated with the propagation of stretched and turbulent flames.
