Funds are requested for a micro-Raman spectrometer with diode array detection
to be installed in the Department of Chemistry at Arizona State University. The
Raman-spectrometer system will be designed to allow spectroscopy of samples
subjected to ultra-high pressures in a diamond-anvil cell apparatus. Research on
the instrument will focus on the characterization of materials considered likely
candidates as phases in the Earth's deep mantle and the effect of pressure on
their stability, structure and physical properties. The Arizona State University
will provide 60% of the funds for the equipment, and NSF will provide the
remaining 40%.
