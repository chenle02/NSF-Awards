This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University purchase laser equipment.
This equipment will be used in the following research activities: 1. Light
Induced Charge Separation in Model and Biological Systems 2. Charge Separated
Electron Transfer in Biomimetic Model Compounds 3. Solvent Dynamics of Non-
Adiabatic Charge Separated Electron Transfer 4. Experimental and Theoretical
Approaches to Specific Solvation of Charge Separated Electron Transfer Complexes
5. Proton Coupled Charge Separated Electron Transfer Lasers emit a narrow beam
of coherent, powerful and nearly monochromatic electromagnetic radiation. This
radiation is used in Chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the
dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron transfer processes, and
from interfacial chemistry to picosecond pulse shaping. Lasers are also useful
in optics, communications, and engineering.
