This project consists of laboratory studies of the kinetics and mechanism of the
reaction of OH (hydroxyl radical) with pinenes, which are important biogenic
hydrocarbons. In the atmosphere, these reactions lead to the production of
numerous products, including radicals, however, the details of the mechanism are
not well understood. Relative rate measurements will be carried out in a small
quartz chamber with direct sampling of the gas mixture and mass spectrometric
detection as well as GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) analysis of
compounds with low volatility. These studies can be carried out at various
temperatures. Studies of the reactions of some of the reaction products
(pinonaldehyde, nopinone) themselves with OH are also planned. Absolute
measurements of the rate coefficients will be carried out using the turbulent
flow technique. The results of this study will improve our knowledge of the
details of the oxidation mechanisms and will be valuable in determining the
efficiency of these biogenic hydrocarbons in the production of photochemical
smog.
