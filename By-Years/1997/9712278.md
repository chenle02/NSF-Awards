This proposal is to evaluate the sensitivity of sulfur isotopes to several
geologic processes which contribute to the formation of mid-ocean ridge basalts
(MORB) on a global scale, and to use sulfur isotope variations to constrain the
processes of assimilation and recycling in MORB and their mantle sources. The
stable isotopes of sulfur (mainly 32S and 34S) are fractionated by many low-
temperature processes such as chemical alteration, degassing and rock-seawater
interactions, but are not fractionated by high-temperature processes such as
partial melting and fractional crystallization. As a result, sulfur isotopes in
MORB can be used as sensitive tracers of (1) assimilation of seawater sulfur in
mid-ocean ridge magma chambers, and (2) recycling of sediments and oceanic crust
through the upper mantle and back into the source regions of MORB. We will use
high-precision ion microprobe measurements of sulfur isotopes in primitive
immiscible sulfides from MORB glasses worldwide to define the global variability
of sulfur isotopes in MORB, and examine the relationships of these variations to
assimilation, crustal thickness, spreading rate, and proximity to hotspots.
