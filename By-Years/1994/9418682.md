9418682 Merritts This project will study the active tectonics of the Mendocino
triple junction in northern California. Many of the faults in this part of
coastal California are poorly documented and understood, and this study will map
them, conduct geodetic surveying, analyse the Quaternary deformation and analyse
seismicity patterns. Results from the fieldwork will be incorporated into
computer models that will test competing hypotheses about the tectonics of this
region. The results will further our understanding of plate tectonic processes
and earthquake hazards in actively deforming regions of the earth s crust.
