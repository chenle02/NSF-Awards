The proposed research is an investigation into the nonlinear optical properties
of selected semiconductor superlattices. The work will specifically focus on
optically induced changes near the excitonic resonances in II-VI compound
semiconductors such as (Zn, Mn)Se and (Cd, Mn)Te. These materials are unique in
that strongly coupled electronic and magnetic excitations are optically
accessible. The proposed studies combine two aspects of new and advanced
research, first, the use of sophisticated transient optical techniques on
picosecond and femtosecond timescale, and second, the spectroscopy of novel
ultrathin semiconductor layered superlattice structures. The basic portion of
the work involves the characterization of the largely unknown exciton kinetics
on such timescale while the more applied part focuses on the enhancement of the
sought transient nonlinearities in a high density magnetically oriented exciton
system. The longer term impact of this research includes possibilities for
ultrafast optical switches and logic elements.
