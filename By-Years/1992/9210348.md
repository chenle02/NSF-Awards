Ciliary neurotrophic factor, CNTF, is a protein known to promote survival and
differentiation of specific classes of neurons grown in culture, as well as to
affect the development of glial cells. The basic molecular mechanisms for the
effects of CNTF are not known. A simple, easily accessible system, human
neuroblastoma tumor cells, will be used to identify CNTF receptors. In addition,
a pharmacological approach will be taken to characterize the intracellular
mechanisms involved in transducing the CNTF signal to affect cell physiology.
The regulation of CNTF receptors by neurotransmitters and ion channel ligands,
as well as during phorbol ester induced cell differentiation will also be
studied. These studies promise to provide fundamental knowledge about factors
crucial to the development, survival, regeneration and aging of specific types
of cells in the nervous system.
