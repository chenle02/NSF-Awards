Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include an
investigation of dynamical symmetry breaking, a non- perturbative analysis of
quantum chromodynamics (the candidate theory of the strong nuclear force),
studies of string theory, and work in quantum field theory. The research
incorporates a number of unusual and innovative approaches to important problems
in our development of a better understanding of the elementary particles and the
basic forces.
