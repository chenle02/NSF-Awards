AST-0808877&lt;br/&gt;Babu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2008 Summer School in Statistics
for Astronomers; June 9-14, 2008; Pennsylvania State University, College
Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observational astronomers continually confront a wide
range of challenging statistical problems. Due to the structure of undergraduate
and graduate curricula, U.S. astronomers are not well trained in statistics, and
most of them learn elementary methods through books written by and for physical
scientists. Advanced methods are badly underutilized: statistics is an available
technology that should be tapped to advance the needs of astronomy and
astrophysics. The 2008 Summer School for young astronomers in statistical
inference at an intermediate level helps to alleviate this educational gap,
continuing the intensive week-long Summer Schools in Statistics for Astronomers,
initiated in 2005 by the group at Pennsylvania State. The school gives a broad
exposure to fundamental concepts and a wide range of resulting methods across
many fields of statistics. Experienced statistics professors will teach an
innovative curriculum, accompanied by software tutorials with applications to
astronomical datasets. This will have a substantial impact on the training of
many young researchers.
