The project consists of four parts: nonlinear partial differential equations,
calculus of variations in nonlinear elasticity, stochastic control and
stochastic functional differential equations. In the nonlinear partial
differential equations part the investigators want to study the existence of
radially symmetric solutions of two special Dirichlet problems for quasilinear
elliptic equations, one of which contains a mean curvature operator. They would
like to obtain the same results as Serrin, Peletier and Ni, using the calculus
of variations rather than methods based on ordinary differential equations. In
the nonlinear elasticity part the authors propose to re- examine certain issues
in 3-dimensional nonlinear elasticity, which give rise to the one dimensional
variational methods. They propose to use the connection between the elastic
cavitation effect discovered by Ball and a higher dimensional form of the
Lavrentiev's phenomenon. In the two stochastic parts the investigators want to
study Bolza problems with regular or singular control, and to apply these ideas
to another class of integrands for variational problems. They plan to
incorporate memory effects in their analysis and use Hilbert space methods in
the analysis of stochastic functional differential equations. This research
effort belongs to applied analysis and calculus of variations, two branches of
mathematics that come in contact with physical problems such as elasticity. Both
investigators are senior experienced scientists with a lot of credit for their
previous mathematical accomplishments.
