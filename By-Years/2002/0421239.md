With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Physical and Life Science at Texas A&amp;M University in Corpus
Christi will acquire an atomic absorption (AA) graphite furnace and microwave
digestor. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including
studies on a) metal-stress response mechanisms in plants; b) the distribution
and fate of endocrine disrupting compounds in the environment; and c)
contaminant measurements in former uranium mines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic
absorption spectroscopy allows chemists to determine the concentration of metals
at environmental sensitive levels. Thus these studies will have a significant
impact in environmentally chemistry. The instrument will also be used in
undergraduate and graduate laboratory courses. &lt;br/&gt;
