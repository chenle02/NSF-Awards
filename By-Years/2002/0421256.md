This award supports the acquisition of equipment to be used in the development
of a plant growth facility that will facilitate research, training and
educational activities in the Department of Biological, Geological, and
Environmental Sciences at Cleveland State University (CSU). The plant growth
facility includes walk-in growth chambers, reach-in growth chambers, a seed
storage chamber, and seed germinators. The facility will strengthen the
departmental research program in molecular and organismal biology, ecology, and
evolutionary biology. With the acquisition of growth facility, the graduate and
undergraduate students and faculty members will be able to conduct more
comprehensive and controlled experiments in order to better understand the
mechanisms and impacts of species invasion, evolution of breeding systems,
effects of environmental pollutants at the population and community levels,
ecological processes in urban wetlands, and molecular mechanisms of plant
responses to cold stress. The plant growth facility will particularly strengthen
research of undergraduate students in our Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) program. The facility will also render academic support for
classes and laboratories in several courses in environmental science, molecular
methodology, and plant biology.
