The objective of this project is to advance the study of public understanding of
science by analyzing how lay and expert advocates of alternative cancer
therapies evaluate their scientific merit in the context of general social
values. The project will draw on the science and technology studies and cultural
and medical anthropology literatures on boundary-work and cultural
reconstruction. It will extend those literatures by examining how an
anthropology of public understandings of science can be made relevant to issues
of public policy. Methodologically, the empirical research will involve two
phases: a review of public literature and conference presentations, and in-
depth, ethnographic interviews with many of the leading figures in the
alternative cancer therapies movement. Interviews will cover a wide spectrum of
views, including some mainstream critics. They will focus on the scientific or
technical criteria used to distinguish good and bad research and therapies, and
how these criteria are negotiated with general values such as cost,
availability, side effects and quality of life, and a concern with
`naturalness.` The hypothesis is that public discourse in this area will reveal
sophisticated understandings of science. Policy implications for analysis
include the question of paternalism in funding and regulatory procedures and the
general problem of democratizing scientific production for various areas of
scientific research and funding. Results will be reported to the academic
community, the alternative cancer community, and the general public.
