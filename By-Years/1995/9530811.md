This project develops a new class of data acquisition systems with user
configurable hardware. The primary development effort is the creation of
software tools which will enable scientists and engineers who are not skilled
hardware designers to utilize such systems. Some of the primary research issues
are the development of techniques for specifying and analyzing timing behavior
between fixed and configurable hardware and the development of techniques for
designing robust interfaces. A typical application of this work is a
reconfigurable data acquisition card consisting of a fixed analog section and a
configurable digital section built from one or more field programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) and static RAM chips. Existing data acquisition cards are
generally used by scientists and engineers who are not skilled hardware
designers; however, the currently available tools for FPGAs require significant
digital design experience. For a reconfigurable data acquisition card to be
useful, it is necessary that the configuration tools accept as input high level
programming language which is accessible to a competent programmer. Any custom
hardware necessary to interface the analog sections or host CPU must be provided
in the form of libraries which can be conveniently linked to the user's code.
