This project supports the organization of the second NSF Expeditions in
Computing (Expeditions) Principal Investigators' (PI) Meeting at the Newseum's
Knight Conference Center in Washington, DC, between Sunday, December 9 and
Tuesday, December 11, 2018. The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting builds on the
previous Expeditions PI Meeting and Expeditions research by fostering
collaboration and promoting close interaction between academia and industry,
governments, research labs, etc. The meeting is a unique opportunity to interact
with a broad cross-section of the scientific community, CISE leadership, as well
as with leaders in both industry and academia. It also provides an important
venue for scanning horizons activities, establishing new collaborations between
different collaborating teams, and exploring possible technology transfer and
partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These meetings are designed to advance
knowledge by exposing the progress of compelling and transformative
collaborative research conducted by multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary
research teams that promise disruptive innovations in computer and information
science and engineering, to allow PIs to showcase their research, and to provide
an opportunity to network. The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting will bring together
approximately 150 stakeholders comprising academia, industry, and government.
The Expeditions PI Meeting 2018 will take place on the 10th year anniversary of
the Expeditions program launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
