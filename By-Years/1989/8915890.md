A simplified framework for the interpretation of Lagrangian measurements using
floats will be developed by examining particle trajectories produced by a two-
level quasi-geostrophic model. Particular attention will be given to
trajectories produced by wave fields and eddies. Relationships between
Lagrangian and Eulerian quantities will be sought.
