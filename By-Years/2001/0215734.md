0215734&lt;br/&gt;Schaumloffel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the MRI
program, the State University of New York College at Oneonta (SUNY Oneonta) will
acquire an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) and
microwave digestion system (MDS). The research carried out with these
instruments, both at SUNY Oneonta and with colleagues at nearby Hartwick
College, involves a wide array of geological, environmental and chemical
studies. These include studies of the elemental composition of metamorphic rock
formations in New York and Montana, studies on the cycling of trace elements in
environmental systems and specific studies of the accumulation and cycling of
mercury in the Adirondack Region (New York). A major component of this project
is the involvement of undergraduate students in laboratory-based research linked
with field-work and the analysis of geological features in the field. The
acquisition of this instrumentation will greatly enhance our suite of shared
analytical instrumentation at SUNY Oneonta, benefiting the research of a number
of faculty members and improving undergraduate
education.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
