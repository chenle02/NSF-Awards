Abstract



In 1913, S.N. Bernstein proved that the error in approximation of |x| by
polynomials of degree at most n, when multiplied by n, converges to a positive
constant as n approaches infinity. We have a new representation of this unknown
constant, and hope to make it fully explicit. Many of the techniques we use are
inspired by orthogonal polynomials, which for exponential weights will also be
investigated.

While this problem involves polynomial approximation, rational and Pade
approximation is also a focus of the research. Recently the PI and V Buslaev
found counterexamples to the 1961 Baker-Gammel-Wills Conjecture on convergence
of Pade approximations. But perhaps the conjecture is true for functions that
are entire or meromorphic in the whole plane. Also, we will try to obtain
analogues of the Nuttall-Pommerenke Theorem for functions meromorphic in the
unit ball?
