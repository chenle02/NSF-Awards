The PDEs known as the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are the most important
deterministic models for the motion of fluids and gases. It has long been
suspected that stochastic versions of Navier-Stokes or Euler equations could be
valuable models for turbulent motion. The research to be performed is concerned
with developing methods for specifying stochastic versions of equations of fluid
dynamics related to turbulence, investigating their properties, and constructing
numerical approximations and asymptotics.

Turbulence is prominent in numerous contexts of significance for science and
technology, including oceanography, climatology, flight dynamics, navigation,
combustion and propulsion, etc. The proposed research deals with mathematical
models of turbulence that capture its essential behavior, and also yield
computationally tractable representations. Related numerical algorithms will be
developed, coded, and tested.
