This is an application to study spectroscopically the mineral coating of
composite prosthetic implants. The hypothesis is that the nature of the bone-
implant interface is determined by the nature of the implant surface whether or
not the interface is occupied by mineralized or non-mineralized tissue. The
hypothesis will be tested using animal experiments. The primary tool for surface
characterization is Raman spectroscopy; spectral resolution will be enhanced by
2nd derivative computations. This study will provide basic information about the
interface between bone and various calcium mineral coatings. The gained
knowledge should be very useful for designing optimized mineral coatings for
implants.
