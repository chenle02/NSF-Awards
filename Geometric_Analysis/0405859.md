Abstract

Award: DMS-0405859 Principal Investigator: Eric Zaslow

This project addresses geometric aspects of mirror symmetry. The PI will study
the geometry of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture by looking at the
conjectural picture of a Calabi-Yau threefold near the large complex structure
limit, where the special Lagrangian torus fibration collapses. The resulting
manifold is a real integer affine manifold with singularities. The first project
will produce a real Monge-Ampere metric on an open ball outside a Y-shaped
singular locus, then study its monodromy. A knowledge of this region is
essential to gaining a global understanding of the Calabi-Yau, including the
role of disc instanton corrections. Related projects are to study the geometry
of flat or Ricci-flat torus fibrations in Ricci-flat manifolds in general, and
to study the counting problem of special Lagrangian and other calibrated
submanifolds by varying the metric away from the Ricci flat one. The final
project is investigate integrable hierarchies underlying the topological vertex.

The project studies the mathematics behind the physical phenomenon of mirror
symmetry. Mirror symmetry is when two different physical theories give rise to
the same predictions about nature. Mathematically, there are deep connections
behind the equivalence, and this project looks at the geometry of the
equivalence. Understanding the geometry of mirror symmetry will lead to a
broader comprehension of the structure of mathematics, and conceivably physics.
For instance, mirror symmetry aids in the calculation of topological field
theories, which have been shown to have computational relevance to the
conventional gauge theories that underly particle physics. At a more basic,
mathematical level, understanding the geometry of mirror symmetry can lead to a
concrete description of the special structures conjectured by Calabi to exist in
1957 and proved to exist by Yau in 1979. Still, we know very little about this
important aspect of geometry. The rich interplay of mathematics and physics has
much to teach us.
