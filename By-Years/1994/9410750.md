This award supports the further development of the Micrograph Data Processing
Program (MDPP). This software program supports image processing in the area of
structural biology image data from the electron microscope. The project has
several goals. First, MDPP will be ported to several different UNIX platforms.
Second, the program will port the client/server code to TCP/IP. Third, the
project will develop a tool-box of MOTIF subroutines designed to facilitate data
entry to the MDPP. Another goals will create a beginners guide to the software.
