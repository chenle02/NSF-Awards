On February 9-10, 1987, an advisory panel met at NSF to represent the views of
the scientific community on issues arising from graphics, image processing, and
workstations. The panel consisted of representative, prominent scientists who
build or use sophisticated visualization tools in the conduct of their research.
As a result of that meeting, the panel now wants to generate a report defining
the field of visualization and detailing its uses in the discipline sciences
(e.g. biology, physics, economics). The proposal seeks to support the generation
of that report. The report will consist of two pieces: a written report and a
videotape. The report will define the field of Visualization in Scientific
Computing, its domain, personnel, and key canonical problems. The body of the
report will be written by researchers from certain discipline sciences that need
advances in the underlying sciences of visualization. The videotape will present
exemplary computer-generated graphics of scientific simulations. The report
brings together a sampling of hard scientific problems that await advances in
visualization in scientific computing, from NSF-supported researchers and other
agencies of government; and , it suggest some programs, policies, and
technologies to meet those needs. The investigators hope to change the way that
science gets done on advanced scientific computers, with implications for
scientific productivity and national competitiveness
