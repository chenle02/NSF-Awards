9710483 Sosnowski Ion implantation, an essential technology for the doping and
fabrication of all Si integrated circuits, is now facing critical research and
development challenges. Principal amongst these is the production of ultra-low
energy beams and the concomitant formation of ultra-shallow junctions. The
research challenges can be broadly defined into two areas (1) the production and
transport of low energy beams and (11) determining the dopant range and defect
production in close proximity to the surface. The research described here will
be carried out by a collaboration of NJIT, a university with expertise in ion
beams and microelectronics research, Bell Laboratories of Lucent Technologies, a
force in Si integrated circuit research and development, and Eaton, a leading
manufacturer of ion implantation tools. Boron implantation poses the most severe
challenge for ultra-shallow junction formation because of its inherently large
range and the phenomenon of transient enhanced diff-usion. Large molecules such
as decaborane, BlOH14, offer a unique way of performing ultra-shallow
implantation without the use of very low accelerating voltages as the kinetic
energy is partitioned proportionally to the constituent atomic mass. Research at
NJIT and Eaton will involve the construction of ion sources and beam lines to
determine the optimum conditions for the generation and transport of these
fragile molecules. Concurrently, research at NJIT and Bell Labs will focus on
the implantation of these molecules into Si, damage formation and electrical
junction formation. Analysis of the implanted samples will involve the dopant
marker layer techniques that the Bell Labs group have used to unravel the
mechanism of transient enhanced diffusion at medium energies. A crucial aspect
here will be to understand transient enhanced diffusion for these large
molecules and equivalent atomic implantation at close proximity to the Si
surface. The benefits of this research will be manifested on several fro nts. A
fundamental knowledge of the mechanism of generation and stability of beams of
decaborane will help define the road map for future generations of low energy
implantation machines. A knowledge of the range and transient enhanced diffusion
of large molecule implantation, and equivalent atomic implantation, will help
resolve fundamental questions regarding dopant clustering and defect production
contiguous to the surface. This information, which is essential for the design
of future generations of devices, would be a milestone for implantation and
defect research. ***
