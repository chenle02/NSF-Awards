Metal carbonyl precursors are used to synthesize structurally unique oxide-
supported organometallic and metallic catalysts including robust analogues of
stable molecular metal-cluster anions and metal aggregates formed from them by
removal of the carbonyl ligands. The effort concentrates on osmium, iridium, and
platinum on magnesia support. Structures and stabilities of the supported
species are characterized. The more stable of these aggregates are tested for
catalytic activity. This effort is designed to bridge the gap between metal
complexes and coordination cluster behavior (a branch of chemistry with a
voluminous literature) and the behavior of supported metal catalysts (the type
preferred in industrial applications). This should improve our understanding of
the sensitivity of catalysis to metal structure and metal-support interactions
and be a major advance in the design of practical catalysts.
