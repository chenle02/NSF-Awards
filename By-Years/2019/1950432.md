Rapid changes in the Earthâ€™s climate are having significant impacts in a number
of different areas, including animal and plant life, oceans and rivers, human
health, and the economy. This Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site
pairs undergraduate students interested in these problems with professional
mentors for a focused, 10-week research experience program. The site
particularly encourages participation for underrepresented students who
traditionally do not have the opportunity to bring their research ideas into
reality and work with leading scientists. Students choose from a set of research
topics such as detecting climate change signals in data, investigating impacts
on local and global marine species, running and interpreting forecast models,
evaluating Arctic sea ice forecasts, and visualization and communicating climate
change information. At the end of their research experience, students present
their findings at a program symposium and then at a national undergraduate
research conference the following year. The goal of the project is to provide
students with the knowledge, tools, and a chance to network with climate
professionals which will increase student understanding of the climate system
and provide them with a solid foundation to continue their research well after
the end of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accelerating pace of global
climate change demands a new generation of scientists and communicators who not
only understand the underlying science but can effectively translate it to
decision makers. The research experience offered by this REU site will bring
together the major climate organizations in the Asheville, NC area to offer an
integrated climate-focused program. The program will strengthen existing
relationships between the regional host institution (University of North
Carolina Asheville) and these organizations, establish connections in the
climate community for participating students, and provide unique opportunities
for traditionally underrepresented students to participate in research in an
area with profound societal implications. Through their research project,
presentations, meetings, and social interactions, student participants will
develop connections with other students, their mentors, faculty, and other
professional scientists that will persist well beyond the end of the summer
experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
