Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER: Aligned Carbon
Nanotube Composite Arrays as Permeable Membranes for Selective Chemical
Separations and Sensing&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0348544&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Bruce Hinds&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at
the development of highly selective affinity membranes based&lt;br/&gt;on
aligned carbon nanotubes embedded in a polymer film. This concept could lead
to&lt;br/&gt;the development of membranes with enhanced selectivity for numerous
applications.&lt;br/&gt;The growth of oriented carbon nanotubes by thermal CVD
and functionalization of the&lt;br/&gt;carbon nanotube tips with carboxylic acid
groups have been demonstrated. The&lt;br/&gt;carboxylic acid groups at the ends
of the carbon nanotubes can be functionalized,&lt;br/&gt;allowing for high
selectivity in an affinity membrane. Measurements of
transport&lt;br/&gt;properties of nitrogen gas and aqueous ionic species through
polymer-coated carbon&lt;br/&gt;nanotube structures have been performed; these
measurements demonstrated the&lt;br/&gt;molecular sieving character of the
membranes. In terms of the broader impacts, the&lt;br/&gt;educational program
will include the development of new courses and laboratories&lt;br/&gt;aimed at
introducing nanotechnology to undergraduates. Success in this research
effort&lt;br/&gt;will enable a new class of well controlled nanoscale pore
structures for selective&lt;br/&gt;chemical separations, sensors, drug delivery,
and environmental remediation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
