Managing the energy consumption of computers requires
cooperation&lt;br/&gt;between energy aware applications and operating systems.
This&lt;br/&gt;research seeks to fully explore the energy management
space&lt;br/&gt;surrounding the interaction of applications and the operating
system.&lt;br/&gt;Applications should adjust their energy consumption when
appropriate,&lt;br/&gt;but must be provided accurate information on their
individual energy&lt;br/&gt;consumption. The operating system must implement the
mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;policies to determine energy consumption and allocate
it fairly as a&lt;br/&gt;global system resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will first re-examine operating system structure with
an&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on managing energy as a first class resource.
Energy&lt;br/&gt;management cuts across all traditional system resources, with
the CPU,&lt;br/&gt;disk, network, and memory all exhibiting unique energy
consumption&lt;br/&gt;characteristics. Next, the work will explore policies for
allocating&lt;br/&gt;energy to competing tasks. The goal is to maintain fairness
while&lt;br/&gt;observing user-specified priorities and soft real-time
deadlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end product of this research will be a
comprehensive framework for&lt;br/&gt;globally managing energy in a diverse set
of scenarios, ranging from a&lt;br/&gt;single mobile computer, to wireless
sensor networks that may have&lt;br/&gt;aggregate goals across a large number of
sensors, to hosting centers&lt;br/&gt;that wish to provide maximum performance
with minimum energy&lt;br/&gt;consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
