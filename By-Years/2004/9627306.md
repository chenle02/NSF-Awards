9627306 Combs The California Museum of Science and Industry (CMSI) will develop
a new exhibit "Body in Balance: Developing Integrative Life Science Exhibits."
This will be a 3000 sq. ft. component in the new 17,500 sq. ft. World of Life
Exhibit Hall when the CMSI opens its new facility in 1997 and becomes the
California Science Center. The World of Life is organized around several key
science concepts which emphasize the commonalties among living things and their
life processes. One of the major ideas to be communicated in this area is
homeostasis as it applies to human beings. Homeostasis has been chosen because
it is the unifying theme of system physiology. The exhibit will include
seventeen exhibits (with a total of sixty- seven interactive elements) as well
as a "The Body in Balance" theater presentations and bilingual (English/Spanish)
exhibition books. This integrative view of body functions is consistent with
recommendations from Benchmarks for Science Literacy and the Science Framework
for California Public Schools Grades K-12. A broad menu of complementary formal
education materials will be developed.
