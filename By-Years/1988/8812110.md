Early embryonic development is thought to be mediated by determinants present
in the egg cytoplasm, but these substances have yet to be characterized. In this
proposal we continue our studies on cytoplasmic determinants involved in
endodermal alkaline phosphatase (AP), muscle and embryonic axis development in
the ascidian Styela. The possibility that AP determinants consist of maternal AP
mRNAs, which are localized in the egg and translationally activated after
segregation to the endodermal cells will be examined by in situ hybridization
with a cloned AP probe. The spatial distribution of muscle and axial
determinants will be examined by UV microbeam irradiation of the egg and
microsurgical deletion of cells from the early embryo. The general class of
molecules to which the muscle and axial determinants belong will be investigated
using a combination of UV action spectrum analysis and a bioassay involving
microinjection of fractionated cytoplasmic components of normal eggs into eggs
whose ability to develop axis or muscle has been impaired by localized UV
irradiation. The potential role in axis determination of a maternal mRNA
encoding a 25 kd protein, a component that is absent in axis deficient embryos,
will also be investigated by UV irradiation and in vitro translation. It is
anticipated that new information will be obtained concerning the localization
and identity of determinants involved in three different developmental
decisions. %%% One of the most important mechanisms regulating the control of
early embryogenesis is the segregation of developmental information,
"determinants" or "morphogens," to various regions of the embryo during early
development. It is believed that these morphogens determine the fate of specific
cell lineages and guide them to differentiate into their final tissue such as
muscle, nerve and gut. The molecular nature of these determinants has not yet
been determined. Dr. Jeffery has made important contributions to this area and
is now on the verge of identifying those molecules necessary for muscle and gut
development as well as for the establishment of the dorsal- ventral axis itself.
