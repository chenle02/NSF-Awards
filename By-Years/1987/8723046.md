The principal investigator plans to work on problems in mathematical analysis
concerning the representation theory of (semisimple) Lie groups. A suitable
example of the latter is the group of rotations of a sphere. Groups like this
are important because they occur in many areas of mathematics ( e.g. geometry,
differential equations,algebraic number theory, mathematical physics ) as groups
of symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take advantage of symmetries
in solving problems. The building blocks for representation theory are the
irreducible representations, particularly the irreducible unitary
representations. The principal investigator will work toward classifying these
representations for semisimple Lie groups. Prior work provides a considerable
store of examples and techniques for attacking this problem, which in the
indicated degree of generality is very hard, and absolutely central to the
subject. Some common themes have emerged and some subtle critical cases have
appeared. The plan is to pursue the common themes and concentrate on the role
played by generalizations of the critical cases.
