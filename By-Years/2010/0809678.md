This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to identify and
validate the small number of genes that control starch and oil content in corn.
The project will determine statistical associations between corn domestication
genes and these traits. Having genes in hand that control starch and oil levels
could be used to breed or genetically engineer corn with significantly higher
starch or oil content per kernel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of
this research will ultimately be reduced dependence on foreign energy sources.
Domestic energy self-reliance can come from bioenergy technologies, including
corn ethanol and biodiesel. Two major objections to the use of corn to make
ethanol are the environmental impact of fertilizing and irrigating greater
amounts of land for growing corn and diverting corn from food to fuel when
people in the world are starving. Increasing the yield of fermentable starch for
ethanol production from each acre of corn grown would address these objections.
In this way, more ethanol and biodiesel feedstocks can be produced from the same
acreage.&lt;br/&gt;
