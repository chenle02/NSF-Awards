The project proposed by the Engineering Experiment Station of Texas A&amp;M
University has as its major goal development of a clear and supporting way for
minorities, particularly minority women, in the San Antonio middle schools to
enter the Highlands High School's Science and Engineering Core Program and
thence into collegiate science and engineering programs. Students entering
grades 7 through 12 will be involved in projects that infuse engineering design
and problem solving into the curriculum. To that end, teachers and parents will
work with major Texas industry scientists and engineers to assist in curricular
matters and also promote the long-term commitment to pursue advanced degrees in
science and engineering. The partnership will bear approximately 64% of the
anticipated project costs.
