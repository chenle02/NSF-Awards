This meeting was addressed by invited speakers who have made outstanding
contributions to the field of computer algebra. The speakers anchored the
meeting and helped attract participants from the computer algebra or
computational scientific/engineering communities from the eastern half of the
US. The invited talks and poster sessions contributed by the community covered
the breadth of algebra: algorithms, software, and applications. The principle
theme of this l995 meeting was applications. The purpose of this meeting was to
stimulate interest in and to enhance understanding of the technical aspects of
computer algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are active or
interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to meet with each other
in an inexpensive and easily accessible way.
