Air travel is provided for five key organizers from a U.S. academic institution
to attend the Fifth International Symposium on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic
Engineering (OMAE) in Tokyo, Japan, Aril 13-18, 1986. This annual event has been
co-sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)-OMAE
Division, National Science Foundation, and 20 other international societies or
associations. The symposia have been successful in promoting offshore mechanics
and arctic engineering and international technology transfer. This is the
largest technical conference of its kind and brings together technical experts
from around 31 countries. The organizers have been particularly successful in
the reseach areas of ice mechanics, fatigue and fracture control, hudrodynamics,
and structural mechanics as applied to offshore and arctic problems.
