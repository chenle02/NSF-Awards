The objective of this research is (i) to fabricate the organic field-effect
transistors (OFETs) using novel techniques that do not introduce defects at the
surface of organic semiconductors, and (ii) to use these devices to explore
fundamental limits of organic electronics. The novel fabrication approach is
based on lamination of elastomeric transistor stamps against high purity organic
molecular crystals. These unique single-crystal OFETs will enable realization of
the ultimate performance of organic materials, not limited by structural defects
or chemical impurities. &lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the proposed work
consists of (i) development of new soft-contact-lamination techniques for OFET
fabrication that preserve the high quality of pristine surface of organic
crystals; (ii) studies of the effect of individual surface defects on transistor
characteristics; (iii) reduction of the contact resistance using self-assembled
monolayers, and (iv) studies of the organic crystals by surface analytical
techniques. The work will have a significant impact on foundations of "plastic"
electronics and understanding of fundamental transport properties of organic
materials. The novel stamping techniques that emerge from the proposed research
will find applications in many areas of flexible electronics. The
interdisciplinary structure of the program provides excellent educational, human
resource and outreach opportunities. The Educational and Outreach part of the
project is designed to develop innovative training modules in novel electronic
materials and devices. Implementation of the proposed research fosters training
of students who will be exposed to the state-of-the-art facilities of
semiconductor research, and can pursue careers in either an academic or
industrial environment.&lt;br/&gt;
