This award is to support research, education, and technology transfer
activities at the Advanced Combustion Engineering Research Center at Brigham
Young University and the University of Utah. The goal of the Center is to
develop fundamental engineering knowledge and tools aimed at the solution of
combustion related problems encountered in the utilization of low-cost, low
grade or non-conventional fuels, and in the control and disposal of hazardous
wastes. The principal emphasis is on the development of complex systems models
to be used in low-grade coal combustion, coal gasification, char or coal/water
slurry combustion, and catalytic combustion. Specific research activities focus
on: 1) combustion process modeling and control, 2) physical and chemical
characterization of fuels, 4) combustion process performance characteristics,
and 5) hazardous emissions and control. These five areas are the key elements
needed for complete design, optimization and control of advanced combustion
technologies. The recommended budge includes funds for Research Experiences for
Undergraduates.
