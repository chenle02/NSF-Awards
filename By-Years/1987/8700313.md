It has been demonstrated that it is possible to express site-specific bacterial
methylase and endonuclease genes in eukaryotic cells. In addition the expression
of these genes appears to have no deleterious effect on the host cell. In
initial studies to express the PaeR7 methylase in mouse L cells, the levels of
methylase produced varied greatly and were insufficient to protect the host cell
genomes from the activities of the cognate endonucleases. The problems that need
to be solved now in this proposal, are (1) the incomplete methylation of cell
genome by PaeR7 and (2) the inefficient restriction of infecting viral DNA. In
order to increase methylase and endonuclease activity, methods such as multiple
rounds of transformation, selection of alternative promoters, gene amplification
will be tried. Hopefully, a stable expression of the bacterial
restriction/modification system in animal cells will be achieved. The ultimate
goal of the project is to establish this system in cultured mammalian cells
which would render them more resistant to viral infection. Dr. Gingeras is
eminently qualified to carry out this work. Support if possible with a very good
priority.
