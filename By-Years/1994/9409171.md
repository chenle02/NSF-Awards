Field 9409171 This is an award to support research on surfactant transport in
aquifers. The investigator plans initially to study the biodegradation of linear
alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactants in an oxygenated zone of a wastewater-
contaminated groundwater aquifer and in an oxygenated zone of uncontaminated
groundwater at a field location operated by the U.S. Geological Survey's Otis
Air Force Base test site on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. A subsequent phase will
involve the continuous injection of a surfactant into the oxygen-depleted zone
of contaminated groundwater to determine the lag time required to initiate
degradation of the surfactant. Results of this project are expected to include
an improved understanding of the processes that affect surfactant fate and
transport in groundwater. This in turn is expected to influence the engineering
design of systems based on use of surfactants to remove contaminants from
contaminated aquifers. ***
