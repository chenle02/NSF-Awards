9614531 Angell This focus of this investigation of glasses and amorphous liquids
is on five broad areas: polyamorphic transitions and possible connections with
biopolymers; studies of microemulsion systems with an emphasis on glass-forming
microemulsions; studies of Vogel-Fucher deviations in thermodynamic properties;
studies of molecules which may exhibit two-state complexity; and destablization
of the crystal phase by electrochemical methods, and by crystal desolvation. %%%
The amorphous state of solids is central to many areas of advanced materials
technologies involving areas such as polymers, ceramics, metals and
pharmaceuticals. Research investigations such as this aimed at describing at the
molecular level the nature of the amorphous state and how it is prepared and
stabilized will lead possibly to new routes for synthesizing new materials with
unique properties. ***
