As the global user base for online services continues to expand and new services
and features are rapidly developed, data centers from which these online cloud
services operate experience constant pressure to achieve higher performance and
improve their quality of service. However, supporting the adoption of cloud
services in all aspects of people?s daily lives requires expanding data centers
to an extreme scale, with hundreds of millions of servers and ecologically
unthinkable energy bills.  This research develops technologies to improve the
performance and efficiency of future data centers, targeting higher performance
and lower energy costs from each deployed server.  As such, it directly
contributes to sustainable growth of data centers and online services, while at
the same time training world-class experts specialized in tackling the
challenges facing future data centers and clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research leverages a recently-codified phenomenon called "temporal streams" to
solve a number of long-standing micro-architectural performance bottlenecks
facing server systems in the cloud.  Many of the performance enhancing
techniques developed over the course of the past several decades for the
desktop, mobile, and super-computer domains provide limited benefits to server
systems, because the size and complexity of a typical cloud workload requires
significantly greater meta-data storage capacity than currently available to
these techniques.  This work re-architects the meta-data storage of speculative
structures, leveraging temporal streams to expand their effective capacity. 
Specifically, this work targets instruction prefetchers, branch predictors, and
hardware memorization as case studies to demonstrate the ability of temporal
streaming to provide sufficient meta-data storage for these mechanisms when
executing cloud workloads.
