Transient isotopic tracing is applied to Fischer-Tropsch and related syntheses
producing hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. These reactions furnish the
basic path for production of carbon compounds from coal. Previous work has
applied this method to methanation over nickel, molybdenum sulfide, and
ruthenium and has identified the key surface intermediates. This work aims to
illustrate how these one-carbon intermediates react with each other as well as
with hydrogen and with carbon monoxide to form simple hydrocarbons and
oxygenated species of higher molecular weight. Ruthenium catalysts are employed.
It is known that a large variety of compounds are produced in this system; this
work should provide the knowledge needed for control of conditions to maximize
production of desired species.
