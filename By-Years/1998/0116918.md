Scientific discourses about sexuality in old age from this period thus implies
associations between aging and disease, highly gendered preconceptions about the
character of the elderly, powerful biological-functionalist models for sexual
behavior, and uncertainty about the role of the elderly from a social-Darwinist
perspective, all of which served to render late-life sexuality a problematic
topic for contemporaries. One product of this network of ideas was the
stereotype of the senile sex offender, or the "dirty old man," a development the
researcher plans to treat in depth. She argues that the image of the villainous,
lascivious elder was partly a product of wide spread sex reform and social
hygiene campaigns at the turn of the twentieth century, and partly a product of
the popular imagination as manifest in the popular press of the time. Further
examination of the image of the aged sex offender and how the different national
historical contexts varied (or didn't) requires additional research. The
researcher is requesting funds for research in Paris and London where she will
examine both court records and the popular press, in particular newspapers,
which covered legal proceedings and sex reform movements.
