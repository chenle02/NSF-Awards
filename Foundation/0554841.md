This project will facilitate collaborative work of faculty and graduate students
from ten U.S. institutions, three universities in Russia, and one university in
Kazakhstan. The research is in three rapidly developing areas of computability:
algorithmic randomness, computable structure theory, and the comparative study
of computability-theoretic structures. The project has two broad goals. The
first goal, more rapid scientific progress, will be met by establishing a broad
network of collaborators, from all three countries, enabling them to pool their
ideas to solve fundamental problems. The second goal, providing opportunities
for students and young researchers to participate actively in the world
community of scientists, will be met in exactly the same way.
