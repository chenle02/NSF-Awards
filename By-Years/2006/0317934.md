This funded proposal will conduct stable isotope and trace elemental analyses on
benthic and planktic foraminifera in five high resolution cores from the North
Atlantic during the Holocene. The resulting records will add insight into the
role that the deep ocean circulation of the North Atlantic plays in Holocene
climate variability.
