In mammals a key hormone involved in reproduction is follicle-stimulating
hormone, FSH. This hormone is released by the pituitary gland, which is
connected to part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The mechanisms that
regulate the timed release of this hormone are largely unknown. Recently it has
been shown that the blood circulating to the pituitary from the brain can
include an unknown compound that stimulates FSH release (FSH-releasing factor,
or FSH-RF) in a pulsatile fashion. This action seems to be independent from the
release regulated by the known contribution of the compound activin, or of
another releasing hormone called GnRH. This project utilizes biochemical,
pharmacological and anatomical techniques, with a novel model system to separate
the neural supply from the blood supply to the pituitary, to localize the timing
and source of this novel releasing factor as a step towards identifying
it.&lt;br/&gt; Results will be very important for neuroendocrinology by
clarifying release mechanisms for a major hormone involved in puberty as well as
reproduction, and will have a likely impact also in veterinary and agricultural
fields. &lt;br/&gt;
