The newly-established structural biology group, a joint initiative between the
University of Pennsylvania and The Wistar Institute, proposes to install a
rotating anode X-ray generator, multiwire area detector, computer, and graphics
system. The instrumentation will complement equipment already provided to the
joint venture by each institution to create a fully-equipped facility for X-ray
crystallography. The interests of the structural biology group are diverse, and
structural problems ranging in size from small molecule host-guest complexes to
large macromolecular assemblies such as adenovirus are currently being
addressed. The acquisition of the proposed instrumentation will permit analysis
and interpretation of all sizes of structural problems within the range of a few
Angstroms to a few hundred Angstroms.
