With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of San Diego will acquire laser
instrumentation for undergraduate research. This equipment will enhance research
in the following areas: a) the photo-physical properties of new lanthanide
complexes; b) fundamental spectroscopy of various atomic and molecular and
plasma phase systems; and c) research on aquatic locomotion.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation will bring laser based techniques
into the undergraduate education (both teaching and research) of Chemistry,
Physics, and Marine Science majors and Marine Science graduate students.
