This dissertation project is a study of the Nivkhi of Sakhalin Island, a
Paleoasiatic people in the Russian Far East. A major focus will be placed on the
narratives and reflections of these Native people on the past, set against the
backdrop of contemporary social change in Russia. In addition to fieldwork,
archival research in St. Petersburg and Tomsk will be carried out.
