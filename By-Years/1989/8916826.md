In the southern hemisphere of the Carboniferous Period two climatic belts have
been recognized so far, based on their floras. The tropical belt (Amerosinian or
Euramerican floral realm) extended into the southern paleo-hemisphere. The cool
climatic zone (Gondwana floral realm) is known from fossil floras occurring
several thousand kilometers away. The temperate climatic zone has been missing.
Based on initial research with Prof. Alleman (Lima, Peru) it is proposed that
the enigmatic Carboniferous flora from Paracas, Peru represents the southern
temperate climatic belt. In order to test this hypothesis PI will study fossil
plants from two areas in Peru. The results will refine the paleoclimatological
model of the Carboniferous Period.
