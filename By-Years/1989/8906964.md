Laminar flames can, under certain conditions, be inherently unstable, leading to
wrinkled or corrugated structures. It is clear that the general character of the
instability is intimately tied to the underlying fluid flow and by the extent of
heat transfer away from the flame front. Stratified mixtures exist in many
combustion environments, creating a curved and possibly unsteady propagating
flame front. The proposed research is directed towards a fundamental
understanding of the behavior and response of a laminar, premixed flame to such
non-uniformities in the flow field. Droplet vaporization and combustion will
also be investigated. The techniques to be used are the asymptotic and
perturbation methods supplemented by numerical calculations, with the results
compared to observed physical phenomena. One's understanding of the behavior of
combustion in systems as complex as engines and furnaces is often enhanced by an
analytical model of a much simplified description which isolates one or two
controlling physical parameters. This theoretical study will attempt to stretch
the application of asymptotic and perturbation techniques to premixed flames
propagating in non-uniform mixtures, with the objective of gaining insight into
the effects of strain rate, flame front curvature, vorticity, mass diffusion,
and heat transfer on the flame stability.
