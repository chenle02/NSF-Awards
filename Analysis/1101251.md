Most of the proposed research activities in this project can be viewed
essentially as perturbation problems for contractive operator semigroups. The
proposed treatment of these questions can be briefly described as follows. One
represents the Hilbert space on which the contractive semigroup acts as a chain
of subspaces so that on each of the subspaces the semigroup acts almost as a
group of unitaries. The corresponding spectral picture produces a chain of
spaces of analytic functions. The goal is then to understand the properties of
the semigroup by investigating these spaces and their relationship to the spaces
generated by a certain model semigroup. The latter often reduces to a problem
about invertibility properties of certain Toeplitz operators. In its essence,
the method that the investigator suggests to treat these problems can be viewed
as a delicate form of the classical argument principle. It has in its basis the
powerful method of N. Makarov and A. Poltoratski regarding the injectivity
problem for Toeplitz operators. As is often the case in harmonic analysis, the
delicate properties of the Hilbert transform again should play the central role.

The majority of the problems proposed in this project lie within the area of
harmonic analysis. The core idea of harmonic analysis is the possibility of
representing complicated signals as a combination of simpler signals - atoms
which are in a sense canonical for the problem at hand. Due to the imprecision
of measurements one is sometimes required to use a slightly different system of
atoms, which may or may not possess the ideal properties of the canonical
system. Careful analysis is required to determine to which extent the properties
present under ideal measurements continue to hold in a real world situation. A
large part of this project is devoted to the further development of the
mathematical tools necessary for such an analysis. Potential applications are
possible in the areas of signal processing and control theory. In addition,
another goal of this project is to popularize the classical areas of harmonic
and complex analysis by softening some existing deep techniques, thus making
them more accessible to the future generations of mathematicians as well as to
other scientists. As a member of a major science-technology university, the
investigator will also incorporate some of these new ideas to offer an up-to-
date, quality education of the new generations of STEM majors, at both the
undergraduate and graduate level.
