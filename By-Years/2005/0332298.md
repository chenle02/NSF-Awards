0093012&lt;br/&gt;Qiu&lt;br/&gt; Plants are primary producers on the earth,
supplying our food directly and indirectly, creating the habitat we live in, and
providing many other materials for everyday life. However, our knowledge of
plant evolution remains scanty. Improvement of crops and understanding
the&lt;br/&gt;roles of plants in our environment partially hinge on our
knowledge of plant evolution. Revolutions in molecular biology, phylogenetics,
and computer science have made it possible for the first time in history to
reconstruct accurately the phylogeny of plants.&lt;br/&gt; In this project by
Dr. Yin-Long Qiu at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, three different
approaches will be employed to understand both organismal and molecular aspects
of land plant evolution. First, several genes from all three plant genomes
(nucleus, chloroplast, mitochondrion) will be sequenced and analyzed in
combination with the data available from the public domain to reconstruct a
multigene land plant phylogeny. Second, several genomic structural features from
the mitochondrial genome, such as intron acquisition, intron transposition, and
gene cluster disintegration, will be investigated independently to evaluate
critical parts of the sequence-based phylogeny and at the same to understand
mitochondrial genome evolution in early land plants. Last, a few mitochondrial
genomes will be sequenced to gain an in-depth look at mitochondrial genome
evolution during early land plant radiation and to provide more genomic
structural characters for assessing robustness of the relationships resolved
through gene sequence analyses among major lineages of early land plants:
liverworts, mosses, hornworts, and vascular plants.&lt;br/&gt; Plant science is
at the dawn of a new era. After two decades of separate development along
distinst lines of morphology, systematics, genetics, physiology, and ecology,
these sub-disciplines begin to integrate into a new comprehensive plant biology.
Thus, this project also aims to reach two educational goals. One is to train
several graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the newly emerging
field of evolutionary genomics. They will fill in a knowledge rift between
traditional systematics and modern genomics that is developing in many biology
departments. The other is to develop three courses, Plant Evolution,
Evolutionary Genomics, and Phylogenetics, which are emerging fields with a
recent explosion of new information. These courses will serve the function for
both undergraduate and graduate education. In summary, the five lines of work
outlined in this project are likely to enhance significantly our knowledge of
land plant evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
