0127887&lt;br/&gt;Hondzo&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
investigate the growth dynamics of the green alga Selenastrum capricornutum and
the blue-green alga Synechococcus leopoliensis in a well-defined flow system.
This research will test the hypothesis that the growth and aggregate formation
of these algae depends not only on optimal water temperature, light regime, and
nutrients, but also on hydrodynamic mixing conditions. To test this hypothesis,
experimental studies of these algae will be conducted under laminar, turbulent,
and turbulent-intermittent fluid flow conditions in order to characterize the
growth, aggregate formation and morphometry as functions of intrinsic fluid flow
parameters. Fluid flow conditions will be generated using both a rotating
cylinder apparatus and an oscillating grid apparatus. This research could
provide data for improved model development for the prediction of alga blooms in
freshwater systems. &lt;br/&gt;
