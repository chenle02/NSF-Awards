0314015&lt;br/&gt;Arzberger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three-year
proposal submitted by Dr. Peter Arzberger, University of California at San Diego
to expand the Pacific Rim Application and Grid Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA).
This assembly currently includes founding members from nine economies and14
high-performance computing institutes in the Pacific Rim region. This is a
renewal of the first PRAGMA project, which was a seed project awarded jointly by
the East Asia and the Pacific Program and the Partnerships for Advanced
Computational Infrastructure Program (PACI) for the period of March 1, 2002-
February 28, 2004. The purposes of the renewal proposal are to provide the
following activities to enhance grid applications and to develop grid middleware
in the Pacific Rim region: (1) participation in face-to-face meetings, (2)
coordination and expansion of cooperative activities to include more institutes
and countries, (3) supporting the development of grid infrastructure and
middleware in the region, and (4) building collaborations via focused grid and
application infrastructure and demonstration projects. This proposal is jointly
supported by the following four NSF units: the Office of International Science
and Engineering, Division of Advanced Computational Infrastructure and Research,
Division of Advanced Networking and Research, and Division of Biological
Infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
