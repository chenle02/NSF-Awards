This project seeks to address the maintenance of good livestock health, high
productivity, and efficiency are key to the sustainability and success of the
livestock industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this the project aims to
converge data, knowledge and individuals across the animal production and health
spaces to develop a multilevel data collection and processing pipeline and
advanced AI analytical, visualization, and decision support tools to facilitate
and improve the “personalized” or “precision” management of animal health and
system optimization, namely precision epidemiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
