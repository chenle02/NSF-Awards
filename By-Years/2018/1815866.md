Data streams have grown in unprecedented scale and velocity in recent years. The
real-time discovery of emerging event trends in data streams is essential for
time-critical applications from computing infection spread patterns across major
medical facilities to detecting frequent stock trends. This project overcomes
the shortcomings of state-of-the-art systems and provides practical solutions
for this important class of analytics. The invention of transformative
strategies to provide these Event Trend Analytics services is game changing.
Event stream applications affecting our daily lives include health care and
financial fraud. The integration of this project's activities with the training
of a future STEM workforce will occur within a new interdisciplinary degree
program in Data Science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops both a
sound theoretical foundation and practical processing strategies that empower
applications to pursue interactive event trend analysis with high
responsiveness. This project enables Kleene-closure based analytics in modern
stream processing systems. Scalable Event Trend Analytics allows applications to
gain trend-related insights from high-velocity stream data. Project activities
include:(a) expressive event trend modeling and matching semantics, (b) compact
event trend encoding techniques, (c) optimizaton methodology for aggregation
push-down into the Kleene closure computation avoiding expensive trend
construction, (d) aggregation computation at multiple granularity levels, (e)
principled foundation of correctness and completeness of the query processing
paradigm, and (f) distributed and shared execution of trend analytics for scale-
up. Principles from database systems, such as query rewriting, optimization,
execution sharing, and scalable cloud computing, are applied to this problem.
Innovations include trend aggregation strategies that selectively skip expensive
trend construction, and compression methods for aggregation state models. These
methods will be validated for utility and effectiveness using real-world
workloads in partnerships with industry collaborators in healthcare and
financial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
