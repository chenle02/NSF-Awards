This proposal applies diffraction analysis to the local atomic structure of
crystalline solids, in particular superconducting oxides and related materials.
Initial studies include the effects of dynamics on the pulsed neutron powder
diffraction (Plazcek correction) and the direct observation of lattice dynamics
using pulsed neutrons. This research is followed by diffraction studies of
single crystals using a novel technique of two-dimensional pair distribution
function analysis. The observations are examined in the context of the mechanism
of superconductivity based upon carrier-induced local lattice deformation
(polaron formation). In the process of these studies the real space method of
diffraction analysis is further developed. %%% The data derived from these
experiments are pertinent to furthering the understanding of the microscopic
mechanisms of high temperature superconductivity.
