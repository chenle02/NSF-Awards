9318950 Jothimurugesan This is an investigation of the hydrogenation of carbon
monoxide over cobalt-nickel alloy (Fischer-Tropsch) catalysts supported on
titania or vanadia. One objective is to enhance the yield of hydrocarbons in the
gasoline range. Catalysts are tested alone as well as in combination with the
zeolite HZSM-5. The effects of process variables such as temperature, pressure,
space velocity, carbon monoxide/hydrogen ratio, and the ratio of zeolite to
Fischer-Tropsch (cobalt-nickel) catalyst are investigated. The issues addressed
are significant in both synfuels and chemicals production. This is an award
under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) announcement. The effort
will be performed with undergraduates at a predominantly minority institution.
