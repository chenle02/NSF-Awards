Thistlewaite plans to examine several interconnected problems in classical knot
theory and the theory of `trace' polynomial invariants. The principal task is
the search for intrinsic geometrical definitions of the new polynomial
invariants of links. Also, Thistlewaite will seek improved combinatorial
definitions of the two 2-variable generalizations of the Jones polynomial, from
which it is hoped that rapid proofs of the existence of these polynomials will
materialize. On a purely geometrical front, he will pursue the question as to
whether crossing-number of links is additive with respect to connected sum.
