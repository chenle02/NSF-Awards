*** 9601586 Fortson This grant will expand the existing Laser Facility
operations at the University of Washington Physics Department, to develop
spectrally pure laser sources in more difficult spectral regions: the
ultraviolet between 190 nm and 250 nm, and the middle infrared beyond 1.5 m. The
UV will be served by efficient frequency quadrupling of diode and YAG lasers and
mixing of the latter with existing Ti- Sapphire lasers, and the IR will depend
upon the exploitation of color center lasers and of new technologies, such as
thulium-doped microchip systems and fiber lasers. A link with the Department of
Chemistry laser based research will be established. ***
