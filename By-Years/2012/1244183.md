This project is developing curriculum materials for two chemical engineering
core courses: thermodynamics and material and energy balances. These materials
are promoting active learning, which has been shown to increase student
learning, by reducing the barriers encountered by faculty who want to use more
effective teaching approaches. An essential element is a set of explanations of
the underlying theories for these teaching approaches and links to additional
references. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing resources for
flipped classrooms, in which students are watching screencasts (short videos
with narration) on their own before class. Class time is being used for more
active engagement with the material, which is resulting in better learning of
conceptually difficult material. Resources for faculty also include a complete
set of class notes that utilize active learning (ConcepTests with peer
instruction, in-class group exercises, etc.), measureable learning objectives
for each class period, a database of solved example problems, homework
assignments, and exams. They are organized in OneNote software so they can be
easily modified and customized to individual faculty.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program evaluation is measuring the utilization of the
materials and how faculty change their educational approach. These materials are
being made available online, accompanied by screencasts that describe how to use
them. Dissemination of these materials is enhancing the STEM education community
and providing faculty professional development.
