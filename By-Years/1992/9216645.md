Simple parameterizations of the marine boundary layer are a crucial component
of numerical models of weather and climate. In the tropics and subtropics,
tradewind cumulus clouds are by far the most common cloud type.
Parameterizations of trade cumulus cloud fields rely heavily on correctly
predicting the vertical mass and moisture fluxes within individual cumulus
clouds, yet these predictions have not been adequately compared with either
observations nor models of individual cumuli. Using data from the previously
executed Hawaiian Rainband Project, the Principal Investigator will analyze
dual-Doppler data of trade cumuli in order to determine the vertical profile of
vertical mass fluxes throughout the life cycle of a large number of individual
precipitating cumulus clouds. The Principal Investigator will utilize a three-
dimensional numerical boundary layer cloud model to help in interpretation of
the results from the Doppler radars. He also will compare results from both
observations and the numerical model to currently used parameterizations of
trade cumulus cloud fields.
