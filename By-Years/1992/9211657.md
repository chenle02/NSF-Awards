The past two decades have witnessed the development of many Computer Aided
Process Planning Systems, each of which has specific advantages and
disadvantages. Among these systems there exists considerable data overlap; yet
the data cannot be interfaced, exchanged, integrated, or communicated because
the data structures are not standardized. Only limited investigation has taken
place with respect to the problems, and some aspects have been ignored
altogether. The object of this project is to develop a test bed of integrated
process planning systems, which can be used for testing flexibility and data
standardization of a variety of process planning functions. The projects will be
conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and
Technology's process planning test bed laboratory.
