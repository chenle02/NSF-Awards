Superhard refractory materials have important applications in metal shaping
equipment and heat engines due to their high- temperature properties. However,
these desirable engineering properties are major obstacles to the fabrication of
useful shapes. In addition they suffer from low fracture toughness as compared
to metals. Conventional processing methods at or near equilibrium conditions are
limited with respect to peak pressure and temperature capability. They are also
very limited in their capability to produce heat-treatable ceramic composites.
We propose to apply a non-equilibrium method for consolidation of silicon
carbide composites containing an electrically conductive phase. In this process
a fine powder mixture is subjected to mechanical pressure and an intense current
pulse with a duration that is typically less than a millisecond. Under these
conditions the conductive phase is melted and alloyed with the silicon carbide
phase with a minimum of heat loss to the containment structure. The rapid
cooling of the compact is expected to result in a heat-treatable solid solution
or extremely fine microstructure. %%% The materials under development are
applicable to cutting tools, dies, armor, and wear components.
