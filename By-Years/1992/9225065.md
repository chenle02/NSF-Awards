The research supported under this project will focus on observational infrared
studies of the highest luminosity infrared bright galaxies, quasars and active
galactic nuclei, faint redshift galaxies, and objects studied at diffraction
limited spatial resolution. There will be implementation of tip-tilt correction
for image motion to achieve improved image quality in the infrared on the 200-
inch telescope at Mt. Palomar. The study of the ultra luminous infrared galaxies
will address the questions of the power source in these objects. There will also
be an attempt at determining their relationship to Active Galactic Nuclei. There
will be studies on how star formation begins (and proceeds) in high infrared
luminosity, interacting galaxies. There will be high spatial resolution
observations of regions of star formation, and the nearest galaxies containing
active galactic nuclei. The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader
in this research area.
