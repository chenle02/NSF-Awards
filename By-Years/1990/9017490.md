The activation of LHRH neural apparatus (a key neuronal system in the control
of reproduction) by neural and steroid signals thru a membrane mechanism has
become a research topic of great interest in the field of Neuroscience and my
laboratory has made contributions to clarify some aspects of such steroid-neural
interactions. The present project to continue examining the binding
characteristics of a novel ligand introduced by my laboratory, the radio-
iodinated albumin conjugated to progesterone in C-11 (the so- called
P-11-125I-BSA) to rat hypothalamic membrane fractions and its modification by
the hormonal status of the animal will clarify the first step in the action of
progesterone at membrane level. The recent demonstration that membranes from
female rats but not from male rats have specific binding shows an important sex
difference at this level in the CNS and may have important implications. The
work of the present project may have clinical implications because it will
further our understanding of the effect of steroid hormones in the function of
the central nervous system and the role of gender in such actions.//
