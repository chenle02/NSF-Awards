The flux of biogenic debris has often been implicated as major vector in the
vertical transport of metals in aquatic systems. However, efforts to model
quantitatively these processes have been limited by an inadequate data base on
the retention times of most metals in biogenic debris particularly under
different conditions of microbial decomposition. This study includes a series of
radiotracer experiments in which the retention times of thirteen metals will be
measured in phytoplankton, copepods, appendicularians, and chaetognaths as well
as zooplankton fecal pellets, crustacean molts, and larvacean houses under
different condition of microbial degradation. Metal biokinetics and pathways in
organisms will be studied for metals accumulated from dissolved and ingested
sources. Metal compartmentalization in phytoplankton will be assessed to help
understand the fate of ingested in herbivores. A simple model to quantify the
roles that different forms of biogenic debris can play in mediating the flux of
metals will be constructed and tested off the NE US coast. Decomposition of
biogenic debris and metal flux in individual types of debris will be measured in
material caught in sediment traps deployed for the SEEP program. Metal analyses
will employ the X-ray microprobe facility of the National Synchrotron Light
Source.
