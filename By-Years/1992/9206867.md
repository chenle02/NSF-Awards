Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will attempt to further
develop new methods for dealing with the fact than many of the predictions of
quantum field theory, naively calculated, are infinite. Less naively calculated,
these predictions are finite and some of them have been spectacularly
successful. The new methods are simpler than older ones in certain contexts, and
are also applicable to problems where the older ones are not. This research is
an important component of our efforts to extract the predictions of the so-
called "standard model" of the elementary particles, so that we can test that
model.
