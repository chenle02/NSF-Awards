This project is directed towards establishing improved analytical procedures
for accurate electron microprobe analysis of major, minor and trace elements in
non-conducting materials, with special emphasis on silicates, oxides and
carbonates of interest to earth and materials scientists. The result will be a
set of correction factors for reducing the characteristic X-ray intensities that
are directly measured by the electron probe to accurate quantitative chemical
compositions of such materials. Increased accuracy in quantitative microanalysis
is of interest for all fields of science dealing with small-scale chemical
variations in solid materials.
