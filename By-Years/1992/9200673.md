In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Gilbert will investigate the spectroscopy and photochemistry of various
nitrogen-containing compounds, such as energetic halogen amines, aminyl
radicals, and nitrenes. NX2, NXY, and NX species will be trapped in low
temperature matrices for spectroscopic and photochemical characterization, while
the photochemistry of several NX3 and NX2Y species will be studied in the gas
phase. Ultraviolet/ visible absorption and laser-induced fluorescence spectra
will be obtained from the matrix-isolated species to characterize their
electronic states as well as to aid in understanding the photodissociation
dynamics of the gas-phase amines and their intermediates. %%% The family of
nitrogen-containing compounds known as halogen amines is interesting because
these compounds are notoriously unstable under standard conditions of
temperature and pressure. The reasons for this behavior are not understood, but
certain trends are observed, such as increasing instability in going from
compounds containing fluorine to those containing chlorine, bromine, and finally
iodine. An understanding of these issues in the halogen amines may aid in
elucidating the chemical nature of other nitrogen-bearing species.
