9451438 Goldfeather Graphics IRIS Crimson/VGXT, two Silicon Graphics INDY
workstations, and a Sony videocassette recorder equip an improved and expanded
3D Computer Graphics Laboratory (housed in the newly constructed Center for
Mathematics and Computing). This graphics laboratory supports the present
computer graphics course as well as independent study in computer graphics. The
course focuses on the foundations of modern computer graphics, with an emphasis
on the mathematics, physics, and computer science theories needed to render
raster images. Students progress from simple pixel-by-pixel calculations to a
final project involving realistic 3D images. The predominant independent study
project, known as Carl3D, is a student-written 3D graphics environment which can
create, display and manipulate images in a wide variety of formats. Students use
the advanced features of the graphics system to create visualization tools for
other students and faculty, with a particular emphasis on animation.
