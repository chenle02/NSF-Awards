This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
studying the struggle of a dependent, Caribbean society to define its identity
with respect to the dominant European society. The research will take place on
Martinique, a "department" of the French nation. Using participant observation,
interviewing of government officials, and studying popular culture, the student
will try to understand how local Martinique bureaucrats in charge of cultural
affairs define their cultural life with respect to the hegemony of France, and
how ordinary people deal with the issue of their "own" nationalism and their
status as French colonial citizens. This research is important because the
problem of national identity is critical for ex-colonial nations in the third
world. This case study of public officials and plain citizens deals with the
problems of establishing a positive identity with respect to the dominant
Western ex-colonial power. It can help us understand similar situations in other
geographic regions. With the breakdown of the USSR empire local cultural
conflicts will increase in importance, and any increase in our understanding of
the sources of conflicts about cultural identity can help decision makers deal
with them.
