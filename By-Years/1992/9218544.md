9218544 Parish This project is a one-year continuation of a successful
investigation into the antarctic surface and boundary layer wind field, with
specific emphasis on the extremely strong down-slope katabatic winds in the
vicinity of Terra Nova Bay. The outward flowing surface air is an integral part
of the meridional circulation, together with inflow and convergence aloft, and
generally sinking motion over the continent. The pattern of katabatic winds over
the sloping ice sheet is highly irregular, with air converging into several
narrow coastal regions to produce locally what are recognized as the strongest
and most persistent surface winds in the world. Known examples are at Cape
Denison and Port Martin in Adelie Land (facing Australia), and in Terra Nova Bay
on the western coast of the Ross Sea. Specific tasks to be undertaken as part of
this project are to complete the kinematic, dynamic, and climatological analysis
of specific katabatic events. Automatic weather station observations from the
vicinity of Terra Nova Bay, satellite imagery collected at McMurdo Station, and
synoptic weather analyses from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology will be
examined for the period of 1988 to 1991 to determine the broadscale conditions
associated with variations in the katabatic wind regime at Terra Nova Bay. ***
