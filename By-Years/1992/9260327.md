This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the
feasibility of low-cost video linking of rural schools and school districts by
means of conversion (now imaginable because of recent advances in technology) of
the former military technology of troposcatter radio for digital video
transmission over long distances in interactive classroom instruction. This
approach to communications beyond line-of- sight distances will compete with
two-way cable systems and high- speed telephone in the coming years, and the
proposed research will assess its value relative to solutions being explored by
larger industries. The proposal addresses an important problem of US education:
The future quality of rural education depends on high quality, low cost
communications. Moreover, it represents a peacetime application for education of
a derivative of advanced technology developed for the military.
