This project is aimed at development of a method for combustion- flame
production of diamond films; this method has the potential for deposition of
large area films on complex shapes. In this work, flames will be supported in a
combustion chamber wivh subsequent expansion of the product flame gases through
a converging-diverging nozzle to form a supersonic jet which will be directed
against a substrate for deposition of the desired films. This approach has the
potential to mitigate previous problems associated with diamond-film deposition
such as poor uniformity and high levels of grain impurities via control of the
chemical reactions and transport phenomena, thus leading to efficient and
uniform utilization of the combustion-generated active species in production of
high-quality diamond films. The basic principles involved in this approach are:
isolate the active portion of the fuel-rich combustion product cloud (which
contains high levels of species which lead to diamond deposition); freeze the
chemistry in that cloud through the rapid nozzle expansion process; transport
this "frozen" stream rapidly to the surface to be coated; modify the
uniformity/composition/temperature in an optimum fashion in transit; and
establish a thin, uniform boundary layer at the substrate surface across which
the active species can diffuse to strike the growing diamond film. The proposed
method for applying combustion-generated diamond films will significantly impact
a potential billion dollar market. When perfected, this new technique will
provide a practical, portable, low-cost method of applying diamond coatings to
materials as diverse as machine tools and electronic parts.
