This research program is in the areas of picosecond time-resolved Raman studies
of semiconductors, semiconductor multiple quantum well (MQW) structures and
energy transfer of electronic and molecular defects in ionic crystals. The
program is divided into three sub-programs: (1) transport properties of the
photoexcited electron-hole plasma (EHP) in semiconductors and semiconductor MQW
structures, (2) electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions and deep
impurities in semiconductor MQW structures, and (3) transient energy transfer of
electronic and molecular defects in alkali halides.
