*** ABSTRACT 96-61596 Kane This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop an algorithm for the real-time inversion of spectrograms
for ultrashort laser pulse measurement. Ultrafast laser systems have a large
number of applications in biochemistry, chemistry, physics, and electrical
engineering. These systems generate laser pulses with durations of 10
picoseconds or less and such systems are used to explore kinetics in proteins,
examine carrier relaxation in semiconductors, or image through turbid media. By
using ultrafast diagnostic systems, highly advanced semiconductors, electronic
circuitry, and even biomedical products can be developed and tested for
commercial applications. Furthermore, new applications requiring shaped
ultrashort pulses in both intensity and phase-such as coherent control of
chemical reactions are beginning to be developed. The continued development of
these applications will require, fast, high quality, and easy-to-use ultrafast
laser pulse diagnostics. Frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) has been
proven to be a reliable and effective ultrashort laser pulse diagnostic, but
requires an iterative algorithm to obtain the ultrashort pulse's characteristics
(intensity and phase). Current inversion algorithms are slow. During the Phase I
research effort, a new inversion algorithm will be developed that will obtain
the intensity and phase of an ultrashort pulse from the FROG device's output in
real time facilitating the development of a real-time oscilloscope for
ultrashort laser pulses. Immediate commercial applications are directed toward
use as a diagnostic for existing ultrafast laser systems for which few are
currently available. Other commercial applications for the algorithm include
scanning transmission electron microscopy. ***
