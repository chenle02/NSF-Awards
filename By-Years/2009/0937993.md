Abstract Existing data storage systems based on the hierarchical directory-tree
organization do not meet the scalability and functionality requirements for
exponentially growing datasets and increasingly complex metadata queries in
large-scale Exabyte-level file systems with billions of files. This project
focuses on a new decentralized semantic-aware metadata organization that
exploits semantics of file metadata to improve system scalability, reduce query
latency for complex data queries, and enhance file system functionality.

The research has four major components: 1) exploit metadata semantic-correlation
to organize metadata in a scalable way, 2) exploit the semantic and scalable
nature of the new metadata organization to significantly speed up complex
queries and improve file system functionality, 3) fully leverage the semantic-
awareness of the new metadata organization to optimize storage system designs,
such as caching, prefetching, and data de-duplication, and 4) implement the new
metadata organization, complex query functions, and system design optimizations
in large-scale storage systems. This project has broader impact to data-
intensive scientific and engineering applications, graduate and undergraduate
education, and K-12 education through its contributions to storage system
research and its integration with an existing NSF-REU site award and an NSF-
ITEST award.
