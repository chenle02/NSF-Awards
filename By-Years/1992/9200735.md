The workshop will bring together approximately twenty people from academia and
industry. The goal of the workshop is to identify critical research topics in
computer architecture as it relates to high performance computing. These topics
will consitute a set of "grand challenges" for computer architecture research
and development. The workshop will be held at Purdue University on December 11
to 13, 1991. A report on the discussions and conclusions will be published.
