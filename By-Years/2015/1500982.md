This award will provide support for sixteen U.S. mathematicians to participate
in the Research Term on Analysis and Geometry in Metric Spaces from April
through June, 2015 at the Instituto de Ciencias Matem√°ticas (ICMAT) in Madrid,
Spain. Metric spaces are useful models anytime one wants to consider sets of
objects with a natural notion of "distance" -- for example, images, DNA
sequences, and data in general can be modeled with metric spaces. Developing
calculus in metric spaces is useful in part because it allows one to formulate
and solve optimization problems in these settings. This research term will, in
particular, integrate metric space theory with a wide variety of applications
including image processing, reconstruction theory, control theory, and
robotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, program brings together three
areas of metric space research: first-order analysis (including theories of
Sobolev spaces, solutions to the p-Laplace equation, and functions of bounded
variation on metric measure spaces), geometric measure theory and variational
problems (particularly in the sub-Riemannian setting), and versions of weak
curvature (for example, the the setting of Alexandrov spaces). It is expected to
facilitate crossflow of ideas and techniques between these areas and establish
international collaborations between researchers. The schedule includes four,
week-long minicourses for non-specialists and young researchers during the month
of May taught by leading experts in metric space analysis and geometry, followed
by a workshop in June that brings together topics from the minicourses. Priority
for travel support from this award will be given to graduate students, early-
career mathematicians, and mathematicians from under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Term web site:
