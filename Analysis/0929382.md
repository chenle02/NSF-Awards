The proposed project is aimed at a wide range of problems in the theory of
elliptic partial differential equations on rough domains. The ultimate goal is
to understand the intricate relations between the geometry of the domain, the
nature of the data, the structure of the equation, and the regularity of the
solutions. Among other problems, the project addresses fundamental properties of
solutions to the higher order elliptic equations in arbitrary domains (such as
maximum principle and Wiener criterion), sharp estimates on the solutions of
Dirichlet and Neumann problems in terms of the data in the presence of boundary
singularities, as well as elliptic operators with complex bounded measurable
coefficients. The research plan incorporates techniques originating from
different branches of modern analysis (harmonic analysis, operator and spectral
theory, function spaces) and promotes the development of new methods, which
unravel some completely new phenomena.

The elliptic problems naturally arise in various branches of physics, such as
electrostatics, thermodynamics, and elasticity. However, despite its long
history, the theory of elliptic partial differential equations contains many
open questions. This work will contribute to further progress in the
aforementioned areas of science and engineering, and the results of the proposed
research will be disseminated at various levels: through publications and
presentations in national and international professional meetings, communication
with researchers in analysis and other fields, formal and informal educational
and outreach activities.
