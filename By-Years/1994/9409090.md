9409090 Rosenthal This research will focus on three related topics. In the first
project, game-thoeretic models are developed which focus on incentive schemes to
implement desirable public good allocations in situations where information is
incomplete for some social groups. In the second project, models are developed
which deal with the interacting dynamics between two social groups. The goal is
to explore under what conditions would opportunism drives out cooperation if
individual members of one group behave in an opportunistic manner against the
individuals of the other group. The third project develops models of
communication and coordination. The aim is to assess the effects of lags in the
flow of economic information across groups in the absence of market price
signals. The study is of significant interest because it would enrich our
understanding of how society is organized and the different ways individual
behavior respond to that organization.
