Since the era of Newton, mathematics has been a key tool in helping us
comprehend the nature of the universe. Famous examples are calculus via
Newtonian mechanics and differential geometry via Einstein's theory of general
relativity. During the last twenty years, there has been a great deal of
activity devoted to building a so-called string-theoretic model of the universe,
which incorporates some of the most sophisticated mathematics. The subject of
Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago during a period of intensive
interaction between mathematics and physics. Since then Gromov-Witten theory has
established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics. At the same
time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics,
ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of
Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten
theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable
examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact
Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and
Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great
importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best
experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition,
the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating
Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and
mathematical physics. The PIs hope to make important and substantial
contributions to these areas of mathematics, and their interrelations.

This project is interdisciplinary in nature, in that both physical and
mathematical ideas play central roles. In this sense it adds to the current
trend of interaction between mathematics and physics. This project emphasizes
teamwork and collaboration. Through research seminars, organizing and
participating in national and international conferences, this proposal will also
enhance the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as
postdoctoral fellows. There will be a number of research publications that will
help in introducing students to this exciting area of mathematics.
