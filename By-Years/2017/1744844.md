The goal of this project is to establish, through direct geological evidence,
whether complete deglaciation of East Antarctic marine basins took place during
past warm-climate periods. Direct geological information about whether the
Antarctic Ice Sheet responded catastrophically to past climate changes is
important to evaluating the likelihood of significant ice-sheet response to
future climate change. The team will assess the feasibility of achieving this
goal using cosmogenic-nuclide measurements on bedrock that is currently buried
under the ice sheet. They will conduct a reconnaissance and site survey to
identify potential drill sites where subglacial bedrock-exposure dating could
subsequently be used to test whether ice at those sites was absent when the
Earth last experienced current levels of carbon dioxideâ€”at approximately 3.0 to
3.3 million years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will seek out potential
sites that can address whether total deglaciation of subglacial basins in
coastal East Antarctica took place during past warm-climate periods like the
middle Pliocene warm period at circa 3.0-3.3 Ma. Ice-sheet model simulations
have identified marine ice-margin instability as a possible cause for higher
eustatic sea level during this period. In general, it is difficult to obtain
direct and unambiguous geological evidence that an ice sheet was smaller in the
past because if such evidence exists it is most likely inaccessible beneath the
present ice sheet. One means of overcoming this problem is to search for
significant concentrations of cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides in bedrock
surfaces beneath the present ice sheet. Such concentrations can only be produced
if the surface is ice-free, so significant cosmogenic-nuclide concentrations
would provide incontrovertible evidence that the ice sheet was smaller in the
past, and, in addition, can provide information about when this occurred. Guided
by ice-sheet model simulations of Pliocene deglaciation to identify areas where
complete deglaciation of the Wilkes subglacial basin would cause substantial
changes in the extent of bedrock exposure, the team will collect geophysical and
geochemical data to identify and evaluate sites with potential for future
bedrock recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
