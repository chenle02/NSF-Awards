The aim of this program is to improve the data acquisition and analysis skills
of undergraduate students. This issue is addressed on two levels. On the more
general level data acquisition hardware, data storage devices, and powerful
packages for the mathematical manipulation of data will enhance the laboratory
skills of the students. These skills are particularly important in problems
which require real-time responses. A specific subset of this problem is the
acquisition and manipulation of images. Students are prepared to design and
build hardware and software for interpreting biomedical images, including those
obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized axial tomography
(CAT scan), as well as X-RAY. The enhancement of the undergraduate computational
facility with state- of-the-art scanning and recording devices is needed to
increase student practical skills in this domain. Biomedical signal analysis,
especially as it applies to medical imaging, is one of the fastest growing
technologies of health care. It is vital that the undergraduate engineering
programs keep up with the demand for well-trained, knowledgeable engineers for
this industry.
