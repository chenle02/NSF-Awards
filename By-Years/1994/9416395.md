9416395 Zage This project funds an Industry/University Cooperative Research
Fellowship in which Drs. Wayne and Delores Zage of Ball State University will
conduct a study "Using Design Metrics Feedback During Software Development." The
researchers are an integral part of Purdue University/University of Florida's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Software Engineering. This
study is to be conducted at and cost shared by the Northrop Corp. The research
will evaluate the performance of the design metrics developed at Ball State
University as it is applied to ongoing software development in a controlled
industry experiment. The researchers are nationally recognized experts in their
field and well qualified to perform this project. The Program Manager recommends
Ball State University be awarded $15,000 for one year for this project.
