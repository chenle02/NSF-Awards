Modern atomic absorption spectrometric (AAS) techniques are being incorporated
into the project-based laboratory program in the Chemistry Department at
Hampden-Sydney College, through the recent acquisition of a computer-controlled
atomic absorption system. The addition of this instrumentation to current
holdings, and its instructional use, further encourages attitudes of
resourcefulness and independence in undergraduate students who can now profit
fully from the spectrum of scientific instrumentation available. Realistic
laboratory experiences are provided, beginning in the freshman and sophomore
years and continuing with increasing sophistication to activities in the
research- style junior/senior advanced laboratories.
