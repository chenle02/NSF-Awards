The Board of Earth Sciences and Resources provides over- sight of solid-earth
activities within the National Resarch Council. This action provides partial
support of the core activities of the Board and selected committees of the
Board. It is expected that the Board will produce reports assessing the health
of the science and identifying major research oppor- tunities and applications.
