The investigator continues to study general decomposable forms. In particular,
he seeks better bounds for the number of primitive integral solutions to non-
degenerate decomposable form equations and also stronger asymptotic results for
the number of integral solutions to the related inequality. In addition, the
investigator studies the absolute Siegel's lemma and the related Hermite's
constant over the algebraic numbers. The main goal here is an effective version
of the former and improved upper bounds for the latter.

The decomposable form equations dealt with here are examples of Diophantine
equations. These have been studied for millennia. Long thought to be mere
intellectual curiosities, it is now realized that knowledge in this area is
crucial in our ``digital" age. Much of cryptography, coding, and data exchange
rests on the ability, or lack thereof, to find solutions to such equations.
Siegel's lemma and Hermite's constant are intimately connected with sphere
packings, finite groups and error-correcting codes, and via these to many
disparate areas of science.
