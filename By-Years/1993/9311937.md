9311937 McClymont This project focuses on obtaining a theoretical understanding
of the relationship between active regions and the solar dynamo in which the
magnetic fields, and possibly free energy, are generated, and the dissipation of
magnetic free energy in solar flares. The investigation encompasses a study of
flux emergence, with the goal of determining whether a flux tube model of the
sub photospheric magnetic field can explain observed characteristics of active
region development, and a study of magnetic reconnection in the corona, with the
aim of understanding the scaling of the reconnection rate with resistivity, the
effect of gas pressure on current sheet formation, and the relationship between
magnetic reconnection in an incompressible fluid and reconnection in a
pressureless fluid. This research will lead to a greater understanding of the
formation and evolution of active regions of the sun. ***
