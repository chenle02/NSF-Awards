This project provides support facilities for an interdisciplinary
instrumentation and measurement course in a newly designed Bachelor of Science
in Electro Mechanical Engineering Technology program. Transducers and sensors
that are highly interdisciplinary will be introduced to the audiences.
Laboratory experiences of this nature greatly assist students in becoming
familiar with numerous types of transducer, data acquisition, principles of data
communication, as well as advanced graphical engineering software. Specifically
this project (1) introduces both digital and analog instrumentation and
measurement to the students; (2) allows students to acquire data from
transducers in an automated fashion; (3) allows students to use their acquired
data for further mathematical and graphical analysis; and (4) introduces the
principle of local networking to the students and provides a vehicle for
training hands on. The experiments in this laboratory are designed to be
flexible in order to permit modification and to allow the students to experience
interdisciplinary work exercises. The data acquisition, data communication, and
post-data-acquisition parts permit the students to become familiap with the
theoretical aspects of experiments.
