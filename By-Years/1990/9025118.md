The human auditory system is very important for spatial orientation. Hearing is
the only sense that can provide information about the position of remote events
regardless of where the observer is currently facing. The lateral location of
the ears make the auditory system well situated to direct positional changes of
the head and the eyes toward a target of interest. Recent experiments have shown
that the time required to locate and identify a visual event is substantially
improved if auditory spatial information on the location of the event is also
available. This research project considers the following issues: 1) What are the
factors underlying the improvement in visual search, for both horizontally and
vertically distributed targets, when aural aids are available? 2) Does this
auditory spatial advantage extend to visual search in depth, toward and away
from the observer? The results will have implications for any situation in which
efficient visual scanning is critical and acoustic spatial information can be
made available, such as visual arrays in cockpits or air traffic control
systems, development of mobility aids for individuals with visually restricted
visual fields, and pedestrian or industrial safety.
