Quorum sensing is a process that allows bacteria to communicate using secreted
chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers. This process enables a
population of bacteria to collectively regulate gene expression, and therefore
behavior. In general, processes controlled by quorum sensing are ones that are
unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium but become effective
when undertaken by the group. For example, quorum sensing controls
bioluminescence, secretion of virulence factors, sporulation, and conjugation.
We now know that intra- and inter-species cell-cell communication occurs, and
this combination of communication abilities was first described, and has been
most thoroughly studied, in the model luminous bacterium Vibrio harveyi. The
project focuses on V. harveyi, with the aims of exploring the molecular
mechanisms used for quorum sensing controlled gene regulation, further defining
the members of the quorum sensing regulon, determining the hierarchy of gene
expression, and exploring how information from the intra- and inter-species
autoinducers is integrated, processed and transduced to control community-wide
behavior. Teaching and service related activities are being undertaken as part
of this project. These activities include mentoring of undergraduate, graduate,
and postdoctoral fellows, instruction in Princeton University undergraduate and
graduate courses, Direction of the Princeton Graduate Program in Molecular
Biology, and Chairing of the Princeton University Biology Umbrella Development
Program, and the Committee for Scientific Direction, Curriculum Development, and
Faculty Recruitment. A high school outreach program is being developed for
teaching science to local children and teens. Science exhibits are being
developed for Science Museum in NYC. Editorial duties will be fulfilled on the
boards of Molecular Microbiology, Genetics, Journal of Bacteriology, and
Cellular an Molecular Proteomics. Grant and fellowship review work will be
performed for NSF, Keck, Damon Runyon, ASM and AAM.
