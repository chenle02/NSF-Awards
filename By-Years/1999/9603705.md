Paul B. Green 9603705 The developmental mechanisms producing shoot patterns in
plants are of interest for practical and theoretical reasons. The practical side
involves branching and the physical stability of the plant as well as the yield
of fruit or grain, which reflects the pattern in the flower producing it. The
theoretical side relates to the fact that plants show only two centric patterns:
whorls as in the iris flower, and crossed spirals as in the pine cone. Why only
these two, with one of them (spirals) involving the golden section (1:0.618),
long known as special irrational fraction in mathematics? This grant is to
further establish that the explanation lies in the physical folding of tissue
that occurs to produce the lateral organ, be it a limb, petal, flower, etc., at
the top of the plant. Testing this idea requires advanced mathematics, but it is
in range of current engineering analytical approaches.
