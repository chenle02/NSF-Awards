With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor Vernon D. Parker at Utah State University will continue work carried
out over the past five years that employed non-steady-state kinetic methods to
show that a number of reactions long believed to take place by simple single-
step second-order mechanisms are actually more complex and proceed via
kinetically significant reaction intermediates. The non-steady-state kinetic
method developed in the previous grant period is based upon the observation that
the bimolecular reactions examined thus far all take place by the reversible
consecutive second-order mechanism involving kinetically significant reaction
intermediates. New mechanistic probes developed will be used to examine SN2,
elimination, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, group transfer, and Diels-Alder
reactions. The research suggested is expected to greatly increase the
understanding of bimolecular organic reaction mechanisms. Results are also
expected to correct misconceptions based upon the belief that all of these
reactions proceed from reactant to product via a single transition
state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in
the Chemistry Division supports Professor Vernon D. Parker at Utah State
University who will challenge the accepted belief that the bimolecular reactions
that are the backbone of Physical Organic Chemistry follow simple single-step
mechanisms with single transition states on the reaction coordinate between
reactants and products. The cutting-edge research will train undergraduate,
graduate and postgraduate students who will take part in state-of-the-art
research on projects of general interest. Professor Parker will publish the
results of this work in high quality journals as well as present seminars on the
results, and publish review articles to bring the results into context.
Collaborative projects with US researchers and researchers from abroad will be
developed.&lt;br/&gt;
