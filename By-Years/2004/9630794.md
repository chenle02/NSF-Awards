9630794 Bujarski The molecular mechanisms of RNA recombination in RNA viruses
using brome mosaic virus(BMV) as a model system will be investigated. BMV
mutants isolated and characterized during the tenure of the previous award has
demonstrated that replication and recombination functions can be unlinked. As an
approach to understanding how BMV proteins participate in nonhomologous
heteroduplex-mediated recombination, we will 1. analyze the involvement of the
1a helicase domain in recombination, 2. analyze the involvement of RNA
polymerase (2a protein) core domain in recombination and 3. study the role of
the N-domain of the 2a protein in recombination. %%% Only a limited amount of
information concerning the mechanisms involved in non-homologous RNA-RNA
recombination is available. Such recombination plays a key role in RNA virus
genome plasticity, as it can lead to the generation of new virus strains and
species. An understanding of the basic mechanisms of RNA-RNA recombination will
provide valuable insight into viral evolution and diversity and could provide
important practical information which could be used for applied goals. ***
