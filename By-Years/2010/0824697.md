The proposed planning visit will develop a long-term collaboration between the
University of Alaska, Fairbanks and Leiden University in the Netherlands. The
objective of this collaboration is to reconstruct the linguistic prehistory of
the Alor-Pantar language family. The Alor-Pantar languages are among the least
studied languages of Indonesia, and their genetic relationships with other
languages in the region remain the subject of some controversy, largely due to
the scarcity of relevant data. The host for the planning visit is Dr. Marian
Klamer of the Leiden University?s Center for Linguistics. Dr. Klamer is a
linguist whose work has focused on the minority languages of eastern Indonesia.
She directed the Linguistic Variation in Eastern Indonesia: The Alor and Pantar
Project, which provided the first comprehensive survey of Alor-Pantar languages.
During the planning visit the researchers will assemble a database of 500
lexical items and develop a future strategy for collaboration between the two
institutions.
