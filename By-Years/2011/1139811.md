This award will support the Pacific Coast Undergraduate Mathematics Conference
(PCUMC) which will be held in March of 2012 at the California Polytechnic
Institute in Pomona, California. NSF funding will allow 350 undergraduate
participants to attend the 2012 PCUMC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the
conference are to provide an opportunity for undergraduates to share their
research and expository projects, provide a forum for students to learn more
about graduate school and career options in the mathematical sciences, and to
encourage the participation of undergraduate women and minorities, and students
just beginning their undergraduate career, in the math community. The conference
has been held every year since 2006, growing from 80 participants in 2006 to 330
participants in 2011. The prior conferences have received enthusiastic feedback
from student and faculty participants and have been successful in engaging
members of under-represented groups.
