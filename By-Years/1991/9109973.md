A scanning tunneling microscope will be designed and constructed for measuring
surface displacements in the nanometer range in multiphase materials. The
results are particularly needed for improving and guiding mechanics modeling of
interfacial fracture in composite materials. Initially composites of polymer
matrix and graphite fibers, as well as adhesive bonding of metals will be
examined, and as the technique is refined the study of the deformation and
fracture behavior of interfaces in ceramics and metal based composites should
also be possible.
