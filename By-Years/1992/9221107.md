This research addresses the question of whether the ability of a plant to
develop leaves with different morphology and physiology in response to different
growth temperatures promotes survival and/or increased seed production. I will
conduct experiments under natural conditions and in controlled environments to
compare the anatomy, morphology, and physiology of leaves that develop at
different temperatures. I will then determine whether plants that are better at
changing leaf characteristics in response to temperature changes survive better
and/or produce more seeds. The extent to which the ability to change leaf
characteristics in response to temperature is a genetically determined trait
that can be inherited will also be determined. The results of this research will
contribute to our basic understanding of how organisms respond to changes in
their environment. This understanding, in turn, may help in predicting the
effects of natural disturbances and human impacts on the environment on plants
and animals.
