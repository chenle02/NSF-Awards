9512560 Sadra This proposal requests a laser-patterned system for the in-situ
fabrication of III-V semiconductor devices. The system consists on an ArF/F2
excimer laser with patterning optics, etching chamber and hardware to couple
with an existing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) facility. The additional equipment
will extend the PI's research program into promising areas, such as new devices
and semiconductor fabrication equipment. The advanced device structures which
might result from this effort are devices needing multiple regrowth operations.
The ability to perform growth, patterning, etching and overgrowth in a reliable
manner without removing the substrate from the vacuum would provide an important
step forward in the use of MBE technology. ***
