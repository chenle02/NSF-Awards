This ongoing project is designed to cover the final phase of a collaborative
study to determine the origin and evolution of the Laramie Anorthosite Complex
by mapping, experimental petrology, and whole-rock and isotopic geochemistry of
selected samples. The study should increase understanding of anorthosite
petrogenesis and the origin of massive Fe-Ti oxide bodies, which are the major
reserves of titanium in the U.S. and potentially important sources of iron.
