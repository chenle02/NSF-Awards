The ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy,
practice, culture, and organizational climate. The ADVANCE Institutional
Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative
organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to
enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
academic workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villanova University (VU) is in a time
of transition in leadership, strategic priority, and most importantly to its new
national status as a Doctoral Research University. The PIs propose to
intentionally manage this transition to ensure that faculty, specifically STEM
female and underrepresented minority (URM) faculty, flourish in the changing
climate. Three main thrusts will be orchestrated to accomplish their goals. The
first thrust, change management, will include retreats for administrators with a
special focus on diversity and inclusion and faculty workshops focused on
resilience during change. Hiring, promotion, and assessment, the second thrust,
will include diversity statements for job candidates; diversity and inclusion
goals; funds for bringing candidates to campus; broad stakeholder bias training;
and policy review for bias. The final thrust, improving the culture for
diversity, inclusion, and equity, will include administrator and faculty
workshops on creating a diverse and equitable culture; workshops on allies,
inclusive classrooms, and microaggressions; the expansion of intersectional
conversations for faculty; leadership activities; Employee Resource Groups
(ERGs); and the training and support of faculty allies. This ADVANCE IT project
will result in new strategies to ensure equity for all STEM faculty during
institutional transitions to increased research expectations of faculty. .
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the Villanova ADVANCE IT project, research on
the effects of chairperson mindfulness training on departmental climate will be
conducted. Biases are especially prevalent when people engage in automatic
rather than controlled thinking and automatic thinking is more likely when
psychological resources are low such as when people are coping with stress.
Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress and is at the cutting edge
of psychological research and practice. Given these elements, the proposed
research intends to measure the impact of mindfulness training of department
chairpersons' stress and the potential change in departmental climate from the
perspective of departmental stakeholders. The use of a randomized control group
makes the experiment especially powerful as a way to isolate the effects of this
training on departmental climate. Furthermore, given the centrality of the
academic department to institutional change during the transition to increasing
research expectations of faculty, this focus is especially
promising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
