This grant is for partial support of expenses of invited participants at a
Symposium entitled "Chemistry and Spectroscopy of Interstellar Molecules". The
symposium will be held in conjunction with a congress of the chemical societies
of the United States, Canada, and Japan in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22,
1989. The chemistry and spectroscopy of interstellar molecules is a complex,
highly interdisciplinary subject that requires state of the art knowledge in
astronomy, chemistry, and physics for significant progress. The symposium which
is being organized on this subject will introduce a much wider array of chemists
to the problems and should yield important cross fertilization and information
exchange among scientists working in a variety of areas.
