Dr Quinn and his team will modify their smoothed-particle hydrodynamic code to
follow the formation of dwarf galaxies, by improving the resolution and
including a treatment of dust and dense gas. The code follows the gravitational
collapse of both dark matter and gas, and tracks heating and cooling of the gas
to determine when it should form new stars. Improvements will include an
approximation to follow the formation and destruction of dust and hydrogen
molecules, and thus determine the gas cooling as the gas temperature drops below
10,000 K. This approximation will be tested and adjusted by comparing
simulations with isolated Milky-Way-like galaxies and dwarf systems. The code
will then be used to examine when star formation is quenched in the lowest-mass
dark halos, leaving them without any stars to form a visible galaxy. Galaxies
will be placed in their cosmological context by zooming-in on an interesting
region of a larger-scale simulation, and following the development of that
region at higher resolution. Simulated observations of the models will be
generated, for comparison to observed galaxies.

A graduate student will be trained by participating in the research. The team
will continue its work with undergraduates in the University of Washington's
"pre-map" program: this program is managed by science graduate students, and
aims to attract under-represented students into science majors.
