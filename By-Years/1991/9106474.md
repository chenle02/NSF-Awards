The accurate forecasting of the form of precipitation in wintertime storms (e.g.
rain, snow, freezing rain) is a challenging problem with potentially great
societal benefit. The Principal Investigator will investigate the factors that
determine precipitation form and its impact on the structure of the parent
storm. The study will include a climatological effort, diagnostic and numerical
modeling studies. Particular emphasis will be placed on the study of snow that
falls at temperatures above zero degrees centigrade. Such storms cause great
damage and present forecasters with formidable problems.
