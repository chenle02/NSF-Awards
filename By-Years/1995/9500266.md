9500266 Barber This award is for the purchase of computer system and support
equipment which will be dedicated to several research projects, including in
particular: (1) a virtual decision making environment for the evaluation of
graphics and interface software, (2) an interactive virtual environment to
promote distributed scheduling in manufacturing arenas, (3) a visual
specification environment for the development of safe, dependable, time-critical
systems, (4) analyzing aural and visual effects on the software evolution
process, (5) simulation and evaluation of robotic systems in virtual
environments, and (6) recognition of interactive cues in the virtual decision
environment. The research to be performed using this equipment seeks to develop
tools to support the fast but accurate decision-making needed for agile
manufacturing. Decisions made in a virtual decision environment can be easily
evaluated for effectiveness without the time and capital expense required in the
operational factory. The results of simulations can then be implemented on the
factory floor, thus minimizing down time, equipment modifications, replanning
and rescheduling. A virtual decision environment would not replace human
decision-making, but would offer a level of support that improves the ability to
make frequent, rapid and vital decisions in the manufacturing enterprise.
