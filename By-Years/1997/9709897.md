This Research Planning Grant is supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. Professor Zoski is spending a sabbatical initiating a
collaboration with Professor Dana R. Kester of the Graduate School of
Oceanography at the Narragansett Bay Campus of the University of Rhode Island.
During this time she is learning the special requirements of doing analytical
chemistry in a marine environment together with her students. This project will
focus on fabricating microelectrodes and microsensors and characterizing their
function under real marine environmental conditions. These electrodes will be
compared with commercially available sensors for analytes such as oxygen that
employ membranes to protect against fouling. The behavior of bare metal
microelectrodes in marine samples will be characterized using a sequence of
applied potential pulses designed to clean and activate the metal surface and
then analyze for specific analytes. The course of this applied work will be
guided by fundamental theoretical work, the PI's area of expertise, throughout
this project. This work focusses on the development of microelectrodes and
microsensors that can be used in the complex matrices found in marine aquatic
samples. Theoretical and experimental work will be used together to characterize
the analytical responses of these electroanalytical probes so that robust, real-
time systems can be developed and used for marine chemical analysis. Professor
Zoski and her students at the University of Rhode Island will begin a
collaboration with Professor Kester at the university's Graduate School of
Oceanography that will result in more reliable analytical information about the
chemistry of marine environments.
