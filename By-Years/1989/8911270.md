This ocean sciences instrumentation development project will design and
construct a light weight, cost-effective, and maneuverable deep sea television
system. It will provide ocean scientists with real-time, digital color video
with very high resolution in depths to 6,000 meters. Its size, weight, and
reliability will make it usable from ships of opportunity without a complex
support system. The key development to this system's relatively small size is a
new electro-optic cable. Existing deep-sea camera systems require a thick cable
to provide mechanical strength and to deliver required electrical power to the
deep ocean. The newly designed cable will be only 9.5 mm in diameter, thereby
reducing much of the weight and complexity of larger systems. The cable will
also have much greater bandwidth than standard oceanographic cables to allow
transmission of high resolution color video. The new camera system will provide
enhanced capabilities for a number of seafloor research and exploration
projects, several of which relate to studies of the Exclusive Economic Zone off
Hawaii.
