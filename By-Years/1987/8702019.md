This research is concerned with the development of a theory of presentations of
inverse monoids. There are two general areas of problems which will be studied.
The first is concerned with basic decision problems which arise when an inverse
monoid is presented by generators and relations. In particular, the word problem
and the E-unitary problem will be studied, with initial emphasis focussed on the
one relator case. Many of the geometric techinques from combinatorial group
theory as well as basic results from language theory and automata theory will be
used. The second problem is concerned with a study of the closed inverse
submonoids of the free inverse monoid and related problems. In particular, the
relationship between the closed inverse submonoids of a free inverse monoid, the
topology of finite graphs, the rational and recognizable subsets of a free
inverse monoid and the dot depth of a finite aperiodic inverse monoid will be
studied in detail. In addition, an attempt will be made to begin a computational
theory of finite inverse semigroups of partial one-one transformations. This
research concerns the theory of monoids, the simplest of the abstract algebraic
objects introduced in the last century. The particular ones that the
investigators are interested in are precisely those structures arising in
automata theory and the theory of formal languages in computer science. Their
techniques range from group theory to geometry to computations. Their approaches
to the problems are imaginative. This proposal should make important
contributions to both mathematics and computer science.
