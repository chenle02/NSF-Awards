The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute will acquire two computation
servers, two file servers, two web servers, three bootservers, five graphics
workstations, and 45 commodity (PC) workstations which will be dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
our 1997-1999 programs in Stochastic Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, Model Theory
of Fields, Symbolic Computation, Foundations of Computational Mathematics, and
Random Matrix Models. we will move to a network model with commodity
workstations in each office and higher end workstations in public laboratories,
all providing access to specialized servers elsewhere on the network.
