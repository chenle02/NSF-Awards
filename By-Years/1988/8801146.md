This proposal is to defray expenses for participants attending the Northwest
Regional Developmental Biology Conference to be held May 12-14, 1988 at Friday
Harbor. The meeting will include platform sessions of short talks in the
following areas: Gene Expression in development Cellular Interactions in
development Cell Lineages and Morphogenesis Gametes and Fertilization
Development of the Nervous System There will also be four longer formal talks on
the role of growth factors in development as well as poster sessions. These
regional meetings have provided important opportunities for developmental
biologists at all levels to meet with their colleagues within the region.
