9362151 Podany A new high resolution paint spraying technology suitable for
industrial, robotic applications is to be investigated. This technology would
facilitate the automated application of uniform coatings for decorative and
functional painting as well as eliminate tedious manual mask and spray
techniques currently used in industry. The project will investigate the use of
an applicator as a precision paint spraying or coating device for robotic
applications and will have as its objectives the development of a model of the
applicator suitable for computerized robot path planning. Specific objectives
are the characterization of the applicator's spray pattern, volumetric spray
characteristics, spray velocity, and resulting coating characteristics, i.e.
thickness and uniformity, as functions of atomization and fluid pressure, the
nozzle, electronic control of the coating feed, and geometric parameters such as
applicator distance, angle, and velocity. This applicator would reduce industry
costs and environmental hazards while the precise, uniform application of
functional and decorative coatings would allow the automation of certain manual,
tedious coating tasks previously thought difficult, if not impossible, to
automate.
