This five-year award continues the operation of the Millstone Hill Observatory
in conjunction with scientific investigations of the upper atmosphere and
ionosphere. The Millstone Hill Observatory is part of the Haystack Observatory,
located near Westford, Massachusetts. The observatory is situated at a magnetic
latitude of 55 degrees, such that its extensive field of view for ionospheric
observations encompasses the full extent of mid-latitude, sub-auroral, and
auroral features and processes. The radar is operated about 1000 hours per year
in support of several community-driven science programs, as well as individual
investigator requests. The research emphasis of the observatory staff includes a
broad range of topics involving processes and dynamics of the thermosphere,
ionosphere, and magnetosphere, along with investigations of plasma waves and
magnetic storm effects. In addition to scientific research, the staff supports
outside users by developing means for efficient access to the observed and
analyzed parameters via the World Wide Web. Web access is also used for
scheduling usage of the instruments, coordinating community-interaction
workshops, and disseminating education and outreach materials. Broader impacts
of the Millstone Hill program include mentoring of undergraduate students,
scientific contributions to space weather and global change forecasting, and
dissemination of data for scientific and educational use.
