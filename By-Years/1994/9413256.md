9413256 CALDEIRA This is a proposal for a workshop on legitimacy and compliance
in the context of processes of democratization. The end of the Cold War and the
more general spread of democracy throughout the world have generated tremendous
intellectual interest in how democracies arise, take hold, persist, and perish.
Two important subsets of these questions are how and under what conditions
political and legal institutions acquire legitimacy and gain compliance; and
what, if any, relationship is there between the legitimacy of institutions and
compliance with law. Not nearly enough scholars are pursuing these theoretical
and empirical issues. Accordingly, this project will develop a more coordinated
and integrated agenda of research. The proposed workshop will help to shape this
agenda and develop a coherent set of intellectual issues for research. ***
