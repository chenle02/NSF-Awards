Two fundamental problems in marine zooplankton ecology are 1) poor understanding
of the micro-scale distribution of organisms and 2) lack of ability to collect
synoptic or even quasi-synoptic taxonomic data. Dr. Davis and collaborators
propose to assemble a Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), from available technology,
which will measure the distribution of zooplankton and identify them to major
taxa (copepods, chaetognaths, etc) in quasi-real-time at towing speeds of 1-10
knots with along-track spatial resolution of 5-30 um. They will then use the VPR
to sample micro-meso-scale distributions of zooplankton in a wide variety of
hydrographic regimes along a transect line from Woods Hole to the Sargasso Sea.
These data will provide insights into the prevalence of micro-scale patchiness
under various hydrographic and wind conditions and will reveal the spatial
relationships within and among taxa along a continuum of scales from microns to
kilometers.
