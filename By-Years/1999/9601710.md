This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University acquire a fourier transform
infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas including the following: (1) chemical and electrochemical synthesis of
polymers and the characterization of their electrical and optical properties (2)
biomaterials including protein structure-function relationships, and (3) solid-
state materials including the synthesis and characterization of new ternary and
quaternary metal chalcogenids, particularly tellurides. A fourier transform
infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) can provide important information about chemical
structure reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of
the properties of reactivity and nonreactivity of molecules.
