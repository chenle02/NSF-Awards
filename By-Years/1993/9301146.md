Dr. Thea C. Norman has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Norman's doctoral degree was from the University of
California/Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Clayton Heathcock. Dr.
Norman will continue research at the University of California/Berkeley under the
sponsorship of Professor Peter Schultz. Dr. Norman's postdoctoral research will
provide her with the solid state and monoclonal antibody techniques necessary to
prepare synthetic biopolymers. Longer term she plans to develop new biopolymers
whose backbones are optimized for therapeutic applications including membrane
permeability and biostability. %%% The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
