The program introduces faculty members from regional colleges and institutions
to new types of computer-based technology. Emphasis will be on the integration
of these technologies into existing science courses, especially at the
introductory level. The two week intensive training workshop will present
information on video disc technology, CD-ROM materials, telecommunications, and
multimedia applications. Participants will see and use examples of materials
that are available in their specific disciplines. Sufficient hands-on
opportunities will be provided to enable participants to become proficient with
the use of available materials. They will be expected to integrate the new
technology into classes at their home institutions and to share their knowledge
and expertise with other faculty members.
