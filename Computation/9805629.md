This project centers on parameter identification inverse problems. Typically, in
such a problem one is given certain information about the solution of a partial
differential equation and one is hopeful of using this information to compute
one or more of the coefficients in the equation. Such problems are typically
mathematically ill-posed and, to make matters worse, in processing the data in
many practical applications, one must contend not only with measurement error
but sometimes also with the fact that the readings may only be taken at a rather
sparse collection of measurement points. In this proposal we outline a
continuation of work on a new and very promising approach to a broad class of
parameter identification problems. At the core of the method is the Dirichlet
principle for elliptic boundary value problems, that the solution may be
obtained by the minimization of a certain energy functional; that the same
energy functional can also be used to compute coefficients in the elliptic
equation, if an appropriate constrained minimization is employed, is the
significant observation that drives much of the work in this proposal. Extensive
numerical experiments have shown that the same numerical stability that is
associated with the Dirichlet principle approach to finding solutions is also
present (assuming the appropriate stabilization is employed) in the constrained
minimization; in particular the method appears to be quite robust in the
presence of noise in the data. The parameter identification problems amenable to
this approach are, roughly speaking, those that involve elliptic equations that
may besolved by means of a Dirichlet principle; as is well known this is a large
class, having considerable practical significance. In addition, many parameter
identification inverse problems involving parabolic (diffusion) and hyperbolic
(wave propagation) equations may be restated to a form covered by this theory,
and thus the eventual impact is expected to be even greater.

The first part of the project involves producing working algorithms to identify,
from easily obtainable measurements, the various parameters needed to quantify
flow in porous media. This is a crucial step in the modeling of underground
water systems and a necessary first step when one wishes for example to manage
water resources efficiently, or to predict the effects on an aquifer caused by
environmental factors such as flooding or industrial pollution. The second part
of the project is concerned with the problem of imaging inside the human body
with electrical impedance tomography. Here, one attempts, by means of low
voltage electrical measurements taken at the surface of a subject, to form an
image of the interior. Such imaging has the advantage of being both non-invasive
and non-destructive, and inexpensive; current disadvantages include poor image
quality, and it is hoped that improvements can be accomplished by methods
related to those used above. Related practical applications of these ideas
include non-destructive evaluations involving the determination of gas pores,
impurities, and cracks in cast metals; such problems are of interest in a
variety of manufacturing situations, including the inspection of airplane parts,
and also in the manufacture and testing of nuclear reactor containment vessels.
