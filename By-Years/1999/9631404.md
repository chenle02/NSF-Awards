9631404 Karrer DNA rearrangement is a basic biological process which occurs in
organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. The ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena,
is a particularly advantageous system in which to study such rearrangements
because the genome undergoes thousands of site specific DNA rearrangements which
can be synchronously induced in large numbers of cells. Previous work in this
laboratory has resulted in the cloning and characterization of DNA rearrangement
fragment which contains a long, 825 bp inverted repeat near the junctions. Such
repeats are found elsewhere in the micronuclear genome suggesting that they are
critical to the necessary DNA rearrangements needed to produce the macronucleus.
Cloning and structural analysis of additional members of the Tir family of
rearrangements will be done; cis-acting DNA sequences necessary and sufficient
for DNA rearrangements will be identified and tested for function by
transforming Tetrahymena with DNA constructs containing rearrangement junctions;
and the mechanism of Tir1 rearrangement will be explored by searching for DNA
intermediates. %%% Mechanisms which result in a rearrangement of DNA sequences
can be more easily explored and understood using a single-celled model organism
such as Tetrahymena. Such rearrangements of DNA genomes are common in organisms
ranging from bacteria to mammals and are often developmentally controlled, as
they are in Tetrahymena. This work will give a better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms which can be involved. ***
