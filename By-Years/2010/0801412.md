Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0801412&lt;br/&gt;S. Yun, Massachusetts General
Hospital&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The overall goal of this
project is to understand and develop novel modelocking techniques in wavelength-
swept lasers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Sliding Frequency
Modelocking (SFM) is a new technique for generating swept pulses using a unique
mechanism to swept operation. A deeper understanding of SFM would greatly
enhance our ability to develop a novel swept laser for new applications. This
project aims to explore the fundamentals and technologies of SFM through
theoretical and experimental investigations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The proposed research promises to make important contributions to the
fundamental understanding of swept laser technology and modelocking. It will
provides the following: (1) improved theoretical models of modelocked swept
lasers, (2) understanding and implementation of traditional modelocking
techniques, such as active phase modulation and Kerr lens modelocking in swept
lasers, and (3) novel picosecond swept lasers and high-speed Ti:sapphire swept
lasers. Mode-locked swept lasers may enable a variety of applications ranging
from nonlinear imaging to time-resolved spectroscopy. This project provides an
ideal opportunity to educate and train graduate students and research fellows in
the highly innovative and collaborative environment at Harvard Medical School.
Undergraduate students enrolled in the Harvard-MIT HST summer institute and
summer internship will participate in this project. Our group has extensive
collaborations with other research groups as well as with industry. Mode-locked
swept lasers have a significant potential to become a powerful light source to
enable and facilitate a variety of applications, particularly in biomedical
imaging to advance health care.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
