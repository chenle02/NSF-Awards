Understanding and responding to climate change is a key scientific and societal
challenge of the 21st century. Recent advances in satellites and environmental
sensors have made it possible to gather vast quantities of data concerning
temperature, sea ice, sea level, rainfall, vegetation, etc. There is an urgent
need for scientific and technical expertise for developing and effectively
applying computational tools that can make use of such data to build
increasingly accurate predictive models that offer insights to inform our
understanding of, and response to, climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award supports a series of three workshops on Climate Informatics, an emerging
discipline at the intersection of climate sciences and data sciences. The
workshops, through a combination of tutorials that introduce climate scientists
and data scientists to each other's disciplines, invited talks by established
researchers in climate informatics, breakout sessions and for identifying
research challenges and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations,
serve a critically important role in building a vibrant Climate Informatics
research community. The award provides support for the participation of
approximately 60 to graduate students in each of the three workshops. The
workshops contribute to the education and interdisciplinary training of a
diverse workforce in STEM areas that span Climate Sciences and Data Sciences
(including Machine Learning, Data Mining, Inference, Decision Making) as well as
efforts to broaden the participation of women and other underrepresented groups
in STEM research and education. Additional information about the Climate
Informatics Workshop Series can be found at:
