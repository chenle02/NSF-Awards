This is a three-year pilot project designed by the MIT-Japan S&amp;T Program to
increase the capacity of American scientists and engineers in using existing
Japanese technical publications as reference in conducting their research. While
great numbers of Japanese researchers can comfortably use English-language
technical publications, very few of their American counterparts can do so with
Japanese language publications. There is a critical need for more effective
technical communication between American and Japanese researchers. The project
is designed so that ultimately it may be continued without additional external
support.
