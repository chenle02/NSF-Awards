This project consists of the analysis phase of an earlier three-year field study
of the mesoscale structure of the upper layers of the ice- covered Weddell Sea.
The field program produced a substantial data base from a series of drifting
oceanographic buoys set out from the West German research vessel POLARSTERN in
the austral summer of 1986, and with complementary oceanographic and atmospheric
observations, will form the basis of a quantitative study of the dynamics of the
upper ocean in the eastern portion of the Weddell Gyre. The project will
concentrate on processing and analyzing the drifter data that is still being
received through a satellite link from one of the buoys, preparing a
comprehensive data report, and completing the fundamental modeling program of
the warm and cold water regimes in the vicinity of Maud Rise.
