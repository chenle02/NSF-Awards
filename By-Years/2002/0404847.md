The 2nd International Conference on Particle and Fundamental Physics in Space
(SpacePart '03) ) is an important international conference which will explore
the possibilities for the next 20 years for doing fundamental physics in space.
The conference will bring together researchers, both theoretical and
experimental from the disciplines of cosmology, gravitation and elementary
particle physics. &lt;br/&gt;. The funds will be used to support graduate
students, Post-docs and junior faculty who otherwise could not afford to attend
the meeting. It will also be used to help pay for a mini-Quarknet workshop for
High School Teachers. . The school will be held in Washington DC from December
10-12 2003. &lt;br/&gt;
