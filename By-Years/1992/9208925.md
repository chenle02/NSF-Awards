This high-field 250 MNz (5.86 Tesla) superconducting Fourier Transform Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance spectrometer will be used for high-quality, routine spectra
and studies requiring long experimental times. Examples of programs that will
make use are involving synthesis and characterization of highly-branched
dendritic macromolecules with micellar properties. These polymers have valuable
solublilizing and catalytic properties. Another program involves application of
spectroscopic methods for the characterization of polymers, investigation of
initiation reactions, and polymerization kinetics.//
