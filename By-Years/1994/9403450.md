This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program provides support for
Professor Weber's investigations of the fundamental issues and problems
associated with the development of useful membrane sensors for organic anions
and the development of microextraction devices for these anions. Potentiometric
sensors for cations have been successfully implemented for a variety of species,
and the results have had a dramatic impact in the fields of bioanalytical
chemistry and biotechnology. Professor Weber proposes to create new sensors for
anionic species by synthesizing new artificial receptors for the selective
extraction of anions into plasticized polymer media. New anion sensors for ions
such as carboxylates, glutamate and aspartate are urgently needed in such
diverse areas as neurochemistry, the food industry and biotechnology. This grant
in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support research into the
development of practical membrane sensors for organic anions. The goal is to
create a suite of anion sensors similar in function to those already existing
for cationic species. The research will involve the synthesis and
characterization of artificial receptors which will selectively extract anions
into polymeric membranes. The sensors will be used to detect anions such as
acidic neurotransmitters, decomposition products in food, and waste products in
bioreactors
