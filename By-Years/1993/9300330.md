9300330 Bierzychudek This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at
Pomona College to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduate Site. The
program will provide full-time summer stipends for eight students, and part of
semester- long academic year stipends for 10 more to work jointly with faculty
advisors on a variety of projects in the biological sciences, including
molecular biology, population and behavioral biology, physiology and cell
biology. Support activities will ensure that students have ample opportunity to
develop independence, to discuss their work with one another, and to draw
together their results for presentation to others. In addition, activities are
provided to encourage younger students to consider engaging in a research
experience. Significant numbers of women, underrepresented minorities, and
students from schools where research opportunities are limited will be involved
in the program. ***
