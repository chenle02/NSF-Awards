The goals of this research are, first to develop a widely applicable assay for
measuring the activation of calcium- dependent proteases ("calpains", EC
3.4.22.17), and second, to determine whether alterations in calcium homeostasis,
either influx through the plasma membrane or release of intracellular calcium
stores regulate autoproteolytic activation of these proteases. The results of
these studies will provide the basis for subsequent investigations to identify
physiological substrates, which may include talin, filamin, fodrin and protein
kinase C, and the consequences of proteolytic modification on the functions of
these proteins. An increase in intracellular calcium is one important type of
cellular response to certain external signals. Mechanisms by which a generalized
increase in intracellular calcium is translated into specific, local effects on
different cellular functions are currently being sought and studied by many
laboratories. One such mechanism which has only begun to be appreciated is the
activation by calcium of specific protease enzymes. This mechanism is
potentially of great importance, but the absence of an assay for calcium-
dependent proteases in cells has prevented elucidation of the details of their
regulation and identification of their physiological substrates. Thus, the
contributions of these enzymes to localized, calcium-dependent processes such as
secretion, membrane fusion, and other cellular functions have remained obscure.
The results of this research promise to provide a new dimension of insight into
the mechanisms of cellular signalling involving calcium.
