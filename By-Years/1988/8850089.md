Miami University, Oxford Campus will implement a summer enrichment program in
molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology for high school students as
Young Scholars. Twelve students who have completed their junior year will be
selected from the high schools of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. Young Scholars
will spend 6 weeks during the summer of 1987-88 and 1988-89 in residence at
Miami University. Students will attend formal lecture presentations and research
seminars in the morning, Monday through Friday, and perform research experiments
in molecular biology research projects in the laboratories of selected faculty
research mentors from the Botany, Microbiology, and Zoology Departments in the
afternoons. Additionally, Young Scholars will attend informal seminars on career
opportunities in molecular biology, on the college admission process, and the
scientific ethics, risk, and social responsibilities of recombinant DNA
researchers. Miami's residence hall staff will arrange different social,
cultural, and sports activities for the Young Scholars.
