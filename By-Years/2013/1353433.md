This project examines the values embedded in formal mechanisms, such as risk
assessment and cost benefit analysis, that could be used to assess the impact of
emerging technologies, with synthetic biology as a case study. The project aims
to refine the understanding of these mechanisms, facilitate their thoughtful use
in policy-making, deepen the social debate about synthetic biology, and advance
the debate about the values that ought to guide impact assessment for emerging
technologies generally. The project sets out three applications of synthetic
biology, develops formal impact assessments for them, and convenes a panel of
experts who, collectively, have expertise in synthetic biology, governance of
technologies, and the theory and use of impact assessments. With the help of
this panel, the project's leadership team will engage in conceptual and
philosophical analysis of the role of values in impact assessments. The project
draws on literature in policy analysis, political science, economics,
philosophy, and bioethics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting the goals indicated
above could contribute to the growing effort to develop strategies that ensure
the governance of emerging technologies aligns appropriately with public values.
The project will lead to a report that examines the role of values in formal
impact assessment mechanisms, an additional report on how impact assessment
mechanisms square with the recommendation by the Presidential Commission for the
Study of Bioethical Issues for "prudent vigilance" in policy on synthetic
biology and other emerging biotechnologies, and scholarly papers reassessing the
debate about proactionary (promoting freedom to innovate) versus precautionary
(constraining innovation until there is sound evidence that no harm will result)
approaches to policy-making. The work will also be disseminated through
publications intended for a general audiences, interactions with journalists,
public presentations, and on the web.
