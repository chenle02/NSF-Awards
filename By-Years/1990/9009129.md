High TC superconducting devices are of considerable interest to both research
and development community. My interest is in applying high TC superconducting
for device applications. This proposal outlines the development of
superconducting switch for microelectronic applications. At least four
technological aspects of high TC devices will be investigated in developing a
switch. The areas to be used studied include contacts to superconducting thin
films, patterning and fabrication of weak links. The devices will be fabricated
and evaluated in the Microelectronics Research Laboratories of University of
Colorado at Colorado Springs. The proposed device has significant potential in
implementing high speed digital logic gates, non-linear switch for noise
descrimination in digital circuits, limiters, mixers, magnetically and optically
controlled switches.
