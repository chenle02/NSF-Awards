ABSTRACT This award, for $99,524, is to provide for support for the 1993 Design
Education Conference of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, as well as
the follow-on efforts in support of this conference that will: bring about
urgently needed changes in curriculum reform (specifically its design
component); provide incentives to effect these changes; document and disseminate
the experiences of those who have made exemplary curricular innovations in
design; and to identify unanswered questions calling for research and an in-
depth study of design in the curriculum.
