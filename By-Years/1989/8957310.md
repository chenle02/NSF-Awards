This project investigates several aspects of the problem of parallel
programming. The work will be performed in three stages. The first (and main)
stage involves basic research on fundamental issues of the problem including
models of parallel computation user and compiler- assisted parallelism
specification, task formation and synchronization, program partitioning and
interprocessor communication and scheduling of parallel programs on vector-
parallel architectures. During this phase the emphasis will be on the design and
analysis of general policies and specific algorithms and heuristics. The second
phase involves extensive simulations using real benchmarks. The last phase
involves development of a comprehensive parallelizing multilingual compiler for
C and Fortran which will incorporate the results of the previous two phases.
