Professor Dagdigian is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the chemical reactions between fragments of molecules
in crossed molecular beams by analysing the light emitted by the products upon
laser excitation. The motivation for these studies is to answer the question:
What is the effect of having many possible potential energy surfaces on which
these reactions occur on the distribution of product molecules and on the energy
states in which they are produced? In this project the dynamics of reactions
involving molecular free radicals will be experimentally investigated through
the determination of product internal state distributions using the laser
fluorescence detection technique. Because of the unpaired electrons on both
reagents, these reactions necessarily involve multiple potential energy
surfaces. The influence of the different surfaces should be manifest in the
branching between different product channels. The reactions of oxygen atoms with
vibrationally excited reagents, which will be prepared by stimulated Raman
excitation, will be probed through measurement of the hydroxyl product internal
distribution.
