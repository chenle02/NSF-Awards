This conference is intended to jump-start a new field: Comparative Decision
Making Studies (CDMS). CDMS will focus on the many ways that social, economic
and computational decision making studies can leverage methods and results
across disciplinary boundaries, especially the ways computational thinking can
change the types of questions considered by social and economic
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will accomplish three goals, by
facilitating a discussion among scholars from various academic backgrounds and
individuals applying decision-making in society. First, we will encourage
transplanting techniques and insights across research programs and traditions,
highlighting the similarities and differences among established approaches.
Second, we will identify the most important current issues in decision making
research and discuss how collaboration across disciplines and between academia
and the consulting industry can facilitate the emergence of important new
theories, empirical methods, and applications. Finally, we will justify and
promote the CDM approach in the scientific community and consulting industry.
