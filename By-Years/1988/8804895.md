This is an REU site program for ten women and minority undergraduate students
from the home institution and others in the state of Texas. This program builds
upon an REU program of last year and on an ongoing university based
undergraduate summer program. In this REU program 100 faculty who are engaged in
over 300 research projects will be made available to the selected
undergraduates. This large and apparantly overpowering structure can succeed by
virtue of a very effective management plan. The faculty serves as advisors to
the students and the facilities and resources of the departments are made
available to them.
