Little systems software for distributed memory multicomputers is portable to
other multicomputers; as a result, users must pay as much attention to the
attributes of the hardware they use as to their research. Also, researchers
working on different multicomputer hardware can rarely share applications
software. In this setting, NSF can take an active role in catalyzing the
evolution of multicomputer systems software. During a year starting September 1,
1991, the Ohio Supercomputer Center will port a portable operating system
foundation, named Trollius, to multicomputers based on fast, leading
microprocessors, such as the Intel i860 and Transputer. Multicomputers made by
several vendors will thus run compatible systems software. Trollius is a non-
proprietary, "open" operating system for distributed memory parallel computers.
Small groups conducting scientific research are frequently the end users who
will benefit from having Trollius on their computer systems. Research areas
pursued at current Trollius sites include computer algorithms development,
parallel processing research, and computational mechanics. The project will
increase the useful lifetime of software developed by research projects and will
expand the use and usability of multicomputers in the U.S.
