This project would assist the Vassar College psychology department in
modernizing and expanding its laboratory facilities in human perception and
cognition. There is a strong need for this enhancement due to curricular
expansion and student interest in this growing subarea of psychology,
particularly given recent changes in major requirements. Students in psychology,
biopsychology, and cognitive science will benefit from the use of computerized
stimulus presentation and data collection, graphics, voice synthesis, eye
movement tracking, and data loggers through intermediate and laboratory courses
in perception and cognition and student independent work in these areas.
Available facilities and expertise will allow for optimal use of this equipment
to illustrate central methodological techniques in the current study of human
perception and cognition through exercises and demonstrations as well as more
independent student research. The scientific education of a significant number
of undergraduates, particularly women, will be enhanced in the context of a high
quality liberal arts institution which has the resources and commitment to
support this initiative.
