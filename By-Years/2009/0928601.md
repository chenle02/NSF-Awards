This conference will bring together pre-eminent scientists in the field of
abrupt climate change, along with post-doctoral researchers and graduate
students, to discuss paleo-proxy records and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate
models. Participants will discuss recent advances in the understanding of the
mechanisms of abrupt climate change, focusing particularly on the role of
freshwater forcing on the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), sea-ice
feedbacks, and tropical forcing.
