Professor Gina Hoatson of William and Mary College has a grant from the Solid-
State Chemistry and Analytical and Surface Chemistry Programs to support student
participation in the NMR Symposium of the Rocky Mountain Conference on
Analytical Chemistry. This four day meeting is recognized internationally as top
solid state NMR meeting in the US. This meeting will focus on the application of
NMR to key problems in materials science including nanoparticles and interfaces.
Currently 20% of the speakers are women and 13% are minority. Historically, the
conference is well attended by students. This support is targeted at partially
funding students and postdocs to enable them to attend the meeting. The meeting
will occur from July 29-August 3, 2001.
