This project is concerned with theoretical and computational research in
numerical methods for solving the nonlinear partial differential equations of
semiconductor device modeling. The device model equations are mathematically
similar to those appearing in flow of miscible fluid in a porous medium.
Procedures making use of characteristics have been successfully employed in
porous media flows and may be similarly utilized here so that efficient
simulation techniques may eventually make interactive CAD of semiconductor
devices a reality.
