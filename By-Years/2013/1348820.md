EHR Core Research&lt;br/&gt;Workforce Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is conducting a workforce development
capacity building project that is designed to advance the strategic integration
of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) into graduate and professional STEM
programs in 21st century research universities by setting the stage for robust
research studies. The PI proposes to conduct a workshop to explore pedagogical
issues such as the effectiveness of flipped classrooms merged with MOOCs through
a rigorous experimental design, data collection, and analysis process. The
workshop will provide a platform for thought leaders and key stakeholders,
including employers, to discuss paths for incorporating these emerging
educational portals and platforms into the existing fabric of universities. They
will discuss the findings of the workshop and identify research questions about
technology, pedagogy, widespread implementation, and specific implications for
graduate education.
