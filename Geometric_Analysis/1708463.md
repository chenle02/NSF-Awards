Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry that has applications in many
areas in sciences and engineering. The geometry of the hyperbolic plane that is
one of the counterexamples found in the nineteenth century to the classic
Parallel Postulate inspires a similar construction performed over the complex
numbers rather than the real numbers. Discrete groups of rigid motions are
harder to understand and to exhibit in the complex hyperbolic setting than in
the more familiar real hyperbolic environment, and these projects aim to greatly
expand the collection of known symmetry groups of this type.

The study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups has some major general results or
families of examples that remain without counterparts for lattices in the
isometry group of complex hyperbolic n-space, especially results on
(non)arithmetic subgroups. These projects will study lattices generated by
reflections in PU(n, 1) for n at least 2, geometric aspects of arithmetic
lattices, and deformations of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups into PU(3, 1). Goals
include the production of infinitely many distinct commensurability classes of
nonarithmetic lattices in PU(2, 1) and to obtain other infinite families of
lattices generated by reflections, such as the Picard modular groups.
