Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is building on
earlier work on the use of video game technology and effective learning-teaching
principles to enhance learning in electrical and computer engineering (ECE)
courses. One goal of the present project is to expand the video game prototype
to include multiple levels, additional course content, a more developed
storyline, an information resource on key concepts addressed in the game,
explanatory feedback for problems, and worked examples of problems. Other goals
include integrating the video game with the instructional techniques into three
courses and assessing the impact of the video game on student learning and
attitude toward digital systems and electrical engineering, with attention to
differences in impact by gender and ethnicity. The project brings together
investigators from electrical and computer engineering, educational psychology,
and visualization science. Project results and video game development
experiences are being disseminated in engineering education and video game
conferences and journal. Assessment and evaluation, under the direction of an
evaluation specialist, is using systematic observation, interviews, analysis of
student products, and a student attitude survey to monitor progress. Broader
impacts include dissemination of the results and materials, new data on gender
and ethnic differences in learning, and serving as a model for showing the
effective instructional uses of video games.
