Equipment is acquired to support research in nonlinear deterministic and
stochastic vibrations. The equipment comprises a medium thrust shaker with a
vibration control system and a multi-channel input/output Fast Fourier Transform
analyzer. It is used to verify experimentally the theory developed in a number
of projects.
