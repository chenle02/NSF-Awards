9452037 McCabe A programming laboratory for Computer Networks is proposed.
Standard Computer Networks texts and curricula have emphasized general concepts
ranging from the physical layer to the application layer, but most undergraduate
Computer Networks courses fail to provide experiences of network management and
program development in an actual network environment. A basic knowledge of
Computer Networks has become a necessary part of the undergraduate curriculum
for CS students. Exposure to network concepts is not enough. For most students,
network concepts remain abstract and difficult to understand if lecture material
is not followed by laboratory exercises that crystallize the concepts. Since
standard network systems are used as an environment for intensive network
programming assignments, the resulting laboratory manuals are portable to other
universities.
