Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;This three-year Advanced Technology Education
Support project (ATESP) builds on successes of an ongoing information technology
initiative at Mississippi Gulf Coast &lt;br/&gt;Community College (MGCCC)
designed to increase the supply and diversity of the IT workforce. Partially
funded by NSF, the initiative has resulted in an increase in the number of
females and minorities enrolling in IT programs. A recruitment model, The IT
Pathway, was cited by a NSF National Visiting Committee as a model for other
community college technical programs. The overall purpose of this ATESP project
is to build capacity to increase access to IT programs, increase student
retention to program completion and certification and enhance the IT awareness
and skills of post secondary and secondary IT faculty/teachers. Specifically:
&lt;br/&gt;1. Retention of IT majors to program completion with the development
of an IT Access, Retention and Student Success Model, with an emphasis on
females. &lt;br/&gt;2. Increasing access to IT programs. &lt;br/&gt;3.
Validating student success and program quality; and, &lt;br/&gt;4. Professional
development for IT post secondary faculty and secondary teachers. &lt;br/&gt;
