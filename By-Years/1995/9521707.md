9521707 Mandeville This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency
of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Charles Mandeville of the School of
Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. Dr. Mandeville will work with
Dr. Jeffrey Hedenquist at the Geological survey of Japan in Tsukuba. The
investigators seek to improve upon the petrologic methods that are now used to
estimate the amounts of gases released to the atmosphere during large explosive
volcanic eruptions, amounts that may temporarily alter climate. The proposed
research aims to study a suite of Krakatau silicate melt inclusions for evidence
of heterogeneous trapping of immiscible liquid/vapor phases prior to the
catastrophic eruption. Results from this study will be used towards extension of
the present method of estimating volatile discharge to at least qualitatively
evaluate the presence or absence of an exsolved vapor phase in the upper portion
of zoned magma bodies. Results from this study will potentially lead to a better
understanding of how gas sampling of degassing volcanoes relates to magma bodies
at depth. ***
