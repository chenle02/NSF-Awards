The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA requests NSF support
for a 5000 sf traveling exhibit on The Human Brain that is being developed for
the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC). This exhibit offers an
integrated understanding of how physiological structures in the brain relate to
vital life functions and human behaviors. Senior members of the exhibit
development team include distinguished neuroscientists who are locally available
and committed to The Franklin Institute project; the team is also advised by a
large panel of nationally recognized experts in brain research. Like all SMEC
exhibits, The Brain will be seen by over two million Americans during a 32-month
tour to eight major cities across the United States. During the 1990's -- "The
Decade of the Brain" -- the proposed exhibit project is important and timely in
its ability to inform the public about new ideas and discoveries in the many
sciences of brain research.
