Telomeres are specialized protein-DNA complexes that protect the ends of
eukaryotic chromosomes. In most eukaryotes, telomeres contain short DNA repeats
that are maintained by the telomerase reverse transcriptase. Since telomerase
counteracts the terminal sequence loss that accompanies replication of linear
DNA, the enzyme is required for long term cellular proliferation. The field of
telomere biology has grown rapidly since it was recognized that telomere
dynamics and telomerase activation play a pivotal role in human cancer and in
cellular senescence. As a result, the telomere field is now a highly diverse and
dynamic area, representing a wide variety of research interests (cancer, aging,
cell cycle, meiosis, recombination, replication, etc.) and a large number of
different model organisms (mammals, fungi, protozoa, plants). The previous two
(1999 and 2001) Cold Spring Harbor laboratory meetings on telomeres and
telomerase, were crucial in bringing together this diverse group of researchers
and resulted in vigorous discussion and synergistic interactions stimulated by
the presentation of a very large body of unpublished data. Since the CSH
telomere and telomerase meeting represents the only opportunity for scientists
in this rapidly growing field to interact as a whole, this meeting is of the
utmost importance for the future of the field. Furthermore, the format of CSH
meetings, where all talks are chosen from submitted abstracts, maximizes the
opportunity for new researchers and young investigators to present their most
recent unpublished work. The prior two meetings had a uniformly high attendance
rate from an international group of researchers. The platform presentations and
posters at the past meeting presented the major discoveries in the field long
before publication. It is anticipated that the 2003 meeting will be equally well
attended
