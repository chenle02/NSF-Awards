It is proposed to study a novel crystal pulling process and its application to
the manufacturing of a novel optical material and an advanced electronic
material. Czochralski crystal pulling have been the most widely used process for
producing bulk single crystals of optical and electronic materials. The proposed
process can potentially improve upon the Czochralski process in that it is self-
stabilizing and operates essentially in steady state, producing single crystals
of more uniform diameter and dopant concentration. The proposed work will
include computer simulations of fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and the
growth of single crystals of a non-linear optical organic materials and an
advanced electronic material, InP.
