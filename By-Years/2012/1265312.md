This will support student and young researcher travel to the AGU Chapman
Conference on Fundamental Properties of Magnetotails. Chapman Conferences are
topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union. The meeting will
be held in Reykjavik, Iceland March 10-15, 2013. The sessions will last 5 days.
Three main questions will be considered: (1) How to magnetotails form? (2) Once
energy and mass enter the magnetotail what modes operate? (3) How do
magnetotails affect the inner magnetospheres and ionospheres? The meeting will
consider the terrestrial and planetary (Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune) magnetotails.
