This project will upgrade and expand the undergraduate curricula in biological
and earth sciences through the acquisition of an energy dispersive X-ray
scanning electron microscope. The microscope will be used for class laboratory
exercises in intermediate and advanced level environmental science (biology and
earth sciences) and "laboratory" biological science programs, and also for
independent undergraduate research projects in these fields. Through use of the
instruments, students will be able to observe examples of phenomena and
principles discussed in texts, will learn widely used modern instrumental
techniques, and will be enabled to pursue independent research using these
techniques.
