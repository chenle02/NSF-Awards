1126182&lt;br/&gt;Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motion, metabolic, and force
analysis system requested would benefit research, research training, and
education in the Biomechanics Lab and Rocky Mountain Cancer Rehabilitation
Institute (RMCRI) at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC). Understanding
mechanisms associated with the structural characteristics of the prosthesis, the
higher energetic costs of amputee locomotion, and common walking asymmetries in
lower extremity amputees could impact prosthetic design and rehabilitation
programs. Two new research projects involving lower extremity amputees would
benefit from the acquisition of the requested equipment. One project would
investigate the effect of increasing prosthesis mass on the mechanics and
energetics of amputee locomotion. The second would focus on improving models of
the prosthetic ankle by creating a method for identifying the instant center of
rotation of prosthetic ankles. Current research in the Biomechanics Lab has been
limited to 2-D analyses, but with acquisition of the requested equipment, the
proposed research would expand to 3-D analyses.
