The goal of this REU Program is to excite some of the best engineering students
in the nation to consider the challenges of graduate study and a career in
research. Components of the program include identification of exceptional
students through a nationwide recruitment program with emphasis on women and
minority participation, matching students interest with faculty and graduate
students to an appreciation of graduate study, and provide mini-courses to
facilitate effectiveness in the research projects. The research activities span
civil engineering in the areas of water resources, bioengineering and pollution
control, and structural mechanics. Research projects include: (1) finite element
modeling of tidal flow, (2) sequencing batch real reactors to treat municipal
and industrial waste, (3) precipitation immobilization of hazardous wastes, (4)
laboratory and field techniques for groundwater studies, (5) Monte Carlo
simulation of structures, and (6) correlation structure of fatigue crack growth.
