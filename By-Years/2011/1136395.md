Through a Phase 1 Noyce Teacher Scholarship Track, Long Island University
Brooklyn (LIU-B) plays a key role in improving the quality and retention of
science teachers in NYC schools that serve large numbers of poor and minority
students. LIU-B School of Education (SOE) is well positioned to assist NYC
schools in improving science teaching and learning, and it does so through the
Scholarship and Excellence in Secondary Science Education (SESSE) program that
recruits high-performing underrepresented science majors and prepares them to
become high quality science teachers who persist in their teaching careers. A
number of faculty from several STEM disciplines participate in the project. The
SESSE program targets upper level undergraduate biology and biochemistry majors
to become certified to teach in New York City middle and high schools. SESSE
provides scholarships and supporting stipends to sixteen minority science
students in two Cohorts of 8 each in years 1 and 2 of the project.
