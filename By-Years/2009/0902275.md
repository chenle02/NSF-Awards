This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation for the &lt;br/&gt;R/V Blue Heron, an 86 foot
Coastal vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large
Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request includes one item/system:&lt;br/&gt;
1) Mooring releases, a spare deck box to trigger the releases and additional
floatation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance
and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from
any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers. The addition of a shared use mooring release system will
enhance the ability of R/V Blue Heron to complete mooring experiments in the
Great Lakes. This is the only UNOLS ship that operates in these waters.
