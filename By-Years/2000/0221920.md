A program of upper atmosphere dynamics studies is proposed that involves work at
the University of Pittsburgh, at the equatorial Airglow Observatory in
Arequipoa, Peru, and at the midlatitude Millstone Hill Observatory in
Massachusetts. Determinations of Doppler shifts and widths of nightglow emission
lines will be made by upgraded Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) instruments to
yield velocities and temperatures. The FPIs are of both conventional and all-sky
designs that make use of CCD detectors to provide greatly improved sensitivity.
Accurate determinations of the Doppler shifts will be provided by zero velocity
reference sources, either using the PIs newly developed oxygen afterglow
reference source (OARS) that emits the forbidden OI 630.0 and 557.7 nm lines or
by more portable Secondary Standard sources that will be interferometrically
calibrated against the OARS standard. The improved precision will permit
accurate determinations of the (small) vertical velocities, supplementing the
usual horizontal velocity determinations to provide a 3-dimensional
characterization of the thermospheric flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the
equatorial measurements in Peru, the new, multi-wavelength capability of the FPI
will broaden the ongoing 630 nm studies of upper thermosphere dynamics to
include mesopause wind and temperature determinations via OH (731.6 nm)
nightglow line studies. The all-sky FPI at Millstone Hill will be used to
examine coupling effects between the midlatitude lower and upper thermosphere by
sequential determinations of their wind and temperature fields using the 557.7
nm and 630.0 nm airglow emissions. At both latitudes, the neutral dynamics
results can be compared to the ionospheric dynamics measurements obtained by
either the Jicamarca or the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar.
