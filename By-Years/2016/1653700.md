This award will provide support for the 2017 RNA Editing Gordon Research Seminar
(GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) entitled "RNA Editing: Biology and
Mechanisms of RNA and DNA Modification" to be held at Ventura, California on
March 11-17, 2017. The GRS is a dedicated forum for student and postdoctoral
trainees to present and discuss research with peers before participating in the
GRC. The major goal of the RNA Editing GRS/C is exposing trainees to cutting-
edge science and providing multiple platforms for discussing research results
and emerging ideas with leaders in the field. By learning about the latest
advances and cutting-edge technologies, participating trainees and scientists
will be inspired to utilize similar experimental approaches to gain new insights
into their own RNA and DNA modification systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RNA and
DNA modifications occur in all organisms and influence many biological processes
including metabolism, neurological function, and immunity. The 2017 meeting will
focus on new advances into the understanding of how RNA and DNA modifications
affect the biology of an organism and the molecular machines that are
responsible for generating the large repertoire of modifications found in any
given organism. Trainees will all present their research in either an oral or
poster format at the GRS. Selection of the trainees to deliver oral
presentations will be based on several criteria including scientific excellence,
individuals from under-represented areas such as women and minorities, new
comers to the field and topic diversity. Two trainees will be selected by their
peers to present at the GRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the
Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences.
