This research is an experimental investigation of the fundamental dynamics of
tsunamis (seismic sea waves) as they reach a shoreline, as well as the ensuing
run-up and drawdown processes. It is a continuation of the research initiation
award CES-8503436. The goal is to develop a better understanding of the
mechanisms of destructive tsunami effects in a coastal zone. A unique laser-
flow-visualization laboratory facility developed under the initiation award is
used for generating and studying tsunamis formed as bores in the nearshore
region. Observations of viscous and surface-tension effects provide insight into
scale effects associated with physical models. Impulse forces associated with
the tsunami transition from a bore to the run-up mode are being investigated
through direct force measurements, together with the laser-induced flow-
visualization technique. Combining these observations with available field
observations, the emphasis of the experimental research is to guide theoretical
efforts toward a more realistic modeling of the mechanics of destructive tsunami
action in coastal areas.
