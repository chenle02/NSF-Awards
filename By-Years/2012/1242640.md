The Assay and Acquisition of Radiopure Materials (AARM) is a collaborative
effort to improve the understanding of neutron backgrounds underground. This
work aids physics experiments that probe fundamental questions such as the
nature of neutrinos and the dark matter in the universe. AARM, which includes
experts in low-background techniques and simulations of neutron interactions
underground, as well as representatives from major dark matter and double beta
decay experiments and from the geology and microbiology communities, has worked
together over the last three years to better understand low radioactivity
environments and exploit common resources. By organizing around common goals
that would benefit from structured cooperation, AARM has succeeded in creating a
forum for sharing information and advancing research goals, including new
technologies for particle detection, simulation techniques, and material
screening. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will continue AARM's role as a
central unifying force in the international underground community with these
specific goals: &lt;br/&gt;1. Development of community-wide simulation tools,
&lt;br/&gt;2. Confirmation of simulation physics models and cross sections
relevant to underground science by comparing to data worldwide and supporting
specific efforts in neutron benchmarking, &lt;br/&gt;3. Establishment of a
global materials database, and &lt;br/&gt;4. Continuation of the successful
integration workshops centered around simulation, material screening, and
underground physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed work
will create cross collaboration infrastructure support for underground physics.
It directly provides training of scientists in radiation-detection technologies
and low-background techniques, which supplements the country's technical
intelligence base, both inside and outside physics, providing students with
multidisciplinary opportunities in astro, nuclear, and particle physics.
