This is an equipment proposal to provide a MicroVAX II computer system for use
by the VPISU Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics faculty and students involved
in NSF sponsored research. Essential features of the system include: fast
processing time for data replay, work station environment, large disc space,
laser printer, graphics capability, and appropriate software.
