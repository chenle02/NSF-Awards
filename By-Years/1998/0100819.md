The first part of the proposed work concerns Monge-Ampere equations, including
extensions of classical results of Jorgens, Calabi and Pogorelov which state
that entire solutions to such equations are quadratic polynomials. Dirichlet
problem for Monge-Ampere equations in exterior domains of Euclidean space will
also be investigated. Related problems concerning the affine Bernstein problem
will be studied. The second part of the proposed work concerns best Sobolev
inequality on Riemannian manifolds and the Yamabe problem on manifolds with
boundary.&lt;br/&gt;This includes efforts in establishing a new form of best
Sobolev inequalities on Riemannian manifolds as well as existence and
compactness results concerning the Yamabe problem on manifolds with boundary.
Sharp pointwise estimates to blow up solutions play important roles in such
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of mathematical analysis is not so much
to create the equations as it is to create qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
existence, uniqueness, smoothness, and growth.&lt;br/&gt; In addition, analysis
often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the
accuracy of these approximations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
