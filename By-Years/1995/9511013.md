9511013 D'Mello During the development of the vertebrate nervous system,
approximately half of the neurons generated die around the time of birth by a
process known as programmed cell death (PCD or apoptosis). Although leading to
the massive death of neuronal populations, this process is necessary for the
normal development of the nervous system. It is now well established that PCD is
not restricted to the nervous system, but occurs in virtually all tissue and
cell types and represents a fundamental biological process serving to eliminate
unwanted or superfluous cells. A question of significant importance is whether
the inappropriate activation of the apoptotic program underlies abnormal
neuronal loss. The objective of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms
controlling PCD in neurons. More specifically, genes that induce or suppress the
death process will be identified. A cell culture model system using neurons from
the vertebrate cerebellum has previously been established will be used to
identify genes that regulate neuronal death. In the long term, these
investigations will provide fundamental information concerning the processes
underlying neuronal death during development.
