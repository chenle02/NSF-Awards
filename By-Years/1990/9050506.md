The aim of this proposal is to improve the quality of the laboratory courses
involved in the Composites and Polymers Program at New Mexico State University.
This multi-disciplinary program involves the chemistry, mechanical engineering,
chemical engineering and engineering technology and is focused on the
manufacture, processing, testing and design of fiber-reinforced polymeric
composites. The improvement will be accomplished by incorporating modern
instrumentation and equipment for three laboratory courses: Polymers and
Composites Laboratory: Advanced Materials Technology Laboratory and the
Composites Team Project Laboratory. Curriculum and course content developments
are being accomplished with the aid of funding provided by industrial co-
sponsors. The laboratory courses are strongly correlated to current industrial
problems. A key feature of the program is an emphasis of the multi-disciplinary
nature of and team approach to composite materials manufactured. These
improvements will have a large impact on the students passing through the
program, and can provide a model for other multi-disciplinary polymer and
composite materials laboratory programs.
