To simultaneously handle syntactic and semantic ambiguity, we propose using the
shared-packed parse forest of Seo and Simmons (1989) in conjunction with the
logical form representation of a sentence developed by Harper (1990). If the
packed parse forest is used alone, informed decisions about semantic ambiguities
cannot be made while addressing syntactic ambiguities. If logical form alone is
used, all syntactic ambiguities must be resolved before providing the logical
form for the sentence. Logical form can be specified precisely given a parse
tree, but with a parser that provides one parse tree at a time, finding the
correct parse tree requires exponential time. The algorithm resulting from the
wedding of logical form to packed forests will produce a compact intermediate
representation for an ambiguous sentence in polynomial time. As syntactic and
semantic ambiguity are mutually constraining, maintaining both in the
intermediate representation should focilitate their inter- effectiveness. As
more information is processed this intermediate representation will be
incrementally updated until the parse forest is reduced to a single tree
containing one logical form. In addition, the modularity of this approach will
reduce the conceptual complexity of the natural language problem.
