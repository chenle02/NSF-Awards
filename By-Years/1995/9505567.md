9505567 Goldstein Body cells must maintain their volume constant in order to
function properly. Both humans and animal cells face constant threats to their
volumes under both physiological and pathological conditions. In this proposal,
Dr. Goldstein will be examining the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
permit cells to maintain constant volume in the face of osmotic disturbances in
the environment surrounding cells. The experimental model will be the red blood
cell of the skate. He has used this model successfully in the past to begin
elucidating the physiological processes in the cell membrane that are involved
in adjusting cell volume back to normal after extracellular disturbances. He
will continue with these studies as well as others that deal with the ways in
which cell volume changes are signaled to volume-adjustilg mechanisms operating
in the cell membrane. The studies will lead to a better understanding of the
physiological basis of the fundamethal phenomemon of cell volume regulation. ***
