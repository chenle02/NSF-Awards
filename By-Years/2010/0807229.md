This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Women are being especially targeted for support. Student scholars
are enrolled as computer engineering, electrical engineering, or computer
science majors. The scholarship program consists of academic and residential
programs designed to build community and to ultimately increase the retention of
students through to successful graduation. Scholars enroll in several courses
together to improve their sense of community and to provide a support structure
for successful course completion. A residential component serves to increase the
sense of community to an even greater extent.
