This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Emory University for the renovation
and repair of the Psychology Building which will as a result be able to house
that institution's research and research training activities in cognitive
psychology, developmental psychology, and psychobiology. This building was
constructed in 1951 and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant
of $700,000 and $857,595 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities and contribute to the
consolidation of the entire psychology faculty in one building for the first
time. This project will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of the quantity and
quality of research that can be carried out by upgrading the plumbing, heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and lighting; and by reconfiguring the
partitioning of space including the provision of rooms with acoustical
insulation and other features that make them suitable for modern research in
psychology. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing
an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the training of
quality undergraduate and graduate students by a distinguished, nationally
recognized faculty. Students trained in these laboratories will be able to
maintain high standards in the conduct of psychological research.
