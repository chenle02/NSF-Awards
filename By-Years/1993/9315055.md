9315055 McCaffrey This research is to continue seismological investigations of
Sumatra through analysis of data from a digital seismograph network that has
been operating around the Sumatra fault and Toba caldera in northern Sumatra
since October, 1990. The maximum depth and depth distribution of seismic failure
on the Sumatra fault, the relation of the earthquakes and their fault plane
solutions to geologic structures, the seismic velocity structure and attenuation
beneath the fault and Toba caldera, and the relationship of the subducted slab
and a possible tear within it to surface tectonics will be studied. The seismic
network operates within a GPS geodetic network operated by Rensselaer and
Scripps and provides the opportunity to study the spatial and temporal relations
between seismic activity and geodetically measured strain. The work is being
done in cooperation with the Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Agency
(Jakarta) who operate the seismographic networks in Indonesia. This research is
a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
