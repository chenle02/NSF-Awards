This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Chmelka's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry. The work will develop the methodology of multipolar
zero-field NMR through instrumental improvements. Sample shuttling times will be
reduced so as to make it possible to study systems with shorter spin-lattice
relaxation times. The range of accessible dipolar couplings will be extended to
50 kHz so that solid organic compounds may be studied. The new instrumentaion
will be applied to the study of molecular clusters in partially ordered systems.
%%% Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR, is an important method for
determining molecular structure. The NMR approach will be developed to study
solid systems of importance to understanding catalysis in zeolites. These are
systems of great commercial importance.
