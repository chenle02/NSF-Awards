Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving
Cornell University and Bogazici University is in the general area of fractional
supersymmetries. Project funding will allow Prof. Omer Oguz of Bogazici
University the opportunity to work for two months in the laboratory of Dr. S. H.
Henry Tye at Cornell University as well as enable Dr. P. C. Argyres of Cornell
to work in Prof. Omer's laboratory for two months. The collaborative research
will concentrate on the problems of gauging two-dimensional symmetries and
developing a geometrical picture of fractional supersymmetry transformations.
Providing a geometrical picture of these symmetries would aid present efforts
aimed at classifying two- dimensional critical systems. This project in
theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
