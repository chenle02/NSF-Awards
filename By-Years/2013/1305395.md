Literature reviews, whether systematic or ad hoc, are an integral part of the
research process. By enabling the execution of systematic literature reviews,
this infrastructure helps ensure that researchers identify a complete and
unbiased set of candidate papers when performing such a review. In addition,
this project lowers the barrier for performing SLRs allowing a larger portion of
the SE community to conduct SLRs. This work is especially helpful for PhD
students who much perform a literature review as part of their thesis work.
Because SLRs are often publishable as stand-alone articles, this infrastructure
will also help increase students? publication rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project conducts planning activities in preparation for the creation of an
infrastructure to support the SLR process. The community targeted by this
project comprises SE researchers who already conduct SLRs, as well as SE
researchers who will be more likely to conduct SLRs if the barriers to adoption
are removed. The primary objectives of this are to: evolve an understanding of
community needs and the proposed infrastructure; and create a detailed plan for
the development and deployment of the infrastructure
