This three-year, U.S.-France award in chemical oceanography research involves
Daniel J. Repeta at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and two research groups
in France. The main objective of their project is to define the geochemical
behavior of chlorophyll and pigment tracers in marine water and sediments. In
cooperation with Ruben Ocampo Torres at the University of Louis Pasteur in
Strasbourg, the U.S. investigator will analyze sedimentary organic matter using
chemolytic methods. In the second collaboration with Herve Claustre of the
marine chemistry group in Villefrance/Mer, the U.S. investigator will field
test, phycobilins, a pigment tracer for remote sensing of algal class
distribution These studies combine U.S. and French expertise in geochemistry,
chemical techniques and remote sensing techniques.
