Duke University will operate the R/V CAPE HATTERAS during 1990 as a general
oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The R/V POINT
SUR is a 135' general research vessel constructed in 1981 and owned by the
National Science Foundation. Duke operates the CAPE HATTERAS under a charter
agreement with NSF. The ship operates primarily off the U.S. east coast from
Maine to Florida. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science
Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic
research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support
from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require
equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship
must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew
members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same
manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the
operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic
research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions
around the country.
