Lin This project is investigating a novel parallel processing technique, shift
switching, in reconfigurable bus systems. The research has four parts. The first
part classifies and evaluates shift switches and their inclusion in efficient
VLSI architectures. The second part develops and analyzes some efficient
reconfigurable bus architectures with shift switches for such parallel
computations as prefix operations, sorting, list ranking, tree search, and
transitive closure. The third part investigates application-specific
architectures using shift switches for computer arithmetic, image processing,
and computer vision. The fourth part investigates the relation between PRAM
models and reconfigurable busses with shift switching.
