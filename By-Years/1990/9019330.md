This award is to complete development work on the techniques required for the
analysis of Os isotopes by sputter induced resonant ionization mass spectrometry
(SIRIMS) using Lamont's new V. G. Isolab 54 mass spectrometer, and to begin
scientific investigations using Re-Os. In conjunction with making the mass spec
operational, research goals will also be pursued. Most of the research effort
over the coming year will be directed toward characterizing Re-Os distributions
and systematics in samples acquired from various ancient terranes. In addition,
the PIs will begin to investigate Re-Os systematics in basalts and peridotite
nodules to gain a better understanding of the partitioning of Re and Os during
partial melting in the mantle.
