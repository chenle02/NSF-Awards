TERC will develop a comprehensive mathematics curriculum for grades K-6 based
on investigations in number, data, and space, and emphasizing depth and
understanding. The curriculum will stress mathematics as a pattern-finding
science, make the discipline more accessible to both students and teachers, and
build teachers' knowledge of how students learn mathematics. TERC will design,
evaluate, and disseminate ten curriculum modules for each grade level. Each
module will focus on a set of related and developmentally appropriate
investigations which introduce key mathematical content within a compelling
context. The teaching built into the print materials (through scenarios
depicting analytic work in classrooms), and into videotapes of effective
mathematics teaching in action. Evaluation of the project will include formative
research, as well as an examination of the impact of the curriculum on students
and teachers. Investigations will be disseminated through publications aimed
specifically at elementary school educators. The curriculum will be published by
Dale Seymour Publications, who has made a major financial commitment to the
project.
