This award provides funding for the conference "Frontiers in Mathematical
Physics", to be held at the Centre de Recherches Mathematique at the University
of Montreal from August 28 to September 1, 2016.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of spectral theory, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. A
number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are
members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to
attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive
to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of
different activities. More information will be made available at:
