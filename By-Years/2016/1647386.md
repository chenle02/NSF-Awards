This project addresses the processes that lead to the formation and growth of
secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere. These very small particles
are formed from the oxidation of gaseous biogenic hydrocarbons, emitted by
plants. The results of this research will provide guidance for parameterizing
SOA processes in atmospheric models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific
objectives of the project are to: (1) quantify incorporation of tracers with
different properties such as functional groups and vapor pressures into SOA
formed from various gas phase precursors under a range of experimental
conditions; (2) measure rates of desorption of various tracers from different
SOA for input into a proposed molecular model; (3) elucidate the nature of the
surface region of SOA particles using extractive electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry; and (4) measure the magnitude, time dependence and mechanism of
uptake coefficients for amines of different structures on solid diacids and SOA.
