In this project, scientists will carry out a hydrographic section across the
entire Pacific along approximately 10 deg N. CTD stations will be occupied every
75km (closer in boundary current regions), and underway current measurements
will be made using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. Space will be provided
for other scientists to carry out additional sampling for nutrients and tracers.
Data will be used to estimate the cross-equatorial flow between the South and
North Pacific Oceans, as well as to address the overall description of the North
Pacific water properties. This data set will be impor- tant for a variety of
studies of the North Pacific relevant to determining the ocean's role in
controlling climate.
