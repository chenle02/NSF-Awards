931879 Edwards Hawaii Institute of Geophysics (HIG) will develop an improved
long- range seafloor mapping system. During the 1991-92 period, HIG designed and
built two new mapping systems in collaboration with the U.S. Naval Oceanographic
Office (NAVOCEANO). The first one served as the prototype and test platform for
development of the second -- SEAMAP. This is a wide-swath, shallow-towed sonar
mapping system. Both systems are fully operational and each has carried out
extensive seafloor surveying for applied as well as basic research applications.
The systems provide a highly expandable, modular architecture for development
and extension of capability. Capability improvements will be made by building an
11 and 12 kHz shallow-towed sonar system that will have the basic hardware
functionality of the existing systems. Software improvements will also be made
to acquire and process sonar data. Because most of the improvements we are
proposing to accomplish are the by-products of software modifications, they can
also be incorporated into the existing systems that are used by the broad marine
geological community. This work is being partially supported by the U.S. Naval
Oceanographic Office.
