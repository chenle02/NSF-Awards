The Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station has supported
research and education in biological sciences since 1937. Since then more than
300 scientists have produced over 250 published papers, dissertations, and
theses based on work on the Preserve. From 1988 to 1995, 40 Ph.D. level
scientists and 32 graduate students and 275 teachers to practice hands-on
environmental education. The Preserve's laboratory building can no longer
accommodate the researchers and students utilizing its resources. The Huyck
Preserve's five year development plan calls for a three phased effort to upgrade
its facilities and this proposal represents Phase 1. The Preserve will construct
and addition to its laboratory building that will more than double office,
laboratory and teaching space. The addition will also include a library and
collection room. Additional funds will come from Huyck Preserve operating
budget, the Huyck Foundation, previous researchers. Also the Preserve will
finish the buildings' interior walls and doors. Finally a data manager will help
the Preserve develop GIS capability using the software and hardware also
purchased to match this request.
