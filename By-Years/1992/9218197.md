This project continues observations of an unexpectedly "strong" 1992 El Nino
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on corals and coral reef ecosystems of the
eastern Pacific Ocean. Dr. Glynn is presently completing a 10 year monitoring
program on the recovery processes of coral reef ecosystems from previous ENSO
events, which were classified as "very strong" and "weak". It now appears as
this project is approaching completion, that a "strong" ENSO event is in full
swing and that the warming of surface waters is being felt by several coral reef
ecosystems in the eastern Pacific region. Based on biological samples (corals)
collected early this year from sites off Panama, Costa Rica and the Galapagos
Islands, it appears that corals are once again experiencing loss of pigments and
zooxanthellae, termed "coral bleaching". The project will obtain real-time
responses of coral reef organisms to a "strong" El Nino disturbance, which will
be useful for comparison with past "very strong" and "weak" warming events in
the eastern Pacific Ocean.
