This grant supports the operation of the Culture Collection of Algae at the
University of Texas at Austin. The UTEX culture collection center maintains over
2,000 strains of primarily freshwater algae, and is one of two such centers in
the world. The other one is in Germany. The UTEX Center distributes algae in its
collection to anyone who requests them at a nominal cost, publishes a catalogue
of its holdings, and serves as a general resource center by providing answers to
questions about the biology of freshwater algae. Requests for algae come from
the U.S. as well as foreign scientists working in diverse areas of biology.
Science teachers at colleges and secondary schools also request algae for
classroom uses.
