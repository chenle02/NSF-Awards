9414172 Hobbs This project is an airborne study of arctic stratus clouds with
the objective of obtaining several comprehensive sets of simultaneous
measurements of their microstructure and spectral radiative properties. Such
concurrent measurements are basic to the improvement of current models of
radiative properties of stratus clouds. These models in turn are a crucial
component of global circulation models which form an important basis for global
change studies. The development of optimized radiative forcing algorithms is the
objective of a major research effort. Additional objectives of this project are
to measure the spectral reflective properties of various arctic surfaces such as
tundra, open ocean, and melting and refreezing sea ice, and to test a new
approach for distinguishing water clouds from snow and ice surfaces. The
observations will be made from a Convair C-131A aircraft configured specifically
for airborne research. ***
