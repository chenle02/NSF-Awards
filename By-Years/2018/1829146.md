This is a project from Purdue University that extends its already existing
I-Corps Site for the next phase of expansion of their services that support
innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded
entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support
multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps
Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A renewed Purdue I-Corps Site award enables
Purdue to build on their accomplishments from their first three years and
maintain momentum while: funding 30+ faculty and student teams annually;
increasing the number of national I-Corps teams from the College of Engineering;
increasing support for and participation by women entrepreneurs; expanding
support for selective undergraduate senior design teams; and increasing
engagement with State of Indiana's economic development agencies as well as the
regional entrepreneurial ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
