This grant will continue the helioseismology program that is currently ongoing
at California Institute of Technology and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). In
the past several years many improvements have been made in methods for measuring
solar p-mode oscillations, to the point where the BBSO measurements of p-mode
frequencies, frequency splittings, linewidths, and amplitudes are among the best
anywhere. These measurements have been used to better understand the excitation
and dampening of the p-modes, to measure the solar rotation as a function of
depth and latitude, and to infer other properties of the solar interior. This
work will continue with the following scientific goals in mind: 1) to improve
the measurement of the sun's internal rotation, from the deep core right up to
the surface; 2) to continue monitoring the observed solar cycle variations in
the p-mode frequency splittings, which are thought to arise from large-scale
time-dependent temperature variations inside the sun; 3) to improve our
understanding of the p-mode excitation and damping processes; and 4) to
investigate the properties of the solar atmosphere using oscillations. The
overall aim of this work is to use sophisticated helioseismology techniques to
discern the internal dynamics of the sun. This in turn tells us about the 11
year variation. Clearly, this is important to solar terrestrial relations.
