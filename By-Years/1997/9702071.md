The goal of this research project is to explore the combination of statistical
modeling with heuristic search techniques to solve hard computational problems
in two areas : construction of a physical map of the human DNA and automatic
learning in computer chess. The approach consists of formulating statistical
models that are trained on data to automatically adjust broad parameters that
define the knowledge encoded in the program. This is combined with traditional
AI heuristic search techniques when exhaustive search of the parameter or
problem space is not possible. The results of this research will allow programs
to exhibit a rudimentary form of learning in areas like chess games, as well as
allow a physical map of the entire human DNA to be constructed in record time of
about six months which will allow geneticists to find the cause of any genetic
disorder and in turn increases the chance of finding cures for these genetic
disorders.
