This award to Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is for
the acquisition of a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) with
Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) capability. This instrument will
support nanotechnology research and training at the Integrated Nanosystems
Development Institute (INDI) of IUPUI, while stimulating collaborations across
campus and with regional industrial partners. The enhanced nanometer scale
imaging resolution and elemental analysis capabilities will significantly
enhance a large number of ongoing projects, including: (1) Energy: Battery, fuel
cells, solar cells, and energy storage; (2) Investigation of fundamental forces
at the submicron scale; (3) Sensors and materials development for environmental
and biomedical applications; and, (4) Molecular and cellular roles in biological
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FESEM will provide undergraduate students,
graduate students, and post-docs with valuable hands-on experience in operating
state-of-the-art instrumentation, an essential skill for students interested in
future graduate studies and careers in STEM fields. Moreover, the instrument's
impact on women and minorities will be substantial, as 50% of IUPUI graduates
are women and 16% are from underrepresented groups. In addition, faculty
researchers within INDI actively recruit undergraduates from historically black
colleges and universities to participate in summer research opportunities.
Planned educational efforts include teaching FESEM theory and practice in three
nanotechnology-based courses and an electron microscopy course, which attracts
both undergraduate and graduate students from multiple disciplines. The
instrument will also be used to strengthen planned community outreach
activities, including existing nanotechnology discovery summer camps for K-12
students and teachers, where this instrument will allow the exploration of
nanoscale materials and structures, and better understanding of nanotechnology
concepts.
