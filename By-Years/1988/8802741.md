Language-based environments have been one of the foremost topics of programming
environment research for many years, but little has been done to make them
practical for groups of professional programmers working together on large
software systems. Instead, language-based environments have been oriented
primarily to the development of relatively small programs by individual
programmers working alone. The goal of this research is to complete the
development of a new system, MERCURY, that changes this situation. MERCURY
generates language-based environments from attribute grammars. A generated
environment can be used simultaneously by multiple programmers working on the
same machine or on different machines distributed across a network. MERCURY uses
a distributed attribute evaluation algorithm to provide immediate propagation of
changes from one module to another, immediately informing programmers of errors
in their modules caused by changes made by other programmers to other modules.
Additional algorithms support high availability and reliability, so the
programmers can continue working even when part of the network is broken or some
machines are down, trusting that MERCURY will reestablish consistency as soon as
the network or machine is restored. The work proposed involves developing new
algorithms to support: distribution of arbitrary program units selected during
operation; efficient propagation of aggregate attributes; and multiple versions
and configuration of modules.
