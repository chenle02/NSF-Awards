This research project is concerned with the emission of light from metal-oxide-
metal tunnel junctions as a probe of the interaction between the tunneling
current and the surface plasmon-polaritons of the tunnel junction structure. The
light emission is mediated by the morphology of the structure. The objective is
to provide direct confirmation that the dominant mode for the emission of light
is the slow mode, which has large fields in the oxide layer. Junctions will be
grown on gratings with periods between 70 and 100 nanometers in order to provide
the momentum mismatch between the slow mode and the emitted light.
