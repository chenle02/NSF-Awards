The purpose of this project is to construct a unified formal model for the study
of heterogeneous distributed systems. The approach will be to conduct a
systematic study of methods for structuring distributed algorithms and their
correctness proofs. Each of these methods will be carefully integrated into a
single formal model so that it may be used in combination with the other methods
in novel ways to describe complex systems. The result will be a unified model,
based on the I/O automaton model of Lynch and Tuttle, that will be capable of
describing a wide variety of distributed systems. As a test of this unified
model, the project will develop an experimental programming language and
simulator that will describe heterogeneous systems within the formal model and
simulate executions of those systems. //
