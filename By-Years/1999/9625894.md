The proposed project completes the implementation, already underway, of the ViC*
compiler and run-time system. The compiler translates the data-parallel language
C* with some data explicitly declared to be "out of core." Out-of-core data
reside on a parallel disk system. The compiler produces C for a distributed-
memory multiprocessor. It adds I/O and library calls to access data on disk, and
it also produces virtual processing loops to allow each physical processor to be
shared by multiple parallel-variable elements. A ViC* program will run
significantly faster than one run with traditional sequential virtual memory on
the individual nodes of a MIMD machine. Unlike demand paging, ViC* will take
advantage of aggregate data-parallel operations by optimizing away many I/O
calls. Moreover, the ViC* run-time library will execute optimal parallel-disk
algorithms that have appeared in the literature recently. There are two major
components to ViC*: a compiler and a run time library. Both are designed to
minimize the number of parallel disk accesses made by the executing program. The
runtime library will implement the entire C* library for both incore and out-of-
core parallel variables. It will run on any platform that supports PVM and any
of the following filesystem interfaces: Scotch, Galley, Scalable I/O Initiative
API, and UFS for multiple disks. ***
