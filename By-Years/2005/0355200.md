We propose a new research program in theoretical nuclear physics in the area of
nuclear structure and many body problems. We will address unsolved problems in
the study of the constituents of nuclei and their interactions, considering the
effects of correlations on matter, energy and momentum density distributions of
the constituents. We will study the fascinating phenomena of the single
particle, few-particle and collective motions and determine the static and
dynamic properties of nuclei at low excitation energy. We will employ the many
body theory of strongly interacting particles and develop the formalism and the
numerical techniques, using Green's functions, Wigner transform and kinetic
equations, for calculating properties of nuclei. We will investigate properties
of nuclei at and far from stability, in particular, the isotope and isotone
dependence of charge and matter density distributions of ground states, single
particle energies, excitation and decay of giant resonances, and the equation of
state of asymmetric nuclear matter. &lt;br/&gt;We will educate one Research
Associate and three (3) graduate students, whose Ph.D. dissertations will be a
major part of the research program. In the outreach activity we plan to educate
one undergraduate student. The students will be introduced to the forefront of
international research in nuclear physics and to modern scientific computation.
