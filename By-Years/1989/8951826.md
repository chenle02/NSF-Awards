Physiology laboratories using analog to digital boards and computers to obtain
and analyze data are being designed for hearing-impaired students by emphasizing
visual rather than written or verbal presentation of information. MacIntosh Plus
computers with their visually based operating system will facilitate teaching
hearing- impaired individuals. The laboratories will also have a major impact on
women, who are 85% of the college population. Familiarity with computerized data
acquisition and analysis is very important for students who aspire to become
biologists. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
