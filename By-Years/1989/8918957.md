This proposed investigation is concerned with the accurate determination and
environmental assessment of contemporary and prehistoric fluxes of mercury from
the atmosphere. The geographic focus of the research is Antarctica, and the
program is a collaborative effort between Professor William F. Fitzgerald, The
University of Connecticut, and Dr. Claude F. Boutron, Laboratoire de Glaciologie
et Geophysique de l'Environnement, Saint-Martin-D'Heres, France. An excellent
suite of Antarctic snow and ice collections have been obtained by Boutron and
colleagues. Using sample from these collections, which have been carefully
processed and stored, this research program is designed to achieve the following
objectives: 1. to accurately quantify Mercury concentrations in recent snows and
prehistoric ice and to determine the temporal variation of Mercury in the
Antarctic icesheet; 2. to evaluate the importance of atmospheric Mercury
deposition to these polar latitudes and to integrate the results within a
general framework for the cycling of Mercury at the earth's surface; 3. to
identify and quantify the influence of anthropogenic contributions on eolian
Mercury fluxes to the Antarctic continent.
