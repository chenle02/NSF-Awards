Participants at this workshop will explore opportunities for capturing and
exploiting the wealth of information that is increasingly becoming available
from highly instrumentation-focused, data-driven investigations of chemical
reactions. They will outline future possibilities for incorporating new tools in
academic and industrial research, as well as highlighting both existing and
potential funding models to drive pre-competitive collaboration. Ultimately this
approach may lead the way to new scientific insights, new ways of addressing
scientific questions and new tools with which to address them. The workshop
includes discussion of novel educational approaches for the training of future
generations of students and practitioners in the study and application of
organic reactions through multidisciplinary teams and approaches.

This proposed workshop will lay the foundation for new, multi-disciplinary,
systems-based research infrastructure that combines recent advances in reaction
monitoring and data analysis. Developing research tools to provide a deeper
understanding of reaction processes will ultimately provide a platform for
future innovations in organic synthesis, synthetic methodology, and catalysis,
and in how these are in turn applied in future industrial processes.
