This project uses tools and methods of statistical mechanics to introduce a
unified computational approach to analyze the performance of large-scale
multiprocessor systems. The aim is to derive a small amount of "macroscopic"
information about system (thermodynamic) averages, despite the vast complexity
of "microscopic" interactions (a "microscopic" theory dealing with interactions
of each processor with other system components is likely to overwhelm the user
with detail and fail to adequately understand the system behavior - this is
analogous of studying the trajectory of each molecule of a gas when we are
interested in steady-state averages). Therefore, it seems natural that the
complexity existing in multiprocessor systems is the sort of complexity that
ought to yield to some sort of treatment analogous to statistical mechanics. The
approach is to use a physical analogy between the execution of a parallel
algorithm on a multiprocessor system and a physical system to obtain fast
approximation methods for the performance analysis of concurrency. An approach
to analyze critical phenomena ("hot spots") in large multiprocessor systems is
suggested by analogy to critical phase transitions in physics. The results will
be compared with extensive measurements and simulations on a multiprocessor to
provide empirical evidence for the viability of the approach. Success in this
effort would mean the establishment of a general and unified approach for a
"macroscopic": description and analysis of multiprocessor performance.
