9361652 Feng A very large number of science and engineering courses taught in
colleges and universities today do not involve laboratories. Although good
instructors incorporate class demonstrations, hands on homework, and various
teaching aids, including computer simulations, the fact is that students in such
courses often accept key concepts and experimental results without discovery
them for themselves. The only partial solution to this problem has been
increasing use of class demonstrations and computer simulations. Protein
Solutions propose the development of a completely self contained polymer
materials laboratory which, although packaged like a textbook, will contain
within it all of the materials, equipment, and information needed to directly
discover and experience key concepts related to polymer materials. Protein
Solutions expect that such a Labless Lab Book will be widely adopted a a
supplement to the more conventional polymer science and engineering textbooks,
particularly in those courses which do not have a laboratory section or
component. Protein Solutions expect to eventually expand this approach to a wide
variety of science and engineering courses. It is appropriate to begin with
polymer materials, however, because polymeric materials are so readily available
for a wide variety of applications and because they exhibit a range of phenomena
which are very easy to observe, experience, and discover. ***
