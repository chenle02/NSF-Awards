This award will support Dr. Mark M. Green of the Polytechnic University,
Brooklyn, New York, to collaborate with Professor Koichi Hatada and Yoshio
Okamoto of the Department of Chemistry, Osaka University, for six months
beginning in September, 1989. They will work on the synthesis of copolymers of
specific composition and microstructure from isocyanates and from methacrylates
to test the idea that secondary conformational information can be transmitted
across a diblock boundary in the growth process. Controlled anionic
polymerization will be used for the copolymer synthesis, and chiral optical
techniques will be used to characterize the resulting structure. This
cooperative project will provide Dr. Pearse access to the anionic techniques
used to produce conformationally chiral and optically active molecules which
have been developed by the Japanese col- laborators. This research will also
complement that currently supported by the National Science Foundation's
Materials-Chemistry Initiative, and may have important implications in the
development of synthesis techniques for commercially important polymers.
