&lt;br/&gt;AST-0123471&lt;br/&gt;Murphy,
James&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS)
on Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US Air Force with its adaptive optics system
and the standard imaging focal plane will be used to study the visible and
infrared character of the atmospheres of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter. The Mars
observations monitor inter-annual variations of the Martian surface albino and
its relation to global dust storms. The observations of Jupiter and Saturn
monitor the location and properties of aerosols in their atmospheres. The unique
capabilities of this telescope system enable the recording of very high spatial
resolution images of the planets. These high resolutions approaching 20 milliarc
seconds are essential to observe motions of clouds across the surface disk of
the planet. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
