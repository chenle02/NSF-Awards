9520477 Wu Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements will be carried out to
identify and characterize atomic motion with an anomalously low activation
energy in quasicrystals. Such measurements will also be used to improve the
crystallinity of noninteracting semiconducting nanoparticles and to detect the
melting of such nanocrystals. The NMR technique will also be used to
characterize quantum confinement and interband optical excitation in
noninteracting semiconducting nanocrystals. %%% Quasicrystals are known for
possessing a new type of long range order that differs from that of perfectly
ordered structures like common salt. A new type of atom motion is predicted to
occur in quasicrystals -- but has not yet been observed. The current
measurements using magnetic resonance techniques will attempt to investigate
this phenomenon. In addition, ultrasmall particle called nanocrystals will be
investigate with special focus on the changes occurring in physical properties
due in part to the effect of the small size of the particles. One effect that
will be investigated is the change in the melting of such crystallites. ***
