A river in Taiwan, the Cho-Shui river, displays unique characteristics in being
highly variable in its characteristics both, with respect to time as well as
distance along its length. This research will utilize existing data, as well as
future data to be obtained cooperatively through the proposed research, in
modifying and generalizing an existing computer model for sediment transport and
changes in the river bed. The modification is to account for water entrainment
of sediment, whereas the existing model applies only to a degrading river with
deposition of sediment. In addition, the wide variation in sediment composition
along the river length will be included.
