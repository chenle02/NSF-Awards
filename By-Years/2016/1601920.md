One of the fundamental identities satisfied by number systems is the commutative
law ab=ba. More complex algebraic systems such as sets of functions or
symmetries can have much more intricate behavior, reflected by more complicated
algebraic identities. This research project addresses questions such as whether
the set of all such identities can be deduced from a finite subset. The results
are expected to have applications in algebra, number theory, and theoretical
computer science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a new
theory of infinite groups satisfying pro-unipotent or pro-p identities. The
theory should be parallel to the theory of algebras with polynomial identities
and provide a new approach to linear groups over commutative rings. Important
steps in implementation of this program will be (1) a proof that linear pro-p
and pro-unipotent groups satisfy nontrivial identities, (2) proofs that these
identities are finitely based, and (3) a structure theory that would establish
that under certain conditions groups with identities are linear.
