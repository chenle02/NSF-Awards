9315395 Lemmon This grant will purchase equipment for use in presenting a
program about the brain to elementary school children in the Cleveland area. A
group of university based brain scientists are developing this program. These
scientists are very interested in having the program adapt for use by scientists
in all parts of the country. It is clearly important to introduce young children
to the brain and how it functions from the standpoint of understanding the
nature of substance abuse and the significance of neurological injuries. This
could also have an impact on the infrastructure of neuroscience research by
encouraging young people to seek a career in science and developing a lay public
that appreciates science. *** . ? o = 8 ^& B !/ , D o& E Ã• $ B H% D J L N ' W =&
