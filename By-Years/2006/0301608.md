This research program will exploit progress that has been made in a variety of
mechanics disciplines in order to develop a model for soil liquefaction, a
phenomenon in which soils lose their solid-like response and develop fluid-like
behavior, with catastrophic consequences for structures built on or of such
soils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, it involves an extension of a
thermomechanical framework that has proven very successful in describing
numerous dissipative systems such as inelastic and viscoelastic bodies, and
which has been particularly suited to describe the transition from solid-like to
fluid-like behavior. The generalization of the framework to include a complex
phenomenon such as soil liquefaction, and the propagation of waves in geological
and fluid saturated media, will unify the modeling of such phenomena with other
dissipative processes that have been studied. Once the theory has been
developed, it will be applied to specific boundary value problems that have
relevance to earthquake hazard mitigation.
