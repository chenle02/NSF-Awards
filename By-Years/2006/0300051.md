The research goal of this award is to investigate a non-contact, acoustic
levitation technique for transporting relatively light and flat objects. The
objectives are to formulate a comprehensive analytical expression that predicts
acoustic levitation in terms of actuation frequency, vibration amplitude, object
size and mass and to design and build an industrial size, multiple-beam
prototype that will be used to test closed-loop control of object stop-go
motion, change of direction, and object carry-over between two beams which are
mechanically free of each other. Specific approaches to achieving the research
objectives will involve mathematical modeling of acoustic transport dynamics
that takes into account the physical parameters of actuators and object,
numerical analysis of air streaming patterns and the nature of shear forces that
propel objects into motion, and empirical testing of the performance and
controllability of the transport process using an industrial size prototype.

If successful, the results of this research will enable an intelligent transfer
of compact disks, silicon wafers, and other high surface-quality products in a
non-contact, dust-free, and noise-free environment. A broader impact can also be
found in other technology areas such as nanoscale part transport, drug delivery,
and ground transportation.
