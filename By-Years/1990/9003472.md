This project focuses upon lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake. Existing knowledge about the effective communication of
public disaster warnings largely rests on a data base of pre-impact warnings. A
gap exists regarding knowledge about the determinants and process whereby the
public hears, perceives and responds to warnings during the post-impact disaster
emergency period. This research is a study of public perception and response to
aftershock warnings following the Loma Prieta Earthquake. Mail questionnaires
will collect relevant data on 800 households representing San Francisco (a media
rich environment) and Santa Cruz (a media sparse environment) households. The
process and determinants of that process whereby the public hears, perceives and
responds to warnings during the immediate aftermath of a disaster will be
determined. Quick-response field research after this quake suggest that there is
much to be learned. This quake provides an opportunity to conduct a systematic
study on this topic for perhaps the first time.
