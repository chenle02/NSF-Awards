This grant will host a two day workshop to investigate the current education
programs and mission of Field Stations and Marine Laboratories and to develop
recommendations on how this mission can be expanded. It is hoped that concerns
on methods of increasing field biology in the undergraduate curriculum,
increasing participation by underrepresented groups, collaborations with
traditionally minority institutions, community colleges, and museums, and
enhancing programs at field stations to cover all areas of biology will be
addressed by the participants. Prior to the workshop, a survey will be conducted
to assess the range and diversity of educational programs at field stations and
marine labs. The outcome will be an oral presentation and paper and electronic
brochures of the findings and discussions.
