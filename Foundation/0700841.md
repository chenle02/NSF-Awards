In the project, Solecki will explore several problems whose solutions will
involve interactions of a number of areas of mathematics: logic (descriptive set
theory and elements of model theory), topological dynamics, and combinatorics.
For example, Solecki intends to study questions concerning dynamical properties
of the homeomorphism group of the pseudo-arc. By a recent work of Irwin and
Solecki, these dynamical questions can be approached using projective
Fra\"iss\'e limits, which are dual versions of the classical construction of
Fra\"iss\'e limits from model theory. Now, the corresponding questions about
projective Fra\"iss\'e limits can be translated to purely combinatorial problems
concerning finite objects. To solve these problems Solecki will attempt to
develop new combinatorial techniques with the guidance of analogies with the
Ramsey theory for finite structures, a classical branch of combinatorics.

This research will not only involve applying results from one part of
mathematics to another. The expectation is that the interactions will be
mutually beneficial: the topological dynamics question suggests a new model
theoretic construction, which in turn leads to an interesting combinatorial
problem, whose solution yields, on the one hand, a new combinatorial theorem
and, on the other hand, an answer to the original dynamical question. In a
similar manner, other parts of the project feature interactions of descriptive
set theory, model theory, topological dynamics, and combinatorics in the study
of extreme amenability, Borel equivalence relations, and algebraic properties of
isometry groups. It may be hoped that crossing boundaries of subfields of
mathematics will lead to new and substantial insights.
