Shared Consciousness and Collective Action

This dissertation investigates the origins and influence of Africans' collective
consciousness (or shared identity and way of thinking) in the years prior to the
1791-1804 Haitian Revolution, the most successful slave uprising of the modern
era. This research proposes to examine the relationship between collective
consciousness and important forms of resistance between the years 1750 and 1791.
The project addresses the following questions. What was the role of Africa-
inspired rituals in shaping collective consciousness? How did this collective
consciousness influence patterns of escape from enslavement? How and why did
patterns of escape from enslavement change over time and space in the few
decades before the Haitian Revolution?

Preliminary results suggest the following hypotheses. First, Africa-inspired
ritual events were gathering spaces for rebels to raise oppositional
consciousness, campaign for freedom, and mobilize recruits. Second, runaways'
social ties, knowledge of specific destinations, self-assertive behaviors, and
longer durations of escape seem to be reasonable indicators of an oppositional
consciousness. Third, runaways strategically responded to structural and
environmental windows of opportunity (such as natural disasters, changes in
colonial law, and geographic proximity to isolated zones). To test these
hypotheses, the Co-PI will perform (a) qualitative and quantitative content
analysis of over 11,000 digitally archived Haitian runaway slave advertisements;
(b) a systematic review of primary documents held in several key archives in the
Americas and Europe; (c) a systematic review of critical secondary sources
published during and since the period of study; and (c) qualitative field
research in present-day Haiti. The findings on antecedents to the Haitian
Revolution will improve our understanding of the role of shared consciousness,
social ties and networks, and human cultural expressions in collective action
processes.
