This project has four aspects: (1) new physical interpretations of mass transfer
rates between a turbulently flowing liquid and a solid wall and oxygen
absorption rates from turbulent air to a concurrently flowing liquid are
developed; (2) the dispersion of particles in turbulently flowing fluids is
studied to understand the influence of fluid turbulence on the rate of
deposition upon the pipe wall that contains the flow; (3) the annular regime
that exists for high velocity gas-liquid flows has a film that moves along the
wall plus droplets entrained in the turbulent concurrently flowing gas. Studies
of the rate of formation of drops by atomization of the wall film and the rate
of depositon of droplets on the wall film under actual annular flow conditions
are being conducted; and (4) measurements of the velocity field for turbulent
flow over a wave are being made to understand to predict the pressure and shear
forces on the wave.
