The eastern flank of the Andes supports the richest flora and fauna in the
world. Climate change and forest destruction threaten these habitats. Research
will be undertaken to provide the first detailed information on the composition
of modern forest communities on the Andean flank of southern Peru, and how those
communities change along an elevational gradient (600 m to 3000 m elevation).
Simultaneously, an investigation will be made at eight sites on that gradient to
determine the changes of local forest communities since the peak of the last ice
age. Fossil pollen and diatoms recovered from ancient lake sediment will provide
a detailed record of how lake systems and local forests responded to past sudden
climatic change, such as rapid cooling events within the last ice age, and the
rapid warming associated with the start of the present interglacial. Information
will be provided on how forest community diversity has changed through time, and
whether changes in communities were restricted to just the rare species or
affected all species equally. These data will help biologists understand how
high diversity floras and faunas, with a high proportion of endemic species, can
survive climate change, and what will be required to conserve them.
