Leaves alternate between periods of gradually changing photosynthesis and dark
metabolism under the natural daily cycling of light, yet they provide a steady
supply of sucrose to sustain the uninterrupted development of growing parts of
the plant. To do this, leaves must utilize stored carbohydrate during periods of
low light and distribute carbohydrate between export and renewal of storage
during periods of high photosynthesis. Regulation of leaf carbohydrate
metabolism and export from source leaves provides the means to meet these
demands. Mutant plants which lack the ability to synthesize or degrade starch
have markedly reduced seed production, which confirms the importance of export
of stored carbohydrate during periods of low photosynthesis. This research
project will study key aspects of processes by which leaves maintain this steady
supply of sucrose for export. The program is aimed at identifying and
understanding regulation of carbon allocation, translocation, and partitioning
with a view to increasing basic knowledge needed for improving crop plants.
These processes affect crop productivity directly by supplying carbon to sinks
of economic importance. The PI's approach is to investigate the physiology and
biochemistry of these processes and their integrated regulation needed to
provide a basis for genetic and molecular manipulation of these processes. The
response of leaf carbon metabolism to changes in photosynthesis rate during a
sinusoidal light regime, which simulates a natural day, demonstrates the
importance of multiple sources of carbon in maintaining export rate during the
day. These sources will be studied to identify the biochemical and molecular
mechanisms involved in their regulation and coordination. Plants that use either
starch exclusively or sucrose and starch to maintain export will be compared to
determine the basis of these differences. The coordination of starch synthesis
and degradation with photosynthesis rate is important in maintaining a steady
rate of sucrose synthesis throughout a sinusoidal light regime. The pathways by
which newly- fixed carbon and carbon from starch are converted to sucrose will
be investigated. A further program goal is to isolate and maintain plant mutants
having altered starch metabolism for studying the regulation of starch synthesis
and degradation.
