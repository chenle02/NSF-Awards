The construction industry in the United States is highly fragmented. An example
is the partitioning of work phases among multiple entities in the design,
fabrication, and erection of structural steel. Division of the design,
detailing, and construction phases results in a lack of communication of
engineering information crucial to providing the optimal total product. The
objective of this research is to improve the quality of steel structures by
improving communication between the designer and the fabricator and improving
the use of design information by both parties. This will be achieved through an
integration of knowledge-based expert systems (KBES) with computer-aided design
and drafting (CADD). Such a computer system, using a standard format for data,
facilitates the managing and transferring of design information between the
designer and fabricator and enables the use of that data for improved design
decision making. A prototype system will be developed, evaluated and verified
using real design cases, refined using feedback from both fabricators and
designers, tested in small trials by potential users, and evaluated and
documented to expedite transfer to industry use. This will produce a tool to
significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the steel industry.//
