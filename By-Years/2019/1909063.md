One of the most important goals of modern astrophysics is the detailed
understanding of the formation and growth of galaxies. This project will add a
refinement to models of the birth of star clusters in galaxies and their
influence on the growth of the galaxy. They will include these models in
simulations of the the growth of galaxies in the universe over the age of the
universe. The results of these models will be used to compare with future
observations from telescopes on the ground and in
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will model the baryonic component of
galaxies within LCDM cosmological simulations. The refinement to be made will
treat stellar particles within the ART simulation as star clusters and add
detailed properties of the evolution of the clusters and their influence on the
local interstellar medium. With these refinements, zoom-in models of galaxies at
redshifts of zero can have resolutions as small as 5 pc. From these simulations,
they will produce simulated observational catalogs that can be compared with
future observations from ALMA, JWST, and Gaia in order to constrain features of
star formation and feedback within their models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
