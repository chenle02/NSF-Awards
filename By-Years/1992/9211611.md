This grant supports the research by a State University of New York at Stony
Brook professor of Nuclear Chemistry who will study nuclear reactions produced
by heavy ion bombardment at energies of order 50 MeV/u. Prof. Lacey and his
students will use the facilities of the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory at Michigan State University for their experiments.
