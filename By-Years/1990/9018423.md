The principal investigators will test the feasibility of conducting routine
stable isotopic analyses of minerals and fluid inclusions using a multichannel
laser Raman microprobe. Successful development of the technique will enable
analysis of much smaller sample sizes than current techniques allow, and will
provide a means for testing isotopic homogeneity at a few per mil level for
spatial resolution of a few micrometers. The technique could greatly benefit
both geological research, as well as research in other areas.
