Research indicates that calcium ions and signal-modulated ion channels may play
a central role in plant cellular signal transduction. Guard cells provide an
ideal system for the study of plant signaling, as these cells respond
dynamically to hormone and light stimuli in regulating gas exchange. Recent data
suggest that calcium regulation of ion channels in the plasma membrane of guard
clls provides a basis for physiologically- observed calcium dependent stomatal
movements. Preliminary results show that abscisic acid induces increases in
cytosolic calcium, which in turn may trigger stomatal closing, thus protecting
plants from desiccation. The goals of the proposed research are to achieve an
accurate understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cytosolic calcium
and other ions regulate inward rectifying potassium channels and by which
mechanisms abscisic acid exerts control over these processes. Isolated guard
cells will be studied by simultaneous patch clamp analysis and photometric
measurements of cytosolic calcium, allowing the direct investigation of effects
of cytosolic and extracellular modulators on signaling events. The knowledge
gained from these studies will contribute substantially to our understanding of
the molecular mechanisms controlling gas and water exchange in the leaves of
plants and will provide a quantitative description of biophysical and
biochemical regulation of ion channels in higher plant cells.
