Bryophytes exhibit a wide range of breeding systems which may result in
divergent patterns of gene flow. Differences in gene flow may influence the
species potential for microsite adaptation. Thus, species of contrasting
reproductive mode are included in this study of local differentiation. Patterns
of gene flow dispersal of spores, gametes and asexual propagules will be
assessed. These studies are based on 3 years of field experiments and laboratory
analysis. The proposal offers significant opportunities for research
collaboration for undergraduates and provides funds for faculty research at an
institution primarily devoted to teaching. The proposed research will enhance
our understanding of the role of selection and environmental heterogeneity in
the maintenance of genetic diversity, and add to our knowledge of the
reproductive ecology of a little-studied, but ubiquitous group of organisms.
