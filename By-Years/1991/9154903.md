Montana State University will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in the Life Sciences which will offer science enrichment activities for
30 precollege students entering grades 10,11. This program will emphasize field
research in aquatic ecology. The project site, located on Canyon Ferry Lake, is
a Bureau of Reclamation former housing facility which has been converted to
science laboratories and dormitories. Participants will learn to use state-of-
the-art analytical instrumentation while working side- by-side with biologists,
chemists, earth scientists, engineers and corporate officers in an integrated
scientific study of the upper Missouri River and some of its tributaries.
