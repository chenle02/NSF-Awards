The aim of the project is to give Microbiology, Medical Technology, and Pre-
Medical students more "hands on" experience in the undergraduate laboratories,
particularly using the kinds of modern equipment adopted by the pharmaceutical,
food and medical industries, and by graduate schools. The new spectrophotometers
are being used in the General Microbiology course to construct growth curves of
bacteria, in the Parasitology course to perform experiments on enzyme kinetics,
and in Immunology to carry out protein concentration determinations. Laminar
flows, the inverted microscope, the CO2 incubator and the new centrifuge are
being used in Immunology courses to manage Myeloma cells. The miniature and
horizontal electrophoresis systems, the transilluminator, shaking incubator and
microcentrifuge are used to construct physical maps of plasmids in the
Cellular/Molecular Biology course. The Biostat fermenter is used in the
Industrial Microbiology course for the continuous culture of various
microorganisms of industrial interest. With the equipment provided through this
project, students are learning to use electrophoresis, DNA recombination, enzyme
kinetics, and ELISA techniques, and are mastering principles of tissue culture
and the importance of Myeloma cells.
