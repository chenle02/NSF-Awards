Title: Token Status: The Negative Consequences of Distinctiveness This is a
Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant to study the effects of a
perceived token -- status of being the only one of a different social category,
in an otherwise homogeneous group -- on the individual's cognitive performance.
The study will also investigate alternative strategies that might prevent or
eliminate the detrimental effects of tokenism. The planning period will allow
the identification of appropriate research designs and the implementation of
pilot studies. This grant will provide support for a well-trained minority
scientist to prepare a competitive proposal to submit to the MRI research
initiation component.
