9316615 Griffin Most risk communication research focuses on what experts want to
convey to the public and how to do so efficiently. Very little is known,
however, about how people use the risk information available to them to make
sense of risky situations. This project is to investigate how residents of
Milwaukee rely on their personal experience, and on the various mass and
interpersonal communications channels to develop their knowledge and level of
worry about tap-water borne parasitic disease (cryptosporidiosis) in the wake of
a recent widespread outbreak in their city. A random sample survey will be
conducted by telephone of 500 adults who live in the affected part of the
Milwaukee metropolitan area. Since it is essential to gather the data while
personal memories of the experience with cryptosporidiosis are fresh, while the
outbreak is still highlighted in the mass media, and while uncertainty still
remains about possible recurrences, this proposal is funded by the Small Grants
for Exploratory Research. This effort is conducted to prepare a more extensive
research proposal that will examine how people select and process information to
cope with risks in the world around them using an audience-based rather than a
sender-based approach to investigate risk communication. ***
