Engineering (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This phase 2 project is extending a
product of the Phase 1 research both at the original university and in other
higher education institutions. The product is a gateway course that surveys an
engineering field in part or in its entirety, with equivalent attention to
currently topical applications and the broader (social, environmental, cultural,
economic) impacts of those applications, while contextualizing professional
development outcomes into the instructional design. In this phase 2 project, the
three collaborating universities are enabling transferability of the phase 1
intervention by formalizing the process of identifying the comfort zones of both
faculty and students to enable successful social learning. The goal of the phase
2 project is to improve cognitive, affective, and meta-cognitive constructs that
directly support: 1) increasing the number of women and under-represented
minorities in engineering; 2) improving the preparation of engineering graduates
for the 21st century workplace (using ABET criteria); 3) increasing the average
level of cognitive development of engineering undergraduates; 4) enhancing
capacity to work in progressive and collaborative teams; and, 5) upgrading high
level awareness of the 21st century high-tech workplace.
