A long range goal of this research is to identify the important mechanisms that
are involved in fat deposition and subsequent composition. Hibernating mammals
were selected for study because they must deposit large amounts of fat to meet
cellular energy requirements during the winter months. Since they eat little or
nothing during hibernation, they must store energy in the form of fat in their
body. It is hoped that these studies will lead to a better understanding of the
role of certain essential fatty acids in basic nutrition, reproduction, and
hibernation.
