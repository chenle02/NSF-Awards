At the microscopic scale, we do not yet have a good understanding of how
biological mechanical sensory organs work. Small aquatic animals make very fast
responses to local water movements, which can produce whole-animal behavior
including feeding, reproductive movements, or escape from predators within
milliseconds. Despite the need for very short response latency, each of these
different behaviors requires sufficient information on identity and localization
of the source of signals to produce an ecologically appropriate response. This
project uses the tiny marine crustaceans called copepods to analyze how their
microscopic hairlike sensors called setae are stimulated by small water motions,
and how the nervous system controls their extremely rapid specific behavioral
responses. Coupling modern high-speed video imaging technology with
neurophysiological recording and novel micromechanical stimulation techniques,
experiments examine how particular kinds of hydrodynamic fluid disturbance drive
movements of the setae, and how neural signals from the setae are encoded to
initiate appropriate behavioral responses. &lt;br/&gt; Results from this study
will have an impact beyond sensory neurobiology to engineering of microsensor
technology and robotics, and also to biological oceanography because copepods
are a very important component of many marine ecosystems. The project has career
and educational impacts by launching a new investigator's research program, and
by providing cross-disciplinary student training involving computational,
engineering, biological and behavioral approaches to an integrative
question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
