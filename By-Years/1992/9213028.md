A Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer system which will be used to
support several research programs in combustion engineering will be purchased
with this equipment grant. These projects will include: (1) Investigation of the
mechanism and kinetics of formation of sulfur gases and hydrogen chloride during
combustion and gasification of spent pulping liquors and other biomass-
containing process wastes; (2) Studies of the mechanism and kinetics of
formation of nitrogen oxides during combustion of spent pulping liquors and
other biomass-containing process wastes; and, (3) Investigation of the kinetics
of gasification of biomass materials including spent pulping liquors, biomass-
containing process wastes, wheat straw, and wood waste, including studies of the
formation of such acid gases as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride during
gasification. The research program in combustion and gasification is directed at
minimizing the environmental impact of combustion processes through in-process
control and at improved energy conversion efficiency and energy recovery from
low-grade non- conventional fuels and process wastes. Thus, the program has the
potential to aid in three national-need areas: reduction of air pollution,
improved resource utilization, and reduction of solid and liquid waste disposal
problems.
