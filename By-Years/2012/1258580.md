This is a small project to fund Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon
dating and a pilot study of wooden boat frame fragments from the University of
Alaskas Museum of the North Birnirk collection; Birnirk is an early Inuit
civilization of the north coast of Alaska. In the spring of 2012 the PI
identified six umiak fragments from the Birnirk site (Barrow, Alaska) as
fragments of a single boat assemblage. 19 additional boat fragments originating
from the same and adjacent excavation units have a strong probability of
belonging to the same boat and this project would test these fragments to
determine whether they are from one or several structures. The significance of
these findings is that skin boat frame assemblages are extremely rare in the
circumpolar archaeological record; in situ fragments such as those described, in
such quantity and from what appears to be fairly early origin, possibly as early
as 1300AD, makes these fragments potentially the oldest known umiak frame
assemblage in the Arctic. The project will determine whether the fragments are
from the same umiak and has the potential to place the structure within a larger
chronological and cultural context and ultimately provide insight into early
Arctic boat engineering and seafaring.
