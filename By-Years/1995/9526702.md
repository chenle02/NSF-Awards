9526702 Grove This award is a component of an international, multi-
institutional, interdisciplinary study of the Kaapvaal craton in southern
Africa. This four-year project will determine the geological processes that led
to the formation and stabilization of this and other ancient continental
cratons. The Kaapvaal craton preserves Archean (2.6 to 3.6 Ga) continental crust
and mantle. The crustal rocks are well exposed and the mantle and deep crust
have been sampled by abundant kimberlites that provide information about the
spatial distribution and temporal evolution of deep lithospheric structure. The
Principal Investigators will use a number of geophysical and geochemical
techniques to investigate the structure of the craton. The results of these
diverse approaches will be integrated with research programs of several South
African groups to provide a comprehensive understanding of three-dimensional
structure, chemical composition and tectonic evolution of the mantle and crust
of the Kaapvaal craton. The data will be used to evaluate competing models of
craton assembly and to provide constraints on the continental dynamics of the
early Earth. ***
