Directional solidification is a process in which an alloy melt is solidified by
cooling from the bottom of the mold. In the resulting casting, the grain
boundaries transverse to the solidification direction are virtually eliminated.
The material thus obtained shows increased creep rupture strain and improved
thermal fatigue behavior, two important characteristics for the modern gas
turbine blades. It is, however, not uncommon to find long-range differences in
the alloy composition between different parts of the castings. These are known
as macrosegregations, and they are serious defects which adversely affect the
physical and mechanical properties and workability. Even more deleterious are
localized segregates, commonly referred to as freckles or channel segregations,
which are solute-rich, columnal regions parallel to the direction of cooling in
DS-processes. The objective of this research is to determine the mechanisms of
fluid mechanical origin by which freckles are formed in directionally solidified
alloys. Experiments and numerical investigations will be carried out
simultaneously to enhance the beneficial interactive effect.
