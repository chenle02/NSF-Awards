Faculty who teach primarily undergraduates are being exposed to the excitement
and vitality of modern laser/optics technology and science. The activities are
being carefully structured to illustrate connection between fundamental optical
concepts and well focused applications involving advanced and sophisticated
equipment. Basic concepts are those normally taught in a second or third year
optics segment or course at the undergraduate level. The result is an increased
understanding of the flow from basic to applied on the part of the participants,
who will gain direct, hands on experience with recent developments in the
rapidly advancing field of optics. The personal experience gained by the
participants is translating into better instruction through both lecture and
laboratory development and motivation of students toward optics careers. The
motivation and the connection of these workshops with universities offering
graduate training is resulting in greater opportunities for the participant's
students. By holding these workshops in conjunction with the Laser Institute of
America's annual meetings in Florida, Massachusetts and California in each of
the next three years the opportunities for undergraduate faculty are greatly
expanded. In addition the annual meeting enhances the educational opportunities
available to the participants. Follow up for the participants and their students
is designed to provide continuing program improvement, and maximum long-term
impact. A laboratory manual is being produced as a part of the workshops and
follow-up activities. Cost sharing by the participants for their travel and the
Laser Institute for publicity will constitute about 20 per cent of the cost of
the program.
