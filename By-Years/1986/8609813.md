This research performs a combined theoretical and experimental study of
diffraction of Lamb waves by two- and three-dimensional cracks in a plate. The
results will provide the basis to develop techniques for assessing the internal
damage and cracks in solids. The theoretical study will use a hybrid finite
element and modal expansion method. Cracks in a homogeneous as well as in a
welded plate will be considered. A newly developed capacitive transducer will be
used to measure vertical surface displacements in a plate. The measured
displacements will be compared with the theoretical predictions. The goal of
this investigation is to analyze the dependence of the scattered signals on the
dimension, angle of inclination, and depth of burial of the crack. The detailed
analysis will be used to identify characteristic features for crack sizing and
location.
