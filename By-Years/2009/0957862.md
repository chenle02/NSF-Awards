Three institutions- California State University-Fresno, California State
University, Long Beach, and the University of Arizona- are planning and
implementing three annual conferences for faculty and students from Robert Noyce
Teacher Scholarship program sites located in the western region of the United
States. The conferences are focusing on three primary goals: 1) to provide
professional development to meet the specific needs of the Noyce
Scholars/Teachers who will be or are working in "high need" schools and
districts; 2) to provide a forum in which Noyce program leaders can congregate
in order to share ideas, challenges, and successes as they relate to their
respective programs; and 3) to strengthen local, state-wide, and Western Region
networks through person-to-person meetings and online media such as MERLOT,
MERLOT Voices, and the Noyce Commons. Noyce Scholars/Teachers attend a variety
of sessions at these annual conferences that expose them to information and
professional development on learning and teaching. They are able to collaborate
and share experiences, expertise, and skills with their peers and colleagues
through person-to-person and online networking. Results and information from the
conference are disseminated at the Noyce national conferences, journals, MERLOT
Noyce Voices, Noyce Commons, the MERLOT Science Education Community portal, and
other websites. The Western Regional Noyce Conference series provides a powerful
opportunity for Noyce Scholars/Teachers to interact, sharing their experiences,
concerns, frustrations, and hopes as they begin a profession in teaching science
or mathematics. The conferences help them to reinvigorate their commitment to
excellence as current or future science or mathematics teachers and to serve as
the role models they should be as members of the Noyce Community.
