The objective of this project is to provide a systematic study of multi-phase
transitions. There are macroscopic free boundary models, which are based on
observable quantities and are needed to deal with singularities due to
topological changes of free boundaries, and microscopic continuum models,
derived at the molecular level and (always) well-posed. One goal of the project
is to derive critical information from continuum models for free boundary models
when the latter become indeterminate. Another is to develop new microscopic
continuum models for phase transitions among phases such as solid/liquid and
different grains in a polycrystalline material. The main tools used here are
theories of partial differential equations, singular perturbations, asymptotic
expansions, complex analysis, bifurcation, center manifolds, global analysis,
dynamical systems, and geometric measure. From time to time, computer assistance
is used to first stimulate, then validate, and further extend theoretical
conclusions.

The investigator studies interfacial phenomena, which are commonplace in nature
and occur whenever there is a continuum that can exist in at least two different
phases and there is some mechanism that generates a spatial separation of these
phases. The spatial boundaries that separate these phases, referred to as
interfaces or free boundaries, evolve with time due to some enforcement of
transitions of phases from one to another. A typical two-phase transition is a
solidification process of a liquid. A classical multi-phase transition arises
from evolutions of grains in a polycrystal where alignments of atoms in
different grains do not match at grain boundaries. The growth of a solid
polycrystal from a liquid involves a two-phase transition between liquid and
solid and a multi-phase transition among grains. These phenomena motivate new
theoretical development in free boundary problems, systems of parabolic or
elliptic partial or ordinary differential equations, and dynamical systems.
Insights gained from the project increase connections between mathematicians and
materials scientists. New models developed here provide scientists with tools
for understanding and designing new materials.
