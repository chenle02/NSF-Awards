The Cross-Linked Models (XLM) project links learning resources to and from the
Open Source Physics (OSP) Collection within the comPADRE NSDL Pathway by
engaging students, teachers, and the general public in physics, computational
physics, and computer modeling. This goal is achieved by modifying existing
models or creating new models that are indexed and cross-referenced to journal
articles, by publishing descriptions of new simulations in the American Journal
of Physics and The Physics Teacher, by incorporating OSP items into American
Physical Society education and outreach projects, by establishing relations
(comPADRE cross references) between OSP Collection items and other comPADRE
collections, and by linking OSP Collection items to entries in Creative Commons
friendly websites, such as Wikipedia. &lt;br/&gt;The XLM project impacts
education nationwide by strengthening the ties between the American Physical
Society and the American Association of Physics Teacher's professional societies
and the comPADRE NSDL Pathway. Although the development of new simulations is an
outcome of the XLM grant, OSP developers will continue to create new materials.
The primary purpose of the XLM is to add context and value to resources and to
make this material more useful for digital library users.
