This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is
entitled "Ecological and genetic responses of plants to insect herbivory." This
research examines the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to insect herbivores
using both ecological and functional genomics methodologies. The research
examines how plants "recognize" and respond to insects. Comparing genomic
information to quantitative plant responses related to life history, defense,
and fitness in the field allows evaluation of plant defenses, tolerance, and co-
evolution. The training goals are to prepare for an independent research career
by learning techniques from and integrating ecology and functional genomics.
