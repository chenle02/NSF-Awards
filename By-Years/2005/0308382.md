Abstract&lt;br/&gt;DISSERTATION RESEARCH: An Investigation of the Role of
Interaction between Muller's Ratchet and the Red Queen in the Maintenance of Sex
in a Freshwater
Snail&lt;br/&gt;Lively&lt;br/&gt;DEB-0308382&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the
two-fold reproductive advantage of asexual over sexual reproduction, most
eukaryotic taxa are sexual. Although there are several mechanisms that can
theoretically maintain sex, all require assumptions that limit their
applicability. Recent theory has shown that interaction between mutation
accumulation and parasite pressure can maintain sex under less restrictive
conditions than under either mechanism acting alone. More specifically, the
bottlenecking of asexual lineages caused by virulent parasitism will increase
the strength of genetic drift and thus the rates of deleterious mutation
accumulation and lineage extinction in heavily parasitized lineages relative to
less parasitized lineages. The proposed study will examine these predictions by
using mitochondrial DNA sequence information to estimate the age of and
mutational distribution within asexual lineages from mixed sexual/asexual
populations of a freshwater snail that are afflicted by varying frequencies of
infection by a castrating trematode. The results of this project, the first
known to address whether interaction between mechanisms can maintain sex in
nature, will be a valuable contribution to the debate surrounding the mechanisms
underlying the maintenance of sex. The results would be of wide interest to
evolutionary and conservation biologists.&lt;br/&gt;
