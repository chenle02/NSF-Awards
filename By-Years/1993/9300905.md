P# Collins 9300905 (# ` h p x (# This three year project will survey and
database the Miocene and Pliocene marine invertebrate fossil faunas of tropical
America in order to test and study hypotheses of biotic responses to the closing
of the Panamanian sea corridor between the Caribbean and Pacific seaways. During
the Neogene, this closure split the tropical marine realm and produced oceanic
changes and biotic isolation on opposite sides of Central America. The survey,
which will occur in a fine scaled stratigraphic framework, will include
geographic, sedimentologic, stratigraphic, paleoecologic, and taxonomic
datasets. Most of the fauna consists of bryozoans, foraminifera and molluscs,
which will be subjected to faunal analyses and employed in paleoenvironmental
and paleoclimatic determinations. The resultant collections will also be used in
systematic and phylogenetic studies of constituent groups and in training
students in paleobiology. The project has longstanding collaboration with
facilities and investigators at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in
Panama. %%% During the Miocene and Pliocene epochs 20 million to 2 million years
ago the Panamanian sea corridor between the Caribbean and the Pacific became
constricted and finally closed, splitting what had been a continuous seaway into
two discrete marine realms on either side of Central America. This closure
produced wholesale oceanic and biotic changes, including extinctions, migrations
and the development of many new marine species. The project will survey the
marine fossil faunas of tropical America from this time period in order to study
these change s and correlate the impacts on the marine organisms of the closing
of the Panamanian seaway. The survey will include geographic, geologic and
paleontologic datasets. Most of the fossil animals are bryozoans, foraminifera
and molluscs, which will be subjected to faunal analyses and employed in
paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic determinations. The resultant collections
will also be used to reconstruct the history of these organisms and in training
students in paleobiology. The project is extremely important in charting
responses in the marine realm to geological events. ***
