Proposal Title: PECASE: Management of Immersive Sensor Data
Streams&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to design and
develop a system to enable the acquisition, storage, querying and analysis of
immersive sensor data streams, termed immersidata, in the wavelet transformed
domain. Immersive sensors are the user interfaces of the future and it is
absolutely critical to facilitate the manipulation and analysis of their
generated data sets. Management of immersidata is challenging because they are:
(1) multi-dimensional, (2) spatio-temporal, (3) continuous data streams, and (4)
noisy. In addition, they are produced with a high rate and hence their real-time
query processing is a challenging task. The use of wavelets alleviates these
challenges collectively. Furthermore, the resulting system enables many other
applications dealing with large multidimensional data streams that require
approximate and/or progressive query support. This project is benefiting from
the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team of scientists in the areas of
computer vision, graphics, signal processing and human factor studies in the
PI's home institution. The career development plan will train the database
graduate students in continuous mathematics and linear algebra, and provide them
with the opportunity to acquire hands-on experiences in utilizing sophisticated
math techniques for sensor data analysis purposes. In addition, undergraduate
and underrepresented students will become familiar with modern sensory/immersive
interfaces and exercise the concepts of forming mining queries on
multidimensional data streams. The main benefits to the society would be through
specific application developments, which would enable more natural interaction
methods with software systems especially for disabled and elderly users. The
project results will be disseminated via Internet (http://infolab.usc.edu) and
other channels in order to increase the
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was originally funded as a
CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for
Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
