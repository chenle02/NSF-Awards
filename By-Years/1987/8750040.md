Chemometrics has been defined as the field in which mathematical and statistical
techniques are used to extract valuable, but often hidden, information from
measurements. Its introduction into the undergraduate curriculum has been
recommended by the American Chemical Society. The Chemistry Department at
Colorado College is implementing the introduction of chemometrics into the
undergraduate curriculum through the recent acquisition of a Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectrometer with selected spectral libraries and an enhanced library
search package attachments. In addition to the usual infrared spectroscopy
acitivities, use of this system is providing students with experiences in
fourier transforms and computerized spectral searches. The courses impacted
include organic chemistry, quantitative analysis, advanced analytical topics,
reaction mechanisms and syntheses, theoretical spectroscopy, and research
participation.
