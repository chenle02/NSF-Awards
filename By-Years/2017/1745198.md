This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will seek to
acquire fundamental knowledge in determining the amount of data that should be
purchased for statistically estimating the coefficients of optimization models.
This will be done by examining the tradeoffs between the cost of data used for
calibrating optimization models and the quality of solutions obtained with those
models. Such tradeoffs will be explored mainly for problems relevant in
transportation, such as vehicle assignment to tasks, vehicle routing, fleet
sizing, and network flow models. The results should help transportation agencies
and companies across the world in allocating resources and improving their
professional practice. Beyond transportation problems, this work may yield
methods that would be valuable in other applications, industries and
disciplines, including engineering, operations research, economics and
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional optimization approaches do not
account for the cost of acquiring input data, which can be very important in
many applications of engineering and operations research, including
transportation. The need for considering the cost of data acquisition is even
greater now and in the future when the ownership of the data for transportation
is moving from publically owned to privately owned. The goals are to develop
methods for optimizing the amounts of data acquired for calibrating some
specific transportation optimization models and then explore whether and how
such methods and guidelines may be generalized to other optimization problems in
other fields. The quality and cost of data may determine how much should be
obtained. In addition to extensive experiments involving real-world data, the
project will examine the structures of datasets and their underlying
distributions, to explore how a generic decision making framework may be
developed for determining "how much data we should purchase in order to
calibrate an optimization model"?
