This research project is to study and compare the substrate specificity and
structural relatedness of the calcium-dependent and calcium-independent PLA2
isoenzymes from human placenta. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes the hydrolysis
of the sn-2- acyl position of phospholipids. The free fatty acid that is
released upon hydrolysis is metabolized into various biological agents. The P.I.
has been able to purify and partially characterize fine PLA2 isoenzymes from
human placenta. This research will also examine the effect of selected
inhibitors on the phospholipases. It will also aim to better characterize the
phospholipase isoforms.
