In this project, the PI will obtain measurements of upper ocean velocity
structure, using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), along five
hydrographic lines during 1992-1993, as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE). The five lines are designated by WOCE as P-13, 16S, 17S, 17E,
and 19. P-13 is scheduled for August, 1992, with the remainder starting in
October, 1992. The direct velocity measurements will provide reference
velocities against which to compare those derived from hydrography, and to
determine the small-scale, high-frequency variability. Also proposed is further
testing of a lowered ADCP for use on hydrographic casts.
