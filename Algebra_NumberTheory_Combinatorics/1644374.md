The fourth and fifth conferences on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory
will be held at the University of Missouri on November 19-21, 2016, and at the
University of Iowa on November 18-20, 2017. Representation theory is a branch of
modern algebra studying symmetries in linear spaces. It interacts with many
other areas in mathematics, mathematical physics, and theoretical computer
science. Geometric methods have become more and more fundamental in all of these
areas. One of the main objectives of these conferences is to introduce beginning
researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. The
keynote speakers for these conferences will be Harm Derksen in 2016 and Julia
Pevtsova in 2017. Each keynote speaker will give two one-hour lectures,
emphasizing geometric methods; these talks will be accessible to graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers. There will also be several expository
lectures given by other experts. The remainder of the lectures will be research
talks given by both senior and junior mathematicians. These will include several
talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers related to their Ph.D.
theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new
collaborations can be formed and young researchers have the opportunity to learn
about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover, the
conference will enable junior representation theorists to present their work and
interact with the broader research community.

Over the last 40 years, the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras
has enjoyed a great impact of methods from algebraic geometry, in particular
from geometric invariant theory and transformation groups. At the same time,
this influence has led to the feedback of ideas and techniques from
representation theory to geometry. One of the goals of the conferences on
Geometric Methods in Representation Theory is to help strengthen and advance
this interaction between geometry and representation theory. The topics of these
conferences will include: semi-invariants for bound quivers; representations of
group schemes of constant Jordan type and vector bundles; geometric aspects of
cluster algebras; degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in
module varieties; moduli problems for finite dimensional algebras; and universal
deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces. More information about
