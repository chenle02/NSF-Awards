The proposed research involves experimental studies of ion acceleration with
ultra-intense lasers. The laser power will allow access to the strongly
relativistic regime of laser-plasma interactions, which is at the vanguard of
the fields of optics and plasma physics. A central task will be a controlled,
systematic &lt;br/&gt;and comprehensive study of the scaling of proton energy
and flux over a large range of laser parameters as well as target geometries and
material properties. In the process, we will develop real-time ion beam
diagnostics, the lack of which currently limits progress in this research
area.&lt;br/&gt;
