The focus of this integrated research, education, and outreach program is the
development of simulation tools capable of modeling the complex electromagnetic
environment of high-speed circuits. Key innovations include the use of multi-
scale abstraction and introduction of meta-elements to minimize the
computational burden. The finite element method is used as a back-bone approach
to allow for complex geometrical and material features. This simulation tool
will be used, along with other educational materials developed by the Principal
Investigator, to develop a Mixed Signal Circuits course at Michigan State
University that focuses on electromagnetic interference (EMI) mitigation and
design for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
educational materials developed for consumption on the MSU campus will be
adapted for distance learning via the Asynchronous Learning Network. Flexible
short courses will be offered over the Internet to industrial and life-long
learning students. The target audience for this outreach effort are degreed-
professionals desiring EMI/EMC education for mixed signal circuit design.
Student learning tracks will be customized based on the needs of the student and
their company. Several major companies have indicated interest in collaborating
in this effort and their input will assist the Principal Investigator in the
production of a high-quality, high-impact outreach program.&lt;br/&gt;
