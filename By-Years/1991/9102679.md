This award will support Professor Arthur D. Murphy of Georgia State University
in a research collaboration with Professor Miguel A. Mendez Rosado of the
Instituto Tecnologico de Oaxaca in Oaxaca City, Mexico. The purpose of the
research is to carry out a comprehensive study of water quality and management
in Oaxaca. Microbiological studies of water quality and ethnographic studies of
attitudes toward water quality and management before and after the rainy season
will allow the project to relate water-borne illness to both water quality and
household water management practices. Poor quality drinking water is a major
cause of death and illness in Mexico and in other developing countries. The
incidence of gastrointestinal and other water-borne illnesses in human
populations is the result of the interaction between the potability of the
available water and how that water is handled by the consuming household. By
shedding light on the attitudes toward water and its management at the household
level, this joint study will help health authorities design educational and
intervention programs to improve water potability, while, at the same time,
serve as a useful model in the field of urban planning.
