The Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to address an issue of solar physics that
was recognized during the previous solar cycle as deserving particular
attention: Coordinated observations of solar activity over a wide range of
wavelengths from gamma- and X-rays to the infrared and radio wave regimes. The
PI proposes to focus on solar microwave observations, which are relatively new
in this panchromatic approach. In particular, the PI proposes to use and to
expand the frequency- agile interferometer at Owens Valley, with its high
spatial and spectral resolutions, and to study solar activity by microwave
imaging and spectroscopy. Observations with this interferometer can accurately
determine the strength and distribution of active- region magnetic fields and
locate and parameterize thermal and non- thermal distributions of high energy
electrons accelerated during flares.
