0930048&lt;br/&gt;McKnight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition
of a flow-through imaging system (FloCAM) to support investigations of the
dynamics of nuisance algal species blooms in surface waters. The instrument will
support PI Diane McKnight and colleagues at the Institute for Arctic &amp;
Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. The instrument will support
researchers involved in the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) with a
focus on the role of dissolved and particulate organic material in a range of
dynamic processes occurring from the atmosphere to the top of the water table.
Knowledge of the quantity and chemical nature of particulate and dissolved
organic matter transported from the landscape via physical and biogeochemical
processes is critical to understanding how climate change might impact water
quality and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems.
