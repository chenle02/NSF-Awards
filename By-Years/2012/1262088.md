This project supports the fieldwork and research for Carolina Aragon's doctoral
dissertation to produce a comprehensive grammar of Akuntsú, a Tupían language
spoken by monolinguals in Rondônia, Brazil. Until recently the Akuntsú people
were an isolated indigenous group, but now, because of a genocidal massacre,
there are only five remaining speakers. This has left Akuntsú a critically
endangered language.

This project's main goal is to provide a comprehensive grammar of the language
which will be informed by language typology and current linguistic theory. The
grammatical description of Akuntsú will contribute to our understanding of the
typological traits of the Tuparían subfamily and to linguistic typology in
general. Ultimately it will also contribute to the reconstruction of Proto-
Tuparían, with implications for Proto-Tupían.

Other documentary materials will also be produced; for example, important
aspects of Akuntsú culture and history that have survived despite of the
traumatic past will be recorded and archived. Documentation and production of
linguistic, ethnographic, and lexicographic materials will be important not only
to represent the structure of the language, but also to reveal the way that
Akuntsú people see and understand their world. As part of a long-term goal,
pedagogical materials will be created and the dictionary will be expanded
ultimately to produce a talking dictionary.

By studying a group that still lives as its ancestors did, this project will
provide contributions for scientific fields interested in the study of Amazonian
native inhabitants and their cultural diversity. The general public will also
benefit from having access to data and materials which will not only be relevant
for linguistics, but also to scholars interested in learning more about
Brazilian indigenous languages, society, and culture.
