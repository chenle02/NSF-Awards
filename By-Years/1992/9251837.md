The Department of Science and Mathematics is acquiring a high- pressure liquid
chromatograph and integrator, a filter-weighing analytical balance, a solvent
filtration system with pump, and three stereo microscopes. All of these are
being used in an integrated curriculum which will lead to a new Environmental
Sciences degree. Skills being developed from the use of this equipment include
environmental monitoring as well as chemical analysis of the resulting air,
water and soil samples. Quantitative skills for separating and chemically
analyzing trace components, as well as field sampling and evaluation of samples
in ecological and microbiological investigations, are being emphasized in the
curriculum.
