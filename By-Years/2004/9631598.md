The horizontal pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, flux divergence of
momentum (the friction term), velocity tendency, and advection are all dominant
forcing terms in the horizontal momentum equation important to a dynamical
description of the Great Plains Low Level Jet (LLJ). Efforts under previous
grants with the PI have enabled an accurate estimate of all forcing terms
associated with the LLJ, including friction. The scientific objective of this
research is to employ a fully-instrumented research aircraft as an observational
platform to measure the forcing terms in the horizontal momentum equation
responsible for the diurnal behavior of the LLJ. The PI will emphasize the
evaluation of the friction term during the period of decoupling attending the
cessation of turbulent mixing around sunset, and the subsequent adjustment of
the horizontal windfield.
