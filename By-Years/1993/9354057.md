9354057 Bagger The idea of a fermionic Goldstone particle was initially
conceived and developed in Russia 3 , and is currently under active
investigation by members of the Theoretical Physics Group at Dubna. Therefore
this work will clearly benefit Russian science. It will benefit American science
because its impact on pure theory and applied phenomenology. In fact, because of
the new colliders at SSCL and CERN, it is the ideal time to study the physics of
the TeV scale. Supersymmetric searches will surely play a major role at both
machines, so a model-independent description will be great importance to
experimentalists as they begin to confront theory with experiment. ***
