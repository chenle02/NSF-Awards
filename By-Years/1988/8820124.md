A three year program of study and research into the systems management of
emerging technology initiation is proposed. The purposes of the research and
study effort will be to: 1. Develop a systems engineering methodology for
management of the emerging technology initiation process; and 2. Apply the
methodology and evaluate its effectiveness through a number of case studies that
will be researched in close cooperation with the NSF Division of Fundamental
Research in Emerging Engineering Technologies. The research will support the
development of systemic approaches that enhance the development of realistic
perspectives for potential key emerging engineering technologies. It will also
apply the results of the research to the identification and support of
substantive activities involving emerging technologies.
