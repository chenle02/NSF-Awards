Utilizing several concepts in pulsed CO2 laser technology, the PIs propose the
development of an 11 Joule per pulse, 50 pulse per second CO2 laser amplifier
suitable for Doppler lidar measurements of remote wind fields at ranges up to 70
km. A novel conduction cooled laser head will be incorporated into the expanding
beam laser architecture for optical extraction, and the laser will be driven by
the PIs patented all-solid-state pulse power technology. This will allow a laser
cost 2 to 3 times lower than presently available pulsed CO2 systems with
comparable outputs.
