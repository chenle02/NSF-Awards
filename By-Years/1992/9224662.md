This award is concerned with research in two areas of noncommutative ring
theory. The principal investigator will study the semiprimitivity of group
algebras. The main goal is to work on the locally finite case and on some
aspects of the more difficult finitely generated case. In addition, he will work
on developing delta methods in enveloping algebras of color Lie algebras and on
understanding the relationship between H-Galois actions of finite dimensional
Hopf algebras and the irreducible representations of these Hopf algebras.
Finally, he plans to work on quantum enveloping algebras to see whether the
enveloping algebra delta methods can be extended to yield properties of these
rings which do not follow from the usual Noetherian techniques. This research is
in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an
addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation
satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to
do so. An example of a ring for which multiplication is not commutative is the
collection of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of noncommutative rings
has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance
to other branches of mathematics and physics.
