The PIs will perform analysis of shapes and amplitude of marine magnetic
anomalies of the past 5 m.y. around the world to estimate the size of then non-
diaploe component of Earth's magnetic field. A recently developed inversion
technique will be used. Existing data shows large systemic errors in global
plated reconstructions. This work will be an initial attempt to correct the
situation.
