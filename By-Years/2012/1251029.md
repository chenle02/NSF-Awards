Deep packet inspection (DPI) is an established methodology used by ISPs for
performance enhancements, security protections, behavioral advertising, and
content filtering. However, the limitations of DPI and its applications are
becoming more and more evident with the increase in network traffic and the
variations in usage patterns. In this exploratory project, the PI will introduce
the notion of Deep ``Network" Inspection (DNI) that will go beyond DPI in
exploring correlations among multiple networks and other aggregated parameters
from multi-genre networks and behaviors. DNI will use broader knowledge
including social network relevancies, information network, modalities of
accesses, device characteristics, past and present user profiles at various
levels of aggregations; thus going far beyond the realm of isolated
characterizations of communication networks. Primary goals of DNI include the
reduction in the ?search space? for real-time analysis and the complexity of
pattern discoveries, and the discovery of relationships which may not be
detectable by single-network inspection (such as DPI). The goal of this project
is to do an initial study to motivate and explore the capabilities of DNI, the
challenges therein, scope of inspections, and potential applications. The
outcome of this exploratory study would potentially open up an enriched area for
further research in the domains of network science. In terms of broader impact,
the proposed project will also instigate researchers in both academics as well
as industry to explore this new domain on network inspection, which may have
significant potential in a variety of applications, and education of students.
