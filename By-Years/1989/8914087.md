Simultaneous measurements of the d.c. magnetization M(H,T,O) and resistance
R(H,T,O) will be performed on monocrystalline samples of a series of
superconductors of increasing anisotropy, in order to 1) separate the
dissipative contributions from the truly superconducting properties in a
dtermination of the upper critical field, and 2) investigate the role of quasi-
two dimensionality (anisotropy) with regard to critical temperatures, fields and
currents. The systems studied shall be the Bi-and Tl-based oxide
superconductors, and the high Tc organic superconductor (BEDT- TTF)2Cu(NCS)2, a
closely related and important system which possesses similar flux-flow and
anisotropic properties as the oxides.
