Many online services are now hosted on the cloud. However, cloud adoption is
still very limited when it comes to performance sensitive users. One of the
primary challenges for cloud users is the lack of understanding of how cloud
resource allocation relates to application performance. While Cloud Service
Providers (CSPs) offer users easy access to cloud resources for their computing
needs, they do not provide any guarantees on the performance of a user's
deployment or any guidelines on how users should set their resource allocations.
This is because user deployments are opaque: CSPs cannot control or access a
user's workload or application. To make matters worse, the effective capacity of
a user's cloud instance can change dynamically due to interference from other
users. As a result, cloud deployments are plagued with performance issues.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop novel performance
models to help users and CSPs understand the dynamic resource requirements of
cloud applications without requiring any extensive benchmarking or
instrumentation. The research team is constructing novel workload-specific
performance models that capture the relationship between cloud resource
allocation and application performance. The team is also developing novel online
tools based on control theory and machine learning to dynamically infer the
(possibly changing) unobservable cloud parameters, thus allowing the performance
models to be tuned online. The resulting models will enable users and CSPs to
accurately allocate cloud resources to achieve the desired application
performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloud-based services are becoming
increasingly popular. This project helps improve cloud adoption and promotes
more efficient use of the cloud. The research provides tools to reduce wastage
of cloud resources, thus helping cloud users reduce their expenditure and also
lowering the power consumption in CSP data centers.
