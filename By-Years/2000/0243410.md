With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
supports the on- going work of Dr. Andrew Streitwieser in the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. The work is aimed at
understanding chemistry by computations rather than the development of new
computational methods or algorithms. The reactions of lithium enolates with
alkyl halides and carbonyl compounds, for example, are important in synthetic
chemistry and the proposed modeling of experimental results, many of which
derive from Professor Streitwieser's laboratory, will provide significant
predictive power and new understanding of this chemistry. Computational
chemistry has reached the point where much of this chemistry can be modeled
quantitatively, and it is the thrust of the present proposal using ab initio
quantum calculations with standard programs. Such modeling allows a wider range
of the effect of structure on reactivity of these and related reactions, and
therefore, leads to new chemical principles and a better understanding of ion
pair chemistry. The results of this project are expected to serve as a focus for
several review articles to summarize Professor Streitwieser's experimental and
computational results.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry supports the research activities of Professor Andrew
Streitwieser of the University of California- Berkeley. Professor Streitwieser
continues to be a world leader in understanding reactions of ionic species. In
addition to answering some fundamental questions in physical organic chemistry,
post-doctoral and undergraduate students will receive unique training in
computational methods and ion pair chemistry. And, to underscore the broader
impact of this work, Professor Streitwieser had eight undergraduate students
work with him during the last two years.
