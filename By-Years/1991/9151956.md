Instrumental analysis students will perform atomic absorption analyses on real
life samples (e.g., wear metals in engine oils) with the aid of a sensitive
instrument equipped with a graphite furnace. Sophomore students in quantitative
analysis will use a flame atomization source with the same instrument. These
specific, sensitive, realistic laboratory analyses will improve the instruction
of a large number of science majors who form an important cadre of analytical
chemists in local industry.The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal
funds.
