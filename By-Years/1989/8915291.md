This research project addresses the problem of establishing an accurate
theoretical model of the electrical double layer at the surface of a 2:1 layer
type clay mineral (e.g., montmorillonite) in contact with an aqueous electrolyte
solution. The results are expected to clarify the interpretation of experimental
data on clay particle surface potentials, anion exclusion, cation adsorption,
and swelling. A theoretical investigation of the 2:1 clay mineral/aqueous
solution interface will be undertaken with four objectives: (1) rigourous
application of modified Gouy- Chapman theory to a disc-shaped clay particle
suspended in a 1-1 electrolyte solution, (2) calculation of the relation between
the electrophoretic mobility and zeta-potential for the clay particle considered
in objective (1), (3) calculation of the electrostatic interaction between
planar charged surfaces contacting a non- uniform dielectric continuum
containing different-sized ions, and (4) extension of modified Gouy-Chapman
theory to calculate surface potentials and the electrostatic interaction between
planar charged surfaces based on recent integral equation methods in statistical
mechanics.
