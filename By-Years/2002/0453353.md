This REU Site program in Prokaryotic Biology will introduce undergraduates to
exciting areas of microbial research and increase their awareness about careers
in microbiology. The program is an intensive, 9-week long, hands-on summer
laboratory research program in the Microbiology Department of the University of
Georgia in Athens. Ten participants will be recruited from undergraduate
institutions with limited research opportunities in Microbiology. Students from
groups that are underrepresented in the scientific community, including deaf and
hard-of-hearing students, are encouraged to participate in the program. REU
participants will conduct independent projects under the supervision of faculty
mentors in a variety of research topics addressing the functions of prokaryotic
organisms (bacteria and archaea). State-of-the-art techniques will be used in
interdisciplinary approaches that combine knowledge from the fields of Genetics,
Biochemistry, Physiology, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology and Ecology.
Research projects will address broad questions ranging from the role of
prokaryotes in environmental and geochemical processes to their role in human
health. Research experiences will help the participants understand more about
graduate education and careers in microbiology. REU participants will have
informal meetings with faculty, attend scientific seminars and join the weekly
research meetings of their lab groups. Students will present their research
results at the end of the summer in a poster session. To learn more about the
REU program and find out how to apply, students are encouraged to visit
