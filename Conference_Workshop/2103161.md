The 2021 EDGE (Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education) Summer Symposium is a
three-day event that addresses mathematical research and professional
development. The Symposium uses a vertical mentorship model to fill in a variety
of gaps (academic and non-academic) that are not guaranteed to be filled by
other means. The community built during EDGE programs is the primary mechanism
that increases retention, access to professional opportunities, and likelihood
that our participants don?t just succeed, they thrive and are propelled into
careers in the mathematical sciences that influence the whole community.

The EDGE Summer Symposium combines research talks, panel discussions, and formal
and informal networking events. The EDGE Symposium will bring together
(virtually and in-person) 75 mathematicians, primarily an intersection of women
and graduate students, and will be hosted by the University of Minnesota in
Minneapolis. Participants of the Summer Symposium discuss cutting-edge research,
motivating further discoveries and empowering less senior participants to strive
for similar work. These more junior participants also receive indispensable
career advice, while more established mathematicians hone their mentoring
skills, strengthen their own support network, and deepen their commitment to
influencing the next generation of mathematicians. In increasing the number of
women who succeed in graduate school and beyond, the Summer Symposium increases
the visibility of a diverse collective of mathematicians, inspiring younger
mathematicians to persevere and become leaders in the mathematical sciences.
