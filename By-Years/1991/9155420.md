This 2 1/2 year project, sponsored by the Social Sciences Education Consortium
Inc. (SSEC), will implement a curriculum, based upon the history and nature of
science and technology (HNST), in selected school districts throughout the
nation. The project is organized in three stages. The first stage consists of
the development of a teacher education resource book based upon the HNST
curriculum. the second stage consists of an intensive summer program for 40
teachers consisting of teams of teachers from the selected school districts. The
summer programs will include content and pedagogy enhancement as well as
preparation for the implementation of the curriculum. The third stage of the
project consists of follow-up activities in the districts, development of
inservice plans and implementation of the new curriculum in each district with
the help of the resources of SSEC and the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study
(BSCS). The NSF grant is being matched by SSEC and the school districts by funds
equivalent to 46% of the NSF award.
