The pristine conditions and the often simplified biotic communities of the
Arctic offer unique opportunities to study aquatic processes and biological
interactions. Arctic freshwaters need to be studied not only because of the
opportunity to determine fundamental relationships but also to supply
information to managers and governing groups so that plans can be made for the
best possible use of aquatic resources. Nine investigators will measure changes
in the ecology of rivers and lakes in Arctic Alaska caused by experimental
manipulations of nutrients and fish populations. The integrating concepts are
that changes of rate of nutrient supply at the bottom of the food change and of
fish populations at the top of the food chain have direct effects on algal and
fish populations, and indirect effects up and down the food chain. Experiments
manipulating nutrient and fish concentrations will be conducted using whole and
divided lakes, large enclosures, and whole streams. Results will provide a
better understanding of how rivers and lakes are regulated and will enable
better predictions of how the resources of Arctic lakes and rivers will respond
to human disturbances.
