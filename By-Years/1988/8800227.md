The mechanisms regulating social homeostasis in a complex insect society will
be studied by integrating behavioral, genetic, and physiological analyses of
honey bee social organization. Behavioral mechanisms thought to contribute to
flexible colony responses to environmental change will be studied under
experimental conditions and, for the first time, during natural changes in
social structure that occur as a result of colony fission and the honey bee's
unique mode of overwintering. A hormonal mechanism known to regulate individual
worker behavioral development will be probed further to determine whether it
also acts as a colony integrating mechanism by altering behavioral thresholds in
response to environmental and colony conditions. All experimental bees used in
these investigations will bear genetic markers, enabling determination of
possible genotypic differences in both behavioral and physiological aspects of
worker plasticity. These studies promise to provide a comprehensive account of
the mechanisms governing social insect behavioral plasticity, and so contribute
toward the fundamental goal of understanding colony integration in the insect
societies. The work will proceed for two years at Ohio State University under
sponsorship of a postdoctoral fellowship in environmental biology.
