The market for high power lasers is exploding due to the popularity of laser
welders for manufacturing and metal 3D printers. This project aims to
demonstrate high electricity-to-light conversion efficiency for light emitting
diodes (LED) and diode lasers. LED lighting bulbs will be brighter at the same
energy used if they are more efficient in converting electricity into light. The
demonstration will be based on novel nanostructures: quantum wires. Current
state-of-the-art LEDs and diode lasers are based on the concept of quantum
wells, even though higher efficiencies have been predicted from devices based on
smaller nanostructures such as quantum wires. Preliminary results from the work
conducted by this team suggest a novel route to fabricate quality quantum wires
and their subsequent uses for high efficiency LEDs and lasers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabrication of quality nanostructures by direct laser
modification of surfaces has been regarded problematic due to laser induced
defects, especially irradiation of high power laser pulses on III-V
semiconductors has been known to induce damages since 1980. However, preliminary
data from GaAs(001) surfaces that are irradiated by high power laser pulses
suggest that the laser produced nanoscale features, if smaller than 100 nm, are
free from chemical damages when the interferential irradiation of laser pulses
creates transient thermal gratings on the surfaces. The demonstration of quality
nanostructures as gain media for optoelectronic devices is fundamentally
important because it is applicable to other material systems in order to usher
the across-the-board efficiency increase for optoelectronic devices. If
successful, developed direct laser fabrication techniques will be employed to
realize proof-of-concept, diode lasers that are based on novel quantum wires.
