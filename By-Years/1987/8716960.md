The project will develop real-time neural network models for the adaptive
control and planning of complex sensory-motor skills. Such models are equally
important for understanding human movement planning and the design of flexible
characterized circuits for generating synchronous movements of multi-joint motor
systems, such as arms and speech articulators, at variable speeds. The current
research will investigate the design of supplementary circuits that are capable
of rapidly adapting to the unexpected loads and inertias that arise during novel
movements, and of slowly learning to predict the correct movement parameters
when these novel movements become familiar through practice. In addition, the
project will attemp to analyze how elementary, or atomic, movements are
organized into complex movement sequences, and how the controls for these
sequences become automated through learning. Also, eye-hand coordination will be
analyzed by showing how a representation of where the eye-head system is looking
is associatively transformed into where the hand-arm system is commanded to
move. Issues concerning the learned timing of actions and self-organization of a
body-centered coordinated system will also be analyzed.
