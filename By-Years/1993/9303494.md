The research entails applications of geometric and analytic techniques to
moduli problems in conformal field theory, mainly on Riemann surfaces. This
topic is regarded with great importance in modern mathematical physics and lends
itself to a deeper understanding of the large scale structure of space-time and
vortex phenomena.
