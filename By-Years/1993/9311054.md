9311054 Jacobson Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the most abundant peptides
found in the mammalian central nervous system. It appears to modulate many
centrally controlled functions, including respiration, thermoregulation,
reproduction, nociception, anxiety, and memory. By far the best-known role of
CCK, however, is its action as a feeding satiety factor. Recently, Dr. Jacobson
found CCK receptor binding in the facial motor nucleus, a substrate that
mediates facial movement or expression, including nursing. Therefore, Dr.
Jacobson speculates that CCK may also have a central effect on motor systems
involved in the control of feeding-related behaviors. Utilizing the methods of
immunohistochemistry and receptor autoradiography, she will determine if the
cholecystokininergic system is playing a role in nursing behavior. Dr. Jacobson
will compare the distribution of CCK receptors in neurons located within the
Vllm nucleus which innervates facial muscles in neonates of different species.
She will then use a metabolic marker to determine how manipulations in feeding,
and the exogenous administration of CCK or its antagonists, affect the activity
of neurons in developing motor systems. The results from these studies will
further our knowledge on the central mediation of feeding behavior, and the role
of cholecystokininergic system in this process. Understanding this fundamental
mechanism could in turn have beneficial effects on management of obesity and
eating disorders. ***
