9633114 Collins This project supports researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts to conduct a series of experiments at two sites in
the North Atlantic Ocean to understand the processes involved in growth of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Specifically, the investigators will measure the reflected
and refracted arrivals of seismic energy from small explosive charges near the
bottom over sections of the mid-ocean ridge spreading center which have known,
previously sampled, rock compositions. They will then apply the results of their
seismic experiment to a) identify and b) map rock types across these two
sections of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, to test existing models for subsurface ridge
structure. The technique will, if successful, provide the first 3-dimensional
map of the structure of a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge, which is predicted to
differ in several key aspects from the faster-spreading mid-ocean ridge systems
previously studied in this manner in the Pacific Ocean. The experiment will,
also, provide the first field test of the use of high resolution seismic
velocity data to discriminate among gabbros, serpentinites and basalts in the
upper kilometer of an active spreading center. Again, if successful this will
provide an opportunity to map regions of unknown surface lithology using the
seismic technique alone. ***
