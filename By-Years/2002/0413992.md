Prof. Roger Loring of Cornell University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for the development of
theoretical methods for the computation of various observables in nonlinear
spectroscopy of condensed phase systems. The research focuses on determining the
extent to which quantum effects are important in the nonlinear vibrational
response of these systems. Two parts of the research are being carried out: (1)
an investigation of generic models such as low-dimensional systems of coupled
anharmonic oscillators for which exact solutions can be found; and (2) further
development of the PI's prior work on the use of the Herman-Kluk propagator for
semiclassical approximation. The latter project includes molecular dynamics
simulations and is being carried out in collaboration with an experimental group
led by Prof. Michael Fayer of Stanford University. The work is having a broader
impact on the understanding of liquids and biomolecular systems.
