The principal investigator will continue his study of the new 3-manifold
invariants defined by Witten (in the context of quantum field theory) and by
Reshetikhin and Turaev (in the context of representation theory of quantum
groups). Applications of these invariants to central problems in low dimensional
topology, including questions related to the Jones polynomial and to surgery on
knots, will be investigated. The invariants will be computed for a variety of
examples, which can be expected to reveal periodicity phenomena. Machine
computation using Mathematica on a Macintosh IIci is feasible and will be
undertaken.
