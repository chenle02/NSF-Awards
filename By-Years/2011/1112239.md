Patrick H. Vaccaro of Yale University is supported by the Chemical Structure,
Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry division to investigate
fundamental aspects of molecular behavior responsible for physical properties
and chemical propensities. Novel forms of linear and nonlinear laser
spectroscopy are enlisted to interrogate gas-phase species exhibiting key
phenomena that permeate molecular science, including hydrogen bonding, proton
transfer, and optical activity. Building on the unique capabilities of nonlinear
optical spectroscopy, Prof. Vaccaro and his research group explore vibrationally
mediated proton transfer in tropolone and related species, with extensions of
such studies to weakly bind adducts allowing cooperative aspects of multiple
proton-transfer reactions to be examined. Ultrasensitive chiroptical techniques
based upon cavity ring-down polarimitry are used to interrogate the dispersive
(circular birefringence) and absorptive (circular dichroism) components of
natural optical activity in rarefied media, thereby elucidating the role of
solvation, conformation, and vibration on intrinsic chiroptical response. The
latter work has provided a number of important and non-intuitive insights, while
also serving to assess computational predictions for the optical properties of
chiral molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen bonding and proton
transfer are ubiquitous in nature, responsible for mediating the structure and
dynamics of diverse systems ranging from liquid water to in vivo biomolecules.
Besides impacting broad realms of chemical research, participating students are
trained in a multidisciplinary environment that emphasizes contemporary methods
of molecular spectroscopy and related aspects of optical/laser technology,
thereby preparing them to enter the modern technical workforce. Since his
research group historically has been primarily female in character, Prof.
Vaccaro also is contributing to increasing the number of career scientist drawn
from this particular underrepresented group.
