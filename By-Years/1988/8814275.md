Economic revitalization continues to be a national concern and considerable
federal and state resources are being channeled to deal with this issue. While
much of the research aimed at this effort is in technology development, there is
a significant need for methods and techniques for implementing technology. This
is true for both production and service system operations. The proposed workshop
is an attempt to call upon the industrial engineering community to develop a
research agenda for future needs in the field. The participants are well known
and highly respected professionals that should have the research experience and
insight to formulate the necessary avenues of investigation that will parallel
the societal needs and the intellectual core development for the industrial
engineering profession as well. The workshop is to be joint funded with the
Computer Integrated Engineering Program in DMCE. An award is highly recommended.
