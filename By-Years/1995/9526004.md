This research focuses on developing the scientific foundation and implementing
practical tools for optimizing and synthesizing rule-based expert systems to
meet specified response time constraints. Real-time rule-based expert systems
are embedded artificial intelligence systems increasingly used in safety-
critical applications such as airplane avionics, medical monitoring instruments,
smart robots, and space vehicles. In addition to functional correctness, these
systems must also satisfy stringent timing constraints. The result of missing a
deadline in these systems may be catastrophic. If a given rule-based system
cannot deliver an adequate performance in bounded time, then it has to be
optimized or resynthesized. The first part of the project investigates several
approaches (state-space-based and semantics-based) for optimizing the rule base
of expert systems. The second part of the project investigates the optimization
of the match phase, which has a highly unpredictable runtime. The development of
a systematic methodology to tackle the optimization problem opens up new avenues
to further enhance the runtime performance of rule-based systems in time-
critical environments. This technology will play a key role in tomorrow's
complex information and computing systems such as multimedia tools, virtual
reality systems, smart robots, and high-bandwidth networks, where an intelligent
interface is essential and time becomes an increasingly critical resource.
