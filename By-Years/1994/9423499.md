9423499 Malek Description: This is a planning visit award to allow Dr. R.I.
Malek of the Pennsylvania State University's Materials Research laboratory to
interact with Dr. H. Ghorab at Helwan University and Dr. A. Abdelalim at Zagazig
University in Egypt. The object of the interaction is the search for substitute
raw materials for cement and concrete. The two sides expect to develop a
cooperative research project with the objectives of utilizing industrial by-
products and wastes as partial substitutes for cement, and establishing new
concrete mix designs to accommodate the new materials. ***
