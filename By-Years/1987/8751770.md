The Iowa Middle School Science Project is a cooperative project involving the
fifteen Iowa Area Education agencies and faculty members from Cornell College,
Coe College, the University of Iowa, and the University of Northern Iowa. Ninety
teachers (thirty each year one from at least three different grade levels)
representing the school districts of the fifteen Area Educational Agencies (AEA)
will participate in a six week summer institute held at Coe College in Cedar
Rapids. During the academic year, regional AEA sites will host at least two, 2
day follow-up meetings to support the participants. Each of the three years
basically duplicates the first year with one additional feature. Participants
from the preceding year will return for one week to extend their work and to
interact with the incoming participants. Science concepts from physics,
chemistry, earth science, and biology will be presented. The pedogogical
components include an emphasis on the Learning Cycle Model as well as including
misconception research and Cooperative Learning approaches into teaching
science. The participants will form a Science Cadre which will design and
arrange workshops for the non-participating teachers in each of the Area
Education Agencies. Local District Inservice Programs will be held 4-5 times in
each of the 15 agencies. The district inservice activities will be conducted by
the project staff and capable AEA Cadre members. All participants will
participate in the Project Bulletin Board, which is the proposed state node for
the National Computer Network for Science Education currently being funded by
the National Science Foundation (NSF). The projects allowed a large number of
teachers to be involved in a state-wide inservice program. It demonstrates that
a cooperative endeavor across district lines is a viable approach to developing
programs. The Area Education Agencies and the State of Iowa Department of
Education have contributed an amount equal to 34% of the NSF award.
