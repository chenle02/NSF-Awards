Synergy 2004: A Prismatic View of IT Program Reform is a workshop developed by
Nashville State Community College in collaboration with the University of
Arkansas/ Fort Smith and other ATE Centers to be held in August, 2004.
Information technology (IT) has become a foundation for all work. Educational
programs in IT have made great strides in teaching new technologies, but methods
for structuring the learning environment have not changed. Research in teaching
and learning has provided knowledge to educate workers with the "adaptive
expertise" needed in the workplace, now and in the future. The workshop, based
on the experience of some IT projects, brings together all of the components
necessary to help teams of educators and administrators from across the nation
develop and implement regional plans for reforming IT education. The evaluation
determines the impact and effectiveness of the implementation and guides similar
workshops for the future.
