This project involves the balloon borne measurement of ozone profiles and
aerosols in the Arctic by proven University of Wyoming payloads. A type of new
payloads will be developed to detect and measure the physical size and presence
of polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles. In addition humidity and
differential long wave infrared heat flux will be measured from balloons.
Temperature profiles will be obtained on all of these flights. The project will
be carried out from Alert, NWT in conjunction with Atmospheric Environmental
Service of Canada (AES). The PSC's and aerosols are believed to play an
important role in the annual ozone depletion which occurs over Antarctica, and
it is of great importance to determine if the same effects are beginning to
occur over the Arctic. As a consequence, this project is of the highest
priority. The University of Wyoming group is the world's leader in the
measurement of stratospheric aerosols and the facilities and experience are
unparalleled.
