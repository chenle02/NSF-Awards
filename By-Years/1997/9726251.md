Software tools are defined as abstract tools that can be programmed to vector
field systems to perform a desired task, such as centering, rotating and
filtering field configurations. Hardware tools are defined as generic objects
that can interact with other objects being manipulated by the vector field
system, in manners that are suitable for mechanical assembly operations.
Examples of hardware tools include grippers, sliders, compliant fixtures, etc.
These tools can be viewed as basic building blocks of micro-assembly
manipulation tasks, that together define an API for the development and
specification of micro manipulation strategies in a modular way, using a "high
level language". This research will investigate utility tools on both sensorles
and sensor-based frameworks. Path planning in a compliant accommodating vector
force field system will also be investigated.
