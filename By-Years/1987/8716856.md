The proposed study integrates the paleoceanography and paleoproductivity of the
eastern equatorial Pacific, using microfossil (foraminifera and radiolaria),
geochemical (calcium carbonate, opal, and organic carbon), and isotopic (oxygen
and carbon) indicators. Emphasis will be on (1) quantifying spacial
paleoceanographic changes in the late Quaternary, (2) establishing relationships
between paleoproductivity and paleo- circulation, and (3) assessing the
contributions of productivity and preservation to the sediment record. This
study will greatly extend our knowledge of how the equatorial Pacific Ocean
responded to glacial/interglacial climatic changes and will provide a regional
study necessary to drilling in the eastern equatorial Pacific by the Ocean
Drilling Project.
