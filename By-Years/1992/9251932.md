The project focuses on re-structuring the laboratories in Field Natural
History, a sophomore-level course for both majors and non-majors, around the
production of natural history videos. Using high-quality 8mm camcorders, pairs
of students will tape footage on a topic of their choice (e.g., spider web
architecture or acorn foraging by squirrels and jays). In addition to standard
filming in the field, they will have the ability to incorporate videomicroscopy,
time lapse, and slow motion footage. The students will do the library research
necessary to produce a tight outline and intelligent script. They will then use
a professional editing system to turn their raw footage into a narrated
documentary of 10-20 minutes length. The course will end with a film festival,
open to the College community.This project will reinforce young women's
excitement about science, and build confidence in their ability to work
independently, think originally, and value their own observations.
