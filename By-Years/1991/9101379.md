With the increases in microprocessor performance and memory capacity that have
occurred during the past five years, one of the major difference between high
performance supercomputers and the "killer micros" is I/O performance. The
primary objective of this investigation is to increase the performance of the
I/O subsystem by increasing disk cache performance. The first task considered is
to characterize the load presented to a disk controller by analyzing I/O
performance. The traces will be collected by instrumenting the device driver for
the disk controller. Trace entries will be timestamped so a dynamic view of the
system load can be obtained. The second task in the investigation is to use
trace-driven simulation to investigate the performance of various disk cache
architectures. A major goal of this task is to find ways of exploiting the
position dependent nature of disk access latency. Thus, the project will focus
on using cache policies that utilize knowledge of the disk's state.
