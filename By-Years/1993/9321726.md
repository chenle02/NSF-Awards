9321726 Rigby Despite more than 80 years of research on the renowned Permian
"reef" complex of the Delaware Basin (New Mexico/West Texas), there have been no
detailed studies of the very abundant sponges in this bioherm. PIs will a)
identify and describe the sponges to species level and interpret their
phylogenetic significance; 2) assess the biostratigraphic value of these species
and evaluate effects of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction on this group of
sponges; 3) address paleobiogeographic issues with respect to these sponges; and
4) conduct a paleoecologic analysis of the algal-sponge community.
