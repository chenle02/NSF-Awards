After a disaster, such as an earthquake, inspectors are tasked with assessing
the integrity of affected buildings and structures. Depending on the scale of
the disaster, the number of required inspections can range into the thousands.
There are both public safety and economic pressures to consider, and so rapid
and accurate assessments of buildings and structures are vital. The goal of this
research project is to develop a method using digital image analysis and
artificial intelligence to assess the integrity of civil structures after a
natural disaster. Fully realized, this technology will enable post-disaster
inspectors to rapidly and accurately estimate structural damage using only a
digital camera and portable computer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in a
comprehensive method of computer vision-based structural assessment will be
pursued, one that is flexible enough to operate in highly varied and challenging
field environments. To be truly comprehensive, such a methodology must be
hierarchical, first recognizing the system-level context of structural
components observed in an image and then leveraging that information to augment
localized descriptions of damage extracted from segmentation routines. In this
research program, the visual and instrumentation records of NEES experiments,
available through the NEESHub, will be mined and analyzed to validate the
algorithm. The research program will advance understanding as to how visually
observable damage correlates to structural performance, and will provide
insights into the suitability of hierarchical learning techniques for use in the
field of computer vision-based structural assessment. More broadly, the project
will result in an extensible method of visual, non-contact structural assessment
that will provide a foundation for future structural monitoring system.
