9624619 Edwards This career development plan contains both research and
education activities. The objective of the research is to develop an analysis of
cell volume response to osmotic stress conditions that include unsteady-state
intracellular transport, dependence of intracellular transport phenomena on the
gel structure of cytoskeletal proteins and on the occlusions posed by internal
organelles, and absorption of solutes onto external and internal membranes and
partitioning into organelles. The primary anticipated application is
cryopreservation of human, animal and plant cells. The rationale is that
increased understanding will improve the predictive capability and design of
appropriate freeze-thaw cycles. The goal of the educational plan is incorporate
knowledge of mass transfer fundamentals, including new applications, into
undergraduate and graduate curricula. Also, a textbook on Mass Transport in
Biology is planned. ***
