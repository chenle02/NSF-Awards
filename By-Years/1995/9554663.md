Faculty at the University of Southern Mississippi will conduct a series of
workshops with mathematics faculty from two-year colleges who teach pre-service
teachers. Coordination between faculty at two- and four-year institutions is
critical, as an increasing number of students in pre-service teacher preparation
programs at the university level transfer from two-year schools. The workshops
will provide access to experiences with current approaches to mathematics
content and pedagogical activities called for by the NCTM Standards. This
project will provide participants with the material and support necessary to
successfully incorporate the workshop topics into their present curricula, and
to develop the capability of all participants to serve as leaders in their home
institutions. Furthermore, participants will share their approaches to
incorporating project topics into the curricula through publications and
presentations at professional meetings.
