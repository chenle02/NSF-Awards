This planning grant is concerned with the development of culturally relevant
mathematics and science curriculum for Native Americans. The project involves
two trips to gather information for the development of a full research proposal.
The investigators are to take two Native American students to the University of
Illinois to study techniques developed in the Calculus/Mathematica Project. The
ultimate goal of this project is the determination of methods for making
educational software and, in general, the traditional mathematics and science
curriculum more relevant for Native Americans. This grant also funds travel by
the principal investigators to the Mathematics and Educational Reform Workshop
to be held at the University of Arizona, March 21-24, 1991. This project
represents a significant step in terms of attracting and retaining Native
Americans in the science and engineering pipeline. Often Native American tribal
customs prevent young children from learning mathematics and science in the
traditional Western manner. The focus of this project is to find methods for
introducing cultural relevance into educational software for Native Americans.
It is recognized that there is a vast variety of Native American tribes and
customs. This project focuses on the Lummi tribe with a view towards methods for
extending the techniques for other tribes.
