The primary aim of the project is to explore connections between theories
describing two different fundamental forces, namely, the nuclear force and
gravity. The strong and weak nuclear forces are described by gauge theories,
whereas quantum gravity is thought to be described by string theory. String
theory, however, contains not only strings but also D-branes, extended objects
whose properties involve supersymmetric gauge theories, thus providing the
connection between the two types of theory. Specifically, the project focuses on
the properties of particular string theories containing D-branes and orientifold
planes; in these theories, the supersymmetric gauge theories describing the
D-branes include the analogs of quarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interest of
this line of research is that questions impossible to answer in one theory may
be easy to answer using the other theory, and vice versa, allowing progress to
be made in both. For example, well-understood properties of gauge theory could
lead to a better understanding of string theory, and thus quantum gravity, which
has long been an unsolved problem. Conversely, string theory could be used to
probe gauge theories in the poorly understood strong-coupling regime.
Ultimately, this could explain the phenomenon of quark confinement (that is, the
fact that free quarks cannot be observed) and yield a quantitative understanding
of the structure of protons, nuclei, etc., in terms of the properties of their
constituent quarks.
