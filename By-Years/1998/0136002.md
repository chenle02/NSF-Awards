Basic discoveries and innovations in manufacturing methods and processes will be
needed to achieve the full impact of nano-technology. The multidisciplinary
experts from the United States and the European Community gathered for this
workshop will advise NSF on research needs for the future and develop a joint
agenda for US/EC cooperation in nano-manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
2002 NSF-EC Nanomufacturing and Processing Workshop will be held January 5-7,
2002 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The workshop will be held immediately before the
2002 NSF Design, Service, and Manufacturing Grantees and Research Conference, so
in addition to reporting the workshop results by publications, the findings will
be immediately reported to the research community at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;
