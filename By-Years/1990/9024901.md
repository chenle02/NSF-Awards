The two investigators on this project will work on various problems in
approximation theory and in the theory of orthogonal polynomials. Professor
Nevai will concentrate on ordinary and generalized polynomial inequalities,
difference and differential equations, spectral theory of tradiagonal and banded
matrices, Toeplitz and Hankel forms, Hilbert space operators and Jacobi
matrices. In addition to this analytical work Professor Nevai will continue to
develop software for orthogonal polynomials. Professor Erdelyi will work on
extremal properties of ordinary and generalized polynomials and on various types
of polynomial inequalities that figure prominently in approximation theory. The
investigators will work independently of each other on some problems and
collaboratively on others, their talents complementing each other.
