This award supports a research conference on the critical but ill understood
process of how organizations learn and adapt and why some organizations are
gripped by inertial seemingly unable to learn and change. Insights into
organizational learning will influence theoretical developments about
organizations in several disciplines concerned with the analysis of
organizations. It will also have important implications for designing innovation
and self renewal processes in organizations (in particular where fast learning
is required for survival such as in the semi-conductor industry). The resulting
volume of papers will be dedicated to honoring the contributions of James G.
March to the field of organization theory and organizational decision making.
