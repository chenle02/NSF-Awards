Metal-plate connections are widely used in light-frame residential and
commercial wood truss assemblies. An investigation in to the static and dynamic
behavior of these connections has become an urgent problem in view of the great
damage to wood structures, mobile homes and prefabricated houses subjected to
hurricanes and extreme wind conditions. This investigation will determine the
limits of design for safe construction of wood structures.
