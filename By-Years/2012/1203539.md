The PIs propose to use 4 state-of-the-art coupled climate models participating
in the&lt;br/&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th and 5th
Assessment Reports in a consistent framework to investigate several outstanding
issues related to the seasonal atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss
including: model sensitivity to identical prescriptions of Arctic sea ice loss;
the relative roles of late summer/early autumn vs. winter sea ice retreat; and
the mediating influences of troposphere-stratosphere coupling and terrestrial
snow cover. By using the same experimental design in all 4 models, they
anticipate being able to assess the robustness of the seasonal atmospheric and
surface climate response as well as identify the underlying physical
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Policy and management responses to scenarios of
future climate change will be informed by many sources, including models. It is
known that some aspects of model output are robust between models and others are
less so. The partnership between university, government, and international
scientists contributing to this study will assess the robustness and uncertainty
of models with respect to various polar processes.
