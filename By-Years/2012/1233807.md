The research objective of this collaborative Advancing Health Services through
System Modeling Research project is to establish an analytical framework for
modeling the rapid response process in acute care delivery and using this
framework to improve the efficacy of rapid response operations and patient
safety. Specifically, it will develop analytical methods for performance
evaluation, bottleneck identification, and optimal workforce configuration and
response activation protocols. The approach of this research is based on
analytical investigation of the stochastic processes that describe the rapid
response operations which are modeled as complex networks with split, merge and
parallel structures. The challenge of this research is in developing effective
methods to deal with the complexity of system modeling, analysis, improvement,
and optimization based on the collected data.

If successful, the results of this research will be a novel analytical method to
study patient care and safety in acute care delivery, and to provide insights
for improving the efficacy of rapid response operations. It will enable us to
uncover the fundamental principles governing care delivery processes and utilize
them for analysis, continuous improvement, and design to improve patient safety
and care quality. This research will provide hospital leadership and healthcare
professionals with a quantitative tool for improving rapid response operations.
It will not only be vital for acute care, but also useful to other hospital
divisions and the entire American healthcare industry, and is transformable to
other systems, such as civil emergency response systems, critical supply chains,
and information networks.
