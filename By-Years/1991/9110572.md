This project studies how individuals actually make decisions under uncertainty.
Respondents will state cash equivalences for prospects defined over events. The
project will then empirically validate recent axiomatic models of decision
making which allow the separation of attitudes about consequences from attitudes
about risk and uncertainty and which are defined over events that do not
necessarily have a well-defined additive probability measure. The proposed
research seeks to characterize risk attitudes as a function of the events(the
weighting function) rather than the traditional view of characterizing risk
attitudes as a function of the utility curve. Seven studies are proposed to
understand people's attitudes about risk and uncertainty. The main focus of the
studies will be to characterize properties of the weighting function and
understand the relationship between the source of the uncertainty and the shape
of the weighting function (i.e., source dependence.) Supplementing the empirical
work will be a study of additional constraints, or axioms, needed to specify
functional forms for the weighting function.
