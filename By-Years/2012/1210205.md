This action funds Michael Jong Lee of the University of Washington to conduct a
research project, entitled "Effect of game elements on learning for novice
programmers," during the summer of 2012 at Yonsei University in Seoul, South
Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Jinwoo Kim.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in identifying how certain
game elements affect learning outcomes in a programming computer game, creating
better ways to incorporate or disguise tests within the game levels to reduce
the stress of test-taking, and to provide better understanding of how different
testing approaches to measure learning affects novice programmers. Outcomes may
allow access to computer programming training to individuals or groups that are
interested in programming who but do not have the resources to take a course,
increase or maintain people's interest in science and technology by providing a
low-barrier introduction into programming, and result in designs for educational
software to evaluate player learning, and dispel the negative view of online
games by demonstrating positive learning outcomes.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
