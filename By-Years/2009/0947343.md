Abstract: This proposal focuses on extending and codifying the methods and
techniques for the evaluation of visual analytics. It is primarily based on
benchmarking the Visual Analytics Challenge 2010 (organized through the IEEE
Visual Analytics Science and Technology ? known as VAST- symposium
contest/challenge) as a test bed to generalize user-centered evaluation to
assess the effectiveness of interactive systems that combine analytical
reasoning, visual representations, Human Computer Interactions (HCI), complex
algorithms, and collaboration tools. At present, there are no standard methods
for measuring the performance of interactive visual analytics systems as a
whole. Visual analysis systems are not well suited for traditional evaluation
methods. For example, simple methods such as precision and recall are not
suitable and researchers rarely have had sufficient access to historical data
sets with the complexity of the analytical problems that exist across wider,
real-time domains. The means of approach to executing this project encompasses
three activities: 1) gathering diverse collation of datasets with associated
ground truth/problem descriptions, 2) developing automatic metrics and
subjective evaluation criteria to assess judgment, and 3) the investigation of
the effectiveness and utility of these methods and lessons learned for re-use in
other dynamic fields such as business, intelligence, medicine, emergency
response, etc.
