This starter grant award to the University of Tennessee will support the
research of Professor Robert J. Hinde. The theme of the research is
computational studies of hydrogen chloride adsorption on water clusters. The
project employs molecular dynamics computer simulation techniques to study the
atomic-scale dynamical processes involved in the adsorption of HCl molecules at
the surface of small water clusters. This system represents a model for the
adsorption of HCl molecules at the surface of macroscopic ice particles, such as
those found in polar stratospheric clouds. In contrast to earlier theoretical
work, this project models both the water and HCl molecules in a way that permits
the molecules to dissociate into their component ions. Adsorption of HCl on
polar stratospheric cloud particles is a key first step in the chain of events
leading to depletion of stratospheric ozone above Antartica. This research will
provide a better understanding of the rate and mechanism of the initial step in
the ozone depletion cycle.
