9304984 Kieffer Multiresolution techniques for image compression shall be
investigated as well as the problem of finding algorithms for compressing text
that outperform text compression algorithms which are based upon finite-state
automata. Efficiency questions concerning universal codes shall be addressed, as
well as the use of universal codes in model class identification and statistical
parameter estimation. In computational information theory fast algorithms shall
be sought for finding successive approximations to entropy rates, channel
capacities, and rate distortion functions; also, cellular automata and other
automata shall be sought for the fast performance of encoding and decoding
tasks. ***
