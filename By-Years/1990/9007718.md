This investigation will continue the study of cellular control systems and
delay differential equations. There are three main areas of study. The first
area is an interdisciplinary study done in collaboration with Dr. J. W. Zyskind
on the modeling of initiation of replication in Escherichia coli, Mathematical
models are developed to aid in our understanding of experimental observations on
initiation of DNA replication. The second project uses analytical and numerical
methods to study the effects of size and compartmentalization on the stability
of cellular control models with diffusion and delays. Dynamic growth models are
developed and compared to experimental data. The third area explores the
stability of a linear differential equation with two delays using analytical and
numerical methods. Bifurcation surfaces are found, and methods are investigated
to connect their geometries to analytical results. The first two projects link
mathematical studies to current biological problems. All three problems require
the development of new techniques of analysis that can be applied to many
modeling problems.
