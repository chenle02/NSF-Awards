Numerous theories for continuous elastic and elastic-plastic bodies are known to
give acceptable results for many practical problems. While the search for better
theories of nonlinear and inelastic behavior continues, the search also
continues for methods of discrete approximations which provide accurate,
reliable and economical means to utilize existing theories and computational
facilities. The research will focus on the behavior and inherent difficulties in
the simple triangular and quadrilateral elements, in particular, excessive
stiffnesses associated with transverse shear deformations. The Hu-Washizu
theorem will be employed as a tool to gain insights, to trace the origins of the
stiffnesses and to provide rational bases for an effective "flat" element. The
study will also explore rational means to implement discrete (Kirchhoff)
constraints against transverse shear.
