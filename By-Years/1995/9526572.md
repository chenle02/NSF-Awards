This award is for support for a program of measurements to improve our
understanding of the relationship between formaldehyde (HCHO) and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) in the atmosphere and the concentrations of the same species in
Antarctic snow, firn and ice. This work aims to relate changes in concentrations
in the snow, firn and ice to corresponding changes in tropospheric chemistry.
Atmospheric and firn sampling for formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide at one or
more of the WAIS ice core drilling sites will be undertaken and controlled
laboratory studies to estimate thermodynamic and rate parameters will be
performed. In addition, this work will involve modeling of atmosphere-snow
exchange processes to infer the "transfer function" for reactive species at the
sites and atmospheric photochemical modeling to relate changes in concentrations
of formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide in snow, firn and ice to atmospheric
oxidation capacity. This work will contribute to a better understanding of the
relationship between atmospheric concentrations of various species and those
same species measured in snow and ice samples.
