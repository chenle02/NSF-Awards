This project will develop a 2D hybrid plasma simulation model to conduct
simulations of the propagation of whistler/chorus waves in the radiation belt
region and their interactions with energetic electrons. Wave propagation will be
modeled in a dipole magnetic field with cross-field density gradients, which
will make it possible to study phenomena such as wave ducting. The investigation
will address nonlinear wave-particle interaction of whistler waves and energetic
electrons and the processes that can generate waves with large amplitudes.

These waves play a critical role in the energizaton of particles in Earth's
radiation belts. The energization of particles in the radiation belts play an
important role in space weather processes that can affect satellites. The
project may also lead to new understanding of methods for radiation-belt
remediation. The project will develop new computer codes that may have the
potnetial to provide transformative techniques for dealing with space plasmas.
Much of the reseach and code development will be carried out by a graduate
student and the project therefore has strong educational benefits.
