Dr. Jie Qing proposes to study various problems in conformal geometry and
related partial differential equations. Recent development in the study of the
scattering matrix in providing rather global way to understand the holography
principle in physics seems very fascinating and promising. Dr. Jie Qing proposes
in this project to investigate several aspects of mathematical foundations of
the holography principle, particularly the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence. Dr.
Jie Qing also proposes to continue his study of several geometric problems
arising from the mathematics of general relativity. The intellectual merit of
this proposal is that consequences of these investigations will give better
understanding of geometric structure of manifolds of low dimensions.

The proposed research is to study the holography principles that relate quantum
gravitation theory and some conformal field theory. It has become a part the
field where mathematicians and physicists can interact. One broader impact of
this proposal is that advancements in this field of research will greatly
improve our understanding of the nature in theory. The proposed research project
incorporates research activities as a part of the undergraduate and graduate
education programs in the department of mathematics at UC Santa Cruz.
