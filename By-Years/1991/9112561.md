Many theories have been put forward to account for the collapse of the Maya
civilization approximately 1,000 years ago. Some hypothesized that continuously
shifting political forces led to instability and ecological disruption. Through
the analysis of skeletal material, this research proposes to test implications
of the politico-ecological hypothesis. Chemical analysis of skeletal remains can
yield information on dietary factors through the characterization of carbon and
nitrogen isotopes. Dietary inadequacies and general state of health also marks
the remains through the appearance of paleopathological indicators. Demographics
can be estimated through the determination of age at death and sex from skeletal
remains. The hypothesis makes specific predictions as to the diet,health and
demography of the Maya just prior to the collapse. The research allows these
predictions to be tested.
