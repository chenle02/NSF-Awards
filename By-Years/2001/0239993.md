EIA- 0239993&lt;br/&gt; H.V. Jagadish&lt;br/&gt;University of
Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Workshop on Data Management Technology for
Molecular and Cell Biology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop, to be held in
February 2003, will define a research agenda for data management technology in
support of bioinformatics applications. Specifically, it will be supporting
basic and applied research in molecular and cell biology, genomics, functional
genomics, structural biology, biochemistry, genetics, molecular phylogeny,
pharmacology, pharmcogenomics, chemoinformatics, systems biology of the cell,
and industrial microbiology. This workshop aims to look into novel approaches of
database management to fit the needs of bioinformatics research applications,
rather than continue to support conventional database technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will include substantial participation from
bioinformatics researchers and developers, and biological and pharmaceutical
researchers. Workshop topics will include but are not limited to the following:
data integration: terminology management, seamless access, decision support;
sequence data, shape data, graph and tree data, array and matrix data;
similarity queries, pattern matching queries, recursive and graph queries; and
workflow and experiment management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
