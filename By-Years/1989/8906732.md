This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will enable purchase of a replacement
high-power argon ion laser for use by the quantum electronics group at Berkeley
(headed by professor Whinnery, Wang, Gustafson and Smith). Current research uses
include pumping a colliding-pulse-modelocking (CPM) femtosecond laser system,
pumping a dye laser head for generation of a tunable probe beam for making
direct measurements of gain coupling of modes in a semiconductor laser, and
measurement of the performance of photorefractive crystals in a context of an
optical neural network. Several experiments centered around the high power argon
ion laser utilize the femtosecond pulse facility. Passively modelocked CPM
lasers which are pumped with CW argon ion lasers achieve the shortest optical
pulses demonstrated to date, however, low jitter timing synchronication with
optical and/or electrical devices is difficult. The Berkeley group has developed
a mechanism using a pulsed optical phaselock loop that utilizes a gain switched
semiconductor laser which is cross correlated with the femtosecond pulse train
at its leading edge, resulting in a time jitter of only 50 femtoseconds. This
unique pulsed optical phase lock loop (POPLL) is at the heart of a subpicosecond
optical sampling system. It is currently being used to measure and model
picosecond optical devices, and to look at stimulus and probe experiment in
quantum wells where the stimulus is provided by a synchronous microwave signal.
