This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has several goals. First,
together with M. Batanin and D.Tamarkin, the P.I. is going to prove the Deligne
conjecture for Hochschild chains. Second, together with D. Tamarkin and B.
Tsygan, the P.I. is going to prove the formality of the operad of little discs
on a cylinder. Third, together with D. Tamarkin and B. Tsygan, the P.I. is going
to show that the operad of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras and the operad of calculi
are Koszul. Finally, the P.I. is going to investigate the homotopy associative
algebra structure on the Hochschild cochain complex corresponding to the
homotopy Gerstenhaber algebra structure on this
complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Higher algebraic structures, such as homotopy
algebras or higher operads, or higher categories, play a prominent role in
modern mathematics. The investigation of these structures is motivated by
various questions from algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and mathematical
physics. The Deligne conjecture for Hochschild chains and the formality
conjecture for the operad of little discs on a cylinder are the two remaining
strongholds of the Tamarkin-Tsygan program which was outlined by D.Tamarkin in
2000 at the Moshe Flato memorial conference. Despite the efforts of various
people these conjectures are still open. Together with joint recent results of
the P.I. with D.Tamarkin and B. Tsygan the proofs of these conjectures would
complete this program. The proposed research involves rather elaborate
techniques from different areas of mathematics and the results would also
influence various traditional fields of investigation. The proposed research has
applications to deformation quantization which underpins the mathematics of
quantum physics.
