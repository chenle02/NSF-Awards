Mathematical Investigation of Nonlinear Free Boundary Problems in Stokes Flow

Investigators: Michael Brenner and Darren Crowdy

PROJECT SUMMARY

This proposal outlines a mathematical investigation of a class of free boundary
problems for slow viscous (Stokes) fluid regions in both two and three
dimensions. The proposal is motivated by recent results on a remarkable
mathematical structure underlying a fundamental problem in the study of two-
dimensional Stokes flow. Crowdy and Tanveer have devised a new global
theoretical approach to the problem of 2D Stokes flow which resulted in the
identification of an infinity of conserved quantities associated with a large
class of exact solutions for a simply-connected fluid region, and the discovery
of the first-known exact solutions for doubly-connected fluid regions. These
significant mathematical results will be developed in various directions. Of
primary interest is the important and highly non-trivial question of
generalization to three-dimensional Stokes flow. Preliminary numerical studies
by Nie and Tanveer have shown that axisymmetric (3D) Stokes bubble exhibits very
similar qualitative behavior to its two-dimensional analogue (e.g. formation of
near-cusps and topological changes). The results on two-dimensional Stokes flow
will be generalized in various directions. Exact solutions in regions of
connectivity greater than two is of great interest. Moreover, additional
physical factors will be studied including electrostatic (electric fields) and
thermo-capillary effects.

The mathematical problems to be studied are of great physical interest and
application. The solutions serve as useful models in the physical process of
viscous sintering. Sintering is a term broadly referring to the consolidation of
an assemblage of particles in which the mass transport is driven by surface
tension and there exists a huge literature on the subject spanning many
disciplines from materials science to environmental engineering. Understanding
such sintering processes is very important, for example, in fiber-optic and
opto-electronic technologies. The study of the boundary evolution of small blobs
of viscous fluid in the presence of an electric field is crucial for the
understanding of ink-jet printing technologies. The project also has potential
biotechnological relevance -- cells structures and membranes are often modelled
as (charged) blobs of very viscous fluid kept together by surface tension forces
on the boundary. This project will provide an understanding of the mathematics
underlying these important physical models.
