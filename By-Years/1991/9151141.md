The Science and Mathematics department of Holmes Community College is improving
its astronomy laboratory curriculum by acquiring instrumentation which will
allow students to collect scientifically valuable data. The department is using
a 14- inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, photometer, CCD imaging camera, video
camera and conventional photography equipment. In addition, a planetarium and
computers are being used for preparation for outdoor observations. The
photometer is used to determine the lightcurves of variable stars. The
astrometric capabilities of the CCD imaging camera allow students to determine
the angular separation between objects. Students can also use the CCD imaging
camera to plot the movement of objects (such as comets and asteroids) relative
to the stars. The CCD camera also has photometric capability and allows students
to measure changes in the brightness and structure of comets. The video camera
is used to record and time occultations. The video camera also makes the
telescope more accessible to visually and physically handicapped students. The
college is housing the instruments in an existing domed observatory.The
instruments allow students to participate in the entire scientific process, from
the development of an observing program to the reduction and analysis of data.
The department plans its observing programs in association with several amateur
astronomical societies to which students may submit data and publications.
