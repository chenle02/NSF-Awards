Steroid hormones are useful tools for studying the control of gene expression in
eukaryotic organisms. Ecdysone is the steroid molting hormone in insects which
helps to regulate the developmental changes that occur during the insect's life
cycle. A gene from Drosophila, E74 which responds to ecdysone in a primary
manner and which is believed to regulate the expression of other genes has been
isolated. How this gene is regulated by ecdysone and how the product of this
gene, in turn, regulates other genes are the goals of this research project.
Sequences from putative regulatory regions of this gene isolated from several
Drosophila species will be compared and conserved regions identified.
Understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this gene by ecdysone
and, in turn, the mechanism(s) where by the product of this gene regulates other
genes are admirable goals. While it is unlikely that a full understanding of
these mechanisms will result from this project to be carried out at an
undergraduate institution, many undergraduates will be introduced to a high
level of basic research and some factual information relevant to the stated
goals should be obtained.***//
