Proposal ID: AST-0243837 PI: Mac Low, Mordecai-Mark Institution: American Museum
of Natural History

The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York city will establish an
REU site for earth and planetary sciences and astrophysics. The Museum's
Division of Physical Sciences, which contains the research departments of Earth
and Planetary Sciences (EPS) and Astrophysics, will supervise undergraduate
students in experimental, observational, theoretical, and computational projects
at the recently completed Rose Center for Earth and Space at AMNH. This REU site
will collaborate with the long-standing REU program in biological sciences at
AMNH. In addition to their research projects in EPS and astrophysics, the
student participants will gain exposure to research techniques and philosophies
in fields such as paleontology, genetics, and evolutionary biology, through
jointly run orientation meetings, in-house workshops, biweekly informal
discussions, and joint seminars. This twelve week program will host six students
annually. The students will report on their work at the end of the summer, both
in a written scientific paper and a 15-minute oral presentation in a
multidisciplinary scientific symposium.
