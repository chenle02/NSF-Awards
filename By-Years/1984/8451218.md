An investigation of robot motion planning will be expanded using configuration
space. Current planning methods do not take into account the possibility of
gross errors in the environment model, such as unmodeled obstacles or surface
defects. These kinds of problems are quite common outside of well-controlled
environments such as laboratories and factories. The challenge is to detect the
error as early as possible and to undertake corrective action without requiring
complete re-planning. Further, this approach will be extended to planning to
deal with multiple moving objects whose motions are not completely known in
advance. The idea is to be able to guarantee that there exists a plan that
achieves the goal as long as the other objects move within their expected
bounds. Both of these extensions will build on the basic idea that to plan ahead
one does not need to know the state of the environment exactly.
