The project addresses a major challenge facing STEM education: the ability for
underprepared ninth graders to succeed in Algebra 1 courses. While many urban
districts are utilizing extended-time Algebra I classes, most do not have a
coherent, carefully-integrated program that addresses the various needs of
underprepared learners, including the social-emotional, language and literacy,
and organizational aspects of learning. Most districts tether together resources
for extended-time algebra classes, and do not provide professional development
to the teachers of the course, who tend to be younger, less-experienced
teachers. The proposed initiative to scale up Intensified Algebra in urban
districts has the potential to increase high school graduation rates, given the
link of successful completion of Algebra I to high school graduation. It also
has the potential to increase the number of students who pursue STEM related
majors and fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the I-Corp initiative, the team
proposes to create a new advocacy and marketing approach for Intensified Algebra
(IA) to reach large, urban school districts. Innovative content for advocacy
briefings and materials will be developed. The team's goal is to create novel
ways to reach senior leaders in districts (e.g., superintendents, mathematics
curriculum directors). Present marketing approaches for IA concentrate heavily
on the components and design rationale for IA. Initial thoughts on directions
for the new marketing approach include focusing district leaders on a cost-
benefit analysis of intensifying struggling students' mathematics experience in
9th grade to support their success versus 'paying later' via credit-recovery;
and synthesizing and presenting in compelling ways research that supports the
power of intensification efforts (e.g., longer-term benefits of extended-time,
9th grade algebra initiatives, including higher graduation rates and higher
rates of students taking advanced math and science courses; the importance of
non-cognitive factors in helping struggling students succeed, and the ways in
which IA incorporates those in the program; and the importance of affording
struggling students opportunities to learn rich and meaningful mathematics).
