The purpose of this project is the development of theory, statistical
methodology, and computational methods for use in mixture models in high
dimensional data. In the theoretical portion, the investigator enhances the
potential statistical applications of these models by examining their
topographical structure and their relationship to other high-dimensional methods
such as local linear regression and hierarchical trees. New kernel densities are
being constructed by the use of the idea of diffusion processes. New methods to
assess the important aspects of identifiability in these models are under
development. In addition to these basic theoretical developments, the
investigator is creating a set of methods designed to fit diffusion mixture
models, and to assess their fit, in high dimensions. A key part of this
methodological development is occuring in computational enhancements.

The statistics community is faced with a great challenge by modern science, and
that is to develop new tools for scientific inference in the aftermath of the
data revolution. Modern data is potentially high in dimension, and massive in
the number of collected units. The probability models called mixture models have
had a long history of use in describing heterogeneity in data samples. They are
extremely flexible, and provide a compact picture of the key features of the
data structure. Unfortunately, limited theoretical developments in this
difficult area have held back their use in high dimensional problems. This
research project targets a number of the key difficulties remaining in this
area, including the integration of this methodology with other existing ones,
the expansion of this methodology into new data types, and a better
understanding of this model's structure in very high dimensions. The methods
that arise from these developments are being turned into computational packages
so that they can be used by scientists.
