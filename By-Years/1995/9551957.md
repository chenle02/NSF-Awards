This project is designed to introduce all lower-division chemistry students to
the use of computers early in the curricula and continue using them for data
acquisition and analysis as well as for computer assisted instruction (CAI).
Twelve Macintosh SE computers are being removed from the existing department
network and used in the laboratory with Vernier Serial Box Interface kits for
data acquisition. Twelve new Macintosh Quadra 630s are replacing the SEs on the
network. Upgrading the network provides students access to computers powerful
enough to run new statistical software to be used for data analysis and
simulation and to additional Internet services. CAI software is also available
on the network. The success of the project is being measured by student and
instructor evaluations comparing interfaced versus non-interfaced laboratory
exercises and by student and instructor evaluations of the CAI and statistical
software. In addition to publications and conference presentations, the
investigators are holding a series of workshops on computer interfaced
laboratory exercises for local high school and middle school science teachers
and also for at-risk high school students.
