This is an award under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research program. The
immediate objective of the project is to isolate and characterize genes encoding
two enzymes (ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase) that are involved in the first step
in the sulfur assimilation pathway using Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimental
system. The long-term objective is to understand the biology of sulfur in higher
plants. Sulfur is an essential nutrient required by all organisms. Plants and
microorganisms reduce inorganic sulfate to a variety of organic compounds, and
they provide animals with a source of organic sulfur. Animals including humans
require sulfur, yet do not have the ability to convert inorganic sulfur to
organic compounds. The role of sulfur is diverse, including an essential
component of amino acids, some regulatory molecules and lipids. In addition,
plants' ability to metabolize sulfur is potentially significant in ameliorating
sulfur toxicity in the environment. Despite its obvious significance, very
little is known about the sulfur pathway in higher plants, or the mechanisms by
which sulfur mediates important cellular functions. This research may help open
up a new field of research in biology.
