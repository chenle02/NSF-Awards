Interdisciplinary(99) This project brings together science and engineering
faculty to form a specialized program focusing on the timely topic of global
climate change (GCC). In this project first year college students are introduced
to scientific thinking and issues in climate change through community-based
learning projects. Two pressing national needs are addressed in the project: the
need for interdisciplinary education reflecting the implications of global
climate change and the need to develop and retain students in STEM fields. The
project introduces incoming students to scientific thinking regarding global
climate change and the innovative research needed to mitigate problems related
to these changes. In addition, the project facilitates interactions among
students and faculty to develop relationships that increase retention in the
institution and encourage continued interest in STEM fields. This first year
seminar course introduces topics in modular format that enables students'
understanding of the factors affecting climate change and examine the methods
used to measure and address these changes. The project creates a research-
learning community composed of faculty, undergraduate students involved in the
course, and members from the university community as well as local stakeholders.
At the end of the semester, a conference centered on poster presentations is
held where student groups present a more detailed treatment of one of the data
sets collected during the hands on activities. Student teams also contribute to
a common course website to educate the rest of campus on global climate change
issues and solutions.
