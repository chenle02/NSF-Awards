This project is improving the Kirkwood Community College physics curriculum by
emphasizing laboratory experiences that unify content and methodology.
Specifically: 1) laboratory experiences emphasize the time variable as a
unifying concept; 2) laboratory and lecture topics are being more closely
linked; 3) students are using only a few data gathering instruments and data
analysis methods for many experiments throughout the course; and 4) physics data
analysis software is the same as that being used in mathematics and engineering
courses.This improvement in physics laboratories is being accomplished with the
purchase of three IBM computers with velocity, temperature, force transducers,
and real-time interfaces.This project is significant because it provides
conceptual unity, unity in laboratory instrumentation and unity in data analysis
techniques. The instrumentation is facilitating data gathering and analysis so
students are able to concentrate on experimental design, problem-solving and
understanding concepts.
