The goal of this project is to continue and expand an undergraduate research
effort in the Colorado Plateau and Transition Zone of Arizona that will involve
students primarily from Northern Arizona University, but also from other
universities. The research effort will focus upon geological mapping and
environmental sciences. This project will offer students the opportunity to
make, compile, and interpret geological maps within the context of a network of
on-going collaborative research projects funded by the NSF and the U. S.
Geological Survey. Mapping and map compilation will be performed by conventional
techniques and by using computer-assisted mapping facilities. Environmental
sciences undergraduates need field experience to collect data relevant to
environmental problems, and hands-on analytical experience to analyze these
data. Supervision will be supplied by pairing each student with a faculty
supervisor/mentor, but within the departmental research focus on the Colorado
Plateau and Transition Zone. Continuity is important in developing top
researchers; students will be encouraged to start research as juniors (and
occasionally as sophomores and continue throughout their undergraduate program.
