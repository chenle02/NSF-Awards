A high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is a recent
acquisition by the Chemistry Department of Furman University. This instrument,
used for undergraduate instruction, provides experience with the most important
advances in NMR of the past decade: methods for obtaining detailed structural
information (high-field NMR); detailed procedures for elaborating that
information (2-D NMR); and techniques for assessing the motion of molecules
(relaxation measurements). Development of skills in these areas is extremely
important in contemporary chemistry, and they provide the basis for NMR imaging,
the technique expected to complement medical X-rays. This instrument is being
used by students through the entire range of the curriculum from the
instrumental analytical course through its use in undergraduate research.
