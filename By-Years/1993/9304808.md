9304808 Nelson This award will support planning for the second phase of an
international collaborative project to collect deep seismic reflection and
related geophysical and geological data across the Himalaya/Tibet Plateau
collision zone. The pilot phase of this project, termed INDEPTH (INternational
DEep Profiling of Tibet and the Himalaya) was successfully completed last summer
(1992) by a team of U. S. and Chinese scientists operating a Chinese seismic
reflection crew in southern Tibet. The cost of the pilot project was shared by
NSF's Continental Dynamics Program and China's Ministry of Geology and Mineral
Resources. Having demonstrated "proof of concept" with the pilot study, the
principal investigators will proceed with the next phase of INDEPTH data
acquisition during the summer of 1994. In order to do this, however, the need
to: 1. Bring their Science Advisory Team and other potential U.S. and foreign
participants in INDEPTH together to review final analyses of the pilot survey
results, to identify the next profiling site to recommend to their Chinese
colleagues, to design the core seismic experiments and to coordinate the broader
participation by these other groups in INDEPTH. 2. Send a delegation of INDEPTH
scientists to China to negotiate the next phase of INDEPTH data acquisition,
participate in a workshop being held by the Chinese to discuss the joint results
of the pilot study, and most importantly scout the next profiling site in Tibet.
This award will support these critical planning activities. ***
