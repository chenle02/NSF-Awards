The complex interplay between economic and political conditions and the nature
and amount of informal economic activity, such as streetvending, has received
little attention. This doctoral dissertation will examine the relationships
between policies toward street vending, and degrees of economic stability,
political stability, and the level of organization for political action among
the streetvendors themselves. In particular, it will examine the nature of the
conflict between streetvendors, city officials, and economic interest groups
opposed to the presence of street trading in Mexico City, during two time
periods, one of stringent regulation and one of an uneasy truce. Archival
sources, newspaper reports, interviews with current and previous officials and
streetvendor leaders, interviews with streetvendors, and ethnographic fieldwork
in a few selected street market areas will be used to illuminate the process of
the regulation of streetvending in one of the largest, fastest growing, and most
congested cities in the developing world. This project will contribute to social
scientific understanding of the political and economic factors shaping the
construction and enforcement of regulatory policy. This project also will
provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to
develop independent research skills.
