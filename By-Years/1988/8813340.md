The objective of this research is to formulate, design, and evaluate composite
arithmetic algorithms using on-line approach, so that the resulting algorithms
are better suited for VLSI and are more adaptable to the requirements of
application-specific parallel systems for numeric computations. This research
combines theoretical, experimental, and methodological aspects to develop and
adapt algorithms or the basic operations and to combine the basic operations
into more complex functions. Design modules are being developed in VLSI, which
are then incorporated into application-specific systems. The focus is on matrix
computations that are pervasive in signal processing applications. On-line
arithmetic is characterized by (i) digit-serial operations, (ii) the most-
significant-digit-first mode in all operations, (iii) no carry propagation, and
(iv) highly modular organization. Previous research of the principal
investigators have shown that the on-line approach is very promising. The
proposed study relating aspects on algorithm formulation,constraints of VLSI
implementation, and computer architecture is essential to demonstrate the cost-
effectiveness of such an approach. Support is strongly recommended. Support of
two undergraduate students is also recommended under the Research Experience for
Undergraduates program. The undergraduate students benefit by experimenting with
various models of on-line arithmetic and implementing the designs in VLSI.
