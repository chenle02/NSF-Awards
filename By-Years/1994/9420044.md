The PIs will study solar and stellar magnetic cycles and chromospheric activity
using a dedicated fiber-fed spectrograph facility at Lowell Observatory. The
goals of this research will (1) discern the nature and relative importance of
three effects which produce observed solar and stellar variability, i.e., the
long-term activity cycle, rotational modulation, and short-term stochastic
variability; (2) infer the time history of cyclic behavior for a star like the
Sun over its entire lifetime, including information about the statistical
frequency of major departures from "normal" behavior; (3) obtain a broad
perspective on the total ensemble of stellar cycles possible, thus gaining
insight into the nature of stellar dynamos and the effect of stellar magnetism
on the radiative output from the stellar envelope.
