This proposes focuses on the measurement of the time, spatial, and frequency
dependence of light interacting with a sample of ultracold Rb-87 atoms in the
strong localization of light regime. Of particular interest is the time
evolution of light emerging from such a sample, which can reveal suppression of
classical diffusion and the onset of strong localization. Also described is a
method of generating the internal atomic excitation necessary to produce
resonant localized radiation-matter excitations within the dense vapor. The
broader impact involves education, infrastructure and
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
