This pilot project incorporates computer assisted instruction into the
introductory biological sciences courses at a college primarily for women, where
no ethnic group is in the majority. The introduction of computer technology,
including videodisc presentations and simulations, improves lecture and
laboratory information delivery systems, and laboratory experiments incorporate
computer technology in data acquisition, statistical analysis, and graphic
display. Interactive, individualized self-paced learning are available through
the addition of computer software and hardware to the facilities of the
Instructional Media Centers. A new course, Computing for Biologists, teaches
students current applications of computer technology in teaching, learning, and
laboratory research.
