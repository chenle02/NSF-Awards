In this investigation, a comprehensive study will be conducted of iron, nickel,
cobalt and certain of their alloys with a range of mixtures of carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen and water vapor. The metals studied are of
real interest as results can be expected to apply to a variety of practical
materials from structural to stainless steels. The gases chosen for this
investigation are also of real interest because they include the reactants of so
many significant processes. The analytical methods to be used will give a
comprehensive view of the detailed mechanisms involved. The combination of
instruments to be employed will serve to give confirmations and possible new
insights for the surface chemistry of these systems. Experiments will be
performed at different temperatures to give a more complete understanding of the
initiation and growth mechanisms of carbon filament growth.
