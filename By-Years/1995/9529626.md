9529626 Pineda The mechanisms that influence larval transport and recruitment
must be understood in order to predict the species composition and population
dynamics of benthic communities. This project will study the onshore movement of
larvae by large internal tidal bores. Several new questions dealing with small-
scale mechanics and larger-scale spatial consequences of this physical process
will be addressed. Specifically, studies will examine the relationships between
the characteristics of internal bores, internal wave regimes, and larval
behaviors. ***
