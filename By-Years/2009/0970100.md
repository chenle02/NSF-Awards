The investigator and his collabortaors and students study several topics in
arithmetic geometry, in particular to arithmetical intersection theory of cycle
on Shimura varieties with connection to special values of automorphic of
L-series extending his previous work on the Gross-Zagier formula and Arakelov
theory.

This is a project in a subfield of mathematics known as number theory. Many of
these questions are motivated by the philosophy that algebraic informations can
be obtained by geometric methods. It is not too ambitious to say that the
solution to the problems in this proposal will one day affect research in
cryptography, theoretic physics, and quantum computing.
