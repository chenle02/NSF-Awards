HRD-0429972&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The submitted nomination package is in support
of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering
Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that
enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science,
mathematics, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematics Department of
the University of Iowa has become the single largest producer of doctorates
awarded to mathematical scientists from underrepresented communities. This
outcome is the result of a departmental (and university) commitment articulated
less than ten years ago to increase the numbers of minority graduate students,
an effort that has attracted external support through a series of US Dept. of
Education's Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) grants. The
Department's success is based on: (1) a well-designed recruiting campaign to
convince students that the environment is a welcome one; (2) a commitment to
institutionalizing the effort; (3) and collaboration among faculty within the
Department, between the Department and other components of the University as
well as the Iowa state system. The Department clearly recognizes that the
enrichment programs described in the proposal are of value to all graduate
students, and by offering them in this way minimizes the risk of marginalizing
minority students &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
