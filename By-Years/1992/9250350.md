The Department of Mathematics at Chadron State College is establishing a
computer/calculator laboratory which is facilitating a shift from teacher-
centered to learner-centered instruction. They are currently implementing the
Purdue University approach to teaching differential and integral Calculus, a
cooperative-learning approach that relies heavily on computers and mathematical
software. In this project the department is adapting the Purdue approach to the
pre-calculus sequence, a move that requires significant use of technology for
course delivery. Because of the department's strong cross- curricular and
service components, approximately 600 enrollments per semester are being
impacted by the project. In addition, workshops are being offered for inservice
teachers thus impacting the public schools as well.
