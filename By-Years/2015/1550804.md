This award will support student travel to the 2015 New Security Paradigms
Workshop to be held in Twente, the Netherlands, in September 2015. The New
Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) provides a stimulating, safe, and highly
interactive forum for innovative approaches to computer security. NSPW
encourages graduate students and junior faculty to examine long-held ideas
within computer security. It also strongly encourages non-computer security
experts from economics, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines to bring
their expertise to bear on computer security paradigms. The support from NSF
will be used to sponsor travel expenses for graduate students and junior faculty
to attend the workshop. Supporting junior researchers' travel to attend
professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.
Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this
important research area.
