With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Maria Polinsky and Eric Potsdam
will conduct two years of linguistic research on the omission of redundant
information in sentences with a particular syntactic structure. In sentences
with predicates such as 'try' and 'intend', the subject of trying/intention is
identical to the subject of the sentence describing the intended event. Such
identity is called a Control relation. This research project will systematically
document the ways that natural languages realize the Control relation, something
that has not been done before. The project also includes the development of a
database of representative Control patterns in the world's languages. The
research team will conduct fieldwork on three little-described languages:
Malagasy (spoken in Madagascar) and Rutul and Tsaxur (spoken in Dagestan, NE
Caucasus). The empirical findings will inform syntactic theory, which should be
constrained so as to permit and model all and only the observed range of Control
structures.

This research will enhance scholarly understanding of several under-documented
languages and advance linguistic theory by motivating modifications to account
for Control structures. The project will also provide training for future
researchers by involving graduate and undergraduate students in a unique
collaboration between the University of California in San Diego and the
University of Florida. Finally, the project will serve to establish contacts
between linguists in the United States and linguists in Madagascar and Dagestan,
where fieldwork for the project will be conducted.
