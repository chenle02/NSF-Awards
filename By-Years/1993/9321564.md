This award is for support to continue measurements of deuterium on samples from
the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core. The values of deuterium
measured on the GISP2 ice core samples will be used to reconstruct and interpret
the temperature history recorded in the core. Deuterium excess values will also
be calculated in order to determine the climate conditions at the oceanic
moisture source. This work will be coordinated with the group from the
University of Washington that is measuring oxygen isotope ratios on the ice
core. Work to date suggests that records of pressure (North Atlantic
Oscillation) and temperature (Jakobshave-Oslo seesaw) oscillations are recorded
in the deuterium and deuterium excess values. Values of deuterium excess during
the last glacial period show sharp changes at the times of some, but not all, of
the massive fluxes of icebergs into the North Atlantic ocean (Heinrich Events).
Major questions to be addressed include the nature of rapid climate changes seen
in many of the climate proxies measured in the core, the existence of modes of
climate as reflected by preferred states of the climate proxies, and the
importance for the climate record of differential thinning and thickening of
layers, as well as possible folding and faulting of the near basal ice.
