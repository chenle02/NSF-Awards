The gas in and between galaxies can be cold, warm or hot. It is important to
understand how energy flows through such multiphase gas. To make progress, the
team will inventory the multiphase gas in galaxies, groups of galaxies and
clusters of galaxies. They will use radio, sub-millimeter, optical and X-ray
observations for the inventory. The observations will be used to test models of
energy flow. Senior team members will train junior team members. The team will
engage with students from underrepresented minorities who attend high schools in
underserved areas of Alabama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use
observations to study the multiphase gas in the dense central regions of
galaxies, groups of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, and in the trails of gas
pushed out of galaxies as they orbit inside clusters of galaxies. Their goals
are to investigate the conditions for precipitation, the efficiencies of star
formation, the relationships between the gas in different phases, and the ratios
of atomic gas to molecular gas.
