This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California purchase laser
equipment. This equipment will be used in the following research activities: 1.
Molecular Species That are Absorbed on Surfaces. 2. The Phenomenon of Optical
Activity. 3. The Active Sites of Metalloproteins Containing Transition Metals.
4. Studies of Photodissociation Reaction Dynamics in Small Polyatomic Molecules.
5. Photoinitiated Reactions in Weakly Bonded Complexes. %%% Lasers emit a narrow
beam of coherent, powerful and nearly monochromatic electromagnetic radiation.
This radiation is used in Chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the
dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron transfer processes, and
from interfacial chemistry to picosecond pulse shaping.
