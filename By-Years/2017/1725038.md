The objective of this award is to provide support for 80 students to participate
in the Twenty-Eighth Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF)
Symposium - An Additive Manufacturing Conference, to be held in Austin, Texas,
7-9 August 2017. The SFF Symposium is widely considered the premier academic
conference on additive manufacturing (AM) related research in the world. In
2016, it brought together 544 researchers from universities, national
laboratories, and companies from 22 countries around the world, who together
presented 416 technical presentations and posters during the 3-day
event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By attending and presenting their work at this
symposium, students will have the opportunity to interact with leading
researchers in their field, learn about cutting-edge research and challenging
problems across the AM research community, and mature themselves professionally
as future leaders in AM research and development.
