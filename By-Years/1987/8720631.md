In this project chemical diffusion will be investigated experimentally in
silicate melts of basaltic composition. The flattened and polished ends of
capsules containing dissimilar materials will be joined by a Pt sleeve and
welded shut during initial heating by a thread of gold wire wrapped around the
join at the top and bottom of the sleeve. Diffusion profiles will be determined
after quenching the couple by longitudinal sectioning and microprobe "linescan"
for all eleven major elements. The data on numerous "linescans" corresponding to
various diffusion times and initial concentration profiles will be fitted to an
appropriate multicomponent solution of the diffusion equation. The aim of this
exercise is to extract the off-diagonal (coupling) terms of the diffusion matrix
for basaltic magmas. The calibrated diffusion matrices will be used to resolve
certain intriguing aspects of crystal growth in magmatic systems ( such as
whether oscillatory zoning is a natural consequence of the coupling of diffusion
to the crystal liquid interface and the kinetics of interface growth) and to
suggest possible melt "species" predominant in basaltic systems.
