The project is part of the general field of 3-dimensional topology and geometry,
which analyzes 3-dimensional spaces with a high level of complexity and includes
the study of the knotting phenomena that occur for curves in three dimensions.
The underlying problems often arise from practical applications in the three-
dimensional world we live in, but also from more theoretical considerations in
mathematical physics. The project investigates a surprising connection between
two very different approaches to 3-dimensional topology. The first approach is
very algebraic and involves so-called quantum invariants for knotted curves in
3-dimensional spaces. The second approach is more geometric and analytic, and
uses the non-euclidean geometry of the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. The
Kashaev Volume Conjecture, experimentally verified on many examples but still
without a mathematical proof guaranteeing that it holds in all cases, provides
an unexpected connection between these two viewpoints. The award provides
support for graduate students who will be involved in related
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the Kashaev Volume Conjecture
connects the asymptotics of the colored Jones polynomial of a knot to the
hyperbolic volume of its complement. This tantalizing conjecture is now 25-year
old, and supported by much heuristic and experimental evidence. However, the
corresponding property has been rigorously proved for only a very small number
of cases. The goal of the project is to develop various steps in a roadmap
towards a proof of the Kashaev Volume Conjecture, with a special emphasis on its
analytic subtleties. As a first step, the project is focused on a closely
related conjecture for surface bundles over the circle, where the combinatorics
of quantum invariants are more clearly connected to the geometry of the
underlying manifold. The PI and his collaborators will attack this conjecture in
the even more special case of punctured torus bundles, in an effort to be very
concrete while tackling the analytic difficulties that arise in this context.
The PI will then build on the experience, insights and technical expertise
gathered in this first case to proceed with the next steps in the roadmap, one
after the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
