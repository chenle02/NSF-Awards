This is a collaborative project employing kinetic modeling and magnetic
resonance techniques to elucidate the mechanisms(s) of deactivation in zeolite
cracking catalysts. These catalysts are very commonly used in petroleum
refining, especially in gasoline production, and deactivate very rapidly. If
successful, the approach may be applicable to other catalyst systems as well.
