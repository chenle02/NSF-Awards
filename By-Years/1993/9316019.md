ABSTRACT P.I. Kenneth Rose/Maureen O'Leary SBR-9316019 Paleontologists have
always hoped the study of fossil teeth would reveal the diet, ecological
adaptations, as well as the evolutionary relationships, of living and extinct
vertebrates. This study, using SEM molar microwear analysis to infer diet, and
also landmark-based and outline-based morphometrics of the teeth, will reveal
how dental form and use changed over a substantial time interval in an important
extinct primate group. Also, paleosol data from this early Eocene sequence in
Wyoming suggests that variation there can be tied to the dental microwear and
morphological changes, which would be a break-through. The project will
contribute to the study of the tempo and mode of evolutionary change in these
primates. It will also train a very competent young researcher in an excellent
program. *** P\anthro\jfried\9316019.abs < > ! ! ! D ( Times New Roman Symbol &
