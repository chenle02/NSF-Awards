William Miller of the University of California, Berkeley, is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop the theoretical
concepts and computational methodologies that aim to provide a quantitative
description of many kinds of dynamical phenomena in molecular systems, focusing
on chemical reactions. More accurate versions of the semiclassical initial value
representation (SC-IVR) methodology, such as the forward-backward approach (FB-
IVR), will be developed into a method that is able to describe many types of
quantum phenomena, such as coherence, tunneling, and zero-point energy effects.
The capabilities of the new developments will be tested on a variety of
applications, including molecular spectroscopy and dynamics on a femtosecond
time scale.

This research continues to explore the development of a potentially universal
treatment of chemical dynamics, including the quantum mechanical effects that
are important for very small particles. This approach may improve the predictive
capabilities for chemical processes that occur in solids and solutions, with
resulting impacts in chemistry, biology, physics, and nanoscience.
