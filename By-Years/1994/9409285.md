Xue 9409285 The objective of this project is to produce more effective
sequential and parallel algorithms and software for the rapid evaluation and
global minimization of nonconvex potential energy functions that arise in
molecular and protein conformation problems. The proposed research will combine
the fast multipole algorithms and automatic differentiation to produce O (n)
operation algorithms for both the function evaluation and the gradient vector
evaluation for a system of n particles. Since all existing algorithms require at
least O (n2) operations to evaluate the gradient vector, this research will
improve almost all existing algorithms for molecular and protein conformations
where repeated evaluation of the function and gradient is required. This success
relies on two programming paradigms: a discrete-continuous programming paradigm
that uses physical knowledge on the problem to guide continuous minimization
searchers, and a parallel two-level simulated annealing programming paradigm
which provides load balancing dynamically and moves from one local minimizer to
another in an effort to locate a global minimizer.
