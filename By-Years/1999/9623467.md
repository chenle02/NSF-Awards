9623467 Lange The microstructural engineering approach involves control of
concrete microstructure through processing to yield specific material
properties. The overall objective of the study is to enhance understanding of
the relationship between concrete material properties and the physical reality
of microstructure and crack geometry. The study applies state- of-the-art
techniques for material characterization, mechanical testing, surface
characterization and visualization, computer modeling and analysis toward the
objective of learning more about how concrete microstructure controls bulk
material behavior. The Education Plan includes curriculum development and
undergraduate research support, and an outreach project to local high schools.
