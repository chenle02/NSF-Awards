9351485 Barkan Acquisition of a FTIR spectrophotometer will allow the
introduction and development of hands-on instrumental structural analysis in the
organic laboratory. The FTIR and associated software will also provide the
students with computer assisted data collection, manipulation, and spectral data
base searching. Organic Chemistry students will use the instrument to identify
unknowns, follow reaction progress, identify products, and help establish purity
of synthesized compounds. General Chemistry students will use the instrument to
identify functional groups in an introduction to Organic Chemistry. The project
will overcome a major deficiency in the current laboratory curriculum by
introducing the students to FTIR techniques that are widely used in Chemistry.
