Studies of the ionization of vibrationally excited nitrogen open up an important
new area--an approach by the use of a target focused by a free jet expansion.
Also, the use of laser excitation forproduction of either state- or temperature-
specific vibrational distributions will provide opportunities for an entirely
new class of measurements. With the emphasis of work at the interface between
solid-state and gas-phase chemistry and physics, the research is significant for
practical technologicalapplications in discharges of many kinds. Knowledge of
ionization potential is critical to the understanding of ionization balance in
discharge plasmas; dissociative attachment to form negative ions may be the key
to the control of high power switches; and the understanding and control of
vibrational populations is essential to the modeling and design of future laser
systems. The diagnostics used may also prove quite useful in eventual
technologies for the tailoring of chemical reactions by the use of lasers to
producestate- specific molecular populations.
