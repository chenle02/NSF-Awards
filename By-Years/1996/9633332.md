OCE 96-33332 Chang The project will the hypothesis that mixing and Lagrangian
transport due to equatorial trapped waves interacting with the western boundary
may account for the equatorial chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) tongue which is observed
to extend eastward at mid-depth in the Atlantic. The wave-induced mixing
hypothesis will be extended in this work by emphasizing near-surface generation
and vertical propagation of the Rossby and Yanai waves which are important to
the mixing mechanism. A hierarchy of numerical experiments using several general
circulation models will be conducted to investigate the contributions of wind
forcing and shear instability to wave generation. Simulated particle
trajectories will be used to investigate wave induced mixing and transport in
the models, and the results will be compared to recent float tracks from the
region. This work is expected to clarify the role of equatorial processes in the
global thermohaline circulation.
