1159398/1159759 &lt;br/&gt;Cirino/Tang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyketides are an
important class of bioactive natural products. The complexity of these compounds
demands that their synthesis be conducted by dedicated enzymes with exquisite
catalytic properties. Directed evolution of natural product pathway enzymes is
limited by the lack of general high-throughput screens for the complex target
compounds, as well as the genetic intractability of most organisms expressing
these pathways. The proposed research addresses this technology gap through the
engineering of synthetic genetic networks that can respond to a desired
polyketide compound. Many bacterial regulatory proteins naturally control gene
expression in response to a specific "effector" molecule. We will screen mutant
libraries of regulatory proteins to isolate variants that activate expression of
a reporter gene in response to polyketide compounds of interest. Then, using E.
coli outfitted with the synthetic regulatory circuit, the aromatic polyketide
biosynthetic pathway will be engineered towards enhanced production of bioactive
metabolites and biosynthesis of new, "unnatural"
compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is cofunded by the Biotehchnology,
Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program, Chemical, Bioengineerng,
Environmental and Transport Systems Division, Engineering Directorate, and the
Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division of MPS.
