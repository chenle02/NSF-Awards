The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of Hawaii for the summers of 2004-2006. John Head
is the site's program director. Thirteen faculty from the departments of
chemistry, oceanography, physics, cell and molecular biology, and molecular
biosciences and bioengineering will serve as student mentors to 7 students each
summer for ten weeks. Students will be recruited from four-year colleges in the
Pacific Islands, Hawaiian students from mainland colleges who return to Hawaii
for the summer, and mainland students with no ties to Hawaii who attend schools
that do not have extensive research facilities. Research projects are in the
area of biomolecular structures and functions, environmental chemistry,
materials chemistry and astrochemistry. Students will participate in seminars
and presentations including an ethics workshop and a concluding symposium. The
workshops and research experience will be evaluated by questionnaires and
interviews.
