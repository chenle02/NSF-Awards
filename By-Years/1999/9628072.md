Ilan Benjamin, University of California Santa Cruz, is funded by a grant from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical
work in the study of molecular dynamic simulations of chemical reactions at
liquid interfaces. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics computer
simulations and continuum electrostatic and diffusion models will be used to
investigate how the unique characteristics of the interface affect the behavior
of several chemically reactive systems. The problems to be studied include: 1)
solute accommodation and reactions at the water liquid/vapor interface; 2)
gauche-trans isomerization reactions at the liquid/vapor interface of liquid
mixtures; 3) transfer of large hydrophobic ions across the liquid/liquid
interface; and 4) ion pairing at the electrochemical liquid/liquid interface. An
important challenge in the field of chemistry is to understand at the molecular
level the effect of the solvent medium on chemical reactions. Most chemical
reactions of commercial importance occur in solution and are frequently carried
out in the presence of a catalyst. Recent development of a number of condensed
phase experimental techniques, such as femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy
and non-linear spectroscopy, have provided new information on chemistry at the
liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfaces. Benjamin's theoretical work will help
to provide a molecular level interpretation of this new experimental
information.
