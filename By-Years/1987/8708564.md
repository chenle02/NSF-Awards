Wave propagation in layered media has been fruitfully studied for several
decades, with many applications in geophysics and other fields. The fundamental
limitation of this type of modelling, in most cases, is its inability to handle
lateral variations of structure. A recent discovery now indicates that
analytical methods, developed and widely used for layers with plane parallel
interfaces, can be extended to the case of plane interfaces that are not
parallel. Consequently, it appears possible to develop a generalized ray theory
for wave propagation in a stack of wedge-shaped layers. Layer interfaces can
have arbitrary dip and strike, permitting the study of waves in truly three-
dimensional structures. The methods that can be so generalized, from parallel
layering to non-parallel, are those that derive from a fundamental and well-
known relationship between travel- time, range, and a sum over vertical
slownesses (weighted by layer thickness). It is remarkable that this
relationship, so familiar in purely depth-dependent structures, is virtually
unchanged in the three- dimensional case. We propose to explore the newly
generalized methods to study wave propagation associated with randomly dipping
interfaces.
