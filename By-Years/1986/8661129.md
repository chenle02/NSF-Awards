A variety of dry etching processes have been developed for use in the
manufacture of high speed, high density, integrated semiconductor circuits. The
recent requirements for submicron feature dimensions have placed stressing
demands on existing technologies such as reactive ion etching and inert ion beam
etching. Reactive ion beam etching (RIBE) has recently been demonstrated to
offer advantages relative to these technologies by facilitating rapid etching
with highly precise, submicron pattern definition. However, available ion beam
source designs incorporate thermionic electron emitters which are easily damaged
by the gases used in RIBE processing. This results in short ion source lifetime,
thereby greatly limiting the practical application RIBE. This proposal will
attempt to overcome this problem by developing an inexpensive radio frequency
ion source which is expected to be insensitive to reactive gases and their
products. An experimental, 20-30 cm, magnetic-field-free, RF ion source system
will be constructed which incorporates a cold cathode discharge igniter. Plasma
generation experiments will be performed with oxygen and carbon tetrachloride
gases at RF frequencies up to 14 MHz. Ion emission uniformity will be measured
and optimized at current density of approximtely 1 mA/cm .
