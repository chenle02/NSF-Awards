0114725&lt;br/&gt;Hiskens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between continuous
dynamics and discrete events are an intrinsic part of power system dynamic
behavior. Physical devices such as generators exhibit continuous dynamics. On
the other hand, event-driven discrete behavior is normally associated with rule-
based components. Examples include protection devices and market-dispatch rules.
Analysis should accurately capture those interactions. This project will attempt
to develop a unified hybrid systems approach to managing power
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will make novel contributions in three
fundamental areas: modeling, analysis and algorithms. Earlier work has shown
that many hybrid systems can be modeled by a differential-algebraic (DAE)
structure that incorporates impulsive action and switching within the algebraic
constraints. This representation will be used as the basis for exploring model
structures that best satisfy the competing requirements of generality, utility
and computational efficiency. To analyze the behavior of switched DAE systems,
stability results for (non-switched) DAEs will be combined with existing
stability analysis tools for switched ODEs. Lyapunov stability theory underlies
this analysis. Algorithms will be developed to address parameter uncertainty,
parameter estimation, border-collision bifurcations, critically stable
trajectories, boundary value problems, optimal control, switching and issues of
uniqueness in forwards and reverse time. &lt;br/&gt;
