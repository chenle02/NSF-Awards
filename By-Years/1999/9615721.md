Harvey 9615721 Abstract This award supports a meeting of the Meteorite Working
Group (MWG). The purpose of the MWG is to formulate recommendations for
curatorial policies as well as review and recommend allocation of meteorite
samples that have been collected in Antarctica with support from the U.S.
Antarctic Program. The MWG was formed in 1977 in response to a Memorandum of
Understanding between the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, and the Smithsonian Institution as part of an effort
to ensure equitable distribution of meteorites for research and educational
purposes. This award supports a meeting of the MWG in the Fall of 1996.
