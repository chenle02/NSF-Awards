9308235 Fodor This award provides one-half the funding required to modernize two
items of equipment in the Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
at the North Carolina State University. The institution is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the project. An electron microprobe and
an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer will be upgraded. Both instruments are old
but functioning and will be capable of adequate performance for several more
years as a result of this upgrade. The electron microprobe is widely used in the
department as a tool for quantitative elemental analysis of geological samples
with a spatial resolution of a micrometer, and the X-ray fluorescence system is
used for bulk chemical analysis of rocks and minerals. Both instruments are
needed for teaching purposes as well as graduate research projects requiring
chemical analyses. ***
