This five week summer program, based in New York City, will assist twenty-four
master middle school teachers: upgrade their mathematical knowledge, teaching
techniques, and prepare/conduct workshops for co- teachers of grades 5 - 8. All
teachers will be from New York City schools, where at least 80% of the their
students are living at or below poverty level. The purpose of the workshops, run
by the master teachers, is to assist the participating teachers better prepare
their students to receive mathematical instruction and increase the students'
rate of retention in mathematics courses. The mathematical topics will include
algebra, geometry, graphing, computers, probability, and statistics. In
addition, the City College of New York will finance the development and pilot
testing of an instructional in-service videotape for middle school mathematics
teachers. The intent is that teachers can view the tape as often as they want at
their own convenience. The project director is Gerald Elgarten, City College of
the City University of New York. Claire Newman, Professor Emeritus, Queens
College of the City University of New York, a well-known mathematics educator
and Michael Engber of the Department of Mathematics, City College will conduct
the two courses for four weeks and the one week workshop. An Advisory Committee
composed of superintendents and principals from the NYC public schools and the
City College administration will meet several times prior to and once a month
during the project to provide policy advice, monitor and evaluate progress. A
continuing evaluation process will assess the project's impact on the teachers
and their students.
