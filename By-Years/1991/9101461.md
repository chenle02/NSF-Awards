In this project, the P.I. will study the possibility that surface- intensified
baroclinic geostrophic jets are the source of mesoscale (10-100 km) temperature
and velocity variability observed in the North Pacific and North Atlantic
Subtropical Convergence Zones. A linear instability model will be solved by a
method recently introduced for studying atmospheric cyclogenesis.
