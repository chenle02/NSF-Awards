This project represents the convening of leading academic researchers in place-
based innovation policy and related areas to provide timely insight for the NSF
Regional Innovation Engines program. Its objective is to bring together a
diverse group of researchers and policymakers to i) provide an assessment of the
“state of knowledge” of place-based innovation ecosystems, and its relationship
to both geographic and socioeconomic inclusion, ii) identify the insights of
this research to inform innovation policymakers, and iii) surface potential
means by which to measure and assess place-based innovation ecosystems on a
rigorous and ongoing basis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on
regional, place-based innovation economies, and it is divided in two phases. In
the first phase of the project, a “reading group” would convene on a regular
(monthly) basis to assess the “state of the field” and “open questions” around
specific topics in the economics of regional innovation ecosystems. These
meetings would serve as a precursor to the second phase of the project, a one
and a half day research conference bringing together top researchers across
several areas of interest to summarize the key insights around each topic and
discuss key frontier questions in a discussion panel. Summaries of both the
reading group meetings and conference will be developed, serving as a basis for
future reference in the development of regional innovation
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
