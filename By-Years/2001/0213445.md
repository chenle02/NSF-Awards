With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Ian Gould, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State
University, is studying applications of irreversible photooxidation in the
elucidation of the mechanisms of oxidative processes in DNA. N-O bond cleavage
of N-alkoxyheterocycles affords the radical cation of the parent heterocycle and
an alkoxy radical. These irreversible photocleavage reactions allow exploration
of the reaction chemistry of each of these reactive species. Following
elucidation of the mechanisms and scope of the photochemistry of
N-alkoxyheterocycles, Professor Gould will determine the oxidation potentials
and lifetimes of purine radical cations in duplex DNA and explore the factors
controlling their reactivity. Finally, oxidative damage in DNA will be studied
using a mechanistic approach based on accurate measurements of quantum yields,
quantifying the absolute and relative efficiencies of single-strand cleavage via
one-electron oxidation of purine bases and via radical abstraction from the
sugar backbone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxidation of DNA leads to reactive
intermediate species. Exploration of the fundamental reaction chemistry of these
reactive intermediates will lead to a more detailed understanding of oxidative
processes which are of central importance in DNA chemistry and biochemistry. By
developing unique reagents allowing the efficient formation of oxidized DNA
species, Professor Ian Gould, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
Arizona State University, is exploring the reaction chemistry of these important
but only transiently existent reactive intermediates.
