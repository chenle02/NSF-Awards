James Kindt of Emory University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program to develop efficient computational methods
to study the distributions of lipid mixtures. Conventional molecular dynamics
(MD) methods converge far too slowly in these systems. These novel methods,
which introduce Monte Carlo mutation steps into MD trajectories within the semi-
grand canonical ensemble, also yield insight into mixing thermodynamics and
phase equilibria. These methods are being applied to a variety of systems of
increasing complexity.

The ultimate goal of the research is an increased understanding of the structure
and function of biomembranes. Undergraduates are actively involved in these
research project. Members of the Kindt research group produce short videos based
on their simulations and upload them to You Tube and Teacher Tube. Software
based on these new simulation methods have made available to the research
community in the freely available Gromacs molecular dynamics package.
