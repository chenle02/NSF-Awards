Abstract

This project addresses issues related to semiparametric regression models with
censored data as well as testing and estimation of item differential functioning
arising from IRT-based standardized tests. The investigator and his
collaborators develop new algorithms for obtaining parameter estimators for the
accelerated failure time regression. These algorithms are based on linear
programming which is easy to implement. The estimators are shown to be
asymptotically normal, with the limiting variance estimated via a simple
resampling method. The approach is extended to censored quantile regression
models, which are common in econometrics literature. They study the class of
semiparametric transformation models via estimating equations, resulting in a
general method for parameter estimation and inference, justified by a large
sample theory. They develop a new approach for adaptive standardized tests to
detect possible item differential functioning via a generalized logistic
regression model with measurement errors.

The statistical problems dealt with here are motivated by applications in
biomedical sciences, sociology, economics, marketing, psychology and education.
The project develops appropriate statistical models, computer algorithms and
mathematical theory. The results can be used to facilitate design of clinical
trials and epidemiological studies, particularly in studies of cancer,
cardiovascular diseases and AIDS, to analyze unemployment duration data, to
quantify consumer responses to marketing strategies and to screen out items for
use in large-scale standardized tests that are tilted against certain group or
groups to ensure fairness
