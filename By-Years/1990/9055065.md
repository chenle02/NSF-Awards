The University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science Education Network
(MSEN) will initiate a five-week, commuter Young Scholars (EAI) project in
physics and mathematics for 480 students entering grades 7,8. Students will
participate in experimental learning activities in mathematics, physics, career
exploration, communication in the classroom, field activities, and small group
interaction. The project will be planned and implemented through the Network
(MSEN) headquarters and will be offered to minority and female students at six
campuses within the UNC System.
