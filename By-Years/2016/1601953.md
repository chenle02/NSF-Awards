Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying symmetries, especially
symmetries of linear mathematical structures. The incredible richness of the
subject is partly due to the fundamental role it plays in quantum physics, as
well as the way it enters formulations of the so-called higher (non-abelian)
reciprocity laws of number theory in the Langlands duality program, which is
building bridges connecting number theory, analysis, and theoretical physics.
The present project is related to both these topics: one of its aims is to use
geometry of infinite dimensional spaces to answer questions motivated by
Langlands duality; another one is to exploit more classical, finite dimensional
geometric objects and their quantization to study representations.

The project will advance the representation theory of quantized symplectic
resolutions by applying ideas of mirror symmetry and Langlands duality. Another
goal is to further develop l-adic sheaf methods in harmonic analysis on p-adic
groups. The investigator will also continue to explore D-module methods in
representation theory, concentrating on applications of Hodge D-modules and
generalizations of the derived localization theorem in positive characteristic.
