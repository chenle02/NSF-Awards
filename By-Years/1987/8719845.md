The PI has proposed to explore the autonomous interaction of groups of machines
such as robots in working toward common goals, especially in less-structured
environments than the typical production line. New models will be explored,
which could lead to a system theory for cooperative robots. The approach will
draw on a background of team theory research, but will not be limited to that
approach. Earlier applications of team theory (eg, in its original discipline of
economics, and later in cecentralized optimal control) have not been terribly
successful, apparently because of the restrictive assumption that all "players"
share a single goal. This assumption appears to be valid for cooperating
machines. The research is supported under the Expedited Awards for Novel
Research procedure.
