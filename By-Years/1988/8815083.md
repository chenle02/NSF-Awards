This grant provides partial support for the summer school of the 1988 U.S.
Particle Accelerator School. The School offers graduate level courses in the
physics and technology of particle accelerators. The School will be held at
Cornell University in August 1988. The NSF contribution will be used to support
the publication, in book form, of the lectures from the 1987 and 1988 schools.
NSF has already supported the publication of the 1987 symposium part of the
school. Much of our knowledge of the microscopic structure of matter has been
obtained from experiments with accelerated particles. To reach new frontiers of
energy and intensity, new acceleration techniques must be invented and
developed. This School is both a setting for such studies and, also, a facility
for the maintenance of the scientific and engineering infrastructure necessary
for the continuation of our present accelerators.
