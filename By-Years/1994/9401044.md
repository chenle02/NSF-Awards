9401044 Morral The goal of this program is to model complex diffusional
processes with simple equations that are based on rigorous, fundamental
principles. Equations have already been derived for single and selected
multiphase systems in terms of the "square root diffusivity," a kinetic property
of materials. The equations have value to students who are learning how complex
alloys differ from binary alloys and to engineers working on alloy and process
design. The equations show how to measure the square root diffusivity of complex
alloys, how to minimize interdiffusion rates and Kirkendall porosity, and how to
vary the phases that form in interdiffusion zones. An experimental program
combining electron microprobe and image analysis of nickel-base superalloys is
being used to test the accuracy of the equations and to uncover new principles
related to diffusion in multicomponent, multiphase systems. %%% Diffusion causes
property degradation in coated turbine blades, metal-matrix composites, and
other materials used for high temperature service. In addition, diffusion is
important during high temperature processing, for example, pack cementation,
carburizing and annealing. ***
