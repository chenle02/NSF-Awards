Freshwater aquaculture systems have requirements for improved instrumentation
to monitor water quality. Closed loop control of water quality will provide
additional advantages to this growing worldwide industry. The objective of the
proposed program is to develop systems to monitor and control water quality in
freshwater aquaculture. These systems will be based on the use of novel fiber
optic chemical sensors or optrodes. This type of sensor is especially well
suited to the requirements of continuous in-situ monitoring of aqueous
solutions. The systems that will be developed under this program promise to
increase aquaculture growth rates, productivity and efficiencies in
environmentally safe facilities. In the Phase I program, the requirements for
chemical sensors in freshwater aquaculture will be assessed. An ammonia optrode
will be designed, fabricated, and calibrated in the laboratory. This sensor will
then be evaluated in a recirculating aquasystem. Concepts for chemical sensors
to detect other chemical species or water parameters identified in the
requirements assessments will be developed. Additionally, a concept for a system
that will both monitor and control water quality in freshwater aquaculture
systems will be developed.
