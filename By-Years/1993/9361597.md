9361597 Li Important technologic obstacles must be removed before semiconductor
devices monolithically integrated with oxide ferroelectrics can become a
practical reality. The innovations of the proposed program are: 1) advancing
thin-film deposition technology to achieve fully epitaxial growth of
ferroelectric films on silicon substrated, by using the highly successful pulsed
laser deposition (PLD) technique; 2) replacing the Pt bottom electrode with
La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO) - an epitaxial conductive oxide material; 3) achieving a
full monolithic integration of high-density ferroelectric/conductive oxide
capacitors with Si integrated circuits. The main thrust of Phase I will be to
demonstrate the feasibility of epitaxial growth of a ferroelectric thin film
(BaTiP3 or PbZrx Til-x), on top of a conductive oxide film (LSCO), on top of an
epitaxial YSZ buffered silicon substrate. The resulting heterostructures will be
used to fabricate a simple ferroelectric switched capacitor. This device will be
fully characterized and will become the basic building block for applications of
ferroelectric thin films to the microelectronics industry.
