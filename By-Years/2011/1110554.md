The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Murray V. Johnston of the University
of Delaware. Prof. Johnston and his research group will develop and employ
laser-based mass spectrometry methods to study the role of amines in the
nucleation and growth of atmospheric aerosols. The study will elucidate reaction
mechanisms and yield fundamental rate parameters necessary to accurately
represent new aerosol particle formation and growth in atmospheric models.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New particle formation events in the atmosphere is a
global phenomenon that is thought to contribute substantially to the
concentration of cloud condensation nuclei, thereby influencing precipitation
patterns and Earth's energy balance. Prof. Johnston's study to elucidate the
impact of amines on aerosol particle formation could lead to significant changes
in atmospheric models that currently may underestimate the concentration and
composition of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The study will provide
excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in an
area of research of great societal importance.
