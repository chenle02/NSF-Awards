This is a petrologic, geochemical and isotopic study of eclogite xenoliths in
kimberlite pipes of the Roberts Victor mine in South Africa, and from the
Colorado-Wyoming state line district in the U. S. Standard petrologic methods
will be used, followed by Sm- Nd, Rb-Sr, U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope studies. In
addition Concentration of rare-earth elements, K, and Ba in the constituent
minerals of the eclogites will be measured. Finally, analyses will be made of O
and H isotopic compositions from the hydrous phases and these will be compared
with similar measurements from coexisting garnets and clinopyroxenes. The
ultimate goal is to better understand the igneous, metasomatic, and hydrothermal
processes which contribute to the evolution of the earth's crust-mantle system.
