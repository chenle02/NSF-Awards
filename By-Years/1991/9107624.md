The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project under between Dr.
Attila Vertes, Eotvos University, and Dr. Amar Nath, Drexel University, is to
acquire basic understanding of the high-temperature superconductor, Y- Ba-CU-O.
The bulk properties of this material are determined by what is happening on the
microscopic level. The technique, Mossbauer spectroscopy, is ideally suited for
probing the micro-environment of copper-oxygen chains and sheets. Both of these
copper sites are believed to play an important role in the superconductivity
phenomenon. The Drexel lab specializes in emission Mossbauer technique, where a
minute fraction of the copper in the superconductor is substituted by cobalt-57.
Investigations using absorption Mossbauer spectroscopy using iron-57, tin-119
and europium-151 will be done at Eotvos. This project in high-temperature
superconductivity fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
