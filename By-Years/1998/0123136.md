The PIs propose to use astronomical sky spectra to investigate the terrestrial
nightglow under solar maximum conditions, and in the declining phase of solar
cycle 23. The work is directly relevant to the goal of improving our
understanding of solar-terrestrial interactions, as outlined in the phase III
agenda of the CEDAR program. From limited data collected in 2000, they have
identified most of the Rydberg transitions from atomic oxygen in the visible and
near-infrared regions of the spectrum. Except for the lines at 777.4 and 844.6
nm, these emissions have not previously been seen in the nightglow. Of two types
of Rydberg transitions, triplets and quintets, the quintets have been little
studied even in the laboratory, yet they tend to be the stronger in the sky
spectra. The PIs will compare both triplets and quintets against theoretical
calculations, with the goals of (1) using the observed intensities as a relative
intensity calibration standard and (2) determining variability in the triplets
as a consequence of radiation trapping.
