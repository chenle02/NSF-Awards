This award will provide partial support for the Connecticut Logic Seminar in
order to assure at least one outside speaker per month. The Connecticut Logic
Seminar has met weekly since 1974. Its participants now include the logicians
from the University of Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar, Southeastern Massachusetts
University, and Yale, as well as other faculty from regional schools. Weekly
meetings are held on a rotating basis at Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar and Yale.
The seminar typically ranges over most of current interest in logic, and
reflects the interests of the participants and invited speakers. From time to
time, an extended period is spent investigating as topic in depth, as was done
most recently with Hrushovski's examples of new strongly minimal sets. The
seminar is of great value not only to the participating faculty, but to their
graduate students.
