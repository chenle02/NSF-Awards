Broecker 9413834 This award supports the development of a "geochronology
laboratory" at Columbia University, specifically to carry out dating using K-Ar
and Ar39-Ar40 dating techniques. The laboratory will be based around a new mass
spectrometric system, and will be integrated into the existing noble gas
laboratory at Lamont-Doherty Earth Obsepvatory. It will include an all metal
noble gas mass spectrometer with Faraday Cup and ion counting capability, as
well as a gas extraction line with a resistance furnace and laser system for
bulk and detailed sampling. It will be applied to a broad range of applications
including igneous petrology, stratigraphy, structural geology, geomorphology and
paleoceanography, and will promote interdisciplinary research among the
researchers at Lamont-Doherty and collaborators at other institutions. Half of
the funding for this facility will be provided by Columbia University, with the
remainder provided by NSF through the Academic Research Infrastructure program.
