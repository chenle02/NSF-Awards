&lt;br/&gt;The 21st Century Scholars Program is providing scholarships for
students studying in the areas of computer science, mathematics and engineering
(CSEM). This important program provides a vital link between the workforce needs
of Danville's employers and a pool of potential employees in need of the
resources to gain vital skills. Objectives are to (a) provide financial
assistance for students to earn an associate's degree in a CSEM field and (b)
allow area residents to prepare for jobs in the areas that impact the local
economy.&lt;br/&gt;
