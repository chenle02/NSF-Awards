This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Guy Bertrand, University of California at Riverside, on the
synthesis and characterization of boron-phosphorus compounds with unusual
bonding and electronic states. This class of compounds consist of a four-
membered ring with alternating boron and phosphorus atoms. By judicious
substitution on the boron and phosphorus atoms, the electronic ground state can
be "tuned" along a continuum from a sigma-bonded system to singlet or triplet
diradicals. The structure, bonding and reactivity of these unusual boron-
phosphorus molecules will be studied. Related classes of compounds such as
aluminum-phosphorus or aluminum-nitrogen systems will also be explored.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental questions of bonding and electronic structure
will be addresssed by this study. Possible long-term applications include
polymers with unique magnetic properties. This research will also promote
collaborative research and the exchange of undergraduates, graduates and
postdoctoral fellows between UC Riverside and several French universities.
