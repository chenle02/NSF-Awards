The project work will develop applied mathematical models to simulate two-
dimensional heat flow and stress development in a static-cast ingot using
finite-element modeling of transient thermal-stress development in
solidification. The intent is to continue the application of mathematical
models, industrial experimentation, and metallurgical studies to increase
understanding and solve problems in other metal casting processes. While still
incomplete, these models have already helped to improve understanding of fluid
flow from submerged nozzles, the distorted shape of a continuous slab casting
mold, the mechanical behavior of steel at elevated temperatures, the problems in
casting of high-quality steel, such as inclusion entrainment and shell thinning
due to shell jet impingement on the solidifying steel shell, formation of
surface shape defects in stainless steel slabs due to inadequate mold taper, and
crack formation due to thermal stresses.
