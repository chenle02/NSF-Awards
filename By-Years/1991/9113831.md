The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr.
William H. Scouten of Baylor University and Drs. Jaroslava Turkova and Milan
Benes of institutes in the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences is to investigate
the immobilization of various proteins in a sight- directed and/or oriented
fashion. The approaches taken by the American and Czechoslovak researchers,
while distinct, are complementary. The American researchers have been attempting
to create a broad and general type of orientation using chemical features of the
matrix, the activating agent, and of the enzyme itself. The Czechoslovak
researchers have been using biological interactions between an immobilized
protein, or other biomolecule, and the protein to be immobilized. Results are
expected to facilitate the exchange of technical methods between the groups.
This project in biochemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
