This project brings together US and Japanese networking researchers in a 1.5-day
workshop to identify key challenges in enabling Trustworthy Networking for Smart
and Connected Communities. The two focus areas of the proposed workshop are: (i)
trustworthy optical networking, and (ii) trustworthy computing/networking
platforms (e.g., IoT/CPS, edge cloud). Optical networks are necessary in the
core of provider and enterprise networks as data rates increase, while
IoT/CPS/edge clouds are expected to dominate future access networks. Funds
requested for this workshop will be used to cover workshop expenses and travel
costs for only US attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are
to identify key challenges in the focus areas of trustworthy optical networking
and trustworthy computing/networking platforms for IoT/CPS and edge clouds.
Specific attributes of trustworthiness include reliability, dependability,
resilience, survivability and robustness. Attendees will make presentations,
participate in breakout sessions to identify key challenges, and then
collaborate on a workshop report. The expected outcomes include: (i) A list of
key research challenges in the two focus areas of the workshop; (ii) An improved
mutual understanding of research interests, research contributions, and testbeds
in the two countries; (iii) An improved understanding of processes used in the
two countries to enable mutually beneficial collaborations; (iv) Seeding of
individual linkages; (v) An identification of research objectives and projects
that are missing in one of the two countries with the goal of increasing
awareness of unaddressed challenges; and (v) Workshop report.
