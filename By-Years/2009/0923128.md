This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from the MRI program has
created a "next generation" sequencing center, dedicated to plant genomics. Such
centers were recently called for by a report on the plant genome project by the
National Research Council. The facility will be used for a wide range of
projects ranging from de novo sequencing of the various plant genomes and
transcriptomes to studies of epigenetics. The center will consist of an Illumina
GAIIx DNA sequencer and computer equipment for data analysis and storage. Such
centers exist of course for human and animal sequencing, but dedicated
instruments for plant sequencing will be an important development that would
greatly impact plant genomics. The availability of substantial capability in
next generation sequencing will allow the much more rapid collection of plant
genomics data. The center greatly enhances the national infrastructure for next
generation sequencing that is available to the plant genome community, and
contributes meaningfully to the training of scientists to use such equipment.
