The primary research objective of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID)
award is to document the emergence of the field of computer simulation since
World War II. The approach will be to capture the early history of the field by
producing digital videos of interviews with the pioneers of the field whose
seminal contributions have had long-lasting impacts on theory and practice, not
only in computer simulation but also in the following disciplines: computer
science; industrial, manufacturing, and systems engineering; and operations
research and the management sciences. This project requires swift action to do
the following: (a) identify those pioneers whose health enables them to
participate in the project; (b) make the logistical arrangements necessary to
produce high-quality digital-video recordings of structured interviews with
those pioneers; and (c) carry out the interviews, edit the recordings, and post
those recordings in a universally accessible permanent digital repository.
Another key project objective is to provide a template that can be used as an
effective guide to performing similar projects for other disciplines, and then
documenting the lessons learned from those projects.

The digital videos produced by this project will be made freely available on the
Web site of the Simulation Archive hosted by the North Carolina State University
Libraries; and the availability of the videos will be widely publicized in the
international simulation community and in the broader professional communities
that sponsor and participate in the Winter Simulation Conference, including
relevant professional societies for women and underrepresented minorities.
Faculty members who teach simulation will be encouraged to disseminate these
videos to their students and to use the videos in their courses. These videos
can also be used effectively in courses on the history of science and technology
and in courses on ethnic and gender studies.
