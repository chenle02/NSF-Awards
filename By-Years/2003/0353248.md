A new program US-Japan Young Scientists Exchange Program has been marked between
MEXT, Japan and NSF. An exchange visits to several Japanese universities for
twelve US scientists, with research interests broadly defined as Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology, at the early stages of their academic careers is proposed. The
Japanese government will sponsor an equivalent trip of twelve young scientists
from Japan to several US universities as the other part of this exchange visit.
The US scientists will visit Japan for ten days November 3-14, 2003. The format
of the trip will consist of a one-day workshop in Tokyo followed by site visits
to various Japanese universities. Both the US as well as the Japanese team will
present brief summaries of their research at the workshop, allowing the
scientists to learn about their areas of research. The laboratories to be
visited will depend upon the research interests of the team members, with one
day for each site. The Japanese colleagues, in equivalent stages of their
careers, will be visiting US universities September 24-October 4, 2003. The
format for their trip will be similar, a workshop, followed by site
visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Links established between scientists in the US and
Japan at the very early stages of their academic careers will lay the foundation
for a long-term fruitful collaboration over an extended period, maximizing the
probability for a successful global interdisciplinary effort. Besides the
presenters, several additional university colleagues are expected to attend the
symposia at MIT and in Japan. This exposure will translate directly to education
of graduate students, potentially as visiting students or as postdoctoral
fellows. Undergraduate students in research groups will also benefit from this
experience. A side benefit of this program is the exposure of US and Japanese
scientists to research programs in their own groups.&lt;br/&gt;
