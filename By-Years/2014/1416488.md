The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to remove a
barrier to commercialization of low-cost vacuum glass, a major building energy
efficiency improvement. Universal use (unachievable but a useful point of
reference) could reduce total U.S. energy use by 5% (about 4 quadrillion
BTU/year), more than $15 billion/year at today?s natural gas prices, while
adding minimal cost to building infrastructure. This disruptive technology will
claim a large share of the new and retrofit building market. Rapid market
penetration will be driven by the classic value proposition much better
performance for the same cost, eliminating the need for government subsidy. In
the near term, the customers will be manufacturers of high-end windows for use
in homes around the world. Germany and Russia have their own vacuum glass
development programs; a successful development will ensure the U.S. stays at the
forefront.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project aspires to demonstrate the feasibility of
removing residual surface gases from the inside of vacuum glass assemblies using
a room temperature process. This necessary manufacturing step is traditionally
achieved using a high-temperature bakeout process, which eliminates the
possibility of supplying tempered vacuum glass (25% of the market). Research
will be performed on an ambient pressure plasma degassing process, which can be
carried out at room temperature. Risks include 1) failure to prevent re-
adsorption of moisture prior to sealing leading to longer cycle times and short
product life, 2) arcing due to the presence of the metal foil seal, low-
emissivity metal coatings, 3) varying pane sizes in the same machine, and 4)
excessive cycle time and inert gas wastage leading to high cost. This project
will build upon atmospheric pressure surface treatment research by the
subawardee, the Center for Plasma-Aided Manufacturing at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison.
