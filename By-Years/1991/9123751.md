The focus of this research is the understanding ofMo-mediated allylic amination
reactions. Specific objectives include development of efficient Mo-catalyzed
allylic amination reactions of alkenes by hydroxylamine derivatives;
determination of the scope, regio- and stereoselectivity of these reactions;
development of double amination variants; evaluation of the feasibility of
alpha-aminating a variety of unsaturated substrates; assessment of LW(O)(RNO and
Cp2NbR'(RNO) complexes as alkene aminating agents; and elucidation of the
mechanismn of these types of reactions. %%% With this award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kenneth M. Nicholas of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma. Professor Nicholas will
focus his work on the development of new reactions that functionalize
hydrocarbons by the direct introduction of nitrogen based groups using Mo-
promoted allylic amination.
