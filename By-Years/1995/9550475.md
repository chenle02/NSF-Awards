9550475 Rommel This experimental project tests and evaluates the potential of
using measurements and analysis of biological form (morphology) to help students
understand basic principles of biology. The study's goal is to determine the
feasibility of helping K-12 teachers and especially middle school teachers,
develop skills, materials, and instructional models to teach students how to
collect and analyze measurements of their own bodies and then to compare these
measurements over time. The study will determine the relevance of the study of
morphology to the needs, interests, and abilities of science students. In
support of this study teachers and students will be introduced to computer
graphics that will all them to customize illustrations of students' skeletons
and to compare these illustrations over time and to other organisms' growth. ***
