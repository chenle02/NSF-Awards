This EAGER proposal is a partnership among the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, an
independent R&amp;D organization associated with the Sesame Workshop, E-Line
media, a publisher of game-based learning products, and the Center for Games and
Impact at Arizona State University. The goal of the project is to inform the
development of an impact-based research methodology (IBR) to enable a more
direct and overt connections between academic research on games and the
development of educational products and services that are sustainable and
scalable. Through consultation with other researchers and developers, the team
is conducting series case studies to identify promising practices from three
communities: 1) the tech-enabled services sector, particularly the idea of lean
start up, 2) the social impact sector; and 3) the learning sciences and
educational research sector.
