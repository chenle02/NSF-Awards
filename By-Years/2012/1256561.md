This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a new signal amplification system that, while being inexpensive and
simple to use, can be combined with antibodies or other probe molecules and can
increase detection limits of conventional Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) by 100 to 1000-fold. ELISA has been used both in science and diagnostic
for more than 40 years. ELISA is simple, reliable, and inexpensive technique.
However, because of the nature of enzymes used in this technique as signal-
generating and amplifying device, it has a relatively low sensitivity. During
Phase I, it was demonstrated that substitution of these enzymes with phages that
can propagate and simultaneously generate light signal substantially increases
the sensitivity of ELISA and simultaneously reduces cost of the assay without
complicating its protocol. In Phase II, the goal is to further improve
sensitivity and response time of the system and create two types of products: 1)
components that can be plugged-in into conventional ELISA system, and 2) kits
designed for detection of specific toxins and other
pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact /commercial potential of this
project is expected to impact the areas of basic research, biodefense, and
medicine. The proposed system will allow very sensitive and inexpensive
detection of antigens of choice. For those involved in basic research, the
proposed immunoassay will allow a significantly more detailed analysis of
biological processes, possibly even opening the doors to monitoring those
processes and molecules previously undetectable. In biodefense and medical
diagnostics, increased sensitivity will mean an increased security by allowing
earlier detection of harmful pathogens, as well as pathological changes in the
human organism.
