The proposed research seeks to increase knowledge by constructing and testing a
comprehensive framework of plant performance to resolve the controversy
regarding performance trade-offs in manufacturing. This issue has been widely
discussed, but rarely investigated empirically. A three stage approach will be
used to enhance and test existing theory. In the first stage of the research,
academics and practitioners will design an initial model which describes
potential relationships among plant performance criteria. The initial model will
be tested on a limited scale. In the second stage of research, the model will be
revised, and a large-scale study to assess various forms of plant performance
will be designed. In the third stage, a large-scale study on performance results
from plants in multiple industrial settings, will be conducted. This study will
utilize survey methodology and quantitative data analysis techniques. If
successful, the research should enable industry to eliminate or avoid
performance trade-offs, thereby becoming more responsive to customer needs at
potentially lower costs. Companies participating in this study include
Honeywell, Donaldson, and 3M.
