With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Daniel R.
Talham and colleagues Khalil A. Abboud, Ronald K. Castellano, George Christou,
and Lisa McElwee-White from the University of Florida will acquire a SMART APEX
II DUO X-ray Diffractometer equipped with a new storage system for data
archiving and central file sharing for the Single-crystal X-ray Laboratory to
provide structural analysis. Besides these researches many newly hired faculty
members in the chemistry department will use the instrument for research in new
materials synthesis, organic, inorganic, biochemical, and polymer chemistry. The
new instrumentation will play a critical role in accomplishing the research,
educational, and outreach goals of the department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography allows accurate and precise
determination of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of molecules relative to the neighboring molecules. These
studies will have an impact in a number of areas ranging from synthetic
chemistry to systems of biological interest and cleaning of the environment.
