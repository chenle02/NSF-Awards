ABSTRACT CTS-9406718 Gustavo Larsen This is an investigation of the use of
sulfated zirconia supported on zeolites as solid superacid catalysts. Zeolite-
supported, sulfated, zirconia clusters are prepared and their physical form and
catalytic activity studied. An objective is to produce catalysts with longer
lifetimes than bulk sulfated zirconia. Test reactions include isomerization of
n-butane to isobutane, isomerization of 2-methyl-2 pentene, and synthesis of
ethyl tert-butyl ether. Characterization techniques used include X-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption, and Fourier-
transform infrared spectroscopy. Environmental concerns have led to a large
increase in the demand for oxygenates as gasoline additives. At the same time,
environmental and occupational-health concerns are forcing a phase-out of the
fluid superacid catalysts used to make these materials. This study looks at a
solid superacid that could replace these dangerous fluid catalysts. A portion of
the effort also addresses the use of ethanol in motor fuel. ***
