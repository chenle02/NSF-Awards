An investigation of dynamics and intermolecular interactions in molecular solid
state systems. Picosecond and subpicosecond nonlinear experiments combined with
ultrahigh resolution spectroscopy, conventional optical spectroscopy and theory
are used to study isolated molecules in crystals and glasses, weakly interacting
molecules in impurity band systems, and strongly interacting molecules in pure
crystal exciton systems. In glasses by combining photon echo and other optical
coherence experiments with optical holeburning experiments, acoustic
measurements and heat capacities, a new and detailed picture of dynamics and
intermolecular interactions in these nonequilibrium systems is emerging. In the
impurity band problem, photon echo experiments are shown to be a direct
observable for the concentration dependent delocalization of electronic
excitations in mixed crystal systems. The application of phase related pulse
sequences, particularly the optical dipolar echo, to the impurity band problem
is described using a new approach for generating picosecond pulses with well
defined phase relationships. The applications of picosecond transient grating
techniques to the investigation of exciton transport and polariton effects in
pure molecular crystals are discussed. A combination of photon echo experiments
and polarization grating techniques are used to examine the relationship between
the mechanical motions of molecules and coupling to electronic states as
observed by optical dephasing.
