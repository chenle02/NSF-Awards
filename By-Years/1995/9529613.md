9529613 Moore It is well recognized that fluids play a crucial role in sediment
accretion, deformation, diagenesis and metamorphism at subduction zones. To
date, however, there has been little concentrated study of the pathways and
processes of fluid migration in such settings. The present award will continue
the analyses of three-dimensional seismic reflection data acquired from the
Barbados accretionary wedge in attempt to better relate the processes of fluid
migration to the structure and deformation of this region. Specific topics being
addressed include the geometry of thrust faults and backthrusts in the accreted
sediment and the velocity/density structure of the major thrust zone along which
subduction takes place. ***
