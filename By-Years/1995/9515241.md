Psychological research has demonstrated that people's preferences are not
constant and that decision makers often depart from predictions made by so
called `rational` models. Most decision making theories, however, either make
deterministic predictions to address departures from rational principles, or
handle variability of behavior with stochastic models that cannot account for
such violations. This research examines a new, stochastic model of decision
making, the proportional difference model (PD). PD is a simple, two-parameter
model, based on the notion that decision makers trade attribute values in a
proportional manner and that this trading is a variable process. A number of
experiments will be conducted to examine the predictions of the PD model. The
first study will test PD by comparing its descriptive ability to that of three
other models found in the literature; preliminary tests suggest PD is a better
model. The second study will focus on PD's predictions of context effects, such
as effects of maximum attribute values in the choice environment and the known
reflection effect. The third study will investigate decision making with vague
information. The results of this research will advance the state of knowledge of
descriptive decision making.
