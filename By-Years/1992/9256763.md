ABSTRACT There exists a national need for hybrid scientists trained at the
advanced graduate level in both biology and engineering/mathematics. This need
is created by the increasing difficulty of analyzing, processing, and modeling
biological data that are accumulating exponentially and by the difficulty of
modeling increasingly complex, biological systems. This need is manifested by
the extreme difficulty of hiring faculty with the requisite hybrid training.
Fortunately, this need can be met because appropriate mathematical and
engineering techniques have been and are being developed to cope with both the
increasing data and the increasingly complex, biological systems. For thirty
years, Johns Hopkins has provided in-depth, hybrid training in biology and
engineering/mathematics in its Biomedical Engineering Doctoral Program. Three
new Program initiatives, in Molecular and Cellular Systems Physiology, Systems
Neurophysiology and Biological Imaging continue, and expand this tradition. All
three of these initiatives create a fusion between the methods of modern biology
and the methods of modern engineering and mathematics. Equally important (and,
perhaps, unusual), each of these programs has a strongly integrative quality
because each examines biological processes at multiple levels of organization.
We request support for a total of seven additional students in these three
areas.
