This proposal is pursuant to a Memo of Understanding established with the United
States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in which both the NSF and the DHS
will co-fund "The Making of Terrorists and Their Networks." The project is to
undertake an assessment of the state of knowledge about the "making of
terrorists." It is a meta-evaluation to evaluate studies of the making of
terrorists. The proposal undertakes a series of workshops to bring experts
together to discuss a large number of topics related to terrorism. An
interdisciplinary panel of experts will review and evaluate relevant data,
distill essential scientific findings, and make recommendations to policy
makers, researchers, and other audiences. The goal is to determine what is known
about terrorist groups generally and what is known about terrorist networks
specifically. The experts assembled will determine how this information can be
used to identify vulnerabilities for the purpose of effective counterterrorism.
