The enzyme subtilisin will be studied in order to understand the nature of
enzyme binding and catalysis, an area of importance both to biology and
chemistry. This enzyme is an ideal system for such a study because the x-ray
structure is known to high resolution and, more importantly, many crystal
structures of mutant variants have been and are being solved. The mechanism of
action is clear and the effects of changes in the primary structures on both
binding and catalysis have been analyzed separately. Other enzymes have been
studied with site specific mutagenesis, but none have the combination of
excellent and abundant crystal structures and this wide variety of binding and
catalytic mutant variants that subtilisin does. New insights into the details of
serine protease catalysis should be realized. This should also catalyze the
development and refinement of theoretical methods for studying binding and
catalysis in many other macromolecular molecules as well as in enzymes.***
