Subset selection is the task of finding a small subset of informative items from
a large ground set. Sequential data, including time-series and ordered data,
form an important large part of modern datasets, requiring effective subset
selection techniques. This project develops a unified framework for sequential
subset selection that incorporates dynamic models and relationships among items,
addresses both unsupervised and supervised problems and handles multi-modal
data. The project develops practical tools for video and multi-media
summarization, human information selection models that benefit human-in-the-loop
systems, as well as providing interdisciplinary research training to students
and disseminates research results. The research results from this project can
impact several communities, such as machine learning, computer vision, signal
processing, visualization, and health-informatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research develops a comprehensive framework for subset selection in sequential
datasets by addressing three important problems: i)it develops novel algorithms
for sequential subset selection that incorporate dynamic models and
relationships among sequential data and develops efficient optimization
techniques to solve the problem; ii) it addresses the problem of unsupervised
and supervised sequential subset selection by generalizing metric learning for
subset selection and by tackling the challenge of the lack of pairs of positive
and negative items; and iii) it proposes a multi-modal sequential subset
selection framework to effectively take advantage of all modalities in datasets.
The project brings together tools from sparse and low-rank recovery, convex
optimization, message passing, metric learning and dynamical systems to tackle
the problem. The project also designs objective evaluation methods to measure
the performance of the methods.
