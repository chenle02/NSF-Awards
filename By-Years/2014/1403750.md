Current membrane technology is based primarily on pore size and chemical
functionality. Naturally occurring protein channels far exceed any man-made
engineering pores with selectivities exceeding parts per million and flow rates
10,000 fold faster. The PI proposes to imitate natural protein channel
structures and nanometer scale electrode geometries to increase flow. If
successful, this could potentially revolutionize membrane function by providing
a solution to the long standing trade-off between high chemical selectivity and
high processing rate.

Two promising material platforms are Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Membranes and nm-
scale electrode multilayers on anodized aluminum oxide (AAO). There are three
key attributes unique to Carbon Nanotube (CNT) membranes: 1) atomically flat
hydrophobic graphitic core that induces a near perfect slip layer for dramatic
fluid flow 2) functional chemistry by necessity is at the cut entrances to the
CNT cores for gatekeeper activity and 3) CNTs are conductive allowing for
electrochemical transformation and application of electric field. Needed is a
method to generate fluid flow (with chemical interaction or selectivity) in the
entrance to CNT pores and have the plug flow rapidly transfer down the fast CNT
core. Electro-osmotic pumping is found to have similar flow enhancements as
pressure driven pumping and can accelerate selectively bound species within plug
flow Peptide libraries allow the screening of 109 peptide combinations to find
highly selective affinity chemistry far beyond what is achieved with simple
coordination chemistry. However, strong binding coefficients result in kinetics
too slow for monolayer-based pumping cycles. The PIs have found that modest
voltages are sufficient to release cationic bound rare-earth ions, from high
surface area conductive AAO surface. Multilayer electrodes allow for pumping
cycles to direct strong electric fields in a high porosity AAO system. This
allows for a very general separation system based on rapid cycles of binding
targets to specific peptides at the pore entrances followed by electrostatic
release pumping across the membrane. Due to the large breadth of peptide
affinity libraries, this concept is applied to a large number of commercially
relevant applications in energy storage, energy processing, chemical sensors,
selective pharmaceutical separations, drug delivery and water purification.
Support of this research area will enable many educational opportunities related
to novel nanometer scale materials fabrication, characterization and application
into separations science and engineering.
