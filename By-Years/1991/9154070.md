The study will investigate the power of video in helping middle school students
learn the mathematical bases of change over time. By connecting digitized video
images with powerful analytical software, environments will be created in which
students can construct robust understandings of the relationships among
functions, changes in their values, and accumulations of changes. The plan is to
use video as DATA, a view that renders video an active part of the analysis
process, not merely a motivational ploy. Thus, video becomes a new, flexible
data-collection device that students can use to explore previously-inaccessible
aspects of the world around them and to relate mathematics to science. The
project will produce and experiment with several prototype systems for using
video to provide visible, salient connections between mathematics and science
and to support the learning of basic concepts of change over time. These
systems, coupled with descriptions of the roles they played in students'
learning, will constitute one outcome of the project. In the second phase of the
project, we will design and implement a single system, based on the results of
our experiences with prototypes. The effects of this system will be evaluated by
working with experts in focusing on several key mathematical concepts,
constructing problems that embody the concepts, and comparing middle school
students to college students with respect to these challenges. Through these
activities we will understand the effect of various characteristics of the video
technology on students' learning.
