9361743 McGrew Several 3-dimensional visual display technologies exist, but
there is currently no satisfactory 3D hardcopy technology available. There is a
clear need for archival 3D hardcopy printers in a wide range of fields including
medicine, engineering, architecture and modeling. This Phase I effort is
directed at proving the feasibility of a desktop printer which can record a 3D
hologram pixel-by-pixel at a speed comparable to high-resolution laser printing.
