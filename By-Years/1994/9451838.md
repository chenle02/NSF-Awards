9451838 Makris Instructive experiments in Structural Engineering are to be
conducted by undergraduate students in the Department of Civil Engineering and
Geological Sciences. The scope of this project is the development of laboratory
course in experimental structural engineering in order to expose students to
modern methods. Too large-scale experiments will be conducted. The first
experiment is associated with the Reinforced Concrete Design course and is the
study of the behavior of a reinforced concrete column under static and cyclic
loading. Students will measure quantities of significant importance in
structural analysis and design, such as initial stiffness, yield point, ultimate
strength, dissipated energy, member ductility and stiffness deterioration. The
second experiment is associated with the Reduction of Natural Hazards course and
is the study of determination of damping of a structural component. Students
will conduct oscillatory tests at different frequencies to extract the dynamic
mechanical characteristics of structural component. A capstone project will
complete the course. The objectives in offering the course are twofold: a) to
increase the physical understanding of students, about structural behavior, in a
systematic and comprehensive way that will support and clarify their theoretical
knowledge, and b) to familiarize them with current experimental techniques used
in the state-of-the-art industrial and academic laboratories.
