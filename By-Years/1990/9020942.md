There are considerable research efforts underway in the Southeast which center
on mathematical logic and on its connections with other aspects of mathematics
and computer science. Along with mainstream investigations in set theory,model
theory, proof theory and recursion theory, there are sustained research programs
focusing on applications of set theory in topology, applications of model theory
in algebra, and on applications of logic to topics in theoretical computer
science. This grant will help support a conference to be held at the University
of Florida during March 1991, whose goals are to provide a forum for the
exchange of ideas and results on the leading edge of research in mathematical
logic and its applications to other branches of mathematics, and to facilitate
closer collaboration among individual researchers and among the institutions in
the Southeast.
