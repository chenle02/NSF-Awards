This award to Professors Lipsman, Adams, Herb, Kudla, Li, Rosenberg is made
under the Mathematical Sciences Research Group initiative. It will support
postdocs, graduate students, and visitors in a series of collaborative projects
in representation theory. Specific topics include theta correspondence, dual
pairs, and applications to automorphic forms. The research will deal with
various aspects of the representation theory of Lie groups. Lie groups, named in
honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major
themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for
exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie
groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in
analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum
mechanics and elementary particle physics.
