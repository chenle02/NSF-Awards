This dissertation research in cultural anthropology will examine the relation
between native conceptions of social structure and the organization of
territorial interests among the Bani Sakhr, a tribe located in Jordan. Like
other Near Eastern tribespeople, the Bani Sakhr describe their society as one
composed of genealogically related sections and subsections. Each section
possesses honor, and the section's name and honor are associated with physical
space, property, and borders. In the tribal view honor, territory, and genealogy
occupy the same conceptual space. This project will test the hypothesis that
tribal genealogies as well as conceptions of honor become more elaborate and
exclusive as investment in fixed productive resources increases. This research
is important because the Near East is a critical culture area in the modern
world, and their conceptions of honor are not well understood by the West.
Research which will increase our understanding of their feelings about honor and
lights to their honor will help our society deal with Near Eastern societies on
a beneficial footing.
