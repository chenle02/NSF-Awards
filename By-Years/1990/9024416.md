Rotational magnetization-vector experiments will be conducted with yttrium-
barium-copper-oxide and other type-II superconductors of current interest. These
measurements allow the total vector magnetization of a sample exposed to a field
to be uniquely decomposed into a diamagnetic (shielding) component and a
penetrating (vortex) flux component. The latter component in high- temperature
superconductors has extraordinary rotational properties that reflect and
characterize the strength distribution of the vortex pinning forces which, in
turn, control the critical current. The technique will sample the anisotropous
of the pinning forces as well their energy distribution. The research will
employ, polycrystalline, grain-oriented and single-crystal materials.
