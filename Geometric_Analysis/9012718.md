Two investigators will analyze problems arising from the study of geometric
partial differential equations. One will study questions related to asymptotics
for geometric extrema, including questions about growth properties of entire
solutions of the minimal surface equation and more general quasilinear elliptic
equations. He will also work toward a solution of the long-standing Willmore
conjecture. The second investigator will study the structure of singular sets of
minimal surfaces, asymptotic behavior of harmonic maps near singularities, and
topological types of minimal submanifolds. Both investigators will analyze
problems which involve understanding how partial differential equations act on
minimal surfaces. These equations include derivatives of functions of more than
one variable and frequently have their origins in applied mathematics. Minimal
surfaces are the mathematician's model of common soap films. In recent years the
use of partial differential equations in connection with minimal surfaces has
seen an explosion of research activity.
