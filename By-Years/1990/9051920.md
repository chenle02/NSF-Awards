Equipment is acquired to introduce computer aided data acquisition into
undergraduate electrical engineering laboratories. Computer aided data
acquisition will be introduced in a way that students are not "distanced" form
the hands-on laboratory experience. That is, existing laboratory equipment will
be used to set up experiments and observe initial results; the computer aided
data acquisition will be introduced as the last step to replace manual point-by-
point data collection or copying oscilloscope traces. This approach has several
advantages: students are better exposed to current engineering practice; data is
acquired in a form suitable for analysis and presentation using computer tools;
and laboratory efficiency is increased. The choice of laptop computers and
constructed data acquisition modules is based on the following criteria: 1) The
data acquisition units are easily transportable - thus a few units may serve
several laboratories. 2) Cost effectiveness, because few unites can serve
several laboratories. 3) The small footprint conserves bench space and 4) The
capabilities of the constructed data acquisition modules can be matched to the
demands of undergraduate laboratories.
