This planning project, enabling the development of expertise in Information
Security (IS), involves travel to participating institutions (NSA, Mississippi
State, Iowa State, and Purdue Universities) to consult on undergraduate
curricula enhancement and graduate program development with emphasis on IS.
Seminars of speakers from participating and other institutions will expose the
students to the desired area. Travel to workshops and conferences in IS will
prepare the PIs in understanding the field contributing to establish a network
with people. Training of faculty will be sought through short courses. When
sufficiently prepared in the area, the PIs will seek a full award to develop
infrastructure for education and research in information security.
