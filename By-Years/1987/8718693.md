This investigation will employ the use of a powdered materials (PM) approach to
fabricate superconducting cermet composites with superior mechanical properties.
Initial work will concentrate on developing processing techniques that yield
well bonded cermet composites without degrading the superconductivity of the
ceramic phase. The PI's plan to emphasize hot isostatic pressing and liquid
phase sintering techniques. Subsequent work will examine the influence of
microstructural variables (e.g. contiguity) on properties such as critical
current density and toughness. The PM/cermet approach also presents
opportunities for developing superior joining techniques, which will be
examined.
