A quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) is being used in a range of experiments
throughout the undergraduate curriculum. The extreme mobility, simplicity of
operation, robustness and rapid start-up time of the instrumentation allows
students in the Advanced Freshman Laboratory to determine atomic and molecular
weights. In the Organic Laboratory students carry out a GC-MS of their reaction
product(s) and interpret a cracking pattern, while in the Advanced Experimental
Laboratory the MS is used for quantitative analysis and as an exemplar of
interfacing. In the Intermediate Laboratory, which stresses Inorganic Chemistry,
students take the mass spectrum of ferrocene. Also being developed are: 1)
simple rapid sampling techniques to aid teaching/demonstration; 2) a graphics
package which displays the flight of ions through the quadrupole field; and 3)
experiments which illustrate simple periodic trends and bonding properties.
