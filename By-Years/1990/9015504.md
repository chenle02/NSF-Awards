The two-day workshop will take place following the Western Pacific Geophysics
Congress, on August 28-29, 1990, at Yamanashi University, Japan. The purpose of
the meeting is to discuss and develop a research agenda related to hydrologic
hazards and water resources engineering issues which would be of mutual interest
to United States and Japanese experts. The research topics identified will
provide both countries with the basis on which collaborative research can be
built. The recommendations of the workshop will be published in a report and
disseminated to both countries hydrologic/natural hazards communities.
