Wartburg College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus network
to MIDnet. MIDnet is the midlevel network which supports the academic
institutions located in the western half of Iowa. MIDnet will provide operations
management and information services and it will give Wartburg College connection
to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The university needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.***
