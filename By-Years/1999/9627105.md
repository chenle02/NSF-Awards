distribute a traveling version of their permanent exhibit, Behind the Screen.
The project, which consists of a 4,000 to 6,000 square foot traveling exhibit
and related educational materials, will focus on the science and technology
underlying movies and television, including motion, light and optics, sound,
electricity and magnetism, chemistry, and geometry/trigonometry. The exhibit
also will examine the impact of advances in the technology of movies and
television and the resulting impact on audiences and society. The PI will be
Rochelle Slovin, founding director of the AMMI. Carl Goodman, Curator of Digital
Media, and Richard Koszarski, Head of Collections and Exhibitions, will serve as
exhibit content specialists. The integration of science principles and
activities into the exhibit will be under the direction of Ted Ansbacher, a
physicist who previously served as Director of Exhibits at the New York Hall of
Science. Thom Thacker, Director of Education at the AMMI, will be responsible
for the development of educational outreach material.
