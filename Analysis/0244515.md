Abstract Kalton

In this proposal, the aim is to study a number of problems related to Banach
space theory and its applications. Part of the project deals with the theory of
extensions of one Banach space by another. For example it is planned to study
the problem of classifying those Banach spaces such that every minimal extension
is trivial. This problem can be reformulated as a problem in approximation
theory. It is also planned to study applications to problems in the nonlinear
theory of Banach spaces, related to problems of existence of uniform
homeomorphisms between two Banach spaces or between their unit balls. In a
somewhat different direction the proposer plans to continue his ongoing research
on Rademacher-bounded families of operators with applications to sectorial
operators and semigroups.

The theory of extensions can be considered in the following terms. Suppose we
are given a centrally symmetric solid in three or more dimensions and we are
allowed only to compute its cross-section by a slice in some directions and the
shadow cast by the body in the perpendicular directions. This gives us some
information about the solid, but does not permit complete reconstruction. The
idea of studying extensions is to obtain more complete information about the
body under certain additional conditions. Many questions of importance in
mathematical analysis and applications, although not formally expressed in this
way, can be visualized in terms of extensions. Sectorial operators are of
importance in the basic theory of partial differential equations of evolution
type; such equations are very important in physical applications. Typically a
sectorial operator is a differential operator acting on some suitable space of
functions. By understanding the properties of sectorial operators and the
semigroups they generate one gains a better understanding of the behavior of
solutions of certain partial differential equations.
