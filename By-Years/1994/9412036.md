This RUI grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Cheryl Stevenson at Illinois State University to study anions and
anion radicals of annulene and homoannulenes. These NMR and EPR spectroscopic
studies will make use of deuterium isotopic perturbation techniques. The four
focal point of research are the determination of equilibria between ring-opened
and ring-closed 16 annulene structures, the characterization of the electron
distribution in sigma-bonded 16 - 8 - and 16 - 6 -bisannulenes, the analysis of
the deuterium effect on the splitting of the degeneracy of non-bonding orbitals
of 8 - and 16 -annulenes, and the isotope effect of the solution electron
affinity of pyrene. In this project Dr. Stevenson will conduct spectroscopic
studies on dianions and anion radicals of differently sized annulenes. Her
undergraduate research employs the deuterium isotopic perturbation technique to
investigate their bonding properties and electronic distributions. The
fundamental studies on the isotope effect on orbital splitting and solution
electron affinities will be supported by collaborative theoretical studies.
