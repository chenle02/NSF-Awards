Mathematicians from the Five College Consortium of Amherst, Hampshire, Mount
Holyoke, Smith Colleges and the University of Massachusetts will restructure the
standard three-semester calculus sequence during the next five years. They will
develop a new curriculum in which the four mathematical themes of optimization,
estimation and approximation, differential equations, and functions of several
variables will be stressed from the beginning. These major mathematical concepts
will grow out of exploring significant problems from social, life and physical
sciences. Dynamical systems, discrete time models, Fourier series and partial
differential equations are some of the concepts which will be explored. The
computer will be integrated into the curriculum as a basic conceptual device for
structuring the way students think about problems and what it means to solve
them. A national Advisory Board of mathematicians, a scientist, and an engineer
will contribute ideas, and give overall guidance in the evaluation.
Dissemination will be in the form of team-taught courses, weekend retreats,
summer workshops for area faculty and high school teachers and publication of
the curriculum. These instructional materials will be used at universities,
liberal arts colleges, and high schools. The Five Colleges is providing
significant cost sharing.
