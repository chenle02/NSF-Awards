Chaetetids, the major framebuilders of Middle Carboniferous reef mounds, are
poorly understood biologically. Recent recognition that chaetetids are coralline
demosponges provides a sound basis for better understanding this simple poorly
studied group. Improving our knowledge of these builders of reef mounds, known
hydrocarbon reservoirs of the Carboniferous, has useful economic implications,
as well as basic scientific value. Coralline demosponges with a chaetetid-grade
skeleton are now known to be polyphyletic. Thus, it is necessary to reevaluate
and revise their classification by studying calicle morphology. This study will
address: (1) taphonomic (diagenetic) alteration, (2) "astogeny" (3) possible
polymorphism, (4) ecophenotypic plasticity, and (5) the relationship between
calicle morphology and the primary and secondary skeletons in the three basic
growth forms. Other morphological features, such as the spacing and frequency of
tabulae, will also be addressed. Morphometric analysis of data obtained from
strained and unstained thin sections and acetate peels will be the principal
method employed, combined with available detailed ecological data to determine
the relative importance of the five points noted above. Integration of
information obtained will aid in: (1) establishing a viable taxonomy, (2)
understanding the demise of chaetetid-grade demosponges at the Westphalian-
Stephanian boundary and their pantropical distribution , (3) understanding the
reefal occurrences of Carboniferous chaetetid-grade demosponges, and (4)
evaluating the possible relationship between chaetetids and algal symbionts.
