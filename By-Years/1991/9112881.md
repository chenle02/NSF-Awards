A user mode research program will be carried out principally in electromagnetic
nuclear physics. Research will be carried out at the TRIUMF lab in Canada. The
activities will include: study of (1) pion bremsstrahlung, radiative capture,
and form factor; (2) di-lepton production in nucleon- nucleon collisions; and
(3) di-lepton production following pion capture on the proton. These activities
relate to improved understanding of the structure of pions and nucleon
resonances, with some application to the fundamental interactions of nucleons in
relativistic heavy ion reactions. Experiment development, simulations, data
analysis, interpretation, and related activities will be carried out at Oregon
State University.
