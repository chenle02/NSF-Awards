This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the
general area of instrumentation development in the subfieldof optical
spectroscopy. Recent years have seen significantadvances in light detection
technology and computer processingpower. There are two dimensional array
detectors, e.g. CCDarrays, that are entirely capable of performing as
scientificdetectors. Modern small computers are capable of handling thevast
quantities of data produced almost instantaneously by thesedetectors. The
missing building block in the development of aspectrometer that can take
advantage of these developments is anoptical system capable of two dimensional
imaging. Chromex hasdeveloped a method of producing high quality aspheric
optics. They will use this technology to produce a full.spectrum,multiple.input,
flat.focal.field stigmatic imaging spectrograph. The spectrograph will be small,
90mm focal length, and extremelyrugged. A fiber optic interface will be
developed that will allowup to eight simultaneous inputs. The ability to measure
multiplespectra rapidly and simultaneously will make this device apowerful tool
in many applications.
