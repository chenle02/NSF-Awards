This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Small business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to demonstrate the
technology for a high power; high energy density nanostructured Li-ion battery.
Many of the new applications of lithium ion batteries require high energy and
power densities, quick recharging time, and safe operation at varying ambient
temperatures.

Lithium ion cells are essential building blocks for a wide range of batteries
used in consumer electronics and military applications, as well as in next
generation hybrid electric vehicles. If successful this research will help
provide improved performance for these applications.
