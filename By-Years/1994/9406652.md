9406652 Coe Papua New Guinea is one of the few places where an arc- continent
collision is actively producing a mountain belt, and as such serves as a type
area for present day continental accretion. However, several competing models of
the neotectonics of the region points out the need for more robust data.
Paleomagnetism offers such a tool, that in conjunction with basic geologic
information, can demonstrate the amount, rate and scale of rotations of blocks
during deformation. This work will take advantage of the young sediments and the
on-going deformation to define block size and to demonstrate whether or not
sequential rotations of blocks occurs as each arrives and collides. Results will
help understand behavior and also will be invaluable in parallel studies of the
Finisterre range and studies of the rate and morphology of sea level terrace
uplift along the Papua New Guinea coast.
