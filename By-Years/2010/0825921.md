The research objective of this proposal is to develop methods of model reduction
and feedback control for aerodynamic flows, and in particular surface control of
turbulent flows. The research will result in active flow control methods that
are general enough to apply to nonlinear partial differential models, such as
the Navier-Stokes equations that govern turbulence. The research plan progresses
from the development of reduced order models for the two-dimensional Burgers?
equation that govern a nonlinear convective flow, to unsteady flows governed by
the Navier-Stokes equation. A systematic approach that allows surface actuation
and sensing, such as in control of the air flow over an airplane wing, to appear
in a natural way in the reduced models will be developed. Deliverables include
methods for modeling, analysis, and design, demonstration of the methods via
simulation and/or experimental measurements, and documentation of research
results and engineering student education.

The results of this research will provide an opportunity to integrate feedback
control with active flow control with applications to drag and noise reduction,
lift enhancement, and ultimately the ability to use flow control devices in
place of traditional aircraft control surfaces through separation control or
virtual aerodynamic shaping. Drag reduction will result in improved fuel
efficiency of air and ground vehicles, and therefore increased range, loiter
time, and payload. The research plan is complemented by an educational plan,
with particular emphasis upon the cultivation of a diverse undergraduate and
graduate population and inclusion of under-represented minorities. The plan
includes improvements in essential courses and creation of undergraduate
capstone design projects. Teaching techniques focus on increasing student
involvement in the classroom by integrating teaching and research activities,
utilizing student and mentor teams incorporating graduate and undergraduate
students, and emphasizing both project-oriented integrated systems design and
dissemination of results through presentations and publications.
