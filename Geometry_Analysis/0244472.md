Abstract

The principal investigators will work on two fundamental projects in the field
of geometric analysis. The first project concerns the interrelated analytic
study of rational billiards, moduli spaces of abelian differentials, and the
dynamics of the Teichmuller geodesic flow. A recent theme has been the interplay
between the dynamics on flows on homogeneous spaces on the one hand, and the
dynamics of flows on rational billiards and flat surfaces on the other. This
synergy has led to recent breakthroughs in both subjects. Broadly speaking, the
principal investigators propose to apply the methods and ideas developed in the
case of homogeneous spaces to study rational billiards and dynamics on
Teichmuller space. The second project is to give a combinatorial approach to the
study of Teichmuller Space and its geometry. One of the major goals is to
develop a complete analogue between this theory and the classical theory of the
geometry of the modular curve.

Many natural phenomena are studied via the branch of mathematics known as
dynamical systems. One important example is planetary motion. Another centuries
old example is the theory of billiards, or the study of collisions of molecules.
Triangular billiards occur in the study of elastic collisions of two masses in
an interval. The study of a dynamical system can take many forms. One example is
to study periodic orbits (or repeating behavior); another is to study choatic
behavior. The principal investigators plan to study a variety of dynamical
systems that occur in mathematics. One of the prominent topics will be billiards
in polygons in the plane, and a generalization known as flat surfaces. These
surfaces also fit together into a family known as a moduli space, and the
principal investigators plan to study dynamics on moduli spaces. A major
component of the project will be educational. The principal investigators plan
to give workshops for students, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels,
in order to introduce them to these fields of mathematics.
