This project will test current procedures of using modern sexing criteria on
fossil hominid remains, which has proven to be more complex than previously
believed. The student will test the limitations of using modern bony pelvis
measurements for determining sexual dimorphism in the earliest hominids at the
period of the transition to bipedalism. The student will test the hypothesis
that the greater sciatic notch was probably not related to sexual
differentiation of the pelvis but rather to changes in the pelvis for
bipedality. This research will help paleoanthropologists determine which
sexually dimorphic traits in modern humans and pongids will be strong sex
discriminators in fossil hominids. It will also test assumptions about the
effects on the hominid female skeleton due to increases in infant skull size.
There is current debate over the sexing of fossil hominids and the amount of
sexual dimorphism in specific species. This research project will help in
refining the criteria by which fossils are identified as to sex.
