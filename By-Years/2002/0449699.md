This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Katherine J. Franz at Duke University to
explore the impact of metal ions on the conformation of a-synuclein, the major
protein component of Lewy Bodies, a symptom of Parkinson's Disease. Fluorescence
techniques will be used to monitor metal binding to synthetic peptides relevant
to both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated a-synuclein. Aggregation into
fibrils is characteristic of a-synuclein, and after investigating tractable
synthetic peptides which do not aggregate the methodology will be extended to
fibril-prone peptide segments of a-synuclein. Important skills necessary for
professional development will be enhanced through workshops for graduate
students. Leadership and communication will be highlighted in the workshop
settings, and career strategies and presentation techniques will be addressed as
important topics for graduate student professional development. Duke is
participating in the Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate, and the educational
objectives of the professional workshops planned for graduate students merge
constructively with efforts to reassess the philosophy guiding PhD curricula in
the department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the role of metal ions in
protein conformational preferences and in aggregation processes is an important
goal that is germane to modifying biological systems. Studies of polypeptides
related to alpha synuclein will provide insight into the interactions of metals
with potential metal binding sites along the amino acid
sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
