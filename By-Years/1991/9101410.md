The Center for Analysis of Structures and Interfaces (CASI), a Minority Research
Center of Excellence (MRCE) at City College of The City University of New York,
proposes to increase the number of minority undergraduate students receiving
research training and exposure in its focus areas of research. Avenues for
enhancement of undergraduate participation include (1): placement in associate
laboratories with research activities close to that conducted by CASI. In these
laboratories, as well as CASI laboratories, undergraduate students will be
provided stipends and a modest supply budget; (2) development of a summer
enrichment program for entering freshmen to promote successful launching of
their college lives, thus aiding retention. The summer enrichment program would
have a component activity aimed at aiding students to assess career goals, and
would provide a modest stipend to participants. For graduate student
participation, the Center proposes to increase the number of minority Ph.D.
students it supports by six (for a total of eight) to allow CASI to match
support with the actual number of minority graduate students presently involved
in its laboratories.
