Evolutionary models of dynamics have been a source of robust explanations of
individual behavior in experiments and in the development of social norms. This
project synthesizes these two applications as experiments are conducted on
populations of individuals who choose between idiosyncratic and aggregate
gambles. This research is based upon the work of Arthur Robson which shows that
there are systematic biases in the evolutionary dynamics toward the selection of
idiosyncratic gambles. If these models prove to be empirically robust, then we
can confidently apply these evolutionary models to topics such as understanding
how markets for risky assets have developed.
