This grant is to facilitate travel and cover a small portion of the conference
costs for the symposium on "Advanced Boundary Element Methods--Applications to
Mechanics". The Symposium has the specific goal of bringing together the most
significant and current research into boundary element methods for applications
to solid mechanics and to some degree to fluid mechanics. The principal
investigator has extensive experience in organizing various symposiums. He is
well known in the field of boundary element analysis as a principal developer of
the method and author of numerous publications. Southwest Researoh Institute is
cost sharing the expenditures for the symposium.
