Research in advanced materials and composites requires processing, machining,
and evaluation facilities. Some modern processing and evaluation equipment have
been developed for research in advanced materials at Clemson. Advanced materials
is one of three major research areas in the university's five year plan. This
electrical discharge equipment will provide capability to safely produce
composite parts and test specimens for research projects in the College of
Engineering and the School of Textiles. The equipment will support research
projects in metal, polymer, carbon, and ceramic matrix composites.
