This project here will take the first steps towards a genomic approach to the
analysis of adaptation to environmental extremes in the Piriqueta caroliniana
complex, a novel model plant system. The primary goal develop the methods that
will allow us to identify and analyze the genetic factors that contribute to
adaptation to contrasting environmental extremes, severe drought and saturated
soils, through novel application of microarray analyses to identify
taxonspecific mRNA transcript expression traits. This research has the potential
to benefit the development of drought and flood resistant crops as well as
deepening our understanding of the impacts of global climate change and
potential responses of natural systems.&lt;br/&gt;
