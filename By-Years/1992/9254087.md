This project is developing a new introductory statistics curriculum for science,
engineering, and management students at WPI that can serve as a model for such
curricula nationwide. Focusing on the two goals of teaching students to think
critically about data and having them experience the role of statistics in
scientific investigation, the curriculum has among its key features: division of
the material into one-week modules, each based on a laboratory and project
experience; a complete restructuring of course content emphasizing exploratory,
graphical, and computational approaches to data analysis and inference; and the
incorporation of new teaching strategies. The modular course structure allows
flexibility in customizing the course to student and instructor needs, and
ensures portability to other institutions. The labs and projects provide
students with hands-on experience in using statistical methods in scientific
experimentation, data production, and data analysis.
