This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists are just beginning to
discover the extent to which fluorescence occurs in organisms in nature, and
what roles fluorescence may play in influencing an organism's survival. Our
knowledge has been limited in part because humans can see only a portion of the
spectrum of light, which we term 'visible light'. However, many organisms,
including spiders, insects, and birds, can see ultraviolet light as well, and
may visually communicate using ultraviolet coloration. Masta and Reed recently
discovered that spiders fluoresce in primarily ultraviolet wavelengths when
exposed to ultraviolet light. Fluorescence occurs when molecules called
fluorophores absorb light at one wavelength and then emit light at a longer
wavelength. To better understand fluorescence in this species-rich and
ecologically important group of animals, fluorescence will be characterized and
quantified broadly among spider groups, and in-depth in three species of
spiders. This will allow greater understanding of whether spider fluorescence
may function to communicate information, enabling spiders to attract mates,
evade predators, and lure prey. Fluorophores will be extracted from spiders and
the fluorophores' light-emitting properties determined, testing for differences
by sex and age. This research expands on a novel finding that should open up new
lines of research, and could lead to considerable societal benefits. If
fluorescence helps spiders to lure insects, then it could potentially be
exploited for pest control. Moreover, fluorescent tags derived from substances
in nature have many applications in medicine and biotechnology. By launching the
study of fluorophores in a group of animals that has been completely unexplored
in this regard, initiates a search for novel and biomedically useful chemicals.
This project also includes extensive student research training, as well as
outreach efforts to educate and engage students and the public.
