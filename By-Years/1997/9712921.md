9712921 G. H. Bernstein University of Notre Dame CISE Educational Innovation :
From Bits to Chips: A Multidisciplinary Curriculum for Microelectronics Systems
Design Education This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the development
of an interrelated set of courses from the Computer Science and Engineering
(CSE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) departments that will emphasize both the
technical and human aspects of microelectronics system development. As a part of
the project, students will work in interdepartmental teams to design and
fabricate a working microelectronics system, specifically a microprocessor. The
project builds on particular strengths of the EE and CSE departments at Notre
Dame and the educational plan is symbiotic with ongoing collaborative research
between the two departments in the areas of nanotechnology, processing-in-memory
computer architectures, and circuit and fabrication process optimization. In
addition to bringing research results into the curriculum, it is expected that
ideas from development and implementation of the new courses will also assist
the ongoing research.
