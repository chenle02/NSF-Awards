Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) have become important
tools in research and environmental analysis and management. These techniques
allow for effective hypothesis testing in environmental research. Access to
equipment and training at the undergraduate level are vital to the preparation
of science students for graduate school and future employment. This is
especially critical for minority students who are underrepresented in these
disciplines. In response to this situation, the Dominguez Hills Information
Technology (DoIT) Laboratory is being developed through this project. The
laboratory focuses on the integration of remote-sensing and GIS technologies.
The missions of the laboratory are (l) making available technical training in
the earth and environmental sciences to student groups that traditionally have
not had access to such programs and to future elementary and secondary school
teachers, (2) providing access to remote-sensing facilities and instruction for
students of the four other state university campuses in the southern California
area which cannot be supported by their home departments, including extension
programs; (3) providing area community colleges an avenue for their science
technology students to seamlessly progress into a 4-year academic institution,
and (4) providing access to communications, data and programs now available on
the internet through the recently installed Internet backbone. *
