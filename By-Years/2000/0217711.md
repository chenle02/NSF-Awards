This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of organizational innovation,
learning, and adaptation to technological change. It examines organizational
structures that are relatively new and unstudied alternatives to traditional
corporate R&D programs in pursuit of the development and commercialization of
technology. The study will gather real-time longitudinal data on the adaptation
and selection of organizational programs and practices in the face of
increasingly adverse macroeconomic conditions. This research continues and
expands on exploratory work funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
from NSF.

This research is theoretically grounded, rooted in prior research seeking a
better understanding of how R&D spending may more efficiently translate into the
effective creation and diffusion of innovations. This project was designed and
will be executed in collaboration with research partners in nine technology
corporations: Intel, Sun Microsystems, Adobe, Compaq, Tektronics, Comcast,
Oracle, DOW, and 3M and four venture capital firms. The findings should have
direct practical applicability for all organizations, private and public sector,
that are grappling with technological and strategic change.

A research team composed of faculty, doctoral students, and corporate
collaborators is pursuing five objectives: 1) conducting an historical analysis
of internal corporate venture investing (CVI) arms; 2) developing a typology of
organizational structures for housing and pursuing CVI; 3) delineating the
strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness of these structural alternatives; 4)
identifying "best practices " for pursuing corporate venturing and for codifying
and diffusing these practices; 5) gathering real-time longitudinal data on the
adaptation and selection of CVI programs and practices in the face of
increasingly adverse macroeconomic conditions. Six interrelated studies have
been designed to pursue these objectives. The studies collect varied types of
data (secondary financial and economic data, semi-structured interviews,
organizational documents, and non-participant observations).These data are being
analyzed using varied methods (econometric forecasting, multivariate analysis,
computer-based content analysis, and grounded theory building). The multi-
method, multi-level and multi-theoretic approaches are well integrated with the
overall theoretical approach.
