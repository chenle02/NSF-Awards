9411741 Kolen The focus of this Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant is
to explore the possibility of designing a low cost non-video based motion
analysis system that can be used as a motion analysis tool and/or be
incorporated as a closed loop feedback control scheme for prosthetic motion
control. By obtaining the real-time spatial orientation of individual body
segments, a computer generated rendering of the whole body movement is available
for real-time or post analysis. There is a large potential application for this
type of motion analysis ranging from gait analysis and rehabilitation
performance evaluation, through sports medicine and Olympic training. The
specific activity to be undertaken under this planning grant is the preliminary
study of a single two dimensional sensor module. A follow- on proposal for
research to study a complete magneto- resistive sensor is planned for
submission. ***
