A five-day workshop for 30 mathematics faculty is being conducted to study and
evaluate the impact of computer algebra systems (CAS) on the undergraduate
mathematics curriculum. The focus is on pedagogical issues common to a range of
upper level mathematics courses. This workshop addresses the question: what are
the implications of this technology for the way mathematics faculty structure
individual courses and for the curriculum as a whole? The workshop is directed
toward faculty who have experience using a CAS or other instructional software
in mathematics courses. Materials using computer algebra systems to teach
mathematics effectively in upper division mathematics courses will be created by
participants. These will be shared with participants and other interested
persons.
