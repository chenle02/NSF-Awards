The main objective of the proposed research is to generalize the classical
theory of theta functions for Abelian varieties to polarized Calabi-Yau
varieties, both open (i.e. log) and compact, more precisely: to give a canonical
basis for the vector space of global sections, and a formula for the structure
constants for the multiplication rule in the coordinate ring, expressed in the
canonical basis, determined by counts of rational curves on the mirror. The
existence of such generalized theta functions points to the existence of
geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space, vastly
generalizing the Mumford-Namikawa-Alexeev-Olsson compactificaton of A_{g,d}, and
the Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinski-Alexeev-Olsson theory of the secondary polytope,
and at the same time suggests a synthetic construction of the mirror as Proj of
the canonically described ring. The proposal includes a detailed scheme for
carrying this out in dimension two, and for cluster varieties of all
dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main proposal is that a broad class of
geometric objects, so called Calabi-Yau varieties, come with a natural system of
coordinates. Informally: If you live on a Calabi-Yau variety, there should be
natural, intrinsic quantities in your world, whose values determine your precise
position. As these geometric objects play a fundamental role in diverse areas of
mathematics, these intrinsic quantities should play a similar fundamental role.
More broadly, string theory models suggest that WE live on a Calabi-Yau, and
thus the proposal suggests there are such fundamental quantities, not yet
understood, in our world.
