The staple of the field of observational stellar evolution is the study of the
form of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (stellar surface temperature vs.
luminosity) of star clusters. Using a new wide-field CCD (Charge Coupled Device)
camera and over a two year period, the the Principal and Co-Investigators will
obtain accurate colors and brightnesses of the brighter stars in 50 globular
clusters and place them on a uniform scale. These results will be used to derive
the cluster ages and structural properties of the stars as they evolve off the
"main sequence", become red giants, and ultimately "horizontal branch stars."
