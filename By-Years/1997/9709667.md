University of Delaware The objective of this investigation is to improve our
knowledge of aerosols by estimating and examining atmospheric turbidity.
Turbidity represents the ability of aerosols to attenuate solar radiation. The
objective is to develop and apply techniques for estimating monthly and possibly
daily turbidity from readily available surface-weather and remotely-sensed data,
regardless of cloud cover. Using a high resolution spectral radiation model, the
investigators will parameterize clear sky beam irradiance and integrate the
expression over the day to obtain an equation for estimating potential daily
clear sky beam irradiation. Using daily and monthly averaged data, the plan is
to solve for turbidity at an array of sample weather station locations. By
evaluating data for the 1980s, the method will produce new and more useful
estimates of turbidity trends and variability for the Southern Hemisphere. Plans
are to disseminate these to scientists over the Internet.
