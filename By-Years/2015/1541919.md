This award supports participation in the 24th International Meshing Roundtable
(IMR) on October 11-14, 2015 in Austin, TX. Meshing is the decomposition of
complex objects into simple parts for design, display, and analysis. As
technologies change in computing and computer-aided design and manufacturing the
demand for meshing seems only to increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMR
conference includes four short courses, four invited speakers, and presentations
of reviewed papers, research notes, and posters, and a professional development
session particularly targetting students and postdocs. This award will support
registration and some travel expenses for a dozen students (undergraduate to
postdoctoral, coming from U.S. universities, national labs, or non-profit
research organizations) to exchange ideas with experts from around the world,
fostering collaboration and recognition that can help them launch their careers.
