This project is to develop a meteorology-climatology laboratory that will allow
access to real-time meteorological data for research and teaching purposes. The
laboratory will be developed under the auspices of the Department of Geography
at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and will consist of a local area network
(LAN) comprised of a file server and several workstations, with appropriate
printers and other peripherals attached as shared resources. This laboratory
will be primarily devoted to meteorological data display and analysis using the
NSF-funded Unidata data stream and PC-McIDAS display and analysis software.
Through the campus computing network, the meteorology laboratory will be joined
to a geographic information systems (GIS) laboratory that will allow students to
analyze and display meteorological, climatological and geographic data in non-
traditional ways. The synergistic relationship of the laboratories will create a
unique environment for innovative undergraduate education and research. Existing
courses in meteorology-climatology will be improved by the additional computer
equipment and the expanded capabilities will allow new courses to be developed.
The coupled meteorology-climatology and GIS laboratories will allow an emphasis
on the inseparable nature of the physical world and societal activities in the
department's courses and will provide a model program for other departments
around the country.
