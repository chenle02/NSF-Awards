9424506 Carroll This project will organize extant documents and other related
materials pertaining to the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV). In addition to
facilitating the time-critical development of an in-depth history, this project
will provide the beginning for a self-sustaining digital library for the BEV. As
such it will be the first step in the development of histories of the evolving
Village information systems and a reference model for other community networking
projects.
