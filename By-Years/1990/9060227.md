The construction and expression of a recombinant immunotoxin consisting of a
single chain antibody fused to ricin toxin is proposed. The use of recombinant
DNA technology to design and express immunotoxins has numerous advantages over
current biochemical methods of preparation. These include formation of a
recombinant protein that contains only the sequences required for specific cell
recognition and cytotoxic activity. Prokaryotic expression systems an provide
high yields of uniformly produced protein. Intact ricin contains nonspecific
galactose-binding sites, currently these must be blocked y chemical means in
order to permit the antibody portion of the immunotoxin to selectively target
tumors. Expression of recombinant ricin in E.coli will facilitate the
mutagenesis and screening of genetically modified lectin-deficient ricin
immunotoxins. If biologically active, a recombinant ricin immunotoxin will
permit dissection of the nature of ricin binding and entry into cells, and will
serve as a prototype in the molecular restructuring of other carrier
protein/ricin hybrids.
