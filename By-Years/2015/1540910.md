The proposed workshop will bring together researchers who have contributed both
theoretically and empirically to the concept of innovation as a search of
combinatorial possibilities. From a variety of disciplines (biology, economics,
engineering, management science, archaeology, anthropology, physics,
mathematics) scholars have seriously engaged with the origins and dynamics of
innovation in human societies and organizations, across time and across scale
(from cities to firms to national economies) informed by complexity science The
objective is to assess how useful the concept has been, and whether a general
and formal framework of innovation as search can be built that would be useful
to policy.
