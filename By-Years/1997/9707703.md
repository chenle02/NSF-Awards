The Department of Mathematics and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook will purchase computer equipment
which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used for several research projects in mathematics,
including in particular: computing examples in Riemannian geometry; moving
current investigations in rational dynamics from one to higher dimensions
finding explicit examples of positive area Julia sets investigating the
algebraic structures arising from Nambu mechanics and quantization via symbolic
computations
