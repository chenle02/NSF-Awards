9521743 Perera Graduate student and postdoctoral student participation in
emerging interdisciplinary technologies such as neural networks, sensors, chaos,
artificial intelligence, etc. will be enhanced by providing partial support to
attend international conferences. Participants will be selected from the
attendees at the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE MODELING AND SIMULATION organized by
the "International Association of Science and Technology for Development"
(IASTED) to be held in Columbo, Sri Lanka from July 26-28, 1995 and he students
whose research interests overlap the novel semiconductor Neural Network
Device/Sensor areas. IASTED is an organization whose main purpose is to further
economic development by promoting science and technology, with emphasis on
interdisciplinary areas. This effort of promoting interdisciplinary
technological conferences will help the new generation of scientists and
engineers who need to broaden their expertise beyond their training in a highly
focused area. In addition to participants, scientists and engineers in Sri-
Lanka, a developing country, will also profit from this particular meeting, due
to the exposure to the new research ideas and developments in the western world.
