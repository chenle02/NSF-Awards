9520246 Ossiander Abstract This proposal is directed towards reaching a further
understanding of the probabilistic structure of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin
glass model. Two complementary approaches are indicated. The first approach
involves the use of results about the fluctuation of Gaussian processes to
explain the variability of the partition function and the convergence of the
free energy of the S-K spin glass. Preliminary results suggest that this
approach is quite useful. The second approach involves investigating the weak
convergence of weighted sums of dependent random variables. This will have
immediate consequences for the understanding of the S-K spin glass model, as its
partition function can be represented as the moment generating function of a
weighted sum of dependent random variables. The work of the investigator on this
proposal is directed toward finding relatively simple mathematical models which
provide an accurate description of the complicated probabilistic behavior of so-
called "spin glass" models. Spin glass models provide a theoretical description
of those magnetic systems for which the interaction strengths (coupling
constants) are random. These systems are found in structurally disordered
materials with behavior depending on a threshold transition temperature. The
randomness of the interaction strengths arises because of impurities within the
materials. The theoretical work proposed here promises to provide a better
understanding of the variability in the behavior of these materials when they
are synthesized under different temperature regimes. This research draws on
recent advances in the study of random processes.
