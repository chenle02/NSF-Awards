The very success of the industries that produce information technology and the
pervasiveness of their products and services in people?s daily lives frequently
obscure the mutually reinforcing&lt;br/&gt;roles that industry, government, and
academia play in conducting IT research and its translation into new products,
services, and industries. This project through the National Academy of Sciences
will capture and present for a general audience such phenomena as how much
industry builds on government-funded university research, the long incubation
periods sometimes needed for research to be translated into major industry
activities, the steady work and funding required to get from initial exploration
to large-scale commercial deployment, the interdependencies between research
advances in different subfields, and the complex nature of the IT research
ecology. Because new major IT industries appear on a regular basis and because
our understanding of the key industries and their antecedents continues to
evolve, the regular updates that this project will provide will ensure that a
current picture that includes cutting-edge products and services is available on
an ongoing basis. Earlier depictions by the National Academies of these
phenomena figure have been used repeatedly in presentations to congressional
staff and other decision makers, have been discussed broadly in the research
community, and have been used in economic and policy analyses. This project will
provide a useful resource to decision makers, researchers, and the general
public on the structure of IT research and the roles of industry, academia, and
government in innovation and the creation of IT products, services, and
industries.&lt;br/&gt;
