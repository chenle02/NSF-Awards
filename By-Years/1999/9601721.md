9601721 Goodwin This proposal is a request for funding for a magnetic suspension
balance system. This equipment will be used for two basic types of measurements:
(1) sorption measurements relating to environmental remediation and
bioprocessing problems, and (2) density and vapor pressure measurements on
fluids and fluid mixtures. A major initial focus for this joint work will be on
systems designed to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms in bioremediation of
soils contaminated with volatile organics and other toxic substances. In
addition, bioprocessing applications include measurements on protein ion-
exchange systems and on drying of foods and agricultural products.
