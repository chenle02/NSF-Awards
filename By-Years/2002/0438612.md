A teleconnection, in atmospheric sciences, is a strong correlation of temporal
fluctuations between two meteorological parameters. In this study fluctuation at
each observational point is considered to be the result of the dynamics of an
atmospheric system that behaves in a complex manner. The main goal of this
research is to study the collective behavior of the complete observational
network. This work will extensively focus on the PIs earlier preliminary works
to study in detail (1) the spatial and temporal variability of teleconnections
during the last century in many atmospheric parameters, (2) the relation between
teleconnections in different parameters, and (3) the relation between
teleconnections and various indices such as the Southern Oscillation Index. This
analysis will then be extended to modeled outputs to investigate the mode(s) of
communication between tropics and midlatitudes. Finally, this analysis will be
used to improve the predictive capability by identifying which regions on the
planet are more likely to be affected by an anomaly pattern somewhere
else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The new insights from this study may
help to improve climate predictions.
