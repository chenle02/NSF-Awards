It is widely acknowledged, both in academic studies and the marketplace, that
the most effective form of education is the professional human tutor. A major
difference between human tutors and computer tutors is that only human tutors
understand unconstrained natural language input. Recently, a few tutoring
systems have been developed that carry on a natural language (NL) dialogue with
students. &lt;br/&gt;Our research problem is to find ways to make NL-based
tutoring systems more effective. Our basic approach is to derive new dialogue
strategies from studies of human tutorial dialogues, incorporate them in an NL-
based tutoring system, and determine if they make the tutoring system more
effective. For instance, some studies are determining if learning increases when
human tutors are constrained to follow certain strategies. In order to
incorporate the new dialogue strategies into our existing text and spoken NL-
based tutoring systems, two completely new modules are being developed. One new
module will interpret student utterances using a large directed graph of
propositions called an explanation network, which is halfway between the shallow
and deep representations of knowledge that are currently used. The second new
module uses machine learning to improve the selection of dialogue management
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;The research is thus a multidisciplinary effort whose
intellectual merit lies in new results in the cognitive psychology of human
tutoring, in the technology of NL processing, and in the design of effective
tutoring systems. Improved NL-based tutoring systems could have a broad impact
on education and society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
