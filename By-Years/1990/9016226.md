Dr. Rosemary Wyse at the Johns Hopkins University will use this award to
continue her investigation of the present day kinematics and distribution of
chemical elements of the stars of our Milky Way Galaxy. Over 2000 stellar
spectra have been obtained with support from a prior NSF grant. Observations
will continue, but the emphasis will shift to the analysis of the large data
set. The study of galaxy formation is crucial to obtaining knowledge about the
physics of the origin of structure in the Universe. An understanding of our
Milky Way Galaxy, for which the most detailed data are available, is crucial for
the development and testing of theories of galaxy formation and for the
elucidation of the origins of different morphological types of galaxies. The
Milky Way offers a unique opportunity for study since it is the only galaxy for
which one can determine directly and in detail the true model- independent
three-dimensional structure, kinematics and chemical distributions of the
constituent stellar populations, by study of individual stars. Dr. Wyse's
theoretical modeling of her new observational results will provide new insight
into the structure and the course of the evolution of the Galaxy.
