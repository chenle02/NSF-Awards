The National Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Service Conference supports
community-based efforts contributing to the exploration of the nature,
composition, and execution of NSF supported national scale coordinated
cyberinfrastructure services that are responsive to evolving technologies,
solutions and user needs, with the overarching goal of supporting the full range
of computational- and data-intensive research across all of science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will enable the exploration
national scale coordinated cyberinfrastructure services that support the next
generation of science and research in light of rapidly evolving technology
landscape and increases in capability, which have the potential to change and
transform the future of science. The conference will also directly address
critical issues regarding workforce development and preparedness to support next
general science, including training, education, and developing the next
generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
