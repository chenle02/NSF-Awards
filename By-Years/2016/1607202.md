The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the premier scientific instruments of
our time. It is the world's largest particle accelerator and has achieved the
highest energy of the colliding particles. The observation of a unique
fundamental particle, the Higgs boson, at the LHC in 2012 has opened a new era
of discovery and understanding in particle physics. The group funded by this
award will work on the most intriguing open questions of the field of particle
physics. which studies elementary building blocks of matter and laws governing
their interactions, by studying in greater detail the properties of the Higgs
boson. The predictions of the theory that reflects the best understanding of
these fundamental particles and interactions, the Standard Model, will be
subject to stringent tests, and discoveries of new phenomena, predicted at the
LHC energies by many theorists, are anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High
Energy Physics (HEP) group at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) will
pursue fundamental particle physics research within the Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) experiment at the LHC. The group will investigate properties of the Higgs
boson and how it interacts with the top quark. Several measurements of top-quark
properties and production cross sections are planned. Studies of single and
multiple vector boson production will contribute to understanding of the
structure of protons, clarify the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking,
and may provide hints of new phenomena. Searches for signatures of one of the
most interesting theories that go beyond the Standard Model, Supersymmetry, will
be performed. During the award period, the UNL HEP group will complete its
contribution to the manufacturing, installation and commissioning of the Phase 1
upgrade of the CMS Forward Pixel Detector, and will engage in the development of
the Phase 2 upgrade of this detector. The group will continue making major
contributions to computing, software development, and operations of the CMS
experiment.
