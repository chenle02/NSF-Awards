9531653 Young The proposed conference is in the area dynamical systems with an
interdisciplinary theme. Planned talks cover a spectrum of topics ranging from
Komogorov-Arnold-Moser theory to celestial mechanics. Parts of dynamical systems
have matured in the last few decades with many success stories; a stated aim is
to re-examine the directions of the subject and to encourage possible
interactions with other parts of mathematics and mathematical physics. Dynamical
systems theory has been a very active area with a variety of applications: fluid
motion, various ecological phenomena, and planetary motion are among the more
standard applications. In fact, any reasonably sized physical system varying
smoothly in time can, in principle, be modeled as a dynamical system. The
proposed conference seeks to further identify these physical applications of
dynamical systems.
