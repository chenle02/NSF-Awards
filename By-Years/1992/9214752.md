PROGRAM: Academic Research Infrastructure The Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) program supports 1) acquisition or development of major research
instrumentation, and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional cases,
replacement of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This
proposal from the University of Alaska (UA) requests funds to purchase an
automated mass spectrometer with a gas stripping module. The instrument will be
operated as a shared-use facility to support research efforts of several
scientists at the University and aboard research vessels in the Arctic region.
The instrument will be widely used for nurient cycling studies funded as part of
the Global Change Research Program. Joint funding for this proposal has been
provided by the Directorate of Geosciences. Matching funds will be provided by
the University. //
