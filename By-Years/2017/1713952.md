Commonsense reasoning is the ability for humans to use everyday facts about the
world to support planning. To create a story about a bank robbery, one must have
knowledge of what a bank is, why one would wish to rob it, etc. Artificial
intelligence (AI) agents can learn a lot about the world by reading existing
text sources, such as Wikipedia or narrative. However, the information learned
so far from these sources tends to be explicit, such as, person A was born at
location B. This project will investigate methods that can be used to learn
implicit knowledge from text such as spatial or temporal properties of concepts.
This knowledge can then support many different current challenges in AI, such as
narrative generation. This project will be conducted at Toyota Technological
University under the mentorship of Dr. Makoto Miwa. The collaboration provides
access to unique data that will enable new insights into how humans process
everyday concepts.

Current work on information extraction tends to learn propositions that are
explicitly encoded in text. Implicit information is equally or more important in
giving cognitive agents the ability to reason about the world. Under the
supervision of Dr. Miwa, I will apply machine learning and analogical techniques
to the task of associative concept learning. I will specifically look at low
level qualia related attributes including temporality, space, sentiment,
aesthetics, etc. I will use various corpora in support of this task. Dr. Miwa,
along with his research group at Toyota Technological University, are leaders in
information extraction techniques. Subsequently, Dr. Miwa's insight and
expertise will be an invaluable aid in developing techniques for machine
learning implicit knowledge.

This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
