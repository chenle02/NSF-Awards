The face of emerging computing systems is changing rapidly. On one hand
computers are looking smaller than ever. The smart phone is nothing but a pocket
computer which also has the ability to make a phone call. On the other hand,
computers are getting bigger than ever, as in a cloud computing server. These
cloud systems are distributed systems with a large number of processors,
abundant memory and disks and plentiful network resources and bandwidth, and are
huge. This project is on workload characterization and benchmark synthesis for
emerging computing systems such as the embedded computer and the cloud
computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first component of this project consists in
characterizing and understanding workloads on emerging computing platforms.
Characteristics of embedded computing software in embedded Java or paradigms
such as the .NET, or cloud applications such as Hadoop are not well-understood.
It is also unclear whether next generation cloud servers should use simple
energy efficient processors or more powerful processors geared towards
performance. The characterization component of our project is geared towards
understanding these issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second component of this
project consists of benchmark synthesis to create workload proxies that have
equivalent performance and energy characteristics as the original applications
but without the functionality. These proxy workloads will enable efficient pre-
silicon design exploration and sharing of proprietary
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a broader level, the research creates
mechanisms that enable hardware and software developers to collaborate on joint
product development without fear of loss of intellectual property. It also
trains several graduate and undergraduate students in an important research
area, and influences courses on embedded and cloud computing.
