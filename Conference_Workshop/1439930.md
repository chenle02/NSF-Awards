This is a proposal to provide travel support for U.S. participants in the
conference "Cube complexes and groups", which will be held at the University of
Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark from 7-11 July 2014. (More information on the
conference can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/cubescph2014/) The
conference focuses on an exciting and relatively new collection of mathematical
results and techniques, which have recently proved useful in resolving
longstanding problems. The conference will feature lectures on current research
on these and related topics, and also three short courses aimed at early-career
researchers interested in working in this field. Accordingly, this proposal is
largely aimed at providing early-career mathematicians and graduate students the
means to travel from the U.S. to Denmark to attend the lectures and short
courses and to collaborate with their European counterparts.

The conference is on cubical geometry, broadly construed -- the study of
nonpositively-curved cube complexes and median spaces and their applications in
group theory and low-dimensional topology. The lectures will cover many
different aspects of the topic, including its relationship with geometry,
topology, and discrete mathematics.
