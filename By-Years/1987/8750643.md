This project is to introduce a modern, computer-controlled universal testing
machine into the undergraduate civil engineering and materials engineering
laboratory. By using the computer-controlled machine, the student will be able
to run many similar experiments, thus demonstrating the randomness of data and
the requirement for statistical analysis. Computer analysis will also allow the
student to observe and produce many different types of data presentation.
