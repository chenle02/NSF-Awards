Jacobsen &lt;br/&gt;0112563 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will work on
several closely related subjects that will address important problems with
respect to the structure and chemical and dynamical evolution of the Earth's
mantle. The work will entail a combination of approaches using geochemical
reservoir models that take into account the dispersion in both radiogenic
isotope ratios and parent/daughter ratios in the mantle to obtain a simple
theory that can combine fluxes and residence time estimates from traditional
geochemical reservoir models with mixing times from three dimensional mantle
convection models. Test results for the Nd and Sr isotopic systems demonstrate
the validity of this approach. It is also proposed to combine reservoir models
for isotopic transport and evolution with a parameterized convection model that
will integrate the chemical evolution with thermal evolution. The parameterized
models will include important effects that have only recently been identified,
such as the bending of the lithosphere.
