In this project of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
Division with support for instrumentation from the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities, Prof. L. Ziegler of Boston University will perform time-domain and
spontaneous emission frequency-domain studies on ultrafast dynamics of solutions
and neat liquids. The spontaneous resonance emission of short-lived
photodissociative molecules in high-pressure gases (approaching liquid
densities), liquids, and supercritical phases will be analyzed as a probe of
time scales of solvation, optical dephasing and bath-induced nonadiabatic
effects. Classical Molecular Dynamics simulation and instantaneous normal mode
techniques will be used to analyze the experimental observations. Two extensions
of femtosecond polarization spectroscopy, dispersed optical heterodyne detected
(OHD) birefringence and dichroism of transparent liquids, will be developed. The
role of two-photon absorption resonances in femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy
will be explored. Chemical reactions usually require the elevation of molecules
to excited states of energy. Since the chemistry of molecules under conditions
of high pressure, in solution, or embedded in a solid matrix or in a cluster is
affected by their environment, it is important to know and understand these
changes in order improve the technology based on chemical reactions. The
research undertaken in this project will provide a data base and theoretical
model for the reaction kinetics and dynamics of well characterized molecules
which are embedded in a condensed phase medium. It also helps in the
understanding of the outcome of many types of light-initiated chemical events.
