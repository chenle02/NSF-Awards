ADVANCED MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY

This award supports partially the participation by 20 American faculty and
researchers in the Engineering Foundation Conference, "Advanced Membrane
Technology", being held in Barga, Italy, from October 14 to 19, 2001. The
conference brings together leading researchers in the areas of new membrane
synthesis and membrane-process applications. It highlights new developments in
the field as well as research opportunities for the future. It brings together
both academic and industrial researchers from throughout the world. Topics range
from membrane synthesis through separation processes for liquids and for gases
to membrane reactors.

Funding is provided to support partially participation costs of some invited
speakers and particularly of junior-faculty, post-doctoral, graduate student
attendees from the U.S. The impact of this award is not only its direct
contribution to further development of effective membrane separation processes
but also its stimulus in bringing academic U.S. researchers into productive
contact with industrial and international colleagues.
