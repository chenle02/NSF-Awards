Dr. Rothschild's goal continues to be the elucidation of the active transport
and energy transduction system of light-driven proton transport by the membrane
protein, bacteriorhodopsin (bR). A combination of techniques will be used that
include Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) difference spectroscopy, isotopic
labelling and site-specific mutagenesis. FTIR-difference spectroscopy is
sufficiently sensitive to detect and characterize small molecular alterations
which occur in bR. An extensive series of bR mutants will be examined in
collaboration with Dr. Khorana's laboratory. The photocycle of these mutants
will be characterized by UV-visible absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy.
In addition, several new spectroscopic methods will be used to study bR by FTIR
under more physiological conditions. The light-driven proton transport carried
out by the membrane protein bacteriorhodoprin is also characterized by an energy
transduction process. Despite extensive research on bR and other membrane
transport proteins, the molecular basis of these processes is still unknown.
FTIR spectroscopy can probe the molecular dynamics of biomolecules at the level
of single chemical groups.
