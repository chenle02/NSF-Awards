The inherent speed of computers means that geographic research or experiments
which used to take days or weeks to complete, can now be done in minutes or
hours. The speed of computer mapping and spatial analysis has meant that topics,
experiments, and procedures which were impractical for laboratory activities in
the past, can now be added to the undergraduate curriculum. Furthermore, a
knowledge of computer technology specific to geography is becoming essential for
employment in the field and entry into graduate education. A comprehensive plan
has been developed for a Computer Mapping/Spatial Analysis Lab at the University
of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. The lab contains the microcomputer resources which are
specific to the discipline of geography. As part of this plan, the expertise,
data bases, map boundary files, documentation, exercises, statistical packages,
and telecommunications networks required to fully integrate this technology into
all our specialized courses for majors and minors have been acquired. Some of
the necessary hardware has also been obtained through extramural funding. This
proposal provides enough microcomputer hardware and software to make the
technology readily available to all students throughout their entire
undergraduate careers. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
