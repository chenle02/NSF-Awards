This project is to determine the origin of magnetite deposits at El Laco, Chile
through a detailed field and isotopic study. The results will be used to develop
a genetic and exploration model for the origin of REE-enriched iron oxide
deposits worldwide. The apparent contrast in size and tectonic setting of
Proterozoic and Phanerozoic deposits of this class raises the larger issue of
tectonic setting and crustal evolution in the formation of large- scale
mineralizing systems, and relates this project to the fundamental question of
what it is that makes a world-class ore deposit.
