Engineers are today faced with unprecedented design challenges and opportunities
involving novel applications and new engineered materials. Often there is only a
limited knowledge base available to guide these designs. Other than certain
specialized concepts from optimization, a general and useful theoretical
framework for design is lacking. A rigorous mechanics theory that is capable of
identifying alternative global strategies for a complex problem would be very
useful to design engineers. Some preliminary success had be forthcoming in an
attempt to develop new theory and tools to help engineering discover such global
design strategies. The design alternatives are generated by seeking a set of
global design modification patterns which induce mutually orthogonal changes in
the system response. Each orthogonal direction is termed a canonical design
direction. This proposal requests support to continue to test the beams were
based on the RITZ method and symbolic computation (MACSYMA). A finite element
implementation of the method and explore its use in continuum problem will be
developed. This work will include investigation of approaches to global
optimization, optimization of topology, and visualization of design/response
relations.
