9315334 Rinehart This award supports a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Bioorganic Marine
Chemistry, scheduled for July 1994 in Shizuoka, Japan. The co-organizers are
Professor Kenneth Rinehart, Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois, and
Professor Kazuo Tachibana, Department of Chemistry, Tokyo University, Tokyo,
Japan. The seminar will focus on (1) marine microorganisms as sources of drugs,
toxins, and biochemical agents, (2) isolation and structure determination of
bioactive compounds from marine organisms, especially anticancer and antiviral
agents, (c) pharmacological evaluation and mode of action of bioactive marine
natural products, and (d) marine chemical ecology. The United States and Japan
are world leaders in marine bioorganic research. This seminar will provide an
opportunity for scientists in the field of chemistry, pharmacology, and
pharmacognosy from the two countries to exchange information and develop
research agendas for the future. ***
