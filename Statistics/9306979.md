The research entails methods of modelling extra-variation in complex survey
data. Approaches include complete probability distributions with applications to
unequal cluster sizes and longitudinal data. Overall, the intention is to
establish models which are applicable to national surveys such as the `High
School and Beyond' and `National Crime Victimization Survey' projects.
