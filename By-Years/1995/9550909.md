The university has made a strong commitment to improving its undergraduate
program in chemistry by increasing the coverage of molecular structure analysis
in the lecture and laboratory components of the curriculum. The specific aim of
this project is to fund the acquisition of a multinuclear 200-MHz NMR
spectrometer that has indirect detection and variable temperature capabilities.
The new spectrometer can dramatically improve student access to a FT-NMR
spectrometer for laboratory projects. It allows us to develop pertinent and
original experiments to reinforce the chemical concepts being taught in the
lectures. Implementation of this proposal directly affects six courses offered
in the chemistry/biochemistry curriculum. In addition, five faculty members have
a demonstrated need for this instrument in their own undergraduate research
programs, which involve numerous students throughout the summer and during the
academic year. This addition is having an immediate and meaningful impact on the
undergraduate education that is provided and can ultimately lead to substantial
improvements in the laboratory curriculum.
