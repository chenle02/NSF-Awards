9401272 Mason This award is concerned with the theory of rational orbifolds as
part of the broader, and currently very active area, of vertex operator algebras
and their representations. It is closely associated to 2-dimensional conformal
field theory. The principal investigator will examine questions of modular-
invariance of partition functions, the construction of twisted sectors, and the
general phenomena of higher genus orbifolds. Methods include ideas from vertex
operator algebra theory, modular forms and group theory, all of which play a
role in the so-called Moonshine. Conformal field theory is an important physical
theory describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter
physics and classical motions of strings in string theory. Besides its
importance in physics, the beautiful and rich mathematical structure of
conformal field theory also has interested many mathematicians. New relations
between different branches of mathematics, such as representations of infinite-
dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves, the
Monster sporadic group, modular functions and modular forms, elliptic genera,
and knot theory, is revealed in the study of conformal field theory.
