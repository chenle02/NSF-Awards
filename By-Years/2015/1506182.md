Astronomical observations have shown that virtually all massive galaxies can be
expected to have a supermassive black hole residing at their center. Surrounded
by dense star clusters, these black holes will frequently capture stars into
highly eccentric orbits. A fraction of these stars will be compact objects:
stellar mass black holes or neutron stars. As these compact stars orbit, they
radiate gravitational waves, causing the orbit to decay and the star to
eventually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole. The emitted radiation is
potentially observable in future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The
theoretical work funded by this award will provide better understanding of the
expected signals from highly-eccentric compact merging binaries. Detection of
gravitational waves from such extreme-mass-ratio binaries will provide a unique
strong-field test of gravity and a probe of the nature of black holes. This
award contributes to scientific workforce development through the involvement of
graduate students and the training they receive in physical modeling,
mathematical analysis, and numerical and computational
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In greater detail, the primary research efforts
associated with this award are: (1) refined development of two accurate
mathematical and numerical gravitational self-force methods, and the associated
computer codes, that are useful for computing gravitational waves from merging
compact binaries with small mass ratios and highly eccentric orbits; (2) using
one such method to make highly accurate comparisons of calculated gravitational
waves with the distinct and complementary post-Newtonian approach; and (3) using
the second numerical self-force method to calculate the orbital decay,
gravitational wave emission, and merger of eccentric binaries in the late stages
of their orbital decay.
