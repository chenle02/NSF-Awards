This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The project will employ a sophisticated meteor radar at the
Brazilian Antarctic station Comandante Ferraz on King George Island for a number
of synergetic research efforts of high interest to the international aeronomical
community. The location of the radar will be at the tip of the Antarctic
Peninsula - at a critical southern latitude of 62 degrees - to fill a current
measurement gap from 54 to 68 degrees south. The radar will play a key role in
Antarctic and inter-hemispheric studies of neutral atmosphere dynamics, defining
global mesosphere and lower thermosphere structure and variability (from 80 to
105 km) and guiding advances of models accounting for the dynamics of this high-
altitude region, including general circulation models, and climate and numerical
weather prediction models. The unique radar measurement sensitivity will enable
studies of: (1) the large-scale circulation and planetary waves, (2) the tidal
structure and variability, (3) the momentum transport by small-scale gravity
waves, (4) important, but unquantified, gravity wave - tidal interactions, (5)
polar mesosphere summer echoes, and (6) meteor fluxes, head echoes, and non-
specular trails, a number of which exhibit high latitudinal gradients at these
latitudes. This radar will support extensive collaborations with U.S. and other
scientists making measurements at other Antarctic and Arctic conjugate sites,
including Brazilian scientists at C. Ferraz and U.S. and international
colleagues having other instrumentation in the Antarctic, Arctic, and within
South America. Links to the University of Colorado in the U.S., Instituto
Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) in Brazil and Universidad Nacional de La
Plata in Argentina will provide unique research opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students in the U.S. and South America.
