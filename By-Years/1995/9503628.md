9503628 Dolan The Pis will carry out a sidescan bathymetry and geophysical
survey of the Puerto Rico Trench (PRT) and northern slope to map the zone of
active collision at the N. American/Carribean Plate boundary. Key questions to
be addressed include: Does the main ridge form a boundary between more deformed
and less deformed seafloor? Is it a subducting feature and how much of it is
subducted? What's the relationship of thrust and strike-slip faults? The study
will provide a better understanding of the seismogenic potential of this
submarine deformation zone that lies within 150 km of the island of Puerto Rico.
