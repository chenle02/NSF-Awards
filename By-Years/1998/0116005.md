The project aims towards developing a unified on-line experimental methodology
combined with simulation to determine the dynamic performance of complex
structural systems, such as reinforced concrete building with masonry infill
walls. The methodology will be developed in the framework of mixed-variable
(diakoptics) pseudodynamic (PSD) approach combined with substructuring.
Moreover, advanced sensors (e.g. fiber optic strain gages and grid-based
pressure sensors) for distributed measurements to monitor complex structural
systems is an integral part of the proposed research and education project. The
detailed monitoring of the structural response is essential for feedback control
during the developed diakoptic PSD testing methodology. Ultimately, this
methodology will be verified using benchmark data from dynamic experiments of a
generic hybrid system consisting of bare frames and an infilled frame connected
by a reinforced concrete slab. The PSD testing methodology will be
simultaneously applied to the main substructures of this generic hybrid system,
namely the flexible bare frame as one physical substructure and the stiff
infilled frame as another physical substructure with the connecting slab as a
simulated substructure. The success of the project will lead to advances in
experimental research on large-scale structures and recommendations on use and
distribution of advanced sensors to monitor the dynamic response of complex
structural systems.
