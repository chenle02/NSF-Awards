This REU site in ecology, behavior and evolution will provide undergraduates
contemplating a career in the biological sciences with 1) an introduction to
current research in the areas of soil ecology, plant and insect ecology and
evolution, plant physiology, and behavioral ecology; 2) the opportunity to
conduct original research in a supportive, interactive environment; 3)
instruction in the planning, execution, and interpretation of research in the
areas of ecology, evolution and behavior. Students will be recruited with
special attention to encouraging participation of groups underrepresented in the
biological sciences.
