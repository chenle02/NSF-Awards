Single crystal X-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal X-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the molecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis. This award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at University of Missouri Columbia acquire a new X-ray diffractometer
system and purchase an upgrade of the existing diffractometer. Among the areas
of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following:
l. Bifunctional Chelates of 105 Rh and 199 Au as Potential Radiopharmaceuticals
2. Late Transition Metal u-Oxo and u-Imido Complexes 3. Nitrosamine Chemistry
and Carcinogenesis 4. New Ozonide Chemistry 5. Intramolecular 4+3 Cycloadditions
and Molecular Clefts 6. Use of Functionalized Surfactants and Cyclodextrin in
Chemical Analysis 7. Structural Studies of Peptide Mycotoxins and Siderophores
8. Reactivity of Quasi-Aromatic Metal Rings 9. Direct Measurement of Electron
Density Distributions in Crystals
