Abstract Proposal No: 9710553 Proposal Type: Investigator Initiated Principal
Investigator: Philip C. Wankat Affiliation: Purdue University This grant is
awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Philip C. Wankat at Purdue
University. The research will evaluate a new method for the regeneration of
adsorption columns. The method uses hot pure adsorbate vapor to heat the column.
The latent heat available in the vapor is used to heat the column when the
adsorbate vapor condenses on the adsorbent. A cold inert purge gas is used to
purge the adsorbate out of the hot bed. Unlike normal steam regeneration, the
heating and purge steps are decoupled. Pure adsorbate is recovered from the
purge gas by condensation. The purge gas is cleaned in a newly regenerated bed
and recycled. Solute movement theory (local equilibrium analysis) and numerical
solution will be used to predict regeneration. Regeneration of adsorbents is an
energy intensive step that controls the cost of commercial systems. The proposed
technology should significantly reduce energy requirements, improve regeneration
rates and enhance process efficiency. This would have an impact on various gas
adsorption and separation technologies.
