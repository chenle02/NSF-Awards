As of February 2018, there were 8.6 million registered victims of the Colombian
armed conflict. This means that roughly one in six Colombians is recognized by
the state as a victim of violence. This project proposes an investigation into
the politics of victimhood in Colombia?s transitional context: Why are some
victim claims seen as more legitimate than others in the eyes of the state,
human rights actors, and conflict-affected individuals? How does the state
produce the category of victim through its bureaucratic processes and how must
conflict-affected individuals perform it in order to receive recognition and
access benefits? And what are the implications of these constructed hierarchies
for theories and experiences of justice during transitions from violence? These
questions apply not only to the Colombian peace process, but also to justice
dilemmas that arise in transitions from armed conflict worldwide.

Through interviews and discourse analysis, the project aims to understand how
different actors who influence conflict-affected individuals? experiences of
justice make sense of their power. Ethnographic observation will shed light on
what the status of ?victim? means to those who vie for it or refuse it. It will
also examine what individuals have to do to become recognizable as victims in
the eyes of the law and the state. The goal of this inquiry into the evolution
of the status of victims as political actors is not to reify this category, but
to interrogate it and explore its political use by various actors during
transitions from violence.
