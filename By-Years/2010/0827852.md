CBET-0827852&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the
use of a model protein system which has never been used before as a scaffold in
nanobiotechnology. While the Principal Investigator (PI) has already established
this expression system in the PI?s laboratory, and has demonstrated its ability
to hold model drug molecules, this project still contains a number of untested
ideas. Further research needs to be performed to establish the feasibility and
kinetics of drug release, drug encapsulation efficiency, incorporation of
multiple types of drug molecules, and the ability to modulate protein assembly
and disassembly.
