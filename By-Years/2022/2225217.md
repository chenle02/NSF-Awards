With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 1 Pilot Project aims to develop and test
a novel approach to retain undergraduate students who are at-risk of academic
failure in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) studies. To train
the next-generation STEM workforce in the numbers needed to meet projected
demand, it is critical that we find ways to keep academically at-risk students
on track to complete their studies. This is especially true for the 96% of CUNY
Bronx Community College (BCC) students who are students of color: Hispanic and
Black students are more likely to switch out of STEM majors, drop out of STEM
courses, and/or leave college altogether. The 13th Credit Pilot Project builds
on a First Year Seminar program with evidence of effectiveness and refocuses it
on STEM success for underrepresented students at-risk of academic failure as
part of a comprehensive package of interventions (e.g., Course-based Research
Experiences, faculty mentoring, peer mentoring, and cohort development). In
doing so, it may provide a blueprint for other colleges struggling to improve
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 13th Credit Pilot Project includes a research
component that examines to what extent the provision of robust, rigorous science
enrichment, usually available only to the highest-performing students, affects
the outcomes of Hispanic students, students of color, and students from low-
income households who are at-risk academically. Project implementation is
expected to increase studentsâ€™ GPA, credit accumulation, persistence in college,
persistence in STEM majors, graduation from college, and graduation with STEM
degrees. The PI will share findings across the College to foster further
expansion and development of the model. Additionally, the PI will share findings
at NSF project director meetings, annual CUNY conferences, professional
conferences such as the National Conferences on Undergraduate Research (NCUR),
American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), and League for Innovation in
Community Colleges, and in professional journals, as well as disseminating
materials on a BCC website. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM
education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI. Program
will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these
aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
