This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Thomas Thompson, a 274? general purpose Global research vessel and the R/V
Clifford Barnes, a 66? general purpose Coastal vessel. Both vessels are operated
by the University of Washington as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The award includes five items:

1) XBT launchers and MK21 USB DAQ 2) Spare sensor suite for R.V. Barnes CTD
system 3) 300 kHz LADCP, for use on either R.V. Barnes or R.V. Thompson 4) Bongo
net 5) SBE19+ CTD profiler/SBE55 six bottle carousel

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. Both of these
vessels play an important role in outreach and educational opportunities in the
Puget Sound Area.
