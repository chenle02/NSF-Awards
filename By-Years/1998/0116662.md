With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California in San Diego will
acquire a High Resolution Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) transition metal-mediated chemistry
of alkynes; b) the development of novel peptidomimetic structures with
interesting biological properties; c) the use of directed chemical synthesis to
elucidate problems in physical organic chemistry; d) the development of
fluorescent chemosensors; and e) the preparation of large and small metal
clusters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results
from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including the
development of new catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;
