This award funds the research activities of Professors Eric D'Hoker, Michael
Gutperle, and Per Kraus in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCLA.

Decades after its discovery, string theory remains a vibrant subject, continuing
to shed light on fundamental problems in physics. The basic principles of string
theory remain mysterious, as does its precise role in explaining observable
physical phenomena, yet its power as a conceptual and computational tool is now
well established and being applied to a wide range of topics, from pure
mathematics to particle physics and condensed matter. In their research,
Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus seek to advance the understanding of the
precise formulation of string theory; to shed light on fundamental problems
involving black holes and quantum gravity; and to apply techniques of
gauge/gravity duality to novel situations in quantum field theory, including
those relevant to condensed matter physics. This project is aimed at having
significant broader impact. Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus will be
conducting research in a highly collaborative manner involving graduate students
and postdocs, thereby providing critical training for physicists in the early
stages of their research careers. Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus also
plan to disseminate the results of their research by presenting seminars,
colloquia, and public lectures, including at high schools and summer schools.
Additionally, they are involved in advancing education, outreach, and
interdisciplinary collaboration.
