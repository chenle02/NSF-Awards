With this award the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.
James D. White of the Department of Chemistry at the Oregon State University.
Dr. White will focus his efforts on six areas of synthesis of heterocyclic
natural products. The proposed research is directed towards the chemical
synthesis of certain, specified target structures with the objective of
advancing the present state of knowledge of the principles of organic synthesis
and their application in the design of routes to complex molecules. The research
is focused on the synthesis of heterocyclic systems that present a significant
challenge to contemporary methodology. The specific areas towards which the
synthetic effort will be directed include >-lactams (especially antibiotics of
the carbapenem group), alkaloids of the prianosin family which possess
significant cytotoxic activity, a structurally unique set of arachidonic acid
metabolites related to leukotriene, and a member of the nonadride group that
exhibits hepatotoxic activity.
