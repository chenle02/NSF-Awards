9704434 Ji This project lies in the general area of harmonic analysis.
Specifically, the investigator is to determine the Martin compactification of
symmetric spaces and study their topological properties along with those of
other types of compactifications including the Satake compactification. The
tools to be used include asymptotics at infinity of the heat kernel. Symmetric
spaces arise from continuous symmetry groups known as Lie groups. These spaces
are particularly appealing in that they come equipped with many natural self-
symmetries. In addition, they provide a fertile ground for interaction amongst
various branches of mathematics including algebra, analysis and geometry.
