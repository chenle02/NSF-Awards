Geosciences Careers for Kids and Parents is a Track 1 program by Jim Metzner
Productions (JMP) that uses its current communication platforms - the Pulse of
the Planet (PoP) radio programs and website and the Kids Science Challenge
website - to involve upper elementary children and their parents/caregivers and
other adults in learning about geosciences research and careers. JMP's award-
winning PoP radio program, which reaches 1,000,000+ listeners weekly, profiles
geoscientists and encourages parents to involve their children in the
geosciences. The PoP companion pulseplanet.com website provides podcasts of past
radio programs and additional resources for engaging learners in the
geosciences. On JMP's Kidsciencechallenge.com website, children(8-13 years of
age) will find "kid friendly" profiles and videos of geoscientists and their
careers, rich resources and interactivity on the sciences and further career
activities, presented as part of a project that has already actively engaged
thousands of children in learning about and "doing" science. The Pulse of the
Planet and Kids' Science Challenge websites receive an average of 9,600 page
views daily. PBS television's The News Hour and the PBS education site will
feature our video segments on geoscientists featured in PoP programs.
