This project is oriented toward the problem of high density storage of data.
The past few decades have witnessed a rapidly growing demand for efficient data
storage systems. Advances in computer technology have driven the ever increasing
need for higher data storage densities and data transfer rates from systems such
as magnetic and optical disks, and magnetic tape. Many of these needs have been
met by improvements in read/write heads, media technology, and advanced actuator
and tracking systems. Improved signal processing and coding techniques have also
played an important role and offer tremendous potential for providing even
further improvements in data transfer rates, storage capacity, and reliability
of data storage systems. This research focusses on providing such improvements
through the use of joint error correction/modulation coding, joint
source/modulation coding, and multi-track recording techniques.
