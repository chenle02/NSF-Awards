Congestion as occurs in waiting lines or queues (as found in telecommunications,
retailing, ATM's, etc) is the focus of this research proposal. The proposal
builds on a new statistical inference method -- "Queue Inference Engine (QIE)"
-- that computes statistically unbiased estimates of virtually all relevant
queue performance measures from the transactional data alone, with no queue
observation or parameter estimation required. The project builds on earlier work
in four ways (1) to derive various bounds and approximations that speed
computation and facilitate analysis of very congested systems; (2) to create new
queue inference algorithms in more complex settings; (3) to derive the
equivalent of statistical confidence limits on the QIE results, so that one can
know a priori required sample sizes; and (4) to attempt to create a server
allocation or scheduling algorithm within the QIE framework, that would be data
intensive, essentially parameter free and would reflect accurately transient
operations.
