Many insects are equipped with eyes and brains that have the potential for color
vision, the ability to distinguish wavelengths of light from one another
regardless of intensity or brightness. This results from the expression of
different kinds of light sensitive visual pigment rhodopsin molecules in
photoreceptor cells. Butterfly visual systems have tremendous physiological
variation in the sensitivity of their green- and red-sensitive rhodopsins to
light. Like other visual pigments, red-sensitive rhodopsins may confer some
adaptive advantage to those organisms that have them, such as in the detection
of flowers, host plants and mates. Unlike the UV-, blue-, or green-sensitive
visual pigments found in most arthropods, not all butterflies or insects have
evolved red-sensitive pigments perhaps because of some basic constraint or
metabolic cost of producing them. The proposed project will involve the
characterization of opsin genes from a large number of nymphalid butterflies
whose visual pigment absorption spectrum maximum has been measured, and whose
taxonomic relationships are already known from independent molecular and
morphological data. The data will be used to identify functionally important
amino acid substitutions that are responsible for physiological shifts in
sensitivity to light. The project will involve international collaborations and
provide multi-level integrative training for a postdoctoral and graduate student
in vision research, and includes an undergraduate outreach component, whereby
undergraduates will be trained in basic molecular biology techniques in the PI's
lab. The work will be of interest to workers in behavioral ecology, sensory
biology, machine vision and comparative functional genomics.
