The research focuses on developing millimeter-scale robotic tools with force
feedback and tele-taction for performing tissue manipulation for minimally
invasive remote surgery. Key elements of the project are: (1) prototyping of
millimeter-scale robotic hands for teleoperation in minimally invasive
procedures; (2) modeling and manipulation of compliant tissue; and (3)
millimeter scale teletaction. The research program will be carried out on a
telesurgical workstation incorporating millimeter-scale robots equipped with
force and tactile sensing, larger positioning robots for holding the
instruments, and a surgical interface including a bi-manual surgical master with
tactile displays and force feedback . For the purposes of training and procedure
rehearsal, the surgeon will be able to try out his/her actions on the surgical
master using the simulator before implementation. In the first year of the
project, surgical procedures like blunt dissection, catheterization, suturing
and anastomosis will be explored. In the second year the system prototypes will
be tested on procedures such as dissection of the peritoneum and suturing of ex-
vivo stomach tissue. In the third year, a complex procedure, known as Nissen
undoplication to control stomach reflux, will be tried as proof of the entire
system.
