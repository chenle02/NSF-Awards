This project focuses on a plan to develop building blocks for a ligand type that
has been shown to provide metal complexes possessing unique reactivity,
N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. NHCs are being exploited as ligands for a
variety of transition metal catalysts, in a number of cases possessing better
reactivity than ligands investigated previously. They have been shown to be
instrumental in a number of important reactions the most important of which may
be olefin metathesis. Additionally, NHCs have demonstrated activity in the area
of nucleophilic catalysis. This work will develop approaches to provide building
blocks that facilitate the synthesis of a variety of different NHC ligands. The
methods developed in this work will facilitate the synthesis of a wide variety
of N-heterocyclic carbenes and an even larger number of transition metal
complexes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program
is supporting the research of Professor Scott R. Gilbertson in the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Houston. Professor Gilbertson's research efforts
revolve around the development of new ligands for catalysis. The discovery of
new catalysts is often limited by the availability of new ligands. Consequently,
the development of chemistry that provides access to new ligand types is
important. New and efficient catalysts are critical in the manufacturing of many
products, including therapeutic agents, agrochemicals, and commodity chemicals.
