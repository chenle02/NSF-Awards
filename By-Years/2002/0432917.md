This proposal is an exploratory study of the effects of network topology on the
dynamics of collective action. The one-year project will involve three core
activities: a series of computational experiments using agent-based models,
curriculum development for a new graduate seminar, and organization of an
international interdisciplinary workshop. The proposal shifts attention to the
configuration of social ties through which participation in collective action
can propagate as a cascade. The proposal also bridges the disciplinary gap
between the study of dynamical systems and game-theoretic models of collective
action, by using computational methods developed for modeling cascades on large
networks to explore how the structure of social ties can affect the spread of
participation in collective action in heterogeneous populations of boundedly
rational actors. The proposed workshop will promote the exchange of theoretical
ideas, skills, and methodologies between social and natural scientists working
on similar problems but with minimal mutual awareness or appreciation of
potential synergies and no common language for communicating ideas or results.
In the longer term, the graduate curriculum developed in this project will help
to train a new generation of social scientists in the use of computational
modeling techniques that are just beginning to migrate over from the natural and
computational sciences.
