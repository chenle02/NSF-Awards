This research will develop a simple ecosystem model which will account for
observed f ratios in pelagic marine ecosystems during both steady state and non
steady state conditions. The central hypotheses of the model are as follows: (1)
Production is controlled by a single nutrient, the identity of which is
determined by the nutritional requirements of the phytoplankton community and
the ratio of allochthonous nutrient inputs to the system. (2) The size spectrum
of the phytoplankton community is a critical determinant of the f ratio. Large
cells are associated with a high f ratio, and small cells are associated with a
low f ratio. (3) Marine pelagic ecosystems naturally evolve toward a condition
in which stability is maximized. Work carried out to date indicates that maximum
stability is associated with low f ratios, i.e. in the range 0.05 0.1. Nutrient
pulses are expected to shift the f ratio to larger values because under steady
state conditions the large celled phytoplankton are always growing at a low
relative growth rate, and the small celled phytoplankton are growing at a high
relative growth rate. The principal long term goal of this research is the
development of a simple model of the f ratio which can be embedded into much
larger ocean-atmosphere models to explain the production and export of organic
carbon from the euphotic zone. A secondary goal of this work is the development
of a theoretical framework with which to reconcile various measures of the
productivity and turnover of pelagic marine ecosystems, i.e., differences
between gross photosynthesis and net photosynthetic production of particulate
carbon.
