This project investigates novel algorithms for database processing in
multicomputer systems. Parallel architectures for database processing need to
incorporate both parallel processors (CPU's) and parallel I/O (disk access)
capability. This research is focused on a boolean n-cube connected architecture,
with a disk attached to each node, thereby providing parallel I/O. The need to
support parallel I/O gives rise to two important issues: data combination and
non-uniform data distribution. Since the cube interconnection subsumes many
other structures such as trees, rings, etc., this property is exploited to
efficiently support data combination in a variety of database operations such as
Selection, Aggregation, Join, and Projection. The research involves both
analytic and simulation study of various database operations under a variety of
initial and intermediate data distribution conditions, using a 64-node
hypercucbe. Modern fabrication techniques make it possible to produce hundreds
or even thousands of computing elements (processors) at low cost. The
significance of this research is that parallel processing algorithms are
critical to harnessing the fabrication potential to produce real benefit for
applications such as database processing. Support is provided under the Research
Initiation activity for New Investigators.
