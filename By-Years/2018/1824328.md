This award funds research on two projects in economic theory. The first examines
how a monopolist will choose prices over time, with a focus on how monopoly
power in the product market affects how the firm makes decisions over time about
production technologies. The second project is in the general area of mechanism
design, the design of methods to allocate recourses. The specific application is
in matching markets under incomplete information, and the work could give us new
ideas about how to design allocation methods that will lead to stable outcomes.
The research advances science by developing new methods that can be used to
analyze situations from whether to regulate a durable goods monopolist to how
labor markets can do a better job of helping employers find the right
employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project explores dynamic pricing
strategies of monopolists in environments with general market demands and
production technologies. The goal is to characterize the relationship between
monopoly power and production technology, and study how the consumer and
producer surpluses in dynamic models differ from the static model. This work
will provide a new and more general foundation for the fast growing literature
in empirical economics on dynamic pricing of durable goods. The second project
seeks to advance the study of the core and stability in matching markets with
incomplete information. The research agenda includes offering practically
relevant refinements of existing concepts, finding dynamic game foundations of
the concept of pairwise stability, characterizing the precise relationship
between the core and stability, and analyzing stable matchings in various
environments such as those with costly investment and hidden
types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
