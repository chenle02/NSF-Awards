The main focus of this proposal is to develop and to analyze a novel
parametrized maximum principle preserving flux limiter technique for high order
numerical schemes applied to hyperbolic conservation laws. A flux limiting
technique will also be designed to obtain high order positivity preserving
schemes. Numerical schemes that preserve the maximum principle and positivity
are desirable because physically relevant solutions have those properties. The
development is based on finite difference methods, which have the advantage of
producing accurate approximations with low computational cost especially in
multi-dimensional simulations. Within the proposed framework, conservative
maximum principle preserving high order finite difference, finite volume and
discontinuous Galerkin schemes can be designed that allow for significantly
large CFL number, and therefore more efficient computational simulation. Some
important applications investigated in this proposal include compressible Euler
equations, magneto hydrodynamics equations and Vlasov-Maxwell equations.

The investigator is developing new computational techniques that can be applied
to difficult and very important problems in science and engineering. These
techniques address shortcomings in existing methods and should allow more
efficient, robust, and accurate computer simulations in a number of critical
applications. One such application is the supersonic flow problem, which is of
great importance in designing astrophysical jets and also in the simulation of
reentry vehicle for space flight modeling. Another application is the study of
the magneto hydrodynamic systems, which arises in space weather modeling, in
modeling electric propulsion sources, and in systems involving plasma (such as
plasma-opening switches, flight control via plasma, plasma assisted combustion).
These problems are strategically important for the design of the next generation
devices of great industrial and commercial value.
