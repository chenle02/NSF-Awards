ABSTRACT EEC-9529528 Reiter Material handling is one of the common denominators
involving virtually all processing of manufacturing operations. Research on
material handling can directly effect manufacturing costs and impact
productivity. This planning grant is studying the potential for getting
sufficient industrial support to start a multi-university Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling Products and Process
Engineering at Oregon State University and the University of Cincinnati. The
potential research agenda envisioned for the proposed Center will address:
Conformed Clamp Development, Lift Truck Dynamics, Design Process Assessment and
Development, Lateral Clamp Development, Selection of a New Material Handling
System for Service and Repair Operations, Planning and Design of Sortation
Conveyor System for Warehousing and Distribution, Integrating Ergonomics Issues
in Material Handling Equipment Design and Selection, and Designing Vision Guided
Vehicles. The researchers are recognized experts in these areas and can manage
the activities of this planning award.
