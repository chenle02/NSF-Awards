This project develops and applies laboratory methods in political economy. A
broad research agenda that has been guiding the project continues to dictate its
long-range focus. The research agenda can be broken down into the study of
markets and work on voting, committees and political processes. The investigator
is one of two scholars who dominates laboratory experiments in economics. His
work opens new lines of study, sets high standards for scientific rigor, and
makes substantively significant contributions. His past success shows that he
can continue this productive project. The part of the project dealing with
markets emphasizes asymmetric information among buyers and sellers, market
stability, computerized markets and special market organizations such as the
multidimensional auctions. The part concerned with voting focuses on information
transfer within committees, committee design, and the effect of the ethics and
norms of committee members on committee decisions.
