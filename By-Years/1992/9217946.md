A program of construction of model stellar atmospheres for red giant stars will
be continued. This research program is nearly unique in its treatment of the
atmospheres of the coolest of stars. The presence of molecules and solid grains
in the atmospheres present serious computational challenges. Treatment of their
effects will be improved over previous calculations. These models will be useful
to a variety of investigators who are attempting to interpret spectra. The
levitation effects of grains will be examined in detail and may shed light on
mass loss.
