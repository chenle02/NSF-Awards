This is a two year collaborative project between Walter D. Pilkey of the
University of Virginia and Jin Dewen of Qinghua University, Beijing. It is
sponsored by NSF and the Chinese State Education Commission. In this project the
concept of "configurationless" optimization will be developed and applied to the
design of mechanical systems, with emphasis on rotating shaft systems. The work
will be based on the concept of the limiting performance of dynamic systems. For
limiting performance studies the optimization is conducted on a model for which
generic (time dependent) forces represent those portions of the system being
designed. Four types of problems will be studies: (1) extreme-disturbance
analysis, (2) optimum system performance, (3) optimum system design, and (4)
optimum identification of disturbances and values of parameters. The goal of the
project is to improve understanding of the optimal design of mechanical systems,
especially rotor systems. Theoretical work will be pursued while Professor Jin
is a visiting scientist in Professor Pilkey's laboratory. Subsequently,
Professor Pilkey will participate in testing and verification of the theories
during his visit to Profesor Jin's applications laboratory at Qinghua.
