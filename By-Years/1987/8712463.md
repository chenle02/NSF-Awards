This award will support collaborative research between Drs. Joseph Diestel and
Andrew M. Tonge, Kent State University, with Dr. Hans Jarchow, University of
Zurich, Switzerland. They will do research and write a monograph on the theory
and applications of absolutely p-summing operators. The theory of p-summing
operators plays a central role in modern abstract analysis, for example, as a
fundamental tool for the study of Banach spaces. However, this is a complex area
of mathematics that has been inadequately communicated even to other
mathematicians. There is a need for a comprehensive, simplified treatment of the
subject and its applications that will emphasize the relationship of the theory
with other areas of analysis. Dr. Diestel has a strong track record in
functional analysis and has published several books that were well written and
broadly read. Dr. Tonge's expertise in tensor products and algebras will
contribute to the project. Dr. Jarchow has published extensively in relevant
topics such as operators on the disk algebra and on C*-algebras. The project
will require a large amount of background research and discussion among the
researchers. This award will enable them to meet periodically to compare and
synthesize their results.
