The purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers in the
theory and&lt;br/&gt;applications of Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, geometric, and
hybrid methods for control of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear mechanical systems. The
modeling and control issues for these systems is of vital importance in a host
of applications ranging from control of multiple autonomous agents for
surveillance, teleooperated surgery, planetary and undersea exploration, space-
based construction, to the design and control of prosthetic devices and other
biomedical applications. The workshop will address both the state of the art and
future directions of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
