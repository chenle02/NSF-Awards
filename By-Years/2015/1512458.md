CBET - 1512458&lt;br/&gt;PI: Maldarelli, Charles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maritime
oil spills can pose serious hazards to marine life and coastal shorelines. The
goal of this project is to develop biodegradable surfactants for use in
"chemical herding" as an effective oil spill response. In this method of
containment, surfactants are sprayed aerially into uncontaminated water
immediately outside the spill. The surfactants lower the air-water surface
tension, which causes the floating oil layer to retract and thicken to the point
that it can be removed by burning or mechanical skimming. The investigators will
synthesize surfactant herders that are easily degraded and conduct experiments
to evaluate their performance in laboratory simulations of chemical
herding.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Surfactants will be synthesized using naturally
occurring terpenoids with a unique single carbon branch repeating structure as
the hydrophobic tail and a polar head group attached with an ester group that
hydrolyzes after the herding action. The air/water surface tension reduction by
the herder will be measured. An alternative strategy in which the surfactant is
used to lower the oil/water interfacial tension, leading to retraction of the
oil layer, will also be investigated. The herding capabilities of the
surfactants will be demonstrated in laboratory experiments and compared with the
performance of commercially available surfactants currently in use.
