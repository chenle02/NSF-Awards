This is work to develop new experiment techniques for large scale
supercomputing simulations, with special focus on simulation applications at the
Cornell National Supercomputer Facility. The proposed project consists of a
research program on simulation experiment design, and a survey of common
problems and strategies in supercomputing simulation experiment design. This
project will have two practical consequences. The first will be of immediate
benefit to simulation modelers: existing simulation methodologies from the
fields of statistics and operations research will be reviewed and assessed in
the supercomputing simulation context. The second consequence will benefit both
simulation users and methodology researchers. Important areas for further
research in simulation methodology and experiment design will be identified and
pursued.
