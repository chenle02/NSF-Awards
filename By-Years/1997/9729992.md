The School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced Study &lt;br/&gt;(IAS)
was formed in 1930 at the founding of the IAS. The initial &lt;br/&gt;goal of
the School was to provide a haven for scholars where they &lt;br/&gt;could work
in an environment that was exceptionally favorable for &lt;br/&gt;conducting
research. Over the years, other roles have emerged and &lt;br/&gt;the School has
assumed additional responsibilities including &lt;br/&gt;guiding junior visitors
in their research and organizing special &lt;br/&gt;programs that widen the
School's coverage of mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;Although it has functioned in an
international context, the main &lt;br/&gt;impact of the Institute has been on
the U.S. mathematical &lt;br/&gt;community, with a majority of its visitors
having come from or &lt;br/&gt;been absorbed by it. The Institute frequently
conducts programs in &lt;br/&gt;special areas of mathematics. During the last
few years, there have &lt;br/&gt;been numerous seminars in such diverse areas as
kinetic theory, &lt;br/&gt;weak turbulence, quantum algebraic geometry,
geometry, and &lt;br/&gt;modular varieties. There have also been workshops in
materials &lt;br/&gt;science, mathematical problems in finance, fluid dynamics,
kinetic &lt;br/&gt;theory, quantum computing, discrete isoperimetric
inequalities, &lt;br/&gt;and turbulence. Future programs will include geometric
methods &lt;br/&gt;in representation theory and analytic theory of automorphic
forms &lt;br/&gt;and L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support
postdoctoral and mid-career visiting &lt;br/&gt;researchers at the School of
Mathematics of the Institute for &lt;br/&gt;Advanced Study with the goal of
supporting a wide spectrum of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical research at the highest
level. This activity will &lt;br/&gt;provide these researchers unique
opportunities for consultation and
&lt;br/&gt;collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
