Set Theoretic Topology is a branch of Topology in which set theoretic
techniques are used to solve problems about the existence of various classes of
abstract spaces. Mary Ellen Rudin's specialty has been the construction of
pathological, usually rather set theoretic, counterexamples. Such examples aid
in the location of theorems and the building of set theoretic models in which
solutions may be found to natural questions in the area. Like all studies in the
foundations of a subject, results will at first be of interest only within the
area (topology in this case), but broader ramifications should become apparent
with time.
