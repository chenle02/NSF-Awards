This project involves the theoretical analysis of the importance of continuum
structure in various photoionization and recombination processes in atomic
physics. These processes can be influenced by continuum structure associated
with autoionizing states or external dressing by a laser. The project involves
(1) studies of laser induced continuum structure at energies near an
autoionizing resonance; (2) extension of a quantum mechanical treatment of
recombination near an autoionizing resonance to allow for magnetic sublevels and
multiple continuum eigenstates, and (3) studies of threshold shifts in strong
field photodetachment. Specific projects for undergraduates, that involve laser
induced continuum structure and threshold shifts in negative ions supporting
near-threshold autodetaching states, are included.
