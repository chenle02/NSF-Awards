This project will produce a novel, enhanced set of tools (Traffic Lines) that
will increase the speed and lower the cost of performing genetic analysis in the
model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. As a community resource, these lines will
facilitate the research of a large number of investigators studying a wide range
of biological problems in this important model organism, and will also be useful
for teaching basic concepts in genetics at a high school or college level. The
project will provide training for a postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate
students.

Traffic Lines (TLs) are genetic stocks of Arabidopsis thaliana that contain
linked seed-specific transgenes expressing green or red fluorescent proteins.
TLs facilitate genetic mapping by enabling investigators to identify
recombinants in a region of interest using dry seeds, without the need for
molecular analysis. The lines make it possible to identify individuals
homozygous for recombinant chromosomes in a segregating population, increasing
the reliability with which the phenotypes of these recombinants can be assessed.
The lines also will be useful for maintaining recessive lethal alleles. 150 TLs
covering the entire Arabidopsis genome in 1 mB intervals will be generated in
the Columbia ecotype by recombining closely-linked pNAP::eGFP and pNAP::dsRED
insertions onto a single chromosome. Ten TLs covering larger regions of the
genome will also be generated in Landsberg erecta. Stocks useful for a high
school or college laboratory exercise in genetic recombination will also be
generated.

This project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
