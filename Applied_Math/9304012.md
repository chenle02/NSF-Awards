The principal investigator is proposing theoretical studies into some aspects
of the dynamics of galaxies. One objective of this research is to build self-
consistent equilibrium stellar dynamic models of elliptical galaxies, with
special emphasis on galaxies in which orbits of more than one basic family are
present. For self-consistency, the different orbits that are dynamically
possible must be populated in such a way that the resulting gravitational field
is exactly that needed to hold the galaxy together. The second aim of the work
is to understand the kinematic properties of the stellar dynamic models, and to
relate them to observations. Projections of the kinematic properties of real
galaxies on the plane of the sky can be observed, and provide only indirect
information from which to determine the true intrinsic motions. A third aim of
the work is to study the oscillations and stability of disk-like galaxies. A
typical galaxy is composed of hundreds of billions of stars, each of which moves
on its own individual orbit according to well-known physical laws of dynamics.
Galaxies are also interesting examples of complex systems, whose behavior comes
from the combined effects of much simpler components. This project aims to build
mathematical models that incorporate the basic characteristics of real galaxies,
matching observations as far as possible, which is not simple because only flat
pictures of the truly three-dimensional galaxies are ever observed. The work
will use a combination of both mathematical analysis and computation to
elucidate the present day dynamical structure of galaxies, which should contain
significant information about their past history, including that of their
formation.
