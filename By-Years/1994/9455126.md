The central purpose of this project is to enhance minority undergraduate faculty
education in the areas of robotics and machine vision. This purpose is achieved
by conducting an intensive training workshop on these topics for computer
science faculty members selected from historically minority universities. In
particular, we propose to conduct an intensive, two-week long training workshop,
along with certain follow-up activities, for 15 computer science faculty members
selected from minority institutions. Workshop participants are exposed to up-to-
date topics in computer vision and robotics. The activities include direct
interaction by Robotics Research Laboratory's faculty and extensive use of the
RRL's research equipment. Also, participants are encouraged to take part in
individual and group research projects based on current RRL research efforts.
The final day of the workshop includes a brainstorming discussion of how the
information learned in the workshop will be transferred into their curriculum.
The results of the workshop will be published in a refereed journal.
