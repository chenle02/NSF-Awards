9220632 Basar This proposal describes a two-year research collaboration between
the Coordinated Science Laboratory of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign (UIUC) and the Sophia-Antipolis Center of INRIA (FRANCE), within the
scope of an already existing initiative between NSF and INRIA. The principal
investigator who is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and at
INRIA his counterpart will be the Director of the Sophia-Antipolis Center. Two
research teams (comprised of Ph.D. students and post-doctoral fellows) led by
these two investigators in the two countries will collaborate on research
projects with the common theme of dynamic game theory, with applications in
robust controller designs. ***
