ASHANTI J. PYRTLE Institute for Broadening Participation

Dr. Ashanti Pyrtle is an Assistant Professor at the College of Marine Science,
University of South Florida (USF) and a Senior Scientist at the Institute for
Broadening Participation. Her research areas, marine and geosciences, suffer
from an extreme shortage of underrepresented minority (URM) professionals. She
recognized the need to impact a large numbers of underrepresented students and
provide them with coaching and mentoring, coupled with strategic professional
development opportunities that are unavailable to most undergraduate and
graduate students. Dr. Ashanti J. Pyrtle recognized the importance of
effectively encouraging students to pursue careers in science, and has devoted
substantial effort to mentoring.

Dr. Pyrtle has generated extraordinary programmatic support for her mentoring
activities. She authored a unique program that focuses on creating a community
of scientists that assists students' professional development with support from
peers, senior mentors and professional organizations. Dr. Pyrtle has served as
director of many programs important to mentoring at all educational levels; the
Minorities Striving and Pursuing Higher Degrees of Success in Earth System
Science Initiative, the USF College of Marine Science OCEANS GK-12 Fellowship
Program and Georgia Tech's FACES program serving as a member of the US National
Science Foundation Advisory Committee on Environmental Research and Education.

Dr. Pyrtle has made a significant contribution to addressing the need for a
diverse, internationally competitive and globally engaged STEM workforce. She
has developed and implemented a portable model that creates a community where
members share relevant experiences essential to their success in STEM fields.
This model can and should be used by other agencies to achieve the goal of
increasing the number of competitive scientists in STEM careers.
