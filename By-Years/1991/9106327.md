State of the art network security is based on end-to-end encryption and link
encryption. Many operations on networks are however broadcast ( or multicast or
flooding) oriented. This implies that the straightforward application of link or
end-to-end oriented authentication techniques to network integrity implies
either that the required bandwidth increases dramatically or that a terrible key
management problem is created. A geometry-based non-interactive unconditional
authentication scheme for a single- sender-multiple-receiver environment has
been co-authored by the principal investigator. The solution is based on secret
sharing (threshold) schemes. This gives rise to the following open problems to
be investigated in this research: (1) can unconditionally and conditionally
secure multi-sender and multi- receiver authentication and privacy schemes which
are (partially) non-interactive be achieved (2) is there a duality between
sharing and authentication (3) what are the most optimal schemes and what other
enhancements can be obtained? Geometry could continue to play an important role
in solving the above problems.
