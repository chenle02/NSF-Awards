9711703 Conte Understanding of present-day ocean/climate interactions based
largely upon time-series data collected as part of long- term research efforts.
The contributions of long-term studies to our knowledge of how the ocean works
are numerous and far- reaching. Yet, such studies are exceedingly rare-
especially those with a biogeochemical focus. The OFP time-series is now
approaching its 20th year. It is one of the very few oceanographic records
spanning more than a decade and, by far, the longest time-series of its kind.
The OFP time-series has provided an unparalleled record of secular changes in
material fluxes to the deep ocean, and direct evidence of the close linkages
between particle fluxes and upper ocean processes. The OFP record remains on e
of the main pieces of evidence for temporal variability in ecosystem functioning
and in the efficiency of the "biological pump". The OFP time-series is now
becoming long enough to begin to identify significant long-term trends in both
the magnitude and composition of the material flux which appear to be directly
linked to variation in the North Atlantic climate system. The project continues
to share its resources- in the form of sample material, data, ancillary
shiptime, and use of the mooring platform- with a large number of researchers to
make possible a diverse range of detailed, generally process-oriented
investigations which have greatly expanded the scientific results of the
program. Synthesis of these datasets will lead to major and fundamental advances
in identifying the upper ocean controls on the quantity and composition of
material flux to the seafloor. The findings will be of paramount importance for
understanding and predicting the ocean's response to future, possibly
anthropogenically induced, climatic change and for development of global carbon
flux models.
