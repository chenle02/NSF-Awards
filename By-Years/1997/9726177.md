This workshop on electronic publishing in the history of science will help
define the strengths and weaknesses of that technology for this and related
fields of scholarship. While no one can accurately anticipate the development of
computer networking, a number of issues do appear likely to need attention,
including interactions among various forms of electronic documents
(interoperability), development of standards for coding documents for electronic
display and retrieval, intellectual property rights, changing audience
characteristics, and other matters. This workshop will draw together experts
from across the nation, interested users of electronic documents, and students
to examine these and other matters during a two-day workshop to be held in the
Boston area on December 6 and 7, 1997.
