The objective of the proposed research is characterization of ultrathin (<150A)
silicon nitride and oxynitride insulators formed by high dosage, low energy (<5
keV) implantation of nitrogen or nitrogen and oxygen into single crystal
silicon. Samples will be evaluated with measurements of junction capacitance and
conductance (as functions of voltage and frequency), current vs. voltage,
ellipsometry, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), accelerated life testing, and
electrical stressing and breakdown. Use of a temporary mercury contact will
permit evaluation of the insulator alone, including variations of implantation
and annealing conditions; and evaluation of films with various metals as gate
contacts. Computer controlled measurements will permit extensive data
acquisition and analysis.
