0103788&lt;br/&gt;Knobler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico award will
support a workshop on current problems in complex fluids with a particular
emphasis on self-assembling systems. The workshop, which will take place in
Oaxaca, Mexico, July 10-14, 2001 in conjunction with a major international
meeting on statistical physics, STATPHYS 21, is being co-organized by Dr.
Charles M. Knobler, UCLA and Dr. Carmen Varea, of the Institute of Physics of
the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and colleagues at UNAM and
at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi. This activity is being jointly
supported between the Division of International Programs and the Chemistry
Division of NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will discuss current
developments in the field of self-assembling systems and related areas and help
to stimulate joint research initiatives between the US and Mexican research
communities. The area of complex fluids is a multidisciplinary research area
that has attracted increased attention over the past decade due to a variety of
technological applications as well as connections to nanoscale and biomimetic
materials. A variety of materials fall under this category, sharing common
properties useful in attempts to describe and characterize them.&lt;br/&gt;
