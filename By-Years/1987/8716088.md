The margin of the East Antarctic ice sheet adjacent to the Transantarctic
mountains of Victoria Land contains large exposures of bare ice. The icefields
are located in the lee of subglacial ridges and expose a stratigraphic cross-
section of the ice sheet. Moraines within the ice sheet accumulate on these
icefields by ablation of the ice. Dating based on ice-flow velocities, rates of
meteorite accumulation, and the abundance of cosmogonic 10Be in quartz indicates
that the moraines began to form less than 100,000 years ago. The most plausible
cause for the formation of the moraines is a decrease in the thickness of the
ice sheet in response to changes in climatic conditions either in the zone of
accumulation or at the margin of the ice sheet. This investigation will
determine the annual ablation rate of the ice sheet in the vicinity of the
Reckling Moraine by recovering the ablation stakes set out during the 1986/87
season. Closely- spaced ice samples will be collected to document chronological
discontinuities and ice thickness measurements will be made by radar.
