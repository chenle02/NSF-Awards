The work being proposed involves the development of a temperature selective
deposition technique for the formation of small, accurately positioned openings
in a protective coating for implantable integrated circuits. Early work done in
our laboratory indicates that resistors formed using conventional thin film
technology can be used as heat sources during Parylene deposition to prevent the
formation of a film over the heated regions, resulting in small openings having
diameters as small as 3 um. Investigation of this process and the properties of
the polymer coating which results from its use are being proposed.
