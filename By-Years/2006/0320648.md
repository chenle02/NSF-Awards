With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Kansas will acquire a
cryoprobe/cryoplatform for a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out research in a) medicinal organic chemistry,
including the development of new methods for heterocyclic synthesis and
combinatorial chemistry; b) the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of
natural products; c) development and application of improved methods for
coupling NMR and capillary isotachophoresis; d) the development of new
transition metal-mediated reactions for asymmetric synthesis of complex organic
molecules; e) the study of structure-function relationships in heme-containing
proteins; and f) the use of transition metal-catalyzed approaches to
structurally diverse phosphorus- and sulfur-containing heterocycles exhibiting
biological and/or synthetic utility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and
biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
