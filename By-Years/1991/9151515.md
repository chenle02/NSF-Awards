This project targets the vital expansion of a CAD/CAM program into the area of
designing and manufacturing with plastic components. The system is integrated
with the existing flexible manufacturing system (FMS) facility to provide a
comprehensive undergraduate CAD/CAM capability. This project's specific goals
are to provide undergraduate students with hands-on experience of microprocessor
controlled plastic injection molding systems. This adds a totally new and up-to-
date dimension to the undergraduate curriculum. The system, a BOY 50M, allows
small thermoplastic components to be produced, either automatically, when
interfaced to the FMS, or manually, when operated as a stand-alone system.
