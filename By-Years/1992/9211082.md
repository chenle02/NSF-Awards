This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, J. Ross Beveridge, will be working with Dr.
Takeo Kanade at Carnegie Mellon University in the Robotics Institute. He will be
working in the area of parallel languages and software development environments
for computer vision. The research will focus on the needs of computer vision. In
particular low-level and intermediate-level computer vision. The goal is the
development of a coherent parallel environment that is independent of any
particular parallel architecture. The intellectual contribution of this research
will be better understanding of how to support computer vision in parallel
environments. A concrete product of this research will be a pilot system
implemented on a new Sony parallel computer.
