9455618 Herman Mathematics educators from three quite different institutions of
higher learning -Grinnell College, The University of Washington, and Seattle
Central Community College -- are jointly developing an interactive linear
algebra text. This text is being organized in clusters of individual modules to
facilitate its adaptation to many different curricula. The main goals of the
project are: 1) to help students develop their geometric intuition about the
concepts of linear algebra; 2) to deepen their understanding of the algebraic
formulations of these concepts and strengthen their ability to manipulate them;
and 3) to help students gain an appreciation of how the concepts and methods of
linear algebra are applied. The text is being constructed using Maple V,
enhanced by a supplementary package with superior text-handing and screen-layout
capabilities. The text is being designed to support collaborative learning and
writing to learn. Many exercises encourage experimentation and exploration and
many will ask for written hypotheses and conclusions. The entire text will be
made available through the Mathematics Archives and hence will be readily
available to all by ftp, gopher, and MOSAIC. In addition to being appropriate
for all students majoring in scientific, engineering, and mathematics, the
textual materials are particularly appropriate for use with students preparing
for careers as secondary mathematics teachers and are being tested with
preservice teachers at all three institutions.
