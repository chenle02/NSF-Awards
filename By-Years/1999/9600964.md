9600964 Scholl This award to Ohio State University renews support for the
Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC), a collection of Arabidopsis
thaliana seeds and DNAs. The collection includes seed of a large number of known
mutants, large sets of seed obtained from plants mutagenized through several
means, and a similarly large variety of isolated individual genes, genomic
libraries and cloned DNA copies of messenger RNAs. For a modest fee, the ABRC
provides samples of its collection on request, primarily to researchers in the
US, but also to investigators in foreign countries. Through a subcontract to
Michigan State University, the award includes support for further development of
the Arabidopsis Information Management System (AIMS), an online database and
forms-based ordering system that facilitates access to the ABRC. In recent
years, the ABRC has provided over 35,000 seed samples, and 8000 samples of DNA
on an annual basis. Because of its role as a central repository, the ABRC plays
a crucial role in the coordinated international effort to sequence the
Arabidopsis genome.
