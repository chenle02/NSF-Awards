ABSTRACT Proposal Number: ECS-9713137 Principal Investigator: Uwe Kortshagen
Title: Advanced kinetic methods for efficient modeling of low pressure
discharges In this research, mathematical methods to describe the electron
kinetics in the intermediate regime between low neutral densities and high
neutral densities will be developed. The low pressure discharges used for plasma
processing fall into the intermediate regime and there are currently no existing
models which are accurate for this regime. The methods developed will be
rigorously checked against Monte Carlo simulations, and against experiments.
