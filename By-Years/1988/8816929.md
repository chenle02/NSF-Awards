The Main Mantle Thrust, located in the northwestern Himalaya of Pakistan,
separates the Kohistan island-arc terrane on the north from the Indian plate to
the south, and represents the westward continuation of the Indus Suture zone
into the western Himalaya. The focus of this collaborative project (with Lehigh
University, EAR88-16887) is to examine metamorphism associated with the terrane
boundary to establish pressure-temperature-time paths and radiometric dates of
structural events. Data obtained using these techniques will be integrated to
place important constraints on tectonic-thermal models for the Himalaya, and
compressional mountain belt in general.
