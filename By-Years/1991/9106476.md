The combinatorial description of Witten's invariant of 3- manifolds and links
which the investigator developed in his last two papers will be explored in a
number of directions. The combinatorial technique will be extended to include
knotted graphs. A reformulation of the invariant of trivalent graphs in terms of
tetrahedral decompositions will be developed. The implications of this for
invariants of the manifolds themselves will be explored, and a relationship
sought with the parallel work of Viro and Turaev. A geometric interpretation of
this tetrahedral formula will also be attempted, in close analogy with Regge and
Ponzano's interpretation of spin networks. Connections will also be explored
with invariants in other dimensions: the Donaldson invariants in four dimensions
and surgery invariants for dimensions five and above. In short, the investigator
will explore topological invariants inspired by quantum physics. He will examine
their usefulness in purely topological settings. He will also explore the
physical implications of the resulting topology.
