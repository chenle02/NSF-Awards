Engineering - Civil (54) We are meeting the growing need for genomics studies in
undergraduate education by creating a course entitled "Molecular Methods in
Environmental Engineering". An integral part of our course has been to create
teams of students collaborating through the use of inquiry based laboratory
modules. These student are performing group projects following the "full-cycle
16S rRNA approach". This course has been popular among our students in Civil and
Environmental Engineering program. Our curriculum materials have been designed
to be incorporated into other disciplines e.g. Biomedical Engineering and
Chemical Engineering on other campuses. This material has undergone extensive
testing and evaluation by our staff. We have created a laboratory manual with an
accompanying CDROM for dissemination of these laboratory experiments through
appropriate commercial channels. Additional support materials are also available
on the World Wide Web to help faculty and their students. We are presenting
present papers in peer reviewed journals like the Journal of Engineering
Education. We also plan to make a presentation at the upcoming AEESP/AAEE
Conference on Education and Research Needs in Environmental Engineering and
Science on August 11-13, 2002 at the University of Toronto.
