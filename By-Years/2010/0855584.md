This award will support the study of spatial and temporal symmetries in the
interactions of low energy neutrons. It seeks to answer the following questions:
a) Why is our universe made up of matter but not anti-matter? b) What is the
interplay between forces that bind the nucleus? The first question will be
addressed by measuring the separation of electric charge in the neutron, a
quantity that would change if time ran backwards. It involves the same violation
of symmetry necessary to convert antimatter into matter or vice versa. Our
contribution is to efficiently guide polarized neutrons thirty meters from the
source into the experimental apparatus. The second question explores the forces
involved in the capture of neutrons on protons to form deuterium. Even though
the strong force dominates by seven orders of magnitude, the weak force would be
responsible for an asymmetric distribution in the production of gamma rays,
which we seek to measure. This asymmetry distinguishes our universe from a
mirror reflection, one with directions in space reversed. These experiments will
help unravel our understanding the interactions and structure of protons and
neutrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects will have significant effect on
undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Kentucky, especially
women, minorities, and students from the Appalachian region. These students have
the opportunity of participating in cutting-edge research at Los Alamos National
Laboratory (LANL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The PI is
incorporating portions of this work into a course on modern physics, and is
developing an introduction to scientific programming for students involved in
the analysis of these experiments. General purpose software libraries developed
for this research will be made publicly available. The work on neutron guides
will benefit subsequent experiments at the Spallation Neutron Source at
ORNL.&lt;br/&gt;
