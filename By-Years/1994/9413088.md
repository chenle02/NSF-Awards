9413088 Gordon New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) will change its
engineering curriculum to provide each engineering undergraduate with an
understanding of manufacturing processes. A year-long course on product design
and manufacturing will be developed using a simulated factory floor facility. An
elective senior year design course will be offered to give students experience
in design for manufacturing under the supervision of faculty and industrial
experts. In addition, manufacturing principles will be introduced into
management and liberal arts courses offered to all NJIT students. Resources
available to NJIT include the National Science Foundation-sponsored Gateway
Coalition and a feeder network of 19 community colleges. Industry involvement in
this effort will include hosting student interns during the summer and a seminar
series by industrial experts.***
