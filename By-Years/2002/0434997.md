Abstract:

Programming wireless sensor networks is notoriously difficult because of severe
resource constraints for sensors, unstable and low-bandwidth communication
links, unreliable nodes, inaccessible and hostile deployment environments for
certain applications, and potentially a large number of nodes. To ease the
building of sensor network applications, the objective of this research is to
develop a high-level programming abstraction that facilitates resource-
efficient, data-centric, and trustworthy computing for large-scale sensor
networks, and is applicable to a wide range of sensor network applications.

This approach involves designing a sensor coordination model called active
dataspace (ADS), an active data repository that provides associative operations
for data access, and developing techniques to implement the ADS model in a
resource-efficient, robust, and trustworthy fashion. This research extends
previous work on the tuple space coordination model to address the challenges
for sensor networks. Specifically, the ADS model presents a novel construct
called virtual tuple that supports a data-on-demand strategy to conserve the
resources of data producers when their services are not needed, and presents
constructs that facilitate in-network aggregation and exploiting locality.

This research is expected to provide an effective means to develop sensor
network applications for a wide range of problem domains and to impact education
through student participation. The results will be disseminated through papers
and the Web.
