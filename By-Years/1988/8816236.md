This grant supports a study of the margin of the East Antarctic ice sheet, a
very sensitive area because its flow is disrupted by subglacial bedrock ridges.
The resulting ice fields expose a stratigraphic section of the ice sheet
including basal ice of great age which ablates to form supraglacial moraines.
The objectives of this study include 1) mapping of the surface elevation and
thickness of the ice in the Beardmore-Glacier area in order to document the
effect of bedrock topography on local ice flow patterns: 2) identification of
the Pleistocene- Holocene boundary in the exposed ice based on oxygen isotope
compositions of systematically-collected ice samples; 3) study of selected
clasts in supraglacial moraines of the area in order to obtain information about
the geology of the East Antarctic craton; and 4) geochemical, mineralogical, and
isotopic study of silicate spherules that occur in significant numbers in
glacial sediment in the study area.
