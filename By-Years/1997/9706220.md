9706220 Rothman The PI proposes work on granular fluids that includes the
development of numerical models of particular geophysical flows in addition to
work on a basic theory applicable to a wide range of phenomena. Special emphasis
will be focused on the erosion of granular surfaces and will concentrate on the
evolution of hillslope topography and the initiation of channel networks. The
focus will be on the study of statistical correlations evident in both field
data and models, and their subsequent use to constrain continuum formulations of
the problem. The second emphasis of the proposal is to study pattern formation
in shaken sand, with the goal of understanding the transition from wavelike
patterns to localized excitations, the latter of which have thus far appeared
only in granular systems. Some work will concentrate on the development of
models for the study of wet granular deposition. ***
