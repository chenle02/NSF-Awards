This project investigates the structure of semantics definitions of programming
languages. First, models of the ``core'' of a programming language are analyzed
and classified; next, extensions of the core are analyzed for their harmony
(correspondence) and orthogonality, and models of these extensions are related
to each other and to models of the core. The ultimate goal is a ``design and
analysis workbench,'' in which a language can be synthesized, classified, and
prototyped. Such a workbench will aid language designers and provide
experimental evidence that languages with harmonious designs have clean and
correct implementations.
