The proposed research aims to broaden the Economics of Marketing by describing
what is advertised, where it is advertised, why it is advertised, and how it is
advertised. The question of what is advertised&lt;br/&gt;pertains to the
informational content of advertisements: which product attributes will be
advertised by which firms. The question of where information is advertised
corresponds to analyzing the choice of medium&lt;br/&gt;used for imparting
information. The question why addresses the benefits to firms from improved
consumer information about firms' products in a competitive setting. How it is
advertised addresses the issue of&lt;br/&gt;information overload and the problem
that advertisers must compete for the attention of prospective consumers by
sending messages, and that messages may crowd out messages from other
firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis is intended to both provide a
description of actual advertising practice and to evaluate market performance in
fulfilling the goal of information provision. The analysis of information
overload will&lt;br/&gt;consider bulk (or "junk") mail, "spam" email,
telemarketing calls, as well as television and magazine advertising. Policy
issues such as the Federal Do-Not-Call program will be addressed within the
framework. The analysis of information content will also consider the role of
"negative" advertising (highlighting features of rival products), and whether it
is desirable to restrict the use of advertising messages that accentuate adverse
features of rival products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
