9407245 The work proposed here will involve the study of conductance anomalies
in point contact, superconducting island and superconducting to insulating
transition in metallic films. The work related to point contacts is very closely
tied to the experiments at Cornell. The work on superconducting islands focusses
on understanding the even vs. odd number of electrons in superconducting rodes
and is motivated by the experimental observation that the properties of these
systems depend upon whether the number of electrons is odd or even. The proposed
work will develop a microscopic theory of superconducting to insulating
transition analogous to the Anderson theory of localization. %%% The proposed
research is to provide a fundamental understanding of some unusual properties of
point contacts and superconducting rodes and is motivated by experiments in
these systems. The work will also focus on developing a microscopic theory of
superconducting to insulating transition, which is one of the important unsolved
problems in theoretical condensed matter physics.
