The Physics Department at Furman will purchase five 8-inch and one 14- inch
astronomical telescopes and other laboratory equipment for astronomy. The
equipment is to serve three main purposes. The primary use is in the laboratory
portion of an introductory astronomy course, a course which is taught at a level
suitable for non-science majors. Some of the equipment is for indoor, on-campus
use, whereas other items will be permanently installed in a modest observatory
which is to be constructed by Furman at a mountain location a few miles north of
Greenville, South Carolina. Second, the laboratories which are made possible
through this project will provide valuable teaching experiences for the student
assistants who will be involved. Finally, the new astronomy facilities will be
made available, as are existing facilities, to local school, civic, church, and
other groups for demonstrations, laboratory exercises, science projects, and
observing sessions.
