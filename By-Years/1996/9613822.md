Professor Michael Harmata's studies of the cycloaddition chemistry of cyclic
oxyallylic cations are supported by the Organic Synthesis Program. Dr. Harmata,
of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri - Columbia, is
studying (4+3) cycloaddition reactions, focusing on several novel aspects of
this class of reactions. Cycloaddition reactions of substrates containing
halogen substituents provide products which may be elaborated into more complex
structures, particularly through quasi-Favorskii rearrangements. Use of chiral
bases to mediate the (4+3) cycloadditions, particularly in substrates designed
to permit intramolecular delivery of the chiral base, will impart chirality to
the cycloadducts. Representative members of the cyclooctanoid class of natural
products, dactylol and 11-hydroxyjasionone, will be prepared through synthetic
routes highlighting the efficacy of the (4+3) cycloaddition reactions of
oxyallylic cations. Synthesis of the often-complex molecules forming the basis
of modern chemical and pharmaceutical science requires the formation of carbon-
carbon bonds in a highly selective manner. `Cycloaddition` reactions, in which
two (or more) reacting molecules add to one another to form a cyclic product,
represent a particularly powerful way in which to achieve such selective bond
formation. Dr. Harmata studies cycloaddition reactions which result in the
formation of compounds containing seven carbon atoms in a ring, exploring ways
to introduce additional selectivity and versatility into these reactions. He
will exploit an unusual ring transformation reaction which allows the conversion
of these seven-membered ring compounds into products containing eight-membered
rings. These studies will culminate in the synthesis of several specific
compounds, including 11-hydroxyjasionone, which displays antibacterial and
antifungal activity, and will serve as a general platform for the synthesis of
other eight-membered ring compounds of known or potential biological or
medicinal activity.
