There are many areas of scientific research that may benefit from the
development of improved plasma confinement and control methods. These include
studies of antimatter, charged particle beams, and non-neutral plasmas. The goal
of this project is to develop a theoretical understanding of the conditions for
a plasma of one species of charged particles to be confined by an electric field
produced by a plasma of a second species of charged particles. The project
provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students,
including members of traditionally underrepresented groups in science and
engineering. The work will be carried out by students as part of their research
training and will be supervised by the principal investigator to assure
professional quality, with research results presented in peer-reviewed journals
and at technical conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore the
equilibrium of a two-species plasma, with one plasma species confined by the
space charge of the other; with the outer species confined by using the concept
of an artificially structured boundary in a cylindrical geometry. Conditions for
achieving an equilibrium in which a neutral region forms with each species
having the same temperature is sought. This plasma confinement approach is
intended to provide a highly quiescent plasma. The theoretical understanding
will be developed using classical trajectory Monte Carlo, Poisson-Boltzmann
finite difference, and particle-in-cell numerical
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
