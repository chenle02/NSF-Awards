The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop new fluorophores for use with flow
cytometers to enable the detection and sorting of thousands of cells per second.
The market opportunity for fluorophores that are important imaging reagents for
biomedical research is significant and growing, and there is a growing demand
for multi-color flow cytometers and other cell imaging technologies. The goal
for this technology is to simplify the design and reduce the cost of next
generation flow cytometers, enhance the attraction and popularity of flow
cytometry by simplifying the operation procedures and reducing the ownership
cost, create new market opportunity for flow cytometry manufacturers
(instrument, and reagents), and enable wide spread use of flow cytometry in
clinical labs that would promote more effective diagnosis of health disorders
and thus allow earlier treatments. This STTR Phase I project proposes to create
a platform technology that can enhance the fluorescence brightness of
fluorophores by blocking the fluorescent quenching pathways. Ideally, the
proposed technology would offer enhanced fluorescent brightness up to 250-1,000
times of existing fluorophores. The goal is to enhance the detection efficiency
of flow cytometry by overcoming the drawback of spillover, reduce or eliminate
the need of autofluorescence background compensation, enable scientists,
engineers, and technicians to obtain better flow cytometry data at shorter
overall durations, and allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells
especially those in stem cell research.
