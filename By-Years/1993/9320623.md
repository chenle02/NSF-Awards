9320623 Scudder In this proposal the PIs seek funding to develop direct
theoretical arguments that the base of the transition region is an especially
fertile site for the suprathermal tail formation assumed by the velocity
filtration theory. The vehicle that "carries" the embryonic coronal gas is the
suprathermal tail of the fully ionized gas as it leaves the top of the
chromosphere and that the mechanism for the emergence of hot gas overlying
cooler gas is the concentrating effect velocity filtration has on the spatial
evolution of non-thermal distributions in an attractive potential well. In this
view, the combined effects of (1) the copious waves leading up to the TR base,
(2) the convolution effects possible in a stratified fully ionized plasma below
the base, and (3) the quasi-neutrality in the presence of coulomb collisions all
leave their "imprint" on the velocity distributions that are the boundary
conditions for the fully ionized extension of the solar atmosphere. The velocity
distribution functions evolve above the TR base in the electric and magnetic
force fields above this region as if they were in a "velocity dependent
reflecting transmission line" that preferentially filters out the low energy
particles in deference to the higher energy particles of the initially
suprathermal populations. These populations by velocity filtration get
concentrated and their dispersion and hence their temperature increases without
any further energy addition above the base of the transition region. ***
