The Chemistry Department has augmented its undergraduate curriculum by
introducing chemistry students to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
Access to GC/MS has enriched all aspects of a previously already diverse
undergraduate chemistry curriculum, ranging from the core areas of chemistry,
e.g., organic, to biochemistry and environmental chemistry. The theories and
hands-on application of GC/MS analysis have been incorporated into most of the
Department's courses, beginning with sophomore-level courses and extending to
the advanced courses, both in lecture and, particularly, in the laboratory.
Organic chemistry students use GC/MS to identify unknowns and products in
reaction mixtures. Environmental and instrumental chemistry students analyze
"real-world" samples for pesticides and other pollutants. Biochemistry students
analyze complex biological samples like plants for bio-molecules such as
sterols. The acquisition of GC/MS also enhanced numerous undergraduate research
projects. The general aim of this project is to enrich the chemistry students'
educational experiences by introducing them to state-of-the-art analytical
instrumentation, specifically GC/MS. Exposure to modern hyphenated modes of MS
like GC/MS, in addition to the more traditional MS, is better preparing the
students for continued study in graduate school and/or for a career in
chemistry. The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal to
the NSF funds.
