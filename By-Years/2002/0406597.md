Every ``theory'' of games concentrates on one particular&lt;br/&gt;aspect of
games, and ignores the rest.&lt;br/&gt;Traditional Game Theory (J. von Neumann,
J. Nash, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;focuses on the lack of complete
information&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., card games like Poker).&lt;br/&gt;Games of complete
information, like Chess, Go, Checkers, and&lt;br/&gt;Tic-Tac-Toe, are ignored by
the traditional theory.&lt;br/&gt;Here the investigator develops a new branch of
game theory.&lt;br/&gt;He focuses on ``Tic-Tac-Toe like games'' (officially
called Positional Games),&lt;br/&gt;a large and imortant class of games of
``complete information'',&lt;br/&gt;and develops a ``fake probability
theory''.&lt;br/&gt;In fact, the investigator continues his on-going
research&lt;br/&gt;started in the prior proposals.&lt;br/&gt;The basic challenge
of games of ``complete information''&lt;br/&gt;is to handle the ``combinatorial
chaos''.&lt;br/&gt;To analyze a position (say in Chess, or in multi-
dimensional&lt;br/&gt;Tic-Tac-Toe), one has&lt;br/&gt; to examine all of its
options, and all the&lt;br/&gt;options of these options, and all the options of
the options of these&lt;br/&gt;options, and so on. The&lt;br/&gt;exhaustive
search through the ``game-tree''&lt;br/&gt;takes enormous amount of
time.&lt;br/&gt;One way to make up for the lack of time&lt;br/&gt;is to study
the random walk on the game-tree,&lt;br/&gt;that is, to study the randomized
game where&lt;br/&gt; both players play randomly.&lt;br/&gt;The most surprising
part of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;is how the probabilistic analysis of the
randomized game is converted,&lt;br/&gt;via potential arguments, into an
explicit (deterministic) optimal strategy.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator calls it a
``mathematical paradox'' for good reason.&lt;br/&gt;Game Theory is about perfect
players, and it is very&lt;br/&gt;surprising that a play between random
generators&lt;br/&gt;(``dumb players'') has anything to do with a play between
perfect&lt;br/&gt;players! In contrast to ``Poker and randomness'', which is a
natural&lt;br/&gt;combination (see e.g. the role of ``bluffing''), ``Tic-Tac-Toe
and &lt;br/&gt;randomness''sounds like a very strange mismatch. The
justification of this&lt;br/&gt;mismatch requires a long technical
explanation.&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical significance of the proposal is
that&lt;br/&gt;it brings the remote subjects of Probability&lt;br/&gt;Theory,
Combinatorics, and Game Theory close to each other&lt;br/&gt;in a novel,
unexpected way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
