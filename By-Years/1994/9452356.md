9452356 Angevine Somerset Community College of the University of Kentucky is
developing a mobile computer laboratory that can be transported from classroom
to classroom. This equipment and the mobility of such computers are providing
students in various courses such as calculus, pre-calculus, college algebra,
geometry, and mathematics for elementary teachers the hands on experience of
using computers in the area of mathematics. Students have an opportunity to
experience the vastness of mathematical knowledge and have an in-depth look at
mathematics at its best. Students see the changes of graphs at their fingertips,
are able to explore problems more easily without the complications of numerical
manipulation, and experience the use of the computer in mathematics teaching
which is important for students going into the education field.
