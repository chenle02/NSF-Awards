The Young Scholars Program at Wiley College designed to create a learning
environment that challenges the twenty participants intellectual abilities, and
encourages the development of requisite skills for the use of these abilities.
The proposed program consists of an Summer Science Institute which focuses on
research methodology, career awareness, philosophy and ethics in chemistry and
physics. The program also provides an academic year of follow-up activities via
a Saturday academy. The objectives of the program are to: 1) present advanced
topics to the participants in chemistry and physics, 2) provide hands-on
laboratory experiences with state-of-the-art equipment, 3) develop in each
participant, basic skills in writing computer software for controlling
instruments and collecting data, 4) engaging participants in meaningful research
and special laboratory projects, 5) provide "mentor experience" for participants
through organized field trips, and 6) expose precollege students to cutting-edge
research and intellectual frontiers by the Distinguished Lecture Series.
