The 2012 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in in
Orlando, Florida, USA from March 25 to March 30, 2012. This preeminent technical
conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area
of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and
practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of
paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have
the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and
interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field.
Broader Impact: This proposal provides travel support for approximately fifteen
graduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference. The
travel awards will target graduate students, in particular, women and under-
represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part
of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.
