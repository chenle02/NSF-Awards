The objective of this research is to conduct piezocone penetration tests in the
centrifuge on soil samples which are prepared to achieve certain strength and
stiffness profiles. The results of cone penetration tests can be compared with
the reference soil properties which are measured by conventional triaxial
testing on specimens that are either prepared to the same conditions as the
centrifuge soil sample, or are obtained by coring from the centrifuge sample
after the penetration test. In addition, since the undrained shear strength of
soil is not a unique parameter and depends on the type of test used to measure
it, it will be adopted that the undrained shear strength measured by the shear
vane will be used as the reference in this research. Thus, simultaneously with
cone penetration tests on a centrifuge sample, the undrained shear strength
profile of the sample will be measured by means of a miniature shear vane, so
that the profiles of cone penetration resistance and of shear strength can be
compared directly.
