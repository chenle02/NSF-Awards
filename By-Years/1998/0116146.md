In addition to the strong interaction between neutrons &lt;br/&gt;and protons
which binds them in the nucleus, there &lt;br/&gt;is also a "weak" interaction.
The precise strength of&lt;br/&gt;this interaction between neutrons and protons
is not known, and&lt;br/&gt;current results from different experiment are
contradictory.&lt;br/&gt;However, the weak interaction is known to possess the
unique&lt;br/&gt;property of causing reactions that look different in a
mirror.&lt;br/&gt;We intend to construct a detector which can
sense&lt;br/&gt;part-per-billion mirror asymmetries in reactions involving
&lt;br/&gt;neutrons and protons that produce gamma rays. This
detector&lt;br/&gt;will first be used in an upcoming experiment at the LANSCE
pulsed neutron&lt;br/&gt;source at Los Alamos which will detect the mirror
asymmetry in neutron capture&lt;br/&gt;on protons. It will be designed and
constructed at the Indiana &lt;br/&gt;University Cyclotron Facility.&lt;br/&gt;
