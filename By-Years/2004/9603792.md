Pukkila 9603792 The source of specificity for meiotic chromosome pairing is not
known. We have shown that prior to meiosis, a genome-wide homology search occurs
in haploid nuclei of Coprinus cinereus which results in the methylation of
duplicated sequences, a process termed MIP (methylation induced premeiotically).
We have also shown that a mutation with defects in meiotic synapsis, (bad27) is
deficient in MIP. Thus it appears that either prior MIP is essential for
synapsis, or that MIP and meiotic pairing are genetically related. We are
utilizing MIP to analyze the genetic basis of homologue recognition. We have
isolated four mutants which arrest in meiotic prophase following nuclear fusion
(karyogamy) with decondensed chromosomes that exhibit very limited axial core
formation (class I synaptic defect). We have also isolated six mutants which
arrest with condensed univalents (class II synaptic defect). We have shown that
one of the class II mutants (bad27) is deficient in MIP. We will ask if the
class I mutants and the other class II mutants can carry out MIP. We will use
serial sectioning and 3-dimensional reconstruction to learn if homologue
alignment occurs normally in the class II mutants. We will determine epistatic
relationships among the class I and class II mutants. By ordering these genes in
a genetic pathway, we should begin to establish cause and effect relationships
among them. Finally, we will utilize DNA-mediated transformation to obtain a
cloned DNA sequence that can complement the defects in MIP and synapsis
conferred by the bad27 mutation. These studies should provide unique insights
into the underlying mechanisms of homologue recognition. This research will help
us understand how a process that is almost universal in plants and animals
occurs. This process is called meiosis, and involves the pairing of chromosomes
inherited from both parents so that reproductive cells can be formed (such as
sperm and eggs). Dr. Pukkila is studying a fungus which she has s hown provides
special advantages for uncovering the steps that occur in this process.
