The investigators will develop a data assimilation ionospheric model to be
driven mainly by data obtained from the Global Positioning System (GPS). This
model will overcome limitations experienced in obtaining measurements through
total electron content tomography, relying on the first principle dynamical
equations governing the state of the ionosphere. The main goals of the project
are: (1) developing a mid- and low-latitude data assimilation model based on an
existing physics-based model, (2) using the total electron content data obtained
from the continuously tracking ground network of GPS receivers as input to the
model, (3) using the total electron content data obtained from a low-Earth
orbiter tracking GPS as input to the model, (4) deriving a 3-D field of electron
density, (5) evaluating the accuracy of the model by comparing to independent
measurements, and (6) evaluating the predictive power of the model by comparing
predicted measurements to actual ones.
