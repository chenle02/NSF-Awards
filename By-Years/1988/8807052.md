This award funds acquisition of a high temperature test cell for friction and
wear tests. The equipment allows accurate control of temperature, environment
and load under oscillating motion. The friction forces and the linear wear can
be measured instantaneously and accurately. The equipment will support on- going
research on the mechanics of tribological contacts under conditions of both
severe load and severe temperature. The equipment is flexible and can readily be
adapted to a number of other high temperature tribology studies.
