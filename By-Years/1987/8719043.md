The mucosal surfaces are in constant contact with the external environment.
Therefore, the mucosal immune system must deal with constant antigenic
stimulation. The goals of this research are to understand the role of
lymphokines (soluble regulatory molecules produced by thymus derived T cells) in
the generation of mucosal immunity. The types and amounts of lymphokines
produced by T cells residing in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, Peyer's
patches, and mesenteric lymph nodes will be compared with the lymphokines
produced by T cells isolated from the systemic lymphoid organs, spleen and
peripheral lymph nodes. Lymphokines will be measured in the supernatants of T
cells activated in vitro by polyclonal stimulators. The ability of these
lymphokines to affect immunoglobulin isotype will be determined. In addition,
lymphokine gene expression by T cells isolated from different lymphoid organs
after polyclonal stimulation will be analyzed. The mucosal surface lining the
digestive tract is a major site of interaction between an organism and its
environment. Normal function of cells of the immune system in this tissue is
required for maintenance of the normal state of the organism. In spite of the
great importance of this subject, little is known about the regulation of
function of these cells. The results of this research will provide important new
information concerning the signaling molecules involved in regulation of the
normal defense mechanisms associated with the mucosa of the digestive tract.
