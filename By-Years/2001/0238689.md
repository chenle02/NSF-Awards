CTS-0238689&lt;br/&gt;E. Furst&lt;br/&gt;U Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two
models are currently used to understand the rheology of gels: fractal- and
percolation-based. The conclusions of each approach rely on the mechanics of
particle chains that form gel backbones. The PI proposes to directly measure the
microrheology of the gel backbone using optical micromanipulation, such as
Optical 'tweezers', and probe microrheology based on the motion of embedded
particles induced by magnetic or optical forces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
education program is mostly based on broad distribution of the course material
and promoting interdisciplinary education. &lt;br/&gt;
