This research is concerned with the applications of rational Bezier patches.
Three specific problems are proposed. The first problem is concerned with the
construction and contouring of piecewise quadratic, trivariate scattered data
interpolants. The contours would be piecewise quadric surfaces and so could only
be described parametrically in terms of rational patches. The second problems is
concerned with when and how a rational patch can be reparametrized as a
polynomial patch. The final problem is concerned with developing a suite of
geometric algorithms for rational patches. The results should open up the
subject to a wider audience and help provide insight for further study, as in
the case for polynomial Bezier patches. Undergraduate student involvement will
be through the University of North Carolina at Wilmington's Honor Program.
