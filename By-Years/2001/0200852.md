This grant supports the development of gravitational wave source modeling and
signal processing techniques, and the implementation of a data analysis system
designed to detect gravitational radiation using the Laser Interferometric
Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The award also supports the analysis of
LIGO data using both the LIGO Data Analysis System (LDAS) and the Grid Physics
Network (GriPhyN) in an effort to detect the four principal categories of
sources: gravitational-wave stochastic background, unmodeled burst sources,
inspiral signals from binary neutron stars and black holes, and slowly modulated
sinusoidal signals expected from rapidly rotating neutron
stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIGO is an ambitious project to detect gravitational
waves from astrophysical sources, which were predicted by Einstein almost a
century ago but have not yet been directly observed. This work will make a
significant contribution to the overall success of the LIGO project, and may
ultimately lead to the first detection of gravitational waves. This award also
supports research into the nature of highly energetic astrophysical sources of
gravitational radiation which will provide valuable insight into the nature of
Einstein's theory of gravity and will open a new field of astronomical
observation.
