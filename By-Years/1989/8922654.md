This project will study various classes of differential equations which
generate dynamical systems with some monotonicity properties which limit the
complexity of their asymptotic behavior. Included are certain classes of
ordinary differential equations, delay differential equations and reaction-
diffusion systems with time delays. The goal of the research is to describe
global qualitative features of the flow. For finite dimensional systems we focus
on existence and nonexistence of nontrivial periodic orbits and associated
invariant manifolds. For infinite dimensional systems, the principal
investigator will focus on convergence of solutions to equilibrium, invariance
and comparison type results. Systems of the type considered here occur
frequently in the applied literature and particularly in mathematical models in
biology. Results with significant applications are expected.
