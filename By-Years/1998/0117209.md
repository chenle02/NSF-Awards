Adaptive Representations for Genetic Algorithms and Local Search



This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. The PI's
recent theoretical results prove there are advantages to reflected Gray codes
compared to standard binary encodings when used as a representation for search
and parameter optimization problems (e.g., it is possible to use a simple
mechanism to escape local optima by adaptively switching between different
reflected Gray codes). Preliminary empirical results indicate that using high
precision adaptive Gray codes leads to better optimization, and new convergence
results have been proven. In this project, a family of high precision adaptive
Gray codes will be developed for use with genetic algorithms and local search.
The PI will further conduct a broad comparative evaluation of evolutionary
algorithms, local search and other heuristic search methods that do not require
derivative information. A real-world application will be addressed related to a
new generation of much more accurate weather prediction systems. The CloudSat
project will in the next few years deploy a satellite-based system for modeling
cloud structures, and the search methods developed in this project will be the
best and fastest way to solve a key inverse problem which lies at the heart of
such models, as a consequence of which they appear to be likely candidates for
inclusion in the scheduled 2003 deployment of CloudSat.
