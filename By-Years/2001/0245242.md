Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
DMS-0245242&lt;br/&gt;Charles Fefferman and Elias Stein&lt;br/&gt; Problems in
analysis &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the problems that
will be investigated are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) The domination of pseudo-
differential operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Singular integrals which have
that singularities on flag manifolds, and their application to several complex
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Classification of conformal manifolds
analogous to Branson's Q curvature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4) Estimates for
oscillatory integrals and questions of stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(5)
Efficient hedging strategies in the presence of transaction
costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The methods of harmonic analysis and
partial differential equations have important applications in many fields of
science, for example physics, engineering, and finance; also in different parts
of mathematics, for example geometry. The underlying reason is that partial
differential equations express the laws which govern a wide variety of
phenomena, while harmonic analysis is a central tool to understand the solutions
of the equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
