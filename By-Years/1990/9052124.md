Through this project, the institution acquired a FT-IR spectrometer and ATR and
diffuse reflectance accessories. The instrument replaced a dispersive IR that
was purchased in 1965 for which repair costs had frequently exceeded the value
of the instrument and replacement parts were no longer available. The FT-IR is
being used in courses such as organic, physical, spectrometric identification of
organic compounds, and introduction to research. In addition to being used for
the experiments previously done with the dispersive IR, the new instrument and
accessories enable the students to carry out new experiments such as spectra of
aqueous and dilute solutions, opaque solids such as polymers and minerals, cut
outs from TLC separations, and high resolution spectra of gases. The computer
controlled instrument allows the manipulation of data in analyzing mixtures and
the creation of one's own spectral library. Also of prime importance is the fact
that industrial employees and graduate schools expect that a bachelor's degree
chemist can operate a FT-IR instrument and is familiar with the mathematical
manipulations and capabilities of the Fourier transform technique. The FT-IR
also played an important role in the phasing in of microscale in the organic
chemistry labs. The institution is contributing to the project in an amount
equal the NSF funds.
