Intellectual Merit: A major challenge in Nanoscience is the design of synthetic
molecular devices that run autonomously (that is, without externally mediated
changes per work-cycle) and are programmable (modi&amp;#64257;able behavior
without full redesign). DNA-based synthetic molecular devices have advantages of
simplicity of design and engineering, due to predictable secondary structure and
well-established biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;Tasks: The main Task is optimized
design and experimental demonstration of molecular devices composed of DNA
strands and DNAzyme. with unique advantages of being autonomous and
programmable, requiring no protein enzymes. The experiments will be executed in
carefully stages of increasing complexity. First to be demonstrated is a limited
ability computational device, termed a DNAzyme calculator. Next to be
demonstrated is a &amp;#64257;nite state automata device, DNAzyme FSA, which
executes &amp;#64257;nite state transitions using DNAzymes. Further
demonstrations will be extensions to probabilistic automata and non-
deterministic automata. The keystone demonstration is a DNAzyme doctor device
giving transduction of nucleic acid expression: programmed to respond to under-
expression or over-expression of certain nucleic acid strands that may indicate
a disease, and providing a response release of appropriate strands that can act
as a drug remedy. Secondary Tasks are computer software for optimized
design/simulation using realistic stochastic models and correlated to laboratory
tests. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The development of autonomous and programmable
molecular devices has a vast number of critical applications in the assembly and
control of molecular scale devices. Although this work will be limited to the
test tube to demonstrate fundamental capabilities, the impact of a DNAzyme
doctor operating in vivo could be enormous in medicine. Important educational
impact of the proposed research includes the highly interdisciplinary training
of graduate students and postdocs. &lt;br/&gt;
