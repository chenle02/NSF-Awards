The focus of this research is the chiral, non-enzymatic desymmetrization of meso
dicarboxylic esters. The methodology, based on the monohydrolysis of symmetrical
diesters, results in the production of half acid esters and represents an
extremely efficient entry to the preparation of valuable enantiomerically pure
starting materials. Enantioselectivity is achieved by the use of quinine-based
phase transfer reagents and may be of general utility within the pharmaceutical
industry. Dr. Niwayama's educational efforts will focus on the development of a
course that interweaves industrial research with traditional academic
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
efforts of Dr. Satomi S. Niwayama in the Chemistry Department at Oklahoma State
University. Professor Niwayama will focus her work on the development of
processes that can selectively distinguish between two identical ester groups
contained in the same molecule. The process will allow for the preparation of
only one of the two possible mirror image products that could result. The
methodology is expected to be a very inexpensive way to produce important
chemical intermediates used by pharmaceutical companies The educational
activities of the award will center on curriculum improvement and will include
the development of a new course entitled "Industrial
Chemistry."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
