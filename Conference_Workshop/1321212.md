Abstract

Award: DMS 1321212, Principal Investigator: Joseph M. Landsberg, Jeanne N.
Clelland, Colleen Robles

This grant provides partial support for a conference entitled "New Directions in
Exterior Differential Systems," to be held in Estes Park, Colorado on July
14-20, 2013. The conference is intended to disseminate new and influential
applications of exterior differential systems to partial differential equations
(integrable PDE, systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, and control theory),
complex differential geometry (variation of Hodge structure), topology of
algebraic varieties (homological rigidity of Schubert classes in compact
Hermitian symmetric spaces), and parabolic geometries (including conformal and
CR geometries). The conference program will include three sets of mini-courses
that aim to open up exterior differential systems and some of their current
applications to less experienced researchers.

Exterior differential systems are algebraic and geometric renderings of partial
differential equations, rooted in ideas that go back to the nineteenth century
and that untangle some of the complications of nonlinear partial differential
equations. The techniques of exterior differential systems are being applied in
a widening circle of problems and the mini-course components of this conference
are intended to make this subject accessible to junior researchers and to those
with little experience in the field. The conference web site is
