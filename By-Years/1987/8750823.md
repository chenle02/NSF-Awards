Physics is both an experimental and a theoretical science, involving an
interplay between observed phenomena and their description in mathematical
terms. Thus a substantial laboratory experience is an essential component in a
proper study of and understanding of the discipline. Johnson C. Smith University
will improve the quality of its undergraduate laboratory instruction in Physics
by replacing outmoded equipment with personal computers. These, with appropriate
interfacing devices, will be used as measuring instruments to collect data from
the students' experiments, and also as tools for analyzing the data and
presenting the results. The new laboratory program is expected to increase
student interest, and thereby student confidence and competence, and to attract
uncommitted students towards a career in the physical sciences and engineering.
