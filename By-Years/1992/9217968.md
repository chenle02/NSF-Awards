The project will address the effects of anthropogenic forces, such as pumping,
potential climatic changes and sea level changes on coastal aquifers. The work
comprises five analytical tasks: climate change-induced scenarios of sea level
rise; climate change- induced scenarios of streamflow and groundwater recharge
as derived from global circulation models (GCMs) and re-scaled to a regional
level; groundwater transport models of salt water intrusion and groundwater
movement; a groundwater management optimization model; and a case study on the
Santa Clara/Calleguas groundwater basin located in Ventura County, California.
Results from this research will provide a better understanding for the optimal
management and operation of coastal aquifers under climate-induced stress from
both sea level rise and changing groundwater recharge patterns.
