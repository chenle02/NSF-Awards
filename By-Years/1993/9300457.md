An "Engineering Research Experience for Undergraduates" (REU) Site for ten women
and minority students will be in the College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M
University. The REU program will be conducted in conjunction with an ongoing
Undergraduate Summer Research Program, sponsored by the Texas Engineering
Experiment Station for the past ten years, and the Minority Engineering Program.
Students for the REU program will be selected from institutions that have
predominantly minority enrollments including the University of Texas at El Paso,
University of Texas at San Antonio, University of Texas Pan American, University
of Puerto Rico, Trinity University, and Prairie View A&amp;M University as well
as Texas A&amp;M University, with at least half from other institutions.
Individual research projects will be undertaken by the undergraduate students in
conjunction with on-going research programs, and regular faculty involved in
these programs will serve as advisors for the participants' research activities.
