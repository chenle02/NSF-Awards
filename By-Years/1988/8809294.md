The decrease in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica during the Austral spring
has prompted concern over potential biological effects of an enhanced solar
ultraviolet radiation flux. Although few life forms inhabit the Antarctic
continent itself, the potential impacts on oceanic and coastal organisms are
issues which merit further study. Furthermore, the situation provides an
opportunity to test models of atmospheric transmittance of ultraviolet radiation
as a function of ozone concentration. Frederick proposes to define the
climatology of ultraviolet radiation over Antarctica and the nearby ocean.
Measurements of ultraviolet radiation will be taken before, during, and after
the period of springtime ozone depletion, using scanning spectroradiometers
located at three Antarctic stations (South Pole, Palmer, and McMurdo). Frederick
has developed a two-stream radiative transfer model which includes absorption by
ozone, multiple Rayleigh scattering, reflection from a lower boundary, and
scattering by clouds. Ultraviolet radiation climatology will be developed for
the entire Antarctic region over the sunlit portion of an entire year using
ground- based data at the available sites, satellite measurements of ozone over
the continent, and a set of radiative transfer calculations based on Frederick's
model. In addition, data will be used to evaluate the health and biological
consequences of the ambient levels of ultraviolet radiation.
