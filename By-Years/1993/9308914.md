9308914 Stahl The purpose of this proposed research is to develop alternative
theories of strategic thinking, design experiments to test the theories, and
statistically analyze the experimental data to answer the following questions: -
Is it possible to detect different modes of strategic thinking in an apparently
homogeneous population of experimental subjects, thereby rejecting the
hypothesis of a common mode of strategic thinking? - Assuming that no
experimental subject is precisely one of the theoretical types, how much
diversity within each categorical type is due to (a) small variations in priors
and (b) computational errors by subjects? - If subjects are given aggregate
information about the past choices of the population, how will the various types
incorporate that information? The results of this research should make important
contributions to our understanding of individual strategic decision making and
multi-decision-maker problems. ***
