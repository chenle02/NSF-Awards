This proposal presents an approach to resolving a critical and enduring obstacle
to developing dependable biosensor systems for the timely detection of toxic and
infectious agents. This device is vital to the protection of military personnel
and of civilians in industrial and densely populated environments. BSI
Corporation proposes to develop a passivated sensor surface which will associate
uniquely with the specific binding protein in its crude source solution and,
upon activation by light, covalently bond this protein functionally oriented in
a stabilizing, biomolecule-compatible environment A trifunctional amino acid
will be derivatized on one site with a photoactivatable reagent capable upon
illumination of forming covalent bonds with essentially any organic target group
(including all proteins) under mild reaction conditions. This reagent will then
be thermochemically bonded to a ligand for the specific binding protein and to
the sensor surface previously passivated with BSI's Photolink photoreactive
hydrogel, to provide an essentially aqueous environment containing chosen ligand
and photoreactive groups adjacent on the sensor surface. These reagents are
especially useful with antibodies and fusion proteins from genetic engineering
technology. This approach thus presents an innovative combination of affinity
chromatography and photoaffinity labeling technologies to provide a cost-
effective link between genetic engineering products and sensor devices.
