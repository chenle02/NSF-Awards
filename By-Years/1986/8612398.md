The Committee on Ground Failure Hazards Mitigation Research has been functioning
since 1983 with a members hip of geotechnical engineers, geologists,
hydrologists, land use planners, etc. It has issued several reports on
landslides, snow avalanches, etc. and a newsletter; initiated contacts with
Japan, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina, among other countries; and sent teams of
experts to sites where a ground failure disaster had occurred. The program of
work for 1986-87 includes: (1) followup reports on landslides; (2) completion of
report on economic impact of subsidence in U.S.; (3) preparation of reports on
economic impacts of expansive soils, snow avalanches, and after-ground failures
in U.S.; (4) continuation of the publication of the newsletter with increased
coverage of activities in other parts of the world; and (5) continuation and
expansion of the international information exchange.
