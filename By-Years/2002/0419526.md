This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further
develop a prototype high pressure/high temperature apparatus, which will be
capable of generating pressures of 10-30 GPa at 2000-5000C in mm3 volumes.
Having realized this objective, samples of high quality single crystal and
polycrystalline diamond by controlled crystallization from a high purity carbon
melt will be prepared and evaluated. This will substantiate the unique
capabilities of the apparatus. Concurrently functionally-graded nano-TiC/WC/Co
and nano-diamond/WC/Co anvil materials will be prepared.

This new class of superhard/tough materials as well as the process to fabricate
them at high rates will have applications including punch and die sets, wire
drawing dies, forging blanks, drill bits, machine tools for example.
