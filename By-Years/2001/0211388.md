West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that is native to Europe, Asia and eastern
Africa. It appeared in New York City in 1999 and has since spread to much of the
eastern USA. Models of WNV spread in the New World are clarifying the relative
roles of both the mosquito host and other vectors, especially migratory birds.
Recent reports place WNV in the Caribbean, which has serious consequence for
endemic bird species in the region, many of which are endanger. This project
will support more detailed models and a program of sampling will further
document the arrival of WNV in the Caribbean and help predict its spread and
possible containment.
