This grant will provide partial funding for participants in the international
algebraic geometry conference Géométrie Algébrique en Liberté (GAeL) taking
place from July 3 - July 7, 2023 in Warwick (UK). GAeL is an annual conference
in algebraic geometry focused on promoting the careers of young researchers in
the field, and it is unique among major conferences in the organization is
nearly entirely managed by junior researchers. This will be the 30th year of the
GAeL conference. GAeL has always been held in a European country, and funding is
traditionally focused on participants coming from European based institutions.
However, the professional development opportunities offered by the conference
are compelling for US-based participants as well, and funding from this grant
will be used to enable junior researchers at US institutions to participate in
the conference.

GaEL XXX will bring together many leading experts on range of topics within
Algebraic Geometry, providing an excellent opportunity for junior mathematicians
to learn about major new developments. The conference includes 3 senior speakers
each giving 4 hour mini-courses, as well as a range of opportunities (short
talks and poster sessions) for junior participants to present their own research
in front of an international audience. The mini-courses are an opportunity to
learn about cutting edge results and techniques, and they cover 3 distinct areas
of algebraic geometry: Mori Dream Spaces and quiver GIT; Specialization
techniques in the study of curves; and Kawamata log terminal singularities. This
conference is an excellent career opportunity for junior mathematicians entering
algebraic geometry, due to the exposition on cutting-edge research and the new
professional connections that are often made at the poster session and various
social events. Further information can be found at the conference website:
