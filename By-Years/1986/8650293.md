The undergraduate chemistry program at Bucknell University will be enhanced
significantly by providing students with laboratory experience in
crystallography. This project will install an X-ray generator and a precession
camera with Cu and Mo sources. The precession camera will be used at all levels
of undergraduate instruction for projects not previously possible. In general
chemistry, a library of precession photographs and exercises will be generated
to enable students to visualize the reciprocal lattice and crystal symmetry
elements. In physical chemistry laboratory, undergraduates will obtain their own
precession photographs and assign space groups. In undergraduate research,
students will derive unit cell parameters and assign space groups for their own
syntheses, preparatory to full single crystal structural determinations.
