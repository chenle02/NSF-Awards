This project is for theoretical and computational studies of pattern formation
and cell movement with the aims of (i) elucidating the types of mechanisms that
can produce the observed sequence of condensations leading to the humerus, the
radius and ulna, and the digits in developing vertebrate limbs, (ii) developing
microscopic models for non-interacting cells whose dynamics depend on external
concentration fields and which exhibit various behavioral responses to these
fields, (iii) developing continuum descriptions for the population-level
behavior of such cells, and (iv) developing models for the motion of cells in
dense aggregates. The principal investigator plans to analyze a model for
pattern formation that incorporates cell movement by random motion and
chemotaxis, the production and diffusion of the chemotatic species, and two
types of cells that are interconvertible. A major objective is to understand how
these processes interact to produce spatial patterns. Analysis and numerical
computations will serve to delimit the parameter values for which pattern can
develop in an initially-homogeneous tissue, and numerical continuation
techniques will be used to determine how the stable patterns depend on
parameters. The effects of other processes and the role of specialized regions
of the limb will be investigated in this context.
