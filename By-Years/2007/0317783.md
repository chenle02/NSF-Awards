With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Amy Miller will continue research
begun in 1998 on Yuma (also known as Quechan). Yuma is an endangered Native
American language spoken on Fort Yuma Indian Reservation in Winterhaven,
California. This project will result in language documentation of three types: a
detailed dictionary comprising approximately 12,000 items; a body of texts on
Yuma traditional culture published in the original language with English
translation and linguistic analysis; and a pedagogical grammar suitable for
teaching the Yuma language in reservation schools and in evening adult classes.

The dictionary, texts, and pedagogical grammar will serve as permanent resources
for both the academic community and the Yuma people. For linguists and
anthropologists, these materials will provide data on a rapidly disappearing
language and culture. For Yuma people, the materials will be used in language
revitalization efforts: The grammar will serve beginning and intermediate
speakers; the text collection will strengthen the linguistic skills and cultural
knowledge of those already fluent; and the dictionary will be useful at all
levels. For future generations, these documents will serve as records of Yuma
linguistic and cultural heritage.
