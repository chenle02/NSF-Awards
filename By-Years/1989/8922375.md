This proposed project would involve an assessment of the basic science
underlying low-temperature plasma processes of importance to industry,
particularly in materials processing and semiconductor fabrication. The Plasma
Science Committee, recently constituted under the auspices of the NAS/NRC with a
charge to take a unified look at the plasma field, and funded by several federal
agencies including the NSF (ENG, PHY, GEO), has established a subcommittee to
study the area of low-temperature plasma science and technology. The
subcommittee has recommended holding a workshop of some 10 specialists to take
an indepth view of the research needs and opportunities within this area: (i) to
identify key research problems in plasma physics and chemistry and the
interaction of plasmas with surfaces; (ii) to evaluate the potential impact of
advances in low-temperature plasma science on surface processing technology,
with an emphasis on semiconductor applications; and (iii) to expose the
scientific, technological and educational issues to the plasma science
community.
