This ROW Research Planning Grant is for reconnisance sampling of Late Triassic
rocks in North Carolina. Previous work to the north and in these basins suggests
that the rocks will yield significant assemblages of vertebrate fossils. The
fossils will be identified by reference to museum collections. The fossils and
the enclosing sediments will be used for paleoenvironmental reconstruction and
to gain insight into the causes and consequences of the Late Triassic extinction
event. The field and museum work to be supported by this RPG will enable the PI
to develop a research program in an area that will involve her with a larger
research community.
