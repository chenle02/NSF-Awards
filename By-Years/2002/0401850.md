This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports Professor Bryan Eichhorn at the University of Maryland to synthesize
and study the properties of a new class of ligand-free inorganic binary clusters
comprising catalytically-active transition metals and heavy group 14 and group
15 elements. Oxidation of these complexes in solution yields bimetallic
nanoparticles with improved selectivity in heterogeneous catalytic applications.
The research aims at developing catalysts with bifunctional activities through
the use of active supports or multi-component catalyst particles, and the room
temperature synthesis of different phases of alloy nanoparticles. The project
will investigate the chemistry of catalytic processes of bimetallic catalysts
including those for CO oxidation and lean NOx reduction in O2-rich exhaust
gases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles are used
in a wide variety of applications including optical devices, magnetic
nanostructures, and electronic devices. This research will provide synthetic
methodologies for bimetallic molecular precursors to advance the technology of
heterogenous catalysts. Graduate students, undergraduate students and
postdoctoral associates will receive excellent training in synthetic materials
methodology and the study of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts.
