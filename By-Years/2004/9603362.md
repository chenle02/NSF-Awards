This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in atmospheric science
involves Cesar Valladares and Dwight Decker of Boston College and Denis Alcayde
and his group at the Centre D'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements in Toulouse,
France. The award provides travel and subsistence support to the U.S.
investigators for trips to the United Kingdom and France. The objective of the
research is to investigate the global characteristics of plasma structuring that
develops in the polar cap and auroral oval. They will conduct joint analysis,
interpretation, modeling of data collected by the incoherent scattering radars
at Sondrestrom, Greenland, and EISCAT, Scandinavia. The project takes advantage
of access to radar data from Scandinavia and of the complementary expertise of
the U.S. and French investigators in modeling. The project advances
understanding of plasma structure and irregularities in ionospheric density in
the polar cap.
