This award provides continued support for the International Secretariat and
core operations of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). The
IGBP was established in 1986 by the international Council of Scientific Unions
(ICSU) in order to facilitate international collaborative research that would
describe and understand the interactive physical, chemical, and biological
process that constitute critical parts of the total Earth system and the changes
that occur within and among those components. The IGBP sponsors seven core
projects, each of which addresses a scientific question of major importance for
an understanding of global biogeochemical cycles. These core projects include
studies of atmospheric chemistry, ocean biogeochemistry, coastal zone processes,
terrestrial ecosystems and land use, biospheric aspects of the hydrologic cycle,
and past global changes. The IGBP also supports international data and
information management activities, and it co-sponsors the Global Change SysTem
for Analysis, Research and Training (START). Through this award, NSF will
provide three years of funding for continued support of the IGBP on behalf of
all agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change Research Program. U.S.
support is matched by contributions from more than 40 other nations.
