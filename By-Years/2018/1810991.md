Tennessee State University (TSU), a Historically Black University (HBCU) and
lead institution for the Tennessee LSAMP, has been chosen by the TLSAMP Alliance
to serve as the host site for the second cohort of LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate
participants during 2018-2020. A cohort of 12 LSAMP BD students will engage in
STEM research, academics and professional development leading to acceptance and
completion of the doctoral program. The Tennessee LSAMP graduate BD program at
TSU will have the potential to continue to promote systemic change in graduate
education practices and policy, in ways that increase the success of individual
students on the doctoral pathway and the effectiveness of STEM graduate programs
with a goal of diversifying America's STEM
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon the success of the first Tennessee
LSAMP BD program at Vanderbilt University (VU), TSU will employ VU's proven
"toolkit" with components for innovative recruitment, engagement, retention,
student tracking and dissemination that will include a mentoring e-dashboard to
advance the practice of mentoring formatively and real-time tracking student
progress and development. The toolkit also accommodates interview protocols that
has the potential to transform traditional graduate education practices. The
program includes collaborations and linkages with other STEM networks and
resources as well as other graduate programs, such as NSF's Graduate Research
Fellowship Program (GRFP), and institutional resources to ensure students
successful completion of the STEM doctoral degree. The program will be
externally evaluated and students tracked through the program and into STEM
careers following completion of STEM doctoral degree
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
