A new theoretical model of resonant cyclotron interaction of ions with Alfven
waves in the divergent solar wind plasma will be constructed. It is based on a
scale separation between the characteristic scales of wave-particle interaction
(microscopic scale) and the scales of nonhomogeneity (macroscopic scale). The
latter is five to six orders of magnitude larger than the former. The
overarching goal of the study is to explain recent observations of the solar
wind which have revealed that (1) the bulk speed of the particles considerably
exceeds that of the protons, (2) the differential motion of the ions is aligned
along the magnetic field, and (3) the differential speed follows the local
Alfven speed.
