The Principal Investigator is developing a research program in a novel concept
of high-density, high- speed optical memory and optical computing based on
photon echoes, that has inherent potential for massively parallel real-time
processing of temporally as well as spatially encoded data. Photon time- delayed
laser pulses pass through a resonant atomic system. The system responds by
emitting, after a certain delay time, a burst of laser-like light. This is the
echo. By studying the relaxation, modulation, polarization, etc., of the photon
echo signal, much detailed information about the dynamic interactions within the
atomic system can be obtained. On the other hand, the fact that the atomic
system emits a light pulse of some time after the passage of laser pulses,
implies that the system somehow remembers. This is the basic optical memory
concept of photon echoes.
