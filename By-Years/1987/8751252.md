This Teacher Enhancement project will increase the content background and
teaching skills of 48 precollege physics teachers in Virginia through a three
week summer workshop held at the University of Virginia in each of the next two
years. A representative sample of the target population was intimately involved
in the development and design of the workshop. The workshop content will
emphasize modern topics in physics and the use of the computer as an
instructional tool. The workshop staff will provide academic year follow-up in
the classrooms of the participating teachers and through one or more formal
group meetings during the academic year. A resource book of inexpensive physics
demonstrations suitable for the high school classroom will be another outcome of
the workshop. School districts of participating teachers will assure funds to
provide the materials and equipment necessary for the teachers to implement the
new topics in their physics instruction. The excellent needs assessment, the
commitment of the school districts, the servicing of a distinct area of need,
the relationship of the project to other related initiatives in the state of
Virginia, and the extensive follow-up during the academic year by the staff of
the project support and substantiate the award action.
