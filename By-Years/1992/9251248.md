A recently initiated undergraduate course in photobiology includes laboratory
work on light transmittance through biological media, quantum yield calculation,
photosensitization, photosynthesis, vision, determination of absorption and
action spectra, circadian rhythms, bioluminescence, and other selected topics.
The equipment includes a spectrophotometer for determining absorption spectra
and performing multicomponent analysis, UV and visible light sources and a
helium-neon laser for illuminating samples, a monochromator and an array of
filters for selecting specific wavelengths of illumination, and radiometers for
measuring light intensity.
