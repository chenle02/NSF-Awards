This award supports a workshop on the history of Ukrainian science and
technology, to be held in Kiev, Ukraine, in Spring 1998. The workshop will
further development of the history of science and technology in Ukraine,
contribute to the democratization process there, and increase our understanding
of the impact of the Soviet model on the organization and performance of
science. The workshop will bring together eight U.S. historians of science with
a group of Ukrainian scholars to present original research papers on the history
of Ukrainian science. Crucially, the Ukrainian participants will use the
occasion to gain access to previously-restricted archives, including those of
the Communist Party, the government, the Academy of Sciences, and research
institutes, which opens the history of Ukrainian science to unprecedented
scrutiny. The workshop will lead to increased collaboration between scholars in
the U.S. and the Ukraine, and will result in a volume of papers to be published
by the Ukrainian participants.
