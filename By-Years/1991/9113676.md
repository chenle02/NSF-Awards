This award will support collaborative research between James Weber, University
of New Hampshire, and Dr. Michael Bernhard, Centro Richerche Energia Ambiente
(ENEA), in La Spezia, Italy. ENEA is leading a major Swedish, German, and
Italian study on environmental methylmercury concentrations. Weber will work
with Bernhard on the methylation and demethylation of mercury compounds in
sediments. The research will emphasize addition of labeled inorganic mercury and
methylmercury to sediment microcosms with the goal of understanding biotic and
abiotic mercury methylation processes. The results of the collaboration should
provide increased understanding of mechanisms of mercury transformations, and of
the sources and quantities of methylmercury in sediments, and their transfer
into the water and biota. This knowledge could allow for assessment of potential
environmental hazards associated with methylmercury in biota. In addition, this
project would be an important initial step toward establishing a basis for
estimating methylmercury production and establishing environmental quality
criteria for it. Studies will be conducted under a variety of conditions
including: 1) addition or no addition of mercury compounds, 2) inhibition or
stimulation of certain bacteria, 3) aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and 4)
addition or no addition of potential methyl donors. Weber will contribute to the
project fundamental knowledge of chemical mechanisms involving organometallic
compounds and experience in developing techniques for determining low nanogram
and picogram amounts of methyl- and butylin compounds in a wide variety of
environmental samples. ENEA personnel will contribute general knowledge of
formation and demethylation of methylmercury in the Gulf of Genoa and the
Ligurian Sea and rivers draining into them, expertise on biological aspects of
the processes, and considerable experience with use of radioactive isotopes, and
equipment for measuring them.
