This project is on problems in matroid theory and graph theory, including (1)
Tutte functions, (2) biased graphs arising from gains, (3) matroid isomorphisms
of biased graphs, (4) forbidden-minor characterizations of signed graphs, (5)
surface duality for signed graphs, (6) generalized two-graphs, and (7) line
graphs. Emphasis will be given to developing general theories in the areas under
investigation. Priority will be given to (1) because of its possible importance
to knot theory.
