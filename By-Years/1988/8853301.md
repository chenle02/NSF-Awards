Thirty engineering workstations will be used for undergraduate instruction in
the fields of digital and integrated circuit design. Software tools for
electronic design automation are revolutionizing the engineering workplace.
These tools, executed on desktop engineering workstations, address such issues
as system definition and behavioral modeling, digital and analog circuit design,
the effects of temperature and manufacturing tolerances, testing, and integrated
circuit mask layout and verification. The equipment will expose students to a
design environment they are likely to see after leaving the university. A common
design environment thread will be established throughout the various
undergraduate programs.
