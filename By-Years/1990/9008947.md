To control a discrete event system, a supervisor is introduced which enables and
disables events in order to prevent undesirable behavior, that is, the events
that violate safety and other constraints. It is proposed that, in some
applications, a supervisor can take chances by not preventing undesirable
behavior that has very small probability of occurring. This can lead to better
performance. A concise and "logical" model is also proposed, which allows us to
combine controlled systems using conjunction, disjunction, shuffle and
sequential compositions. Forceful controllers are then introduced, which force
an event if a given condition is true. Finally, decentralized and hierarchical
control are formalized. Conditions for decentralization will be investigated. If
this research is successful, it will enhance the applicability of the theory of
supervisory control to complex discrete event systems such as manufacturing
systems, computer and communication systems.
