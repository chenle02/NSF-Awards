The goal of this proposed research is to develop a large-scale process to
produce functional mammalian antibody proteins by employing modified plant
cells. The creation of transformed plant tissue culture cells capable of
synthesizing functional antibody proteins has great potential for producing
large quantities of specific antibodies cheaply and efficiently. Single domain
anti-lysozyme antibody cDNAs have been subcloned into a plant expression vector
and introduced into cultured plant cells which will be employed for the
production of antibody proteins. Various signal peptide sequences will be tested
for the efficient secretion of antibody proteins into the medium from cultured
cells. The scale-up and optimization of the cell cultivation will be carried
out. The genetic stability of the antibody-producing cells will be monitored.
