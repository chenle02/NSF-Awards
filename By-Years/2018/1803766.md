The research conducted under this grant concerns the study of moduli spaces of
algebraic and geometric objects, and in particular those of manifolds. Manifolds
are mathematical objects generalizing the three-dimensional space in which we
live, and appear throughout mathematics and science. Locally they look like
ordinary space, though possibly of a different dimension, but globally their
shape may be complicated. As a consequence, they can have interesting symmetries
or can be deformed in interesting ways. It is a classical problem to understand
which symmetries and deformation exist, and how to distinguish these in a
computationally effective manner. Moduli spaces provide a geometric method to
access this information, and we will contribute to the progress of science by
furthering their study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand of the
topology of moduli spaces of algebraic and geometric interest, and in particular
their homology, the Principal Investigator will apply the techniques of homotopy
theory and higher algebra. Firstly, the PI shall use the existence of additional
higher-algebraic structures on moduli spaces. The PI will then use higher-
algebraic cellular structures to reinterpret homological stability results and
obtain meta-stable results about those homology groups for which homological
stability does not hold. Secondly, the PI will destabilize recent stable results
in manifold theory by comparing closely related moduli
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
