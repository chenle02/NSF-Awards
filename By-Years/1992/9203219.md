The development of new molecular genetic and statistical techniques provides the
opportunity to identify the number and genomic position of quantitative trait
loci (QTL's) through linkage associations of variable molecular markers. These
new techniques will be applied to a hybridization study of two species of
crickets in the genus Laupala: L.paranigra and L.kohalaensis. These species
posess an extremely simple acoustical communication system. Phenotypic variation
in female phonotaxis will be associated to specific QTL's in a hybrid backcross
design. These results will be compared to those obtained from another study on
the male calling song in order to test competing models of genetic architecture
of character covariation.
