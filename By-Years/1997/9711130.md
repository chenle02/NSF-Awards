9711130 Harcum This Research Planning Grant proposal addresses what appears to
be a commercially significant and scientifically under- investigated area, the
effect of bioreactor conditions on the glycosylation patterns of protein. The
research program would study mammalian cells grown in continuous culture
(chemosts) and determine the effect of variables such as agitation, pH,
temperature, growth rates, etc. Electrophoretic and chromatographic separations
coupled with mass spec and NMR analyses will be used in structural
determinations. ***
