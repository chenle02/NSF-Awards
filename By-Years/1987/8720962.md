This award will provide partial funding toward the purchase of an electron
microprobe x.ray analyzer system to be installed and operated in the Department
of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado.Boulder. The instrument
will be used for elemental analysis of rock, mineral and other natural as well
as synthetic materials on a microscale, i.e., with a spatial resolution of a
micrometer. The new instrument will replace a 25.year old machine that is no
longer functional. The new microprobe laboratory will provide a modern
analytical facility for research by staff and students of the University of
Colorado and other nearby institutions in the Rocky Mountain region.
