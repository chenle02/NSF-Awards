Nanotechnology has tremendous promise in improving the human health through
better imaging, diagnostics or drug delivery. AME2014 International Congress on
NanoEngineering for Medicine and Biology (NEMB 2013) will help catalyze and spur
on this field by bringing together leading academics with interests in
experimental and theoretical aspects of nanotechnology. These experts will
discuss topics related to improved prediction of nanoparticle delivery in the
body, to novel strategies for using nanomaterials for disease detection and for
construction of diagnostic platforms. The exchange of ideas and interactions
afforded by this conference will help identify problems and possibilities and
will lead to new collaborations and new concepts in the field of nanotechnology
and nanomedicine.
