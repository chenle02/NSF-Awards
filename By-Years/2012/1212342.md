This award supports the education and public outreach program at the Soudan Mine
Underground Laboratory, the country's only operational underground high energy
particle physics and astrophysics facility. The Lab is hosted in a Minnesota
state park, where each year approximately 4,000 of the Park's visitors venture
2,341 feet underground to see the facility, the Main Injector Neutrino
Oscillation Search (MINOS) and Super- Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS)
experiments, and to learn about neutrinos and dark matter.

The Soudan Underground Mine is a historical site operated by the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources in an old iron mine in northern Minnesota.
Around 28,000 people per year take the "historical" tour in the park, visiting
the workings at the bottom of the half-mile deep mine. The Laboratory is also on
that lowest level of the mine, where experiments benefit from the vast reduction
in the cosmic ray background compared to the Earth's surface. These experiments
are looking for individual interactions of weakly interacting particles such as
neutrinos or proposed Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) dark matter
candidates. The coincidence of an established education and outreach program, a
top-notch research facility, and an unusual and impressive location provide a
great opportunity to bring students and the general public into the lab where
they learn about the often esoteric world of particle physics in an intriguing
and accessible fashion.
