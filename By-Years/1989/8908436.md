This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of inorganic, bioinorganic, and organometallic chemistry. During
the twelve month period beginning 1 September 1989, Dr. Rakowsky will expand her
background in inorganic and organometallic chemistry to include capabilities in
Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FTNMR) and pulsed electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Specifically, Dr. Rakowsky will
collaborate with Professor Gareth Eaton of the University of Denver and
Professor Sandra Eaton of the University of Colorado at Denver on the study of
the interaction of paramagnetic metal centers with nitroxyl moieties in spin-
labeled iron porphyrins. FTNMR and pulsed EPR techniques will be used to
delineate fundamental aspects of long range intramolecular electron exchange
interactions. This Career Advancement Award will facilitate Dr. Rakowsky's move
into physical bioinorganic chemistry and should advance significantly the
development of her independent research career.
