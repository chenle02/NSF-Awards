The interpretation of quantum mechanics and other contemporary theories in
science are experiencing strain because, on the one hand, they appear to involve
some kind of holism, while on the other hand holism has generally been regarded
as hopelessly obscure. Professor Teller will resolve this interpretive impasse
by developing and applying a conception which he calls "relational holism." This
new concept differs significantly from much traditional work on holism and can
be made acceptably clear by the standards of contemporary analytic philosophy.
Professor Teller will apply the resulting notions of moderate and radical
relational holism to clarifying the ways in which the spirit of classical
scientific thought seemed to be non-holistic, the ways in which there are
nonetheless important holistic strands in classical science, and the ways in
which quantum mechanics involves a radical break with traditional non-holistic
prejudices. The results will clarify the ways in which quantum mechanics departs
from traditional conceptions. Further applications will lay the groundwork for
coming to terms with the traditional puzzles of David Hume about causation (how
can one prove that an effect and a cause are necessarily connected?) and for
clarification of the recent resurgence of interest in holistic elements in the
social sciences.
