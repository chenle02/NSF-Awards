Most proteins do not exist by themselves in living systems but interact with
other proteins in assemblies much as do members of a family. Mass spectrometry
is becoming an important approach for investigating large protein assemblies in
the gas phase. The goal of the research is to assemble and evaluate
instrumentation for investigating macromolecular assemblies of proteins, to
identify what proteins and how many constitute an assembly, to learn how they
interface one to another, to discover what regions are free and what regions are
part of the interface, and in the gas phase. The instrument is a Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer, and it will be built around
a presently existing 7-tesla superconducting magnet. Once the instrument is
built, protein assemblies will be introduced via a very gentle process called
native electrospray ionization, and their masses measured with the highest
performance instrument type that is available in mass spectrometry. Energy will
then be added to the complex by high energy collisions to reveal the
organization and interfaces of the assemblies. Results will be published in the
scientific literature in widely disseminated journals and posted as abstracts
and reports on a web site: http://msr.dom.wustl.edu/.
