This award supports participation in the 2022 Biology and Medicine through
Mathematics (BAMM) conference, held May 18-20, 2022, at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond, Virginia. The aim of the conference is to highlight
recent developments in the fields of mathematical biology and medicine. The
meeting will: i) provide a regional biomathematics conference that promotes
junior investigators (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior
faculty); ii) give visibility to a range of applications and methods in
mathematical biology; and iii) provide a good environment for networking between
junior and senior researchers. The conference will host approximately 100
attendees. The conference will be a mix of plenary talks, break-out sessions,
and a poster session. Travel support will increase the accessibility of the
conference by junior researchers.

Junior researchers (undergraduates and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars,
and early career faculty) will benefit from participating in this meeting. BAMM
will provide an intimate conference environment with opportunities to present a
poster or give a talk for researchers at all levels. Student researchers new to
the field will have excellent opportunities to attend talks from many sub-
fields. Participation of women and members of minorities underrepresented in
mathematics and science will be encouraged and supported. The participant
demographics from the 2019 conference indicate that travel awards have a
positive contribution to the diversity of the participants. The organizers
anticipate a similar, positive impact on this year's event.
