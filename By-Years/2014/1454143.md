Designing software for cyberphysical systems (CPS), such as modern airplanes,
automobiles, and medical devices, using the software development tools available
today is a challenge. The software may be distributed with real time constraints
and must interact with the physical environment in non-trivial ways. Multiple
known accidents involving safety critical systems reinforce the need for testing
and verification tools that provide a guaranteed level of confidence in the
system correctness and robustness. As safety-critical CPS become ubiquitous, the
need for design methods that guarantee correct system functionality and
performance becomes more urgent. This project results in software tools for
testing, verification and validation of complex CPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to commercialize the academic tool S-TaLiRo, a software tool for
the verification and testing of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). S-Taliro provides
such capabilities by enabling automatic test generation and verification guided
by formal specifications expressed in temporal logics. It can analyze large and
complex Simulink models, user-defined functions and blackbox models. S-Taliro
provides functionality for specification falsification, parameter estimation,
conformance testing and runtime specification monitoring. Moreover, due to the
modular architecture, S-Taliro can be extended to add further functionality in
support of model-based design (MBD) processes. At its current prototype stage,
S-Taliro can be integrated in Matlab/Simulink provided by Mathworks.
