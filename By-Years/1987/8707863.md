The field of optical computing has seen a gradual evolution. Perhaps its most
important applications thus far have been in evaluating various transformations
or mappings from one set of numbers into another set which can ideally be
related to the former with as much accuracy as desired. Multiplying one set of
numbers by another set of numbers and adding the result is a simple example of
such a transformation. Optics is advantageous because it can handle a large
number of such calculations all in parallel. The problem is that it involves the
measurement of light intensity which cannot be done with as much accuracy as one
might wish. This leads to the primary disadvantage of using optics. The present
proposal deals with a means by which such optical calculations can be increased
in accuracy. The technique called preconditioning would be important if it can
be done generally.
