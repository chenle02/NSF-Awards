This CAREER award will support laboratory and numerical modeling of midocean
ridge hydrothermal circulation. The research component will use finite-element
models of cellular convection to examine questions of nonsteady flow, two- or
three-dimensionality, and the effects of nonlinear phase properties. The
teaching component will be built around a laboratory class in which students
will develop various experiments in fluid dynamics.
