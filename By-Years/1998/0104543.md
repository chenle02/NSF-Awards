The Wildlife Conservation Society seeks funding for a three-year project to
develop an after school and Saturday program for 180 high school students from
the Bronx in New York City. The families are all low-income and 85% are below
the poverty level. Students will attend sessions two times a week after school
from 2:30pm-5:00pm for 18 weeks; one-half day on Saturday per session will also
be included. Sessions will be held in the spring and fall, and will include a
total of 180 students over the three years of the project. The science content
will be based on the Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo Education (WIZE) curriculum
materials developed by the Bronx Zoo and supplemented with hands-on activities
at the Zoo. The program will bring students from Bronx-area high schools to the
Bronx Zoo where they will learn to observe, formulate hypotheses, collect data,
analyze and present the data. Student will learn aspects of ecology, anatomy,
animal behavior, food webs and chains, etc. Participating students will receive
high school credit from the city of New York for participating. The Institute
for Learning Innovation, an Annapolis, MD-based, non-profit educational research
and development organization, will conduct formative/remedial and summative
evaluation of the implementation and long-term impact of the program.
