Record high snowfall in the Copper River basin, AK, during winter 2011-2012 is
expected to result in anomalously high water and sediment discharge in early
summer (June-July). To characterize river outflow and sediment dispersal during
this time, this RAPID project will survey flow properties, sediment
concentrations, and the distribution of fluid muds near the river mouth and on
the shallow shelf. In addition, cores will be collected in the Gulf of Alaska
and Prince William Sound to explore the potential for developing a paleo record
of Copper River discharge, which is expected to vary with climate conditions.
This work will take advantage of a historic snowfall season to better understand
the effects of climate perturbations on discharge and sedimentation patterns in
an ecologically important high-latitude region.
