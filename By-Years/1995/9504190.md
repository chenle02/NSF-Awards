Two major goals in multiprogramming research are: (1) to design and understand
the modules (e.g., processes or data objects) of a program in isolation, without
considerations of interference by the other modules, and (2) to implement the
modules on separate processors with a fine grain of interleaving so that no
processor is ever locked out of accessing common data for long periods of time.
Further, it is essential to devise a model in which the distinction between
computation and communication is removed; in particular, the methods for
designing and reasoning about the interfaces should be no different from those
employed for the computations at the nodes of the network. The project is based
on the hypothesis that many of the programming concepts developed for databases,
object-oriented programming and designs of reactive systems can be unified into
a compact model of distributed programs that meets the desired goals. In the
past, much effort has gone into limiting interference among the modules by
employing a variety of synchronization mechanisms: locks or semaphores, critical
regions, monitors and communication. In this project, no specific communication
or synchronization mechanism, except procedure call, is built into the model.
Yet, the traditional schemes for communication using bounded or unbounded
channels, semaphores, and accesses to shared memory can be encoded as modules.
This project uses two distinct kinds of procedures, to model sequential and
concurrent aspects of programming. The programming model allows for disciplined
interactions between these two types of procedures. The research seeks to: (1)
develop the model, in particular for dynamic creations of modules (2) implement
the model on top of an existing language, and (3) develop the appropriate
formalism to specify and verify the properties of programs.
