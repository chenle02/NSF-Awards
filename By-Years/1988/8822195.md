This research includes an analysis and extension of the plasma spray process,
the establishment of laser annealing parameters, development of laser etching
techniques, design and fabrication of thick film devices for high frequency
applications, acquisition of families of test data, and optimization of a proof-
of-concept system using plasma spraying, laser annealing, and laser etching for
the fabrication of microwave, millimeterwave and sub-millimeterwave devices. An
important aspect of this program lies in the development of processing
techniques for large scale production of electronic and microwave components.
