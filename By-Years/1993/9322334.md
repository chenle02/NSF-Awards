Harvard University to continue a successful Research Experiences for
Undergraduates SITE for another three years. The Division supervises Ph.D.
training programs of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for students who
are engaged in biological research in laboratories on the Medical School campus.
This 10 week summer research program will support 10 undergraduate students each
summer working in the fields of microbial biochemistry and genetic regulation.
Students will be recruited from a nation-wide pool, with a particular emphasis
on recruiting qualified minority students and women. They will have the
opportunity to carry out projects in the laboratories of any of 16 Division
faculty who are participating in this program. Special program activities
include: weekly student-faculty research seminars to discuss the students'
projects, discussions of ethical issues related to the project content, and a
career development discussion series. Division minority and majority faculty and
graduate students participate in the seminars and ethics discussions, and the
program students are provided with additional opportunities to meet other
majority and minority research faculty and graduate students in both academic
and social settings. ***
