9217526 Porter The objective of this proposal is to carry out a systematic,
multitechnique investigation of the nanometer-scale structural and electronic
properties films derived from aniline, functionalized aniline, and aniline
copolymers. The study will utilize the techniques of scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM), tunneling spectroscopy (TS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). STM and TS provide local,
nanometer-resolved structural and electronic information on the material's
surface. XPS identifies the chemical state of the polymer films, whereas EPR
will be used to investigate the paramagnetic properties of the polymers. The
study will begin with the electrochemically plated and free standing films of
polymers derived from aniline, hydroxyaniline, and aniline-3- aminophenylboronic
acid. The primary goal of this research will be to gain a fundamental
understanding of the influence and interplay that the chemical structure has on
the nanometer-scale structure and morphology. In addition both the chemical and
physical structures will be correlated to the observed macroscopic conduction
properties of these materials. This research in an undergraduate, minority
institution serving Native Americans will allow the students to participate in
contemporary materials research dealing with polymeric synthetic metals. ***
