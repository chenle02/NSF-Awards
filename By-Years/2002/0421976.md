This SBIR Phase II project focuses on olefin/paraffin separation. Ethylene and
propylene are produced in larger quantities than any other organic chemicals. A
new membrane system is under development, which provides high olefin recovery,
extremely high olefin fluxes, drastically improved olefin/paraffin selectivities
over conventional facilitated transport membranes, and long-term operation
stability. During Phase II, a laboratory prototype will be demonstrated.

Integration of this membrane system into an olefin plant will drastically
improve ethylene, propylene and butadiene in a more energy efficient and
economical way. Polymer-grade olefins can be easily produced with this membrane
process with minor post-treatments. Economic analysis showed that incorporation
of the proposed membrane system into an ethylene plant can drastically reduce
capital and operating costs of the entire plant. As a result of reduced power
consumption, this membrane process will correspondingly reduce emission of
greenhouse gas CO2.
