With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Profs. Stefan
Franzen and Jon-Paul Maria of North Carolina State University and Karl Booksh of
the University of Delaware are investigating the structure/property
relationships that regulate surface chemical interactions, and the mid-infrared
optical properties of electrically conducting oxides, metallic nanoparticles,
and their hybrid combinations. Specifically, the multidisciplinary team is
studying surface plasmon oscillations in the mid-infrared, and how those
oscillations can be tuned by modulating the nanostructure of conducting oxides.
Effects on tunability of these optical phenomena by incorporation of metallic
nanoparticles are also under investigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work seeks
new understanding of how light interacts with solid surfaces. It will provide
new opportunities to probe the attachment of macromolecules and biomolecules on
robust oxide surfaces, enabling novel mechanisms for surface characterization
and sensing. It also provides opportunities for graduate students (particularly
those from underrepresented groups) to collaborate with researchers in Poland
and China through the PIs' well-established international exchange programs.
