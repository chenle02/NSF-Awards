The Florida Museum of Natural History holds extremely valuable anthropology and
zooarchaeology collections. These are widely used in anthropological research,
and the latter, which include large numbers of faunal specimens, constitutes a
significant national resource. Analysts working with archaeologically recovered
animal and fish bones turn regularly to these materials of known species and
origin for reference. The Florida State Museum plans to move these materials
this summer to a new compact storage system. To prevent damage of fragile
specimens during this move and to guard against mixing, it is important that
careful packing is done, and National Science Foundation funds will be used for
this purpose. This work is important because the anthropological specimens are
used by a large number of researchers and should be made available in a
maximally efficient manner.
