A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of
the 43rd ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and
Implementation (PLDI), the premier forum in the field of programming languages
and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation,
theory, applications, and performance. The conference will be held in San Diego,
California. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented
groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the
mentoring workshop in addition to the PLDI conference. The impact of the award
relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for
students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next
generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming
languages and programming systems research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
