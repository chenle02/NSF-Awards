This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program supports research in
chemistry to be conducted by Dr. Laurence S. Romsted of Rutgers University, Dr.
Clifford A. Bunton of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Dr. Hernan
Chaimovich of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Dr. Faruk Nome of the
Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The project will provide new
information on the interactions of ions and molecules at association colloid
surfaces. The project will enable the continuation of a successful collaborative
effort between the four groups and will continue to test, refine and develop
models for treating reactivity in association colloids such as micelles,
microemulsions and vesicles. New methods for estimating surface concentrations
of species in micelles and vesicles; quantitative modeling of specific ion
binding effects on micelles; and the modeling of ion binding on the interior of
sonicated vesicles are among the immediate goals of the project.
