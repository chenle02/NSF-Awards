This project will develop a guidebook to assist mentoring activities of middle
school math and science teachers. The guidebook will include techniques and
suggestions for effective mentoring. The first draft will be completed by Fall,
1992. A group of teachers in the Birmingham area will serve as mentors to
teachers selected by their principals and will use the first draft to assist
them. These teachers will have already completed a separate Teacher enhancement
Workshop on improvement of subject matter content, teaching skills, and
mentoring.
