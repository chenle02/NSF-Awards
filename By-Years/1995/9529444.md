CDA 9529444 Nau, Dana Hendler, James University of Maryland at College Park CISE
Research Instrumentation for AI Planning Research The Department of Computer
Science and the Institute for Systems Research at the University of Maryland
will purchase computing machining equipment, including a small multipurpose
machine tool, a pentium-based personal computer for solid modeling and input to
the tool, and a large disk drive for keeping large case-based planning
libraries, all of which will be dedicated to support artificial intelligence
research in the area of computer and information science and engineering. The
equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
*AI-based planning for manufacturing, *High Performance Support for Large
Knowledge Bases, *Combination of generative and case-based reuse techniques in
AI planning, and *Low-cost robotics. In addition, a CAD tool will be donated by
Bentley Systems Inc. to facilitate experimentation with the AI planning
techniques in the manufacturing domain.
