Geometric shapes can be either smooth or singular. Smooth ones have been studied
effectively by the calculus, while singular geometric shapes are much more
difficult to study in general although they appear with abundance in the world
around us. One method to understand singular shapes is by measuring distances
between their points. To do that, the best way is to use the so-called Einstein
structures, which originate from general relativity. In this project, the
investigator plans to study Einstein structures on a class of geometric shapes
called algebraic varieties, which are central objects in many branches of
mathematics. This study will allow us to measure distances and reveal certain
mysterious structures of algebraic varieties. This project requires combinations
of many techniques and will bring experts from different fields to interact. Its
outcome will have potential applications in the development of several theories,
including canonical metrics in differential geometry, stability theory in
algebraic geometry, and string theory in mathematical physics.

The investigator will study the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture about the
equivalence of K-stability and the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on
singular Fano varieties. This requires new strategies to overcome difficulties
due to the presence of singularities. The investigator has introduced a new
process, the minimization of normalized volumes, for detecting local geometries
of algebraic singularities. On the algebraic side, the investigator will
continue his research on the K-stability of Fano varieties by studying
minimization of normalized volumes and applying deep techniques of the minimal
model program from algebraic geometry. This could lead to new criteria for the
K-stability of singular varieties. On the analytic side, the investigator will
apply various newly-developed techniques, including a variational approach via
pluripotential theory, a priori estimates for singular complex Monge-Ampere
equations, Cheeger-Colding-Tian's regularity theory from metric geometry,
algebraic structures on Gromov-Hausdorff limits, and asymptotical analysis of
singular metrics. The combination of these techniques will be effective in
solving Kahler-Einstein equations on singular varieties.
