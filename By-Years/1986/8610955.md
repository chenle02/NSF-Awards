Through ths project, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) will
help coordinate the research activities funded by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) on the Mexico earthquake of September 19, 1985. The
coordination will facilitate a focused research effort by promptly disseminating
relevant information, including research in progress, to all the research
participants; by suggesting additional areas that participants may investigate
to enhance the overall research program; by acting as a clearinghouse for
information and interaction between the participants; and by providing a broad-
based perspective of the overall research effort.
