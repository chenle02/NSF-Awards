The CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric regions) program
carried out an extensive multi-instrumented collaborative campaign (AIDA) in
Puerto Rico in the Spring of 1989. This project concerns the analysis of the
data from the Utah State University Imaging Doppler Interferometer Radar
operated during that campaign. The basic tasks will be to determine mesospheric
winds for comparison with other radar measurements made during the same period,
analyze the data for a spectacular meteor event that occurred when several
optical experiments were operational, extend the wind determinations to the
analysis of acoustic-gravity wave effects and to non uniform motions, undertake
a determination of the mesospheric scattering lifetimes and perform specific
analyses in cooperative studies with all the other participants in the campaign.
