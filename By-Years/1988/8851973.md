The proposed project has two primary goals: first, to upgrade current laboratory
facilities in the Electrical Engineering Department used in computer engineering
courses; second, to develop a prototype of the ideal laboratory environment for
courses in the computer engineering area. Currently-used obsolete single-board
computers will be replaced by modern microcomputer development/prototyping
systems. These systems will be supported by engineering workstations for
software development support and hardware debugging support. The workstations
will be networked to file server for centralized storage and input/output
sources. This networked workstation environment, communicating directly with
hardware development systems and laboratory instrumentation, will provide a
state-of-the-art capability resulting in an enhanced laboratory experience for
students in computer engineering courses.
