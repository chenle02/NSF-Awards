An outstanding problem in magnetospheric physics involves understanding the
source and loss mechanisms of the Earth's radiation belt electrons. It is
thought that various plasma waves play an essential role in this regard. A
recent observation suggests that there may be large-amplitude whistler waves
propagating obliquely with respect to the ambient magnetic field. These waves
may play a significant role in accelerating the radiation belt electrons to
relativistic energies within a few seconds time scale. This project will
rigorously study the propagation of large-amplitude whistler waves in an
inhomogeneous magnetic field and plasma density by solving the fully nonlinear
cold electron fluid equation coupled with relativistic test particle simulation
code. Previous work in this area has been limited to the quasi-linear regime,
uniform magnetic field and density and parallel propagation of the whistler
waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide variety of physics based models are being
developed to forecast radaition belt variations for space weather applications.
It is important to know whether or not obliquely propagating waves are an
important source of particle acceleration. It is similary important to know to
what extent a fully nonlinear treatment of the problem is required. In addition
to the societal benefits of this research because of its relevance to space
weather forecasting, the project has educational benefits as well because a
postdoctoral researcher will participate in the research.
