How do changes in the activity of genes in the brain contribute to behavioral
flexibility? One epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, creates temporary
changes in gene expression. DNA methylation can also lead to changes in gene
activity that are passed from parent to offspring called genomic imprinting. The
role of genomic imprinting and DNA methylation in modulating behavior will be
investigated using Nasonia, a parasitoid insect used widely in biological
control of pests and an emerging model system for behavioral genetics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A wide range of behaviors will be examined for
imprinting, including activity level, dispersal, aggression, courtship and host
choice. Using high throughput sequencing differences in methylation and gene
activity (expression) between brain and body will be measured for the entire set
of genes of the organism. Experiments will also test whether partial "knockdown"
of the activity of genes that cause DNA methylation leads to changes in behavior
and behavioral gene activity within and across generations. Finally, controlled
genetic crosses will test whether parents influence the behavior of their
offspring through DNA modifications passed through egg and sperm. By comparison
to the few other studies on focusing on one behavior, this study on a more
typical insect species group and multiple behaviors will allow us to determine
how frequently DNA methylation is a common method of modulating behavior in
different organisms across a wide variety of taxa, how variable the role of
methylation in behavioral flexibility is and how often these effects carry
across generations. To advance discovery based learning, the project will be
integrated into an undergraduate course on research methods in behavioral
genetics. Because parasitoids kill pest insects, the project could lead to
improved methods of biological pest control due to a better understanding of how
behavior is regulated in these important insects.
