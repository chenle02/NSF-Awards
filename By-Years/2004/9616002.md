This three-year award to the Department of Education will support the
participation of a US consortium in an innovative multicultural curriculum for
young scientists and engineers from the US and the European Union (EU). The US
consortium is headed by the University of Texas at Austin, and includes the
University of Virginia at Charlottesville and the Oklahoma State University at
Stillwater. Support of this proposal will allow 18 US graduate and undergraduate
students to enroll in the seven institutions in the counterpart European
consortium supported by the European Union and receive academic reciprocity and
a double diploma, and to participate in an industry internship. The seven
institutions in the European consortium are headed by the Ecole Central of Lille
in France, and include the Free University of Brussels and the Catholic
University of Louvain in Belgium, the University of Zaragoza in Spain, the
Technical University of Munich in Germany, Brunel University in the United
Kingdom, and the Polytechnic Institute of Milan in Italy.
