Transcription termination factor Rho is an ATPase that binds to the nascent RNA
transcript and catalyzes its site-specific release within E.coli and coliphage
transcription units. This proposal outlines a kinetic and thermodynamic approach
with the goal of gaining a greater physical understanding of the molecular
interactions and dynamic processes that occur during the termination reaction. A
synthetic paused ternary complex will be constructed from the E. coli rho
attenuator (att) region, an important Rho-dependent terminator that is located
in front to the rho gene, and which autogenously regulates the level of Rho in
the bacterial cell. The use of a recent technique to generate a homogeneous
population of paused transcription complexes will be used. A transcription
blockade is created through the binding of a cleavage-defective EcoR1 mutant
endonuclease bound to an engineered EcoR1 site placed at strategic locations
within the att region. The energetics of Rho assembly and the kinetics of
transcript release will be measured to test key questions about the termination
reaction. The RHo binding site on the attenuator transcript will be determined
by RNA footprinting studies using primer extension/chemical modification
techniques. The relationship between the site of the blockade and the energetics
and kinetics of Rho attachment and transcript release will be evaluated.
