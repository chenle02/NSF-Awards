To display complicated information, a common instinct is to draw a picture that
is equally complicated. Yet, minimizing distraction by details is the goal.
Translating natural and effective renderings of unembellished important
structures to computer presentation is conceptually and practically a very
difficult problem. Two basic ideas underlie the approach here: First, depicting
several views and then drawing the links to identify the same object in the
several views gives a sense of the position of the object vis a vis others even
in many dimensions. Second, taking natural groupings of objects and examining
their interrelationships allows focusing on the finer structure of the group.
From these two basic principles, a conceptually coherent approach to viewing
multidimensional data can be derived. Then actual methodology based on focusing
and linking can be developed; user interface architectures to make efficient use
of these techniques can be tried and prototypes can be implemented.
