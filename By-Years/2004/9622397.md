Abstract - Kosanovich - 9622387 The Department of Chemical Engineering at the
University of South Carolina will purchase on four processor Sun SPARC station
20 workstation and one three PSRC Xterminal which will be dedicated to support
research in Chemical Engineering. The high performance computing environment
will be used for research in the areas of process modeling, optimization, and
system identification as applied to anaerobic fixed-film processes and semi-
batch filtration processes. Specifically, it will be used primarily for two
research projects: (1) nonlinear parameter estimation and optimum operability
policy determination for a fixed-film biological wastewater treatment process
and (2) system identification of a semi-batch filtration process. In addition,
the computing environment will advance and improve the quality, and broaden the
scope of research and education in the basic areas of process design, dynamic
modeling, and optimization.
