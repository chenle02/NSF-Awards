9513671 Milgram Cells are composed of a number of separate membrane bound
structures. Each of these structures carries out a specific function, such as
energy production, degradation of old and damaged proteins, and intercellular
communication. The proper functioning of the cell depends upon the ability of
the cell to direct each of its many thousands of proteins to the correct
structure. There are many cells, including those in the brain and endocrine
glands, which synthesize small chemical messengers called peptides. Once these
small proteins are released into the intercellular space they find their way to
target cells and bind to proteins imbedded in the surface of the recipient cell
and initiate signaling. These peptides are derived from larger protein
precursors which are packaged into packets for release called secretory
granules. However, the mechanisms whereby proteins and peptides are targeted to
secretory granules is unclear. The present work investigates the mechanisms used
by proteins to insure their packaging in the proper secretory granules and will
determine whether the amino acid sequences of the proteins contain information
sufficient to direct the proteins to the correct intracellular organelle. This
research will provide a greater understanding of how peptides are made and
targeted to secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells. In addition, this work
is essential for understanding how cells in all organisms use chemical
messengers for communication and has applications to cell biologists beyond the
neuroendocrine field.
