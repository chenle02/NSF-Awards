0121510&lt;br/&gt;Mariano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports
Professor Patrick S. Mariano, Department of Chemistry, University of New Mexico,
to conduct collaborative research with Professor Ung Chan Yoon, Pusan National
University in Korea. The joint study will focus on electron transfer
photochemistry. Among the various types of reactions occurring in electronic
excited states of organic substrates are those that involve intramolecular
transfer of atoms and groups. These reactions proceed by concerted or multi-
stepped routes. This collaborative research between U.S. and Korean researchers
is to develop new and useful photochemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
