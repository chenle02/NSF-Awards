A microcomputer mathematics laboratory is being established for use in courses
for the first two years of college mathematics. Students are working with
computer investigations of mathematics concepts in a laboratory situation. These
investigations include the construction of mathematical processes and objects on
a computer, the use of symbolic manipulation, and the use of graphics to foster
cognitive development of understandings of mathematical ideas and concepts. In
addition, an appropriate cooperative learning component for the laboratory and
classroom settings is being developed. Research into how students learn
mathematics, and into their attitudes about mathematics and the learning of
mathematics is being conducted in this setting. Investigations are also being
conducted into how the use of computer technology and an appropriate cooperative
learning environment can enhance the learning of mathematics for a non-
traditional population.
