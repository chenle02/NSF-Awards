The increased demands upon industrial and transportation equipment (power
plants, airplanes, etc.), coupled with the continuing shortage of engineers
familiar with the potential (and shortcomings) associated with Non-Destructive
Testing (NDT), make it imperative that this be an area of increased emphasis in
the education of today's engineering students. This project expands and upgrades
the Non-Destructive Testing Laboratory by augmenting present A-scan capabilities
with two B-scan units. These two instruments, with auxiliary computer equipment,
provide the portability and versatility necessary for demonstrating NDT
techniques in a realistic environment. The NDT laboratory supports and provides
practical applications to a variety of disciplines. The award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
