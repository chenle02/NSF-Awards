This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Patricia A.
Thiel of the Chemistry Department, Iowa State University. Thiel will continue
investigations of phenomena occurring at metal surfaces, including decomposition
of formic acid, reactions of fluorocarbons, and thin film growth. Studies will
include the mechanism of formation and decomposition of oxides at nickel and
palladium surfaces. %%% The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high
quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as potential
for continued significant contributions to scientific research, the academic
profession, and the education of future scientists. Particularly noteworthy
achievements are studies concerning the adsorption of water by metals and the
structure of thin films, as well as the education of graduate students.
