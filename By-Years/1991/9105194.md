The durability of concrete is an important factor in the long time performance
and safety of concrete structures. this project will investigate the effects of
various admixtures, embedded materials, and different mix combinations or the
durability of the concrete. Analytical and experimental investigations will be
conducted. This is also a joint project with Canada.
