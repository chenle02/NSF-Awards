9500170 Gea This award provides support for the development of an integrated
design tool for optimizing the shape and topology of three-dimensional shells
with stamping-bead stiffeners. A novel approach, Multi-material Design Domain
Method (MDDM), will be used to model different bead configurations. In
conjunction with a Generalized Convex Approximation (GCA), the optimal shape and
layout of beads will be obtained. Based on the direction of principal strain,
the orientations and configurations of bead design will be precisely identified.
To ensure that the final design has the optimal shape and topology, a sizing and
shape optimization process will be integrated into this method. Once the
proposed methodology is developed, it will benefit our automotive and aerospace
industries in three-dimensional shell assembly design. This method will shorten
product development time and produce optimal designs with the greatest saving in
resource. The concept of this method can also be extended to many other
applications and result in a new tool for product design. Consequently, it could
lead to products with higher quality and the lower cost being brought to the
marketplace more rapidly.
