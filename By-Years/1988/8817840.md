This research is to develop algorithms and software to help implement the
automation of robotic assembly workplace planning. In electronic manufacturing,
many kinds of printed circuit boards have parts to be inserted by a robot, and
the insertions can be made in any sequence. Likewise, one is free to choose
locations of bins or feeders to contain the parts. The choice of the assembly
sequence and the location of the bins can greatly affect the total assemble
time, and thus manufacturing productivity. The investigators will develop
algorithms to determine a best assembly sequence, as well as best bin locations,
using ideas in combinatorics and location theory. Results obtained thus far has
reduced the dimension of the problem by 50% over the best available previous
approach. These algorithms will be implemented with user-friendly software,
operable on a personal computer, which will also function in an evaluation mode;
the user can employ a pointing device in conjunction with computer graphics to
specify an assembly sequence and location of bins. The investigators will
examine related problems when set-up times are dominant, and problems involving
the distribution of parts to bins. Expected results should be applicable in
other manufacturing contexts involving robots.
