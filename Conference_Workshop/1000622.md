While the subject of numerical linear algebra dates back to before the first
computations were performed by computers, it continues to be a vibrant topic of
research. It is central to practical fields like optimization, data mining,
signal and image processing, and control, to name a small subset. Recent
advances in computer architecture, including the emergence of hardware
accellerators like GPGPUs and the Cell Broadband Accellerator, have forced a
fresh look at perturbation (e.g., because such processors often do not support
IEEE standard arithmetic and/or mix precisions), performance (how to unleash the
promised performance), and portability (programmability) issues. This conference
will bring together leading experts in the field to examine recent and possible
future advances related to these issues.

A two day event will be held in the Advanced Computing Engineering and Sciences
(ACES) building on the UT-Austin campus, July 19-20, 2010. The meeting will
examine past and present contributions as well as future opportunities in the
field of computational linear algebra, a key subject within mathematics and
computer science that supports computational science. The conference includes
invited talks by established authorities as well as rising stars in the field.
An opportunity for more junior researchers (graduate and postdoctoral students)
to showcase their research is included in form of a poster session. A panel
discussion will examine the state of the field and future opportunities. The
participation by individuals who do not have other federal support, and by
students, postdocs, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities will be
encouraged.
