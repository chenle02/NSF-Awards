The International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the University of Alaska
Fairbanks has requested the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutionâ€™s (WHOI)
Mooring Operations and Engineering Groups (MOE) expertise in the design of nine
under ice subsurface moorings being deployed in the Arctic in the summer of 2021
for a period of two years. MOE personnel will also provide mooring operations
expertise and will participate on the deployment cruise being staged from
Kirkenes, Norway. WHOI will define the science and instrumentation requirements
prior to the construction of the moorings by taking into consideration
environmental factors (such as ocean currents and sea ice). Following the design
phase, the UAF and MOE teams will oversee the construction of the
moorings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
