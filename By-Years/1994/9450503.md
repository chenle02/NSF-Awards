9450503 Brett The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network's Science
Student Internship Program (SSIP) project will enable five minority mathematics,
science, or engineering (MSE) majors to participate in a ten-week summer
internship at NSF and in an academic year outreach project based at each
student's home institution. The students will be exposed to decision-making and
policy formulation in science and engineering fields; provide agencies with high
ability students who can make contributions to existing programs; prepare
students for future MSE leadership positions; enhancing the students' awareness
of MSE educational policy issues impacting minorities; and reinforcing the
importance of community service. NSF staff will gain valuable insights from the
student interns into the obstacles preventing minority students from pursuing
MSE careers and possible strategies for significantly increasing the
participation of minority students in MSE fields.
