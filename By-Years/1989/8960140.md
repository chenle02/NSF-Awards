Compared to cathode materials for electrosynthesis, there are much fewer
suitable anode materials which are at the same time stable, inexpensive,
electrocatalytic for the process, and electrically conductive. This research
involves the preparation and characterization of chemically modified carbons,
containing a substantial amount of unique functionality covalently attached to
the carbon. Modified carbon anodes will be evaluated for regeneration of ceric
ion which is useful in oxidation of aromatics to commercially valuable products.
Also to be evaluated is preparation and use of tailor-made "cerium anodes" for
in-cell electroorganic synthesis.
