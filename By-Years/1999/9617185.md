Charlton, Jane 96-17185 Dr. Charlton will conduct two observing programs with
the new Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The first is a survey of Mg II absorbers, which
focuses on their statistical evolution relative to H I and high ions. The second
is a study of the kinematics of absorbers at higher resolution to chart the
evolution of low ionization gas kinematics. The results of this research are to
provide a first view of low ionization gas in the high redshift universe, a
statistical sample of both low and high ionization absorption lines as a basis
of future studies and a database from which high redshift Mg II absorbing
galaxies can be identified and followed up with imaging.
