With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Profs.
Michael A. Dvorak and Daniel Gregory of St. Cloud State University will develop
a time-resolved laser based instrument for integration into the undergraduate
chemistry research and curriculum experience. This is a collaborative venture
between St. Cloud State University and Dakota Technologies Inc. (DTI). The
overall goal of these studies is to create affordable and easy-to-operate
modules that can be readily coupled to commercial spectrofluorimeters, and
greatly expand their capabilities. This research will focus on the development
of two spectroscopic modules: a nanosecond laser light source, which will allow
recording of fluorescence decay data, and a transient absorption accessory,
which will allow absorption studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and
graduate students will be heavily involved in the development phase of this
project and will use the instrument in their research. Thus, the educational
impact from the instrumentation for undergraduate chemistry training will be
significant. Central to any chemist's training is the understanding of
spectroscopic techniques that play a critical role in all areas of chemistry.
