Theoretical research in cosmology will apply techniques and insights from
elementary particle physics and from string theory. String theory seeks to
describe all the fundamental forces of nature, but its very difficult to test at
currently accessible energies. The cosmological research will include studies of
the idea that the universe contains regions (`bubbles`) in which the energy
density is less than the critical value needed to stop the universe from
expanding forever. These bubble models are the only known predictive models for
a universe with subcritical energy density, and so it is important to calculate
their detailed consequences and properties to compare with the data, which will
soon be good enough to determine the universe's energy density. Also, many of
these subcritical models (and more general cosmological models) probe high
energy scales, and thus may provide significant tests of superstring theory.
