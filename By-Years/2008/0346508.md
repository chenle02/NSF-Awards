This SGER-ACT project (see below) will pursue design and development of a new
generation of high-sensitivity infrared sensors whose critical component is a
tunable high power narrow-band infrared source. The infrared source is based on
the sharp absorption features of surface plasmons in a two-dimensional metallic
photonic lattice, which resides on a silicon carbide substrate. Use of silicon
carbide instead of silicon should allow higher operating temperatures, greater
optical output, and increased device sensitivity. The performance of the optical
lattice will be simulated at Iowa State University. These simulations will
permit exploration of many structural designs including change of lattice
symmetry. In addition to addressing a number of fundamental physics (plasmon
thermal emission) and optics issues (role of the photonic crystal), this work
will guide the fabrication of test devices, to be fabricated by the industrial
partner, Ion Optics (Waltham, MA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work aims
to develop sensitive, accurate, field-deployable, lightweight sensors for
detection of several chemical warfare agents of national importance in the
battle against terrorism. The project will also have a strong impact on
integrating research and education through training of graduate students and
postdoctoral scientists in methods for enhancing national security. The NSF and
the Intelligence Community support this award jointly. It is made as part of the
Approaches to Combat Terrorism (ACT) Program in the Directorate for Mathematics
and Physical Sciences. This program supports new concepts in basic research and
workforce development with the potential to contribute to national
security&lt;br/&gt;
