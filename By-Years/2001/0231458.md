In this research, Real-time Traffic Adaptive Systems are modeled as Feedback
Control Systems, where new decisions (the "phasing" in traffic network signal
control and the ramp-metering rates in freeway control) are implemented based on
"feedback" from sensors that monitor traffic. The feedback includes (i) a
measurement system, (ii) a system that estimates/predicts traffic, and (iii) a
decision/control system that computes appropriate decision/controls. In
developing these systems, issues are raised on (i) the design of the feedback
control system, (ii) the stability of the system, and (iii) the "responsiveness"
of the system. The research will address these issues and particularly focus on:
(1) Characterizing the communication/computational delays in the feedback
(including the computational cycle of getting measurements, processing them,
executing the embedded decision-making algorithms, processing the result, and
downloading it to decision actuators /signals), (2) Characterizing the effect of
design parameters in the feedback, such as "decision horizon", "control update
interval", and "space-time resolution" of the decision-making algorithms, (3)
Studying the stability of the system, in the sense does it go to an
"equilibrium" or does it "cycle" in the limit, and (4) Investigating how well
the feedback system responds to temporary short-term conditions (incidents,
traffic surges, etc.) and slow varying long-term changes (e.g., gradual changes
in the overall traffic volumes). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to basic
research contributions and involvement of PhD students in the effort, it is
anticipated that (1) the results on stability and responsiveness of traffic
adaptive systems will be introduced into curricula, and (2) the analysis of the
traffic adaptive systems would be very useful to USDOT and traffic agencies that
are planning to implement state of-the-art systems within their
jurisdictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
