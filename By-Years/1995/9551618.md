Companies frequently team their employees over widespread regions when
undertaking large and detailed projects. At present, these enterprises use
leased analog and digital communication lines and will no doubt switch to
computer networks as the "Information Superhighway" becomes a reality. From a
pedagogical point of view, this modern approach to teaming requires that
educators develop in their graduates the skills required for this new reality.
These skills include, among others, identifying expertise and interest within a
larger distributed group, segmenting tasks in a meaningful fashion, integrating
designs across a high-speed network, verifying performance against
specifications, and compiling and writing a comprehensive final report. Without
these skills, our students face a competitive disadvantage when confronted with
cheaper, more classically trained engineering talent now prevalent in the global
marketplace. To confront this challenge to engineering education, this project
has designed and implemented team learning and team teaching using the Internet.
The principal investigators are well-acquainted teaching and research faculty
who specialize in digital signal processing. The project features signal
processing courses with a heavy emphasis on distributed experimentation. The
equipment used to support these new courses is located at each university
involved in the project and will form a large connected multimedia laboratory.
These individual laboratories support audio and video transmission necessary for
facilitating real-time student interaction over the Internet. Relevant
experiments and learning aides are being developed and will be disseminated
electronically through standard Internet services and through the development of
a multimedia textbook authored by the investigators.
