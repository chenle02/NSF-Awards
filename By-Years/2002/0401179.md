Proposal DMS-0401179 PI: Arshak Petrosyan, Purdue University Title: Certain
aspects of free boundary problems

ABSTRACT

The aim of this proposal is to study certain free boundary problems with the
lack of "classical" properties such as the uniform ellipticity (parabolicity) or
the nonnegativity of the solutions. More specifically, the PI proposes to study
the following questions that will help to understand the essence of the new
difficulties and the possible ways of their resolution: 1) the continuity of the
derivatives in the obstacle problem for the sub-Laplacian in the Heisenberg
group; 2) the classification of homogeneous global solutions of the obstacle
problem for the p-Laplacian in the plane; 3) uniform convergence of the level
sets in a degenerate phase-transition model; 4) smoothness of the free boundary
in a degenerate Bernoulli-type problem in the plane; and 5) one-phase obstacle
and Stefan type problems with no sign restrictions on solutions. Some of the
problems can be attacked by using recently developed methods, while a
revitalization of some older methods might prove successful in other cases.
Partial results as well as empirical evidence (in some cases) are provided to
support the expected and conjectured results.

Free boundaries are apriori unknown sets, coming up in solutions of partial
differential equations and variational problems. Typical examples are the
interfaces and moving boundaries in problems on phase transitions and fluid
mechanics. Main questions of interest are the regularity (smoothness) of free
boundaries and their structure. Thanks to the contributions by many
mathematicians the theory of free boundaries has developed over the last decades
to a very deep and beautiful part of mathematics. However, in a number of free
boundary problems that arise in applications, ranging from geometry and optimal
control to robotics and superconductivity, certain traditional assumptions may
break down. The aim of this proposal is to understand which results could be
carried over from the classical theory of free boundaries to the case of those
problems.
