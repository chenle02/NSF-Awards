The Tech Museum of Innovation is producing a 3,000 square-foot permanent
exhibition, complementary online acitivities, and a Design Challenge curriculum
to engage visitors in the exploration of Internet techologies. The goals of the
project are to enhance the technological literacy of middle school students,
provide the general public with tools, experience, and confidence to participate
in shaping the future of the internet, and advance the informal science
education community through applied research in networked exhibit technology.
Two distinct features of the exhibit are: 1) The Smart Museum, a computer
network linking gallery and online expereinces, and 2) "dynamic content," a set
of strategies for rapid exhibit updates that will mirror the changing Internet
for the life of the exhibition. The Design Challenge curriculum will be used at
the museum, in outreach to classrooms and community centers, and in training
sessions for science educators. The summative research will be shared with the
science education community via The Tech's web site as well as professional
seminars, publications and conferences.
