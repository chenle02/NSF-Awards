Each year mathematical sciences faculty are invited to apply for a grant to host
the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) National Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Program (NREUP) at their own campus over the summer. NREUP is
structured both to increase undergraduate completion rates and encourage more
students to pursue graduate study by exposing them to research experiences after
they complete their sophomore year. NREUP is designed to reach minority students
at a critical point in their career path - midway through their undergraduate
programs. As course work becomes more abstract, many promising students are not
able to adjust to the demands of a major in mathematics, but with a strong
connection to a faculty mentor established through the NREUP, students are given
the tools they need to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NREUP program reaches
students at a critical transition point in their studies. By the summer after
their sophomore year, students typically have a strong background in calculus
and a course such as linear algebra or differential equations with some degree
of exposure to the proof-based mathematics needed prior to undertaking a
research project in mathematics. At this transition point, between lower
division and upper division studies, faculty will provide mentoring in a
challenging summer program that supports students as they continue their
undergraduate studies and encourage students to pursue graduate studies and
careers in mathematics. Longitudinal external evaluation data collected from
students in this program over several decades helps us better understand the
STEM pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
