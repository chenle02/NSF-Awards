This proposal describes a program of research to examine some of the factors
likely to affect the diagnostic problem-solving performance of work teams that
run multi-operator systems, It is concerned most specifically with those
situations in which teams are confronted with sudden, critical system
malfunctions. The proposed research is founded on a conceptual framework that
delineates the informational bases of coordinated team problem- solving. That
framework emphasizes the importance of --- and structural barriers to ---
discussing diagnostic information that initially may be available to only some
team members. Five controlled laboratories experiments are proposed to examine
the impact of several situational factors likely to affect the way in which
teams use the information at their disposal when diagnosing critical system
malfunctions.
