The ventral photoreceptor of Limulus continues to be a highly productive
preparation for detailed electrophysiological studies of phototransduction and
light-adaptation: it is large, isolated, and readily voltage-clamped. This
research will reveal new evidence that: (i) ventral photoreceptors (in situ)
undergo circadian changes in responsivity to light; and (ii) pharmacological
agents, shown to mimic the effects of endogenous efferent neurotransmission in
the lateral eye, change function in ventral photoreceptors as well. These
findings open up the possibility for uncovering the mechanisms mediating
efferent control of photoreceptor gain (change in membrane conductance per
photon), shape or duration of quantal bumps, and other cellular mechanisms
associated with phototransduction or light-adaptation that are under efferent
control.
