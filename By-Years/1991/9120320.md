Marywood College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the PREPnet mid-level network. The connection enhances
collaborations of campus researchers with colleagues in several fields such as
dietetics, psychology, business and managerial science, social sciences and
mathematics, and enables on-line access to remote bibliography databases and
supercomputers. This award funds part of the costs for two years.
