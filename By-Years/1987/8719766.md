This research continues work on knowledge-intensive systems for machine
learning. The approach taken, Explanation Based Learning, is expanded from small
"clean" problems here into more complex domains. In such complex domains, an
automated learning system will inevitably acquire incorrect concepts. Inference
will not be logically complete, but only plausible. Research is targeted toward
detecting and refining such concepts when they cause performance failures. The
significance of this work is that it expands machine learning capabilities
attack more realistic problems, and offers a promising avenue of solution to the
problem of knowledge acquisition in expert systems, since an EBL system derives
its own "rules" rather than needing them to be specified and programmed by a
human intermediary.
