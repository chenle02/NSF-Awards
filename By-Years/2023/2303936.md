With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the
Division of Chemistry, Shaowei Li of the University of California, San Diego is
developing a method to measure how electrons move and molecular vibrations
change as a function of both space and time when excited by short laser pulses
in molecules and two-dimensional materials. These low-dimensional systems
exhibit unique dynamics that are sensitive to nanoscale chemical variations,
which are difficult to observe using existing microscopic techniques. The Li
group is developing a new microscopy called hyperdimensional scanning tunneling
microscopy (HD-STM) to study these materials with Angstrom spatial resolution
and femtosecond temporal resolution. This approach has the potential to uniquely
reveal details about atomic-scale ultrafast dynamics and potentially enable the
manipulation of these dynamics on-demand. Dr. Li will also develop a five-week
summer research program for high school and undergraduate students that focuses
on increasing student interest in science.

Hyperdimensional scanning tunneling microscopy (HD-STM) couples STM with
visible-infrared pump frequencies, THz (terahertz)-probe frequencies, and
optical/photoluminescence spectroscopy to extract structure, chemical, and
reactivity details about interfacial samples across a wide scale of space, time,
and frequency. The Li group will work to develop this instrumentation so that
electron transfer and nuclear motion in molecules and low-dimensional materials
can be observed with high resolution in the space, time, and frequency domains.
By coupling high resolution STM with optical spectroscopy to do high spatial
resolution visible-pump THz-probe spectroscopy, there is the potential to
examine chemical structure and reactivity at surfaces down to a single atom or
bond, with implications for a broad range of science.
