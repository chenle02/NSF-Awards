This Research Initiation Award is to develop a new approach for detecting
targets on the ocean surface using microwave radars with frequency and
polarization diversity. In the proposed approach, received signals from
resolution cells lying adjacent to a given cell are processed adaptively to
obtain relevant information about the spatial structure of the ocean surface.
This information is used to implement a detection strategy which maximizes the
contrast between the target and the background medium. An investigation of
various theoretical aspects of the problem along with its testing will be
conducted. The application of the proposed concept to other problems and the
impact of the proposed work are discussed. Over two decades of research in the
area of microwave remote sensing of the ocean has established the strong
connection between the characteristics of microwave sea echo and the physical
characteristics of the ocean surface. Improvements in the performance of high
resolution radar systems operating in an ocean environment can only be achieved
by recognizing this dynamic link between the statistical characteristics of
microwave clutter and that of the ocean waves. The research is an attempt at
solving this problem by unifying ideas from three different disciplines of
research (viz., detection and estimation theory, scattering of electromagnetic
waves from rough surfaces and oceanography). This represents a new approach to
the problem and results from this work as well as its theoretical aspects are
expected to generate a good deal of interest in the scientific community.
