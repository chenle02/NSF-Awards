9411609 Asbeck A sampling oscilloscope will be purchased which will be dedicated
to support research in the characterization of high speed devices and integrated
circuits, supporting activities of at least four faculty members. It will enable
research efforts to explore the application of high speed semiconductor
technologies to commercially important systems such as high speed fiber links
and wireless communications. Specific projects that will benefit include:
development of high speed optical modulators and driver amplifiers; development
of ultrahigh speed Read-Only-Memories for frequency synthesis; measurement of
high frequency characteristics of HBTs, including large signal characteristics
and storage time; development of high speed, low power circuits based on
resonant-tunnel-diode/heterostructure transistor combinations; and development
of novel microwave mixer circuits. ***
