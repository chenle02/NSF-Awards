This one-year award for an international dissertation enhancement project
involves Jared Tatum, a graduate student of Graham Harrison of Clemson
University. The objective is to send Mr. Tatum to Cranfield University for a
three-month period to learn the fundamentals of three-dimensional particle image
velocimetry (PIV) and apply this new technique to research in non-Newtonian
fluid mechanics. His doctoral thesis is part of a larger US-UK cooperative
research project between Dr. Harrison and Dr. N. J. Lawson at Cranfield
University. They are using optical techniques to experimentally investigate
particle sedimentation and migration through three different fluids in the
presence of a plane, vertical wall. Three different test fluids are being
employed: a Newtonian reference fluid (the subject of Mr. Tatum's research), a
shear-thinning polymer solution, and a constant (shear) viscosity elastic
liquid. The goal is to identify the characteristics of the flow field that lead
to and result from unusual motions of particles.

This proposed cooperative research program will advance the training and
development of an US graduate student. He will learn novel optical techniques
and have access to advanced equipment at Cranfield University.
