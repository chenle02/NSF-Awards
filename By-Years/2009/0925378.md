Objective: The objective of this program is to demonstrate new nanoscale
photodetectors with high sensitivity and bandwidth for nanophotonic integrated
circuits. The approach exploits self-assembly or solution-process of nanocrystal
quantum dots in nanogap electrodes to achieve high fabrication integratability
with varieties of nanophotonic components. Incorporation of plasmonic effects
and new fabrication processes to reduce tunneling barriers are explored to
enhance sensitivity and bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This research
will demonstrate new design and fabrication of nanoscale quantum dot
photodetectors that can be readily incorporated into nanophotonic device
integration. The device structure utilizes concentrated high electric field for
enhanced efficiency and charge transport. The research on optimizing chemistry
and conditions for quantum dot deposition will offer a route to increased speed,
a major challenge for quantum dot devices. The utility of plasmonics to
concentrate optical field and enhance quantum efficiency will help addressing
the prevailing question of optical coupling in nanophotonics. If successful, the
research will provide a first solution to fully integratable nanophotonic
photodetection. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The growing field of Nanophotonics
has increased the demand for faster, smaller, and more sensitive on-chip
photodetection. Given the divergence in materials and fabrication processes in
nanophotonics, a nanoscale photodetector with full fabrication integratability
has yet to be demonstrated. Success of this research could have a transformative
impact in nanophotonic integrated circuits and broader fields of optical
computing, communications and sensing. This research will also provide exciting
multidisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate
students, and lead to broader impact to the society through diversity
development, education and outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;
