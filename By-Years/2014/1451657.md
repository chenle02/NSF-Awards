This award to the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez will enable early career
faculty to travel to Arlington to meet with program directors at the National
Science Foundation and other agencies. The intellectual merit of this project
lies in its ability to enhance the research activities of early career faculty
via meetings to discuss their research areas and specific funding opportunities.
By speaking directly with program directors about their proposed research,
faculty can engage in deep discussion about research areas and activities,
receiving feedback that will help them submit successful proposals and produce
more impactful outcomes. The broader impact of this award is in its ability to
support a population that is historically under-represented in engineering. The
faculty are of Hispanic heritage and have positions at institutions that are
Hispanic serving. Supporting the faculty efforts to successfully compete for
research funds and generate more effective outcomes will directly benefit the
graduate and undergraduate student populations at their institutions.
