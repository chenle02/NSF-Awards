This award supports the establishment of a two-year cooperative research
project between two groups of theoretical physicists led by Benjamin Grinstein,
Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory, Dallas, and Anthony Sanda, Nagoya
University. In addition to Dr. Grinstein, six other U.S. scientists will
participate in the project by visiting Japanese research facilities in Nagoya,
Osaka, Hiroshima, and Tsukuba. The need for this project is underscored by
worldwide interest in building e+e- B-factories, and the recognition that
B-physics may also be competitively studied in hadron colliders. In particular
there is need to determine which aspects of B-physics are best studied in
electron-positron B-factories, and which in hadronic colliders. Central to this
collaborative effrot are studies of CP-violation (both in B-meson and b-flavored
baryons decays), extraction of elements of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix,
and the methods for computing the rates of rare decays of B- mesons. In
addition, the recently developed techniques of the heavy quark Effective Theory
must be incorporated into these studies. These difficult problems will be
attacked by combining the varied approaches and expertise that this
collaboration brings together.
