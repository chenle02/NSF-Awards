This award provides support for a workshop to formulate a plan of research to
study terrane accretion in southeast Alaska and adjacent portions of British
Columbia. Geologists and geochemists who have extensive experience in the region
will be brought together with geophysicists who have expertise imaging features
in the deep crust. Because of the network of water ways in southeast Alaska, it
will be possible to exploit the logistic and scientific advantages of using
offshore/onshore seismic imaging techniques. The geological community has a good
working understanding of the distribution of rock types in the area and models
for their formation and evolution. What is now needed are constraints on the
nature and distribution of structures and lithologies to the base of the crust
and into the upper mantle. At the workshop, the overall tectonic history of the
region will be presented, followed by discussions leading to a determination of
what geophysical techniques could be used to resolve the major questions and
where they could best be applied.
