LIN 9300708 The object of this study is to understand the specific mechanisms in
which the 3-D mid-ocean topography is controlled by various loading forces
arising from ridge segmentation. In the first phase of the study, a new 3-D
ridge thermal model will be developed that will include heat input associated
with along-axis variations in crustal emplacement, crustal hydrothermal cooling,
and lateral heat transfer across the steep walls of rift valleys and transform
troughs. In the second phase, the hypothesis that the observed ridge morphology
is generated from the 3-D lithospheric deformation will be tested. And in the
third phase, the results of the theoretical models will be compared with data
from four well surveyed areas of the mid-ocean ridge.
