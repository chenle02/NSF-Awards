The goal of this project is to involve advanced biology students at this
historically black institution in modern methods for purifying and analyzing
biomolecules. A low speed preparative centrifuge and an ultracentrifuge are
requested to introduce students to modern methods in molecular separation, as
well as experience in a wide range of traditional techniques.
