This doctoral dissertation research project assesses when supreme courts review
statutes and under what conditions. Does the likelihood of judicial review vary
across issue saliency, institutional rules (e.g., elected or appointed courts),
justices (e.g., party affiliation), and strategic situations (e.g., divided or
unified control of government)? Despite the centrality of these questions,
judicial scholars have only recently begun to systematically examine the forces
influencing statutory review. Thus, this doctoral dissertation systematically
analyzes and evaluates: 1) the extent to which judicial review varies across
areas of law with varying degrees of saliency; 2) whether older statutes
presumably passed by dormant coalitions, are more likely to be declared
unconstitutional than newer statutes; and, 3) whether judicial review varies
across institutional or political circumstances that can be reasoned to
influence the strategic environment of state supreme courts. The research design
employs the collection and analysis of data from the fifty states. These data
consist of the population of state supreme court judicial review cases in five
areas of law. The analysis involves statistical estimation and evaluation of
models of five types of legal cases that came before state supreme courts in the
1970-1996 period. This doctoral dissertation promises to provide a holistic
picture of judicial review by state supreme courts.
