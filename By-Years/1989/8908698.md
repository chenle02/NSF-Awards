This proposal outlines a series of experiments that would explore important
questions of judgment and choice under uncertainty and contribute to the
understanding of basic decision processes. Central to the study is the
development and testing of a theory of response mode effects that will provide
new insights regarding alternative explanations for preference reversals in
choice, including regret theory and contingent weighting. This topic is
receiving a great deal of attention from researchers because of the implications
for the study of decision making if systematically different rank orders are
obtained depending on the choice between formally equivalent assessment
procedures. Thus the project also has general theoretical importance, for the
study of contextual effects on decision processes, as well as practical
implications for the development of improved decision- aiding tools. Three
studies are proposed that extend earlier work of the principal investigator to
provide new information on the stability and consistency of preferences and
decisions, based on experiments conducted under a variety of conditions and in a
variety of contextual settings.
