REU SITE: Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site in Astronomy at the
University of Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST
0453395 Williams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Dr. Jonathan Williams, and co-PI,
Dr. Robert Jedicke, will continue the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Program at the Institute for Astronomy (IfA), at the University of Hawaii Manoa
campus. Eight undergraduates per year, during a ten-week summer program, will
undertake research under the supervision of an IfA faculty member. Research
areas include solar system astronomy, stellar astronomy, star formation studies
and extragalactic astronomy. As part of the program, students will give a
presentation to the IfA at an REU symposium at the end of the summer, and
present poster papers at national meetings. Students will also take part in a
weeklong observing project on two telescopes (one optical/infrared, one radio)
at Mauna Kea Observatory. &lt;br/&gt;
