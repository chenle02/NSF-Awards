9318151 Cassel An alliance of physicists and computer scientists will take on
the Grand Challenge task of developing a fault-tolerant, wide-area, distributed
computing and database system for use in high energy physics. The results of
this research will also be applicable to many other HPCC applications requiring
intensive and long-running computations and massive data samples which force
data to be acquired and distributed over many sites. The project involves
Cornell, the University of Florida, the University of California at San Diego
and the University of Texas at Austin.
