The overarching theme of this project is new discoveries in the theory of
partitions. These discoveries concern both new objects (e.g. Durfee symbols and
k-marked Durfee symbols) and new aspects of venerable problems (e.g. MacMahon's
partitions without sequences, Alder's Conjecture, etc.). First the proposers
consider symmetry studies of the relevant generating functions for the k-marked
Durfee symbols. The next topic is the asymptotics related to partitions with
short sequences. Then the proposers study partial fraction methods whose genesis
lies in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook (a manuscript studied extensively by the
senior PI). In addition the proposers look at questions arising from recent
discoveries concerning lecture hall partitions and conclude with further
investigations of the long standing Alder Conjecture on which the co-PI has made
a major breakthrough.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposal continues the training
of graduate students, one of whom has started a plausible combinatorial approach
to the symmetry study mentioned in the first paragraph. While these topics are
based on studies in the theory of partitions (a branch of additive number
theory), it is notable that partitions with short sequences have interesting
implications in probability theory. Also there has been a spate of recent work
revealing fascinating relations between k-marked Durfee symbols and recent
developments in the theory of modular forms.&lt;br/&gt;
