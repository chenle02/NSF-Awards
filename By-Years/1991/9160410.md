The research will develop a thin-film integrated capacitor structure that
incorporates an insulator with a very high dielectric constant. This can have
important application to high- density computer memory chips with elements on
the micron and submicron scale. In its rutile crystalline form, titanium dioxide
exhibits a dielectric constant greater than 100, which corresponds to a
capacitance of 1 microfarad per square centimeter for a 100 nm dielectric layer.
This can be integrated together with TiN electrodes, so that the entire
TiN/TiO2/TiN trilayer structure can be prepared simply by reactive sputtering
from a single Ti metallic target in appropriate atmospheres. Since TiN is also a
well-known diffusion barrier in silicon technology, it will prevent interaction
with other materials during processing steps. This trilayer can then be
patterned using ion etching to isolate the various capacitors on the chip. The
work will optimize the process for manufacturing these capacitors on large-area
Si wafers, demonstrate their reliability, and to develop improved deposition
equipment that incorporates these processes into integrated circuit
manufacturing technology.
