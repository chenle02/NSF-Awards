9616302 Qamar This award supports the cost of installing a network of
continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in the state of
Washington for the purpose of measuring ground motion associated with subduction
zone tectonics, volcanic activity, and earthquakes. The Principal Investigator
will coordinate the installation and operation of the network from the
University of Washington. The basic research goal of the measurements to be
taken by the network is an understanding of the processes leading to deformation
of the continental crust in the Pacific Northwest region due to the combination
of forces from the oblique subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate, the entrainment
of the Sierra NevadaOregon Coast Range block, and the local forces created by
the topographic gradient from the Basin and Range to the Columbia Basin. The
network is also expected to provide important data for improved assessment of
the seismic and volcanic risk in the region. ***
