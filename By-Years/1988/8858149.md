This Presidential Investigator Award will support a broad program of
mathematical research in operator theory, which may be thought of as linear
algebra in infinitely many dimensions. The original impetus for this subject
came from quantum mechanics, and today there is an expanding area of
applications to systems theory and control theory. Professor Bercovici's work on
skew Toeplitz operators will enrich this important connection. Other research
directions to be pursued include the study of quasitriangular operators, and the
development of the dual algebra approach to the structure of invariant subspaces
for operators.
