This project will focus on observational studies of infrared bright galaxies,
active galactic nuclei, supernovae and superno- vae remnants, and star formation
regions using the facilities of the 200 inch Hale Telescope of the Palomar
Observatory. Two new instruments will be built to complement the existing
infrared instrumentation for the this telescope, and techniques will be
developed to achieve diffraction limited imaging at near infrared wavelengths
using the existing and proposed cameras. The observation programs to be
undertaken will address major questions in infrared astronomy: i. What is the
underlying power source of infrared bright galaxies? ii. What is the
relationship between ultraluminous infrared galaxies and quasars? iii. How does
galaxy interaction produce infrared bright galaxies? iv. What is the origin of
the infrared continuum radiation in quasars and active galactic nuclei? In
addition, studies will be made of the use of infrared observa- tions of
supernovae as standard candles to probe the velocity structure of the local
universe, and of the interactions of supernova remnants with the interstellar
medium. These projects will utilize the imaging (both line and continuum) and
spectro- scopic capabilities of the near infrared camera recently intro- duced
by this group on the 200 inch telescope. The camera will also be used, in
concert with sophisticated analysis techniques, to achieve diffraction limited
resolution analysis of forming stars and mass loosing stars in the near
infrared. Dr. Neugebauer's group is one of the leading and most productive in
the application of state of the art infrared techniques to astronomical studies.
