Using the tools of practicing applied mathematicians - symbolic mathematics,
numerical analysis and graphics packages, the faculty will restructure the
teaching of Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. The project
will use the successful philosophy and strategies of the department's Applied
Mathematics Laboratory to undergraduate mathematics courses. The laboratory
sessions will focus on applications and not programming. Students will work on a
team solving applied mathematics problems posed by local industry. Replicability
will be accomplished through publication of the software packages and problems.
The grantee is providing an equal sum for the equipment obtained from non-
Federal sources.
