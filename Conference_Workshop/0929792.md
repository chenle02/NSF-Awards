This award provides support for participants in two meetings of the annual
Oklahoma PDE Workshop during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 academic years: (1) a
workshop on recent progress in partial differential equations of fluid
mechanics, with emphasis on modeling of geophysical fluids, to be held at
Oklahoma State University on October 10-11, 2009; (2) a workshop on analysis of
partial differential equations arising in geometric applications, to be held at
the University of Oklahoma on October 9-10, 2010.

Each meeting features invited lectures by two leading researchers on topics of
current research interest in applied partial differential equations. The events
bring together scholars currently making important contributions, early career
mathematicians, and students working in the field. The conference encourages and
financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and
members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.
