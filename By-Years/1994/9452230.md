9452230 Swartz Grinnell College will purchase a Hewlett Packard MS-Engine to
incorporate mass spectroscopy, including electron impact and chemical ionization
techniques, into Introductory Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Advanced Organic
Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Physical Chemistry courses and for
student/faculty research. Mass spectrometers are now easy to use and accessible
to relatively inexperienced undergraduates, but they have not been incorporated
into the curriculum in a substantial way, except as gas chromatographic
detectors. Experiments will be developed which illustrate a range of standard
sample introduction and ionization techniques. Use of the spectrometer will
begin in the introductory courses and be integrated through the entire
curriculum. We estimate that 120 undergraduate students (10% of the College's
enrollment) will use the instrument each year.
