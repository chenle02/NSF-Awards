The distribution of halogens in large layered intrusions is of interest because
halogen variations provide information on the degassing history of these
intrusions. Halogen distributions also provide evidence for understanding any
possible role by volatile-rich fluids in the transport of economically important
trace metals such as the platinum group elements. This project is to look at
halogens in hydrous phases to understand the role of volatile-rich fluids in the
transport of economically important trace metals such as platinum-group
elements. The hydrous minerals will be analyzed by electron probe, and whole
rock analysis will be carried out by ICP. Results from this study should be
applicable to other layered intrusions such as the Stillwater and the Bushveld.
