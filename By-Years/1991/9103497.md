The pattern of recent normal faulting in the eastern part of the Basin and
Range province indicates that both planar, deep- cutting normal faults and more
shallowly- dipping listric normal faults occur in the central overthrust belt of
western Wyoming. The listric variety have previously been thought to not
generate large earthquakes, however large fault scarps along two of these faults
indicate this may be incorrect. This project will map the trace of these faults,
trench across them and date offset deposits in order to assess the possibility
that these faults have produced large earthquakes. The work will also use these
data to help explain regional fault patterns in the eastern Basin and Range.
