This project will develop and use low-cost, long-duration balloon systems to
make measurement within the Arctic polar stratospheric vortex to study ozone
depletion issues. The balloon borne instruments will measure polar stratospheric
clouds using the backscattersondes developed by the principal investigator,
ozone, temperature and eventually nitric acid, aerosols, water vapor, nitrogen
dioxide and other trace gasses which are important to ozone depletion. This
project is a joint venture of the University of Wyoming and the Central
Aerological Obsevatory, Moscow, Russia. The Russian involvement is necessary to
obtain permission for the balloons to traverse Russian airspace, to help with
tracking and to facilitate payload recovery. This project is jointly funded by
the Division Of Polar Programs and the Division of International Programs.
