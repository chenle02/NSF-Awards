It is proposed to study the abyssal ocean circulation with simple numerical
models and laboratory experiments in the context of the Deep Basin Experiment
(DBE), a comonent of the World Circulation Experiment. The emphasis on the study
is on how large-scale bottom topography affects the strength and pattern of the
deep circulation.
