The quality of undergraduate laboratory work will be enhanced by the
introduction of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in general chemistry and
in three advanced courses. General chemistry students will determine the amounts
of different crystalline forms of calcium carbonate in seashells, and identify
the polymeric components of a commercial plastic. Organic chemistry students
will characterize the products of two reactions by modern methods, including the
electronic storage and manipulation of spectral data. Students will perform a
new experiment in physical chemistry involving the kinetics of isomerization of
a cobalt amine complex. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal
sources.
