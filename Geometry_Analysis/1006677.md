The PI proposes to construct a Riemannian metric on the Gromoll-Meyer sphere
with positive sectional curvature. This is a long standing open problem and is
now especially relevant as Brendle-Schoen have shown that no exotic sphere
admits a metric with positive complex sectional curvatures. As a separate
specific project the PI also proposes to understand when quasi-Einstein and
gradient soliton metrics are forced to be Einstein metrics. These questions go
back to the earliest works on Einstein metrics, but have received new attention
with Perel'man classification of certain gradient solitons in three dimensions.
Understanding quasi-Einstein metrics is also important in general relativity as
they occur as solutions to the Einstein field equations.

In general terms the PI wishes to investigate what types of geometries are
possible on specific topological objects. Two objects such as a doughnut and a
tea cup are geometrically very different but topologically similar. The goal is
to find the nicest possible geometries for specific topological objects. This is
of interest to mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists,medical
scientists and many other people as it is becoming increasingly clear that our
flat Euclidean picture is not always the correct or even nicest model to use.
