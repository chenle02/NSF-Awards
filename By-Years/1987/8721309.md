The Cliometric Conference series, now in its twenty-eighth year, continues to
serve as an important means for encouraging research in economic history and as
a forum for disseminating new methods, findings, and interpretations among
historians as well as economists. A special effort is made to include the work
of graduate students and assistant professors representing a broad range of
specialities but with increasing emphasis on twentieth century problems. The
scientific results of the cliometric history movement have been impressive and
promise to be equally important in the years ahead. The next meeting is
scheduled to be held at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, in May l988.
