Hawkins the proposed research will quantify the initial response of steam biota
to catastrophic flooding in several mountainous streams of California. Our
primary hypothesis is that the magnitude of effect that flooding has on biota is
influenced by both naturally occurring differences among watersheds in their
sensitivity to flooding and the amount of land use that has occurred within each
watershed. To test this hypothesis, will resample streams in up to 45 watersheds
that were previously sampled during the drought years of 1988 and 1989 and
compare pre- and post-flood abundances and species occurrence in each watershed.
