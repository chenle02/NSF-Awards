This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to Kansas State University will employ researchers to integrate the
concepts of alternative energy and sustainability into the electrical and
computer engineering (ECE) curriculum. These concepts will be part of required
courses at the freshman level as well as in design projects used in upper-level
classes. The project team uses active learning techniques to emphasize solar and
wind energy as well as energy conservation. These techniques will include
student-led experiments in renewable energy as well as sustainability focused
discussions and writing assignments during the senior seminar. The extent to
which these activities result in greater awareness of sustainability will be
measured. This work is expected to serve as a model for recruiting and preparing
the next generation of electrical and computer engineers to meet the growing
needs in alternate energy and sustainability, while transforming the ECE
curriculum to aid in recruitment of future students needed for this new
workforce.
