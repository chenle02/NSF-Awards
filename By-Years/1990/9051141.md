Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) is an essential technique for the
practice of modern chemistry and biology. The institution had spectrometers
which were difficult to use and could not do many of the routine modern
experiments, and were therefore an impediment to the study and use of nmr
spectroscopy in the curriculum. Through this project the institution was able to
obtain a 300 MHz spectrometer. The new spectrometer permits undergraduates to
routinely obtain nmr spectra in the organic, inorganic, physical chemistry, and
cellular physiology laboratories, and student projects and senior thesis
research. The new nmr spectrometer provides such an increase in capabilities
that it has had a profound effect on the nature of the experiments that students
perform. It addition, it greatly increased the rate at which they are
accomplished. The institution contributed to this project in an amount nearly
double the NSF funds.
