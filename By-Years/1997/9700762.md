EEC-9700762 Lundstrom Abstract This award provides funding to Purdue University
under the direction of Dr. Mark Lundstrom, for the support of a Combined
Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Designing Microelectronic
Technologies through a Network-Based Simulation 'HUB'." This project will
involve the development of a curriculum on the design of silicon and compound
semiconductor technologies using advanced computer simulation tools. Students
will learn to design fabrication processes, devices, and circuits and to
integrate previously gained, course-specific knowledge. Unique features of this
program are that its objective is to bring advanced, research-level simulation
tools into the classroom and thereby into engineering practice, its emphasis on
bringing the computational techniques that have been successful in the silicon
industry to the compound semiconductor industry and its focus on the use of
simulation by engineers who are not computational specialists. Producing
engineers proficient in the use of simulation and computational prototyping can
have a major impact on the way that such technologies are developed and at the
same time respond to a critical need continually expressed by industry.
