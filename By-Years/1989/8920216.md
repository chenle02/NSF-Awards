The University of California, Davis, will establish a Science and Technology
Center for Engineering Plants for Resistance Against Pathogens. The Director of
the Center will be Professor George E. Bruening. The goal of the center is to
develop an integrated molecular and biochemical understanding of plant responses
to diverse pathogens. The tomato will be developed as a model organism for these
studies. Participants will include faculty from the University of California,
Davis and Berkeley campuses, Cornell University, Washington University, and
scientists from Calgene, Inc. The Center has three major research objectives: 1.
Genes and molecules that mediate recognition of pathogens by plants will be
characterized. The types of molecules involved in the early determinative phases
of plant-parasite interactions will be identified and used to demonstrate the
recognition capabilities of the plants' defense mechanisms. 2. Molecular
characterization of susceptible and resistant host responses will be
accomplished by identifying the genes and molecules that are differentially
regulated during susceptible and resistant responses. Signal-transduction
pathways and regulatory mechanisms will be dissected genetically and
biochemically. Genes that potentially mediate susceptible or resistant responses
will be functionally analyzed in transgenic plants. 3. Novel strategies for
interfering with pathogen increase, movement, or transmission will be developed.
The initial focus will be on the mechanisms of viral replication and
transmission. The efficacy of satellite and defective interfering RNAs,
transgenic plants expressing viral coat protein, and transgenic plants
expressing defective transmission proteins will be investigated. The molecular
basis of host-pathogen interactions is one of the major unknowns in plant
biology. Successful completion of the basic aspects of this work should lead to
the development of novel means to control plant disease in a variety of crops.
This would in turn reduce the amount of chemical fungicides and pesticides
required for crop protection, thereby reducing both production costs and
environmental contamination. The center will stimulate enhanced
interdisciplinary training in the plant sciences and the development of human
resources.
