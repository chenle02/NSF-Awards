This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop an
artificially intelligent sorting software (AISS) for the metal scrap processing
industry. Scrap packages of unknown composition can result in costly melt losses
and increased consumption of primary aluminum to balance out composition.
Recycled aluminum production consumes 5% of the total energy required to form
primary aluminum and yields significantly less waste per ton. The AISS aims to
(1) enable production of high-quality, maximum-value scrap by combining market
and compositional data to optimize sorting criteria and (2) use artificial
intelligence to predict optimally salable scrap packages; the estimated value of
this information is $1 billion, representing over 4% of total industry revenue.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project will advance translation of a
system combining market value and compositional data to produce maximum-value
nonferrous scrap sortation decisions. The proposed work will deliver the AISS to
scrap processors for identification, in real time, of maximum-value commodity
packages by analyzing several data streams. It will recommend optimized sorting
criteria for maximum profit generation, predict scrap stream composition, and
monitor scrap-package composition for guaranteed quality. This project will: (1)
enhance the AISS to include stream prediction and real-time data integration,
(2) scale integration and testing to validate the AISS hardware package, and (3)
complete integration, testing, and commercial-scale optimization of the AISS
software-hardware package with sensor-sorting systems. This project will develop
the first real-time adaptive sortation algorithm introduced to the non-ferrous
scrap sortation industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
