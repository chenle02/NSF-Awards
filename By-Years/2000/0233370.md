The project will develop and test a balloon payload designed to detect MeV
electron precipitation into the atmosphere. Relativistic electron precipitation
has been found to occur at high latitudes, but it is not known how common such
events are, nor is much known about the conditions that leads to such events.
The instrument to be developed under this project will be a very small, light
weight device that can include real-time data communications via the Iridium
satellite system. This new technology will allow a payload that can be launched
on small balloons as well as on long-duration balloons.
