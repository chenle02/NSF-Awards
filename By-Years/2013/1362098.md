This award provides support for the 19th Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG)
Conference, to be held July 17-19, 2014 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A central goal
of the LFG framework is to create a model of grammar which is sufficiently
sophisticated for theoretical linguists to formulate a model of natural
language, but which can also be used in theoretical and applied areas of
computational linguistics and natural language processing. Because of its formal
rigor, LFG has been used as the theoretical basis of various machine translation
tools, for example, AppTek's TranSphere, and the Julietta Research Group's
Lekta. The annual conference is the largest annual LFG meeting, offering a venue
for the exchange of ideas, and fostering cooperation for theoretical and
computational linguists. It has a truly international outreach, with
participants coming from Europe, Asia, Australia, and America. This will be the
first LFG conference held in the USA since 2007.

The leitmotif of the 2014 conference is "Language Documentation and Linguistic
Theory." It will provide a platform for the discussion of the role of linguistic
theories (LFG and other generative models, e.g. Head-Driven Phrase Structure
Grammar (HPSG) and the Minimalist Program) in language documentation and
descriptive linguistic research. The possibility of using theoretically
motivated computational environments (e.g. Finite State Morphologies or
syntactic parsers) for ongoing efforts in the domain of under-resourced and
endangered languages research is highly relevant in the context of many projects
seeking to document and maintain endangered languages. The conference will be
followed by a one-day ParGram workshop, and a one-day workshop on unbounded
dependencies in LFG.
