9321917 Schwaegerle Rising levels of greenhouse gases are expected to bring
about a host of changes in climate and terrestrial ecosystems. These changes are
expected to be greatest at high latitudes. This project will assess the capacity
of three important arctic plant species to adapt to new environments that may
arise as a consequence of climate change. Because the exact nature of future
climate change is at present unclear, this research will focus on plant response
to multiple environmental factors including temperature, moisture, CO2, and
nutrients. In this way, models of evolutionary response will be developed that
have predictive value among a range of alternative scenarios of climate change.
A series of experiments will focus on plant growth rate and morphological
traits, relationships between traits and growth, and quantitative genetic
analysis. This research is expected to produce evolutionary models of each
species that describe (1) the capacity of arctic plant populations to adapt to
new environments and (2) the patterns of morphological and physiological changes
that would be favored by natural selection in these altered environments. ***
