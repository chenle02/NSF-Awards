This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the
"Recent Progress in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics" conference that will be
held from June 4--9, 2012, at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon in Lyon,
France.&lt;br/&gt;This conference will cover a variety of topics in analysis
(e.g., dynamical systems, mathematical physics, partial differential equations),
with KAM theory serving as a key unifying theme. All of the conference topics
are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The
format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to
speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.
