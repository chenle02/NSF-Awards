Avramov will investigate problems arising at the crossroads of commutative
algebra, homological algebra, and representation theory. Properties of
commutative noetherian rings will be studied through numerical, algebraic, and
geometric invariants generated by homological constructions. New methods will be
developed for computing such invariants, to be tested on problems that have
resisted more conventional approaches. Homological algebra will be utilized to
establish further connections between the theories of commutative rings and of
finite-dimensional algebras, with the goal of transferring viewpoints and
adapting techiques developed in one of the fields for use in the other.

Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of as studying
solutions of several equations in many unknowns when, typically, the solution is
not unique. The set of solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but it is
often best encoded into a family of functions defined on this set. The abstract
version of such families of functions are called commutative rings. Homological
algebra brings to the study of rings methods of algebraic topology, developed to
study geometric structures. Methods for decomposing complicated objects into
primitive building blocks are developed as part of a different branch of
algebra, known as representation theory.
