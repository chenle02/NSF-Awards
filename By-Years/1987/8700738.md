The major issue in multiprocessing is not the construction of a multiprocessor
system, but its efficient use in real applications. The current research is on
computer aided programming tools that help programmers in coding problems for
multiprocessors. Such a tool recommends program partitioning, inserts
synchronization primitives selected by the programmer, and estimates program
performance. Moreover, it provides quality measures in order to help programmers
in improving their programs/algorithms by reducing various kinds of
dependencies. The development of tools to facilitate parallelism in
multiprocessor architectures is potentially significant.
