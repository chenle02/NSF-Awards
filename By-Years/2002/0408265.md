With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Kevin S. Peters of the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Colorado, Boulder, CO. The research will
extend the PI's research using femtosecond, picosecond, and nanosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy to study the real time dynamics of chemical reactions.
Systems to be investigated include 1,2 and 1,3 hydride and deuteride shifts in
carbocations, 1,2 alkyl shifts in carbocations, and the dynamics of
proton/deuteron transfer in a variety of substituted
benzophenones/N,N-diallylaniline radical ion pairs. The results of these kinetic
studies will be analyzed within the context of adiabatic and non-adiabatic
rearrangements in order to assess the validity of transition state theory for
describing the dynamics of charge displacement reactions in the condensed
phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies of the dynamics of proton and hydride
transfer are expected provide important fundamental information that will impact
on theoretical and experimental treatments of such reactions in organic,
physical, and biological chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
