This project, involving picosecond laser methodology, is designed to stimulate
the imaginations of undergraduates and to illustrate the role of modern
spectroscopy in chemical research. Experiments conducted with the system will
introduce advanced undergraduate students to modern laser spectroscopy and to
concepts important in liquid-state photochemical reaction dynamics; electronic
excited-state lifetimes and energy transfer; electron transfer; photobiological
phenomena; orientational and structural relaxation dynamics in viscous liquids,
polymer solutions and liquid crystals; and nonlinear optics including stimulated
light scattering, all-optical switching and other effects. The interface between
chemistry and materials science will be illustrated by experiments on several
classes of important condensed-phase materials. This Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) award from the Chemical Instrumetation Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
acquire picosecond laser instrumentation that will be used to enhance
undergraduate laboratory instruction.
