Several compile-time analyses aimed at aiding compiling and debugging of
programs in parallel software development environments will be developed. The
emphasis is on using our parallel data flow analysis and approximate pointer-
induced aliasing algorithms to facilitate better transformation of programs for
parallel execution, and further developing the work in compile-time anomaly
detection for explicitly parallel programs. The former goal includes both
parallelization of sequential codes and optimization of already parallel codes.
The latter is aimed at the problems of deadlock and race detection. Specific
plans are: > to further profile and optimize the parallel hybrid data flow
analysis algorithm, especially on interprocedural problems; > to extend the
approach in the approximate pointer alias algorithm to accommodate conflict
analysis for parallelization of C-like languages; > to explore directed tracing
for race detection and implement the approach in a prototype; and > to profile
and extend the static deadlock detection algorithm.
