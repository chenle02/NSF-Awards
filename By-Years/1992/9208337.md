The male gametophyte, the haploid male plant in the life cycle of flowering
plants, plays an essential role by producing two sperm cells and transporting
them through the female tissues of the flower into the embryo sac where double
fertilization occurs. The results from the previous NSF funded research have
raised several new and important questions with respect to the regulation of
male gametophyte development that form the basis of the present proposal.
Promoters of pollen-specific genes will be used to target in transgenic
Arabidopsis plants the expression of several specific genes to specific periods
in pollen development. The aim is to over- and/or under-express the gene
products in order to perturb development thus providing clues to their function.
The genes selected are considered to have important roles in pollen development
although the details of the processes controlled by them are not known. Both
repression of mRNA translation and mRNA stability appear to be part of the
spectrum of regulatory mechanisms operating in pollen development. The cis-
sequences in pollen mRNAs required for these properties will be identified. An
unusual repetitive sequence that is found in the 3' non-translated end of
several mRNAs present primarily in young microspores will be investigated
further. In order to identify genes that play crucial regulatory roles in pollen
development a search for T-DNA tagged pollen defective mutants is being started.
This work will significantly expand our knowledge about the mechanisms
regulating development of the male gametophyte.
