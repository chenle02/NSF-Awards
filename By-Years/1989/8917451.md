This grant supports research which is aimed at studying the nature of the
natural death (nd) mutation in the lower eukaryote Neurospora crassa. A major
focus of the research will be to isolate the nd gene using mutant
complementation and/or sib- selection from a N. crassa genomic library. DNA
sequencing of the isolated gene will allow a comparison, by computer, to other
known gene sequences which may provide some insight into the nd gene's function.
The control of nd gene expression will also be examined under various metabolic
conditions. A second area of study will be to analyze in more detail the changes
in mitochondrial DNA that occur in the nd mutant, and to determine the effects
of these changes on mitochondrial transcription and and translation.
