This research will investigate the mechanisms of methane formation in the upper
water column. Dissolved methane profiles in the upper ocean are frequently
characterized by a subsurface maximum. This maximum commonly coincides with the
pycnocline and methane concentrations there are supersaturated with respect to
atmospheric equilibrium. Methane peaks have been correlated with peaks in number
of biological and chemical parameters including ATP, chlorophyll, zooplankton
and particle concentrations. This study will specifically investigate the role
of zooplankton feeding in the production of methane. Zooplankton will be fed
with radio labelled algae and measure labelled methane production. Methods will
also be developed to feed zooplankton individual labeled compounds which may be
specific precursors of methane. The studies will lead to a better understanding
of anaerobic processes in the oxic water column, provide information on
digestive processes in zooplankton guts, and increase our knowledge of the
cycling of methylamines and other C-1 compounds in seawater.
