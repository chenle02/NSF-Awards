This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Alex Inkeles, Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, Stanford Univesity, and Professor Tatsuo Suzuki,
Department of Interdisciplinary Statistical Mathematics, Institute of
Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo. Professor Inkeles will travel to Japan to work
with Professor Suzuki and Professor Chikio Hayashi, also affiliated with the
Institute of Statistical Mathematics, on developing a common methodology for
further comparative study of U.S. and Japanese national character. These two
distinguished Japanese social scientists have been involved with the Japanese
Research Committee on the Study of the Japanese National Character. Professor
Inkeles, who is one of the leading experts on the study of national character,
will bring a comparative viewpoint to the study, which will very likely lead to
new developments in this topic. Although national character is often treated in
qualitative terms that do not admit of scientific testing, one well established
approach does rest on basic methods of social science. This approach defines
national character as a set of relatively enduring psycho- social
characteristics of individuals that are predominant in, or distinctive, or modal
to a given national population. It thus becomes a special element in the general
methodology for comparing nations. Taking that approach permits empirical
testing to establish the actual characteristics of national and sub-national
populations using either tests of personality, or, more commonly, attitudes and
value scales applied to representative national samples at periodic intervals.
This approach has been most systematically and consistently applied in the
studies of the Research Committee on the Study of the Japanese National
Character.
