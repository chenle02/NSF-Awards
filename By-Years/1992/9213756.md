This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at the Illinois Institute of Technology in collaboration with other NSF and DOE
supported scientists. The group will study, at Fermilab, the production and
decay of hadrons containing heavy quarks. The detailed properties of the charmed
quark decays established by these measurements constrain the fundamental
parameters in the Standard Model of interacting quarks and leptons.
