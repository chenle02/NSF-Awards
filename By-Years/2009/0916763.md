This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a novel
tool, named Sunshine, to effectively support joint evaluation and design of
sensor network (sensornet) hardware and software.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;A critical roadblock to the
success of sensornets is the prohibitively slow and energy-wise impractical
software implementations of many important applications. On the other hand,
specialized hardware implementation can outperform, energy-wise as well as
performance-wise, equivalent software implementations by orders of magnitude.
Hence, the joint software-and-hardware design of sensornet applications is a
very appealing, yet unexplored, approach. The objective of this project is to
develop an effective tool, named Sunshine, to support such codesign. This
project may fundamentally transform the relationship between the hardware and
software communities of sensornet research. These communities can use Sunshine
to efficiently exchange mutual requirements and spread the latest technology
advances in each other's fields. Such evolutionary change will greatly improve
the state-of-the-art in sensornet technology. Novel hardware architecture and
platforms that are unexplored in current designs can be created and tested
through Sunshine's cross-domain design environment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;Serving as a valuable education
tool, Sunshine will also foster the continued integration of research and
education at the PIs' institution and benefit curriculum at other institutions.
Sunshine can serve as the foundation for lab experiments and course projects in
networking and embedded system engineering. Sunshine also offers the opportunity
for innovative cross-domain education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
