This project is in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in
the subfield of bioanalytical chemistry. The studies planned here focus on three
related areas of research. These three areas include 1) developing analytical
procedures for selected proteins and herbicides using simple homogeneous
methodology, 2) the use of hollow dialysis fibers to develop a continuous and
reversible biomolecule detection scheme, 3) fundamental experiments designed to
select monoclonal anti-ligand antibodies with desirable binding characteristics
but little or no bridging group recognition. The studies planned here are
designed to develop assays based on the selective interactions of certain
proteins. These assays should be almost as selective, but much less expensive
than assays based on the use of antibodies. In addition, this new methodology
should not require the use of radioactive labels.
