The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide private and public stakeholders
with new technological tools to better monitor and predict pandemics. This
project is expected to modernize the tools used today by private and public
laboratories to collect and purify pathogens, particularly human coronaviruses
from community wastewater, for testing and diagnostic purposes. The new
technological tools are expected to simplify the workflow, reduce costs and
time, and enable the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemics
several weeks before observing clinical cases. Such early prediction would
provide the public and government agencies with important data and sufficient
time to take preventive measures. The technological products of this project are
expected to empower the growing number of companies and laboratories offering
wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) services and help establish WBE as a
routine, cost-effective and reliable tool for public health
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will address a major technological barrier for the detection of
viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Commercially available nucleic acid
collection and purification kits are designed for clinical samples with small
volumes. These kits are not generally used for large wastewater volumes where
the virus is present at low concentrations. As a result, current processes are
time-consuming, and result in the recovery of less than 30% of viruses and
nucleic acids, significantly reducing the sensitivity. The goal of this SBIR
Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel virus and nucleic
acid collection and purification technology from wastewater. Specifically, the
project tasks aim at enhancing understanding of virus properties, particularly
human coronaviruses in wastewater and their interactions with filter media. The
projectâ€™s innovative approach is to design a streamlined workflow that includes
all the steps from sample collection to detection, in a single disposable
cartridge containing novel filters with high affinity to viruses. This
development is expected to enhance viral and nucleic acid recovery in wastewater
to over 90%, while reducing costs. The developed tools will be independently
tested and evaluated by third-party laboratories to confirm their
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
