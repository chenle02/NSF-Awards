The large scale structure of the universe includes clusters of galaxies. The
size of these clusters and the spacing of galaxies within the clusters depends
on the nature of dark matter. This project will use computers and artificial
intelligence to model the growth of this large scale structure, using a new
method that will produce more detailed models over a wider range of dark matter
conditions. These models can be compared with observations of galaxy clusters to
improve our understanding of dark matter. These models also will be used to
produce videos for public outreach and education. Users will be able to "fly
through" the universe to visualize the large scale structure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop an emulator that can reproduce
expected large scale structure properties for a particular parameter set based
on full N-body simulations of neighboring parameters sets within parameter
space. Thus, the more computationally expensive high-resolution simulations can
done over a sparse set of parameters and then the emulator will be able to fill
in the rest of parameter space. The higher resolution of the large scale
structure models will allow current and future surveys to probe scales at the
sub-megaparsec level, instead of the current resolutions of ~10 Mpc. The project
will use the data from these simulations to produce "fly-through" 3 dimensional
visualizations of large scale structure for use in public outreach and
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
