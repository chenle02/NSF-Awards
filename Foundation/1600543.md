In the first half of the last century, Turing and others developed a
mathematically precise definition of the notion of algorithm, or computer
program. Modern computability theory and theoretical computer science grew out
of these efforts, and led in particular to an interest in studying the
computational content of mathematics. At the same time, developments in the
foundations of mathematics led to the investigation of the relative power of
different formal systems for mathematical reasoning. These two areas of inquiry
turn out to be closely related, and this project is concerned with questions at
their intersection. It aims to further our understanding of how structure
affects computability, and how computability interacts with other fundamental
notions such as randomness, the power of formal systems, and the interactions
between formal systems and the mathematical structures they describe.

In particular, this project lies in two related areas: computable mathematics
and reverse mathematics of combinatorial, model theoretic, and related
principles; and notions of robust information coding, including their
connections with algorithmic randomness. Reverse mathematics and computable
mathematics are closely related and complementary approaches to calibrating the
strength of theorems and constructions throughout mathematics, and revealing the
fundamental structure behind them. The investigation of combinatorial and model-
theoretic principles from this point of view has proved to be a particularly
rich line of research, and this project will pursue it from several angles, for
instance the study of first order consequences of second order principles and
notions of computability theoretic reduction that provide a particularly fine-
grained analysis of the comparative strength of mathematical statements. Several
of the combinatorial principles that play a central role in this area concern
the existence of particular kinds of subobjects, which leads to a natural
connection with the investigation of notions of robust information coding, which
are reducibilities capturing the idea of being able to obtain partial
information about an object from partial information about another. This project
will further the study of these notions, in particular versions of infinite
information reducibility, which are particularly closely connected with the
computability theoretic aspects of versions of Ramsey's Theorem, and versions of
coarse reducibility, which have already been found to have significant
connections with algorithmic randomness.
