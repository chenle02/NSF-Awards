The Investigator studies intersection theory on and the cohomological field
theory arising from the moduli of algebraic spin curves and stable spin maps.
Especially important in this study is the exploration of the plethora of
similarities between Gromov-Witten theory and cohomological field arising from
higher spin curves and spin maps. Also important in this research is the study
of the many relations between these cohomological field theories and integrable
hierarchies, including significant recent progress toward proving some
remarkable conjectures like the W-algebra conjecture and Generalized Witten
Conjecture.

The research in this project is concerned with connections between algebraic
geometry and physics, and it has implications for both subjects. Algebraic
geometry, which is the study of solutions to polynomial equations, and
especially the sub-discipline of algebraic curves, which is one of the main foci
of this research, have many applications. The most notable of these applications
are in secure electronic communications (cryptography and error correcting
codes). Recent research has shown that algebraic geometry also has significant
ties to high-energy physics and plays an important role in helping us understand
the fundamental nature of the universe. Conversely, physics has helped us better
understand some important aspects of algebraic geometry and its applications.
This research is focused on studying and further developing some of these
important links.
