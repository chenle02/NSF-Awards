The Virgin Island Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics and Science (VITEMS)
project is a cooperative effort between the Virgin Islands Department of
Education and the University of the Virgin Islands. It will, over a period of
three years, improve science and mathematics education in eighteen public
elementary schools in the US Virgin Islands through training and integrated
follow-up support. For each of three years, a five-week summer workshop which
starts out with a week-long retreat in a mangrove forest will bring together
forty K-6 teachers and principals selected as a team from each of six schools.
During the three year time period, eighteen schools and one hundred and twenty
teachers will participate. This should give excellent coverage of the elementary
educators on the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix. The science content and
activities will be based on nationally produced and successful projects which
will be adapted for use as applicable to the islands' ecology and population.
The mathematics will be based on the standards published by the National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics. Many consultants of excellent reputation will
augment the science and mathematics expertise of the University. The materials
used during the workshops will be piloted in the classes and in Saturday
Academies under the formative observation of the VITEMS staff. Thus, students as
well as teachers will begin to benefit from this project immediately. The
participants will also receive training in the use of electronic mail so that
VITEMS can provide a science/math consulting service, can monitor the science
and math instruction and can provide a networking mechanism for the teachers.
The Department of Education is providing all the funds for this electronic
network including cost of modems and telephone time. An amount equivalent to
over 50% of the NSF request is being cost-shared by the VI Department of
Education and the University of the Virgin Islands.
