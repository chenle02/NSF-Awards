With this award, funded by the Division of Chemistry, Professor Hongtao Yu of
Jackson State University and his collaborators in the REU (Research Experiences
for Undergraduates) Leadership Group will conduct a workshop for current REU
site Principal Investigators and potential REU Site Principal Investigators
(approximately 60 total invited participants) to discuss best practices in
running effective REU sites. The REU Site Program represents a multimillion
dollar effort by the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation to
provide talented undergraduates the opportunity to engage with professors and
other scientists in authentic research experiences. Many of these REU students
do not have opportunities to engage in research in their home institutions.
Running an effective REU site Program is challenging, and the workshop will
provide opportunities for Principal Investigators to share strategies for making
the REU experience as high-impact as possible for the student and faculty
participants. Investment in this workshop will help to strengthen the impact of
the significant investment of NSF resources into the REU Site Program.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Prof. Yu and his colleagues will convene the workshop in
the summer of 2015 in San Antonio, Texas. Objectives for the 2015 Workshop
include: the bringing together of the Chemistry REU PI community to facilitate
the exchange of ideas in formal and informal settings; the engagement of REU PIs
in a discussion of critical issues in management of an REU site, including the
recruitment of a diverse cohort, participant tracking, and training in research
ethics; the engagement of REU PIs with other NSF communities (e.g. the LSAMP
Community); a discussion of the unique issues related to working with Community
College and non-traditional students. Participants at this workshop will learn
skills and develop their professional networks, enabling them to be more
effective leaders of undergraduate research efforts at their home institutions.
