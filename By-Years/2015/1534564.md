A network bringing together scientists working with laboratory based collections
of microbes is being established. The network will hold numerous workshops
teaching best practices for managing, preserving, and distributing bacteria,
fungi, and other microscopic organisms in the context of formal culture
collections. Biosecurity and regulatory issues will also be emphasized at
workshops. Additional goals include re-establishing a professional society of
culture collection researchers in the US, developing internet based collection
management tools, and fostering communication between US collections, foreign
collections, and international collection networks.

Collections of living microbes assure that current and past research and
innovation are available to future generations of scientists. Biological
materials which are made available via well managed collections represent the
foundation of the modern biotechnology industry. Materials in culture
collections impact fields as diverse as human health, agricultural productivity,
biotechnology, and bio-diversity research. While there are several professional
collections in the US, most collections in the US are small and do not have long
term strategies for survival. The network supported by this grant will ensure
that smaller collections benefit from expertise available at larger living
microbe collections.
