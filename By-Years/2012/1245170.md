This project is developing innovative learning materials based on real-life
problems that students may encounter in their engineering careers. Incorporating
service systems into existing engineering curricula promotes students' critical
thinking and scientific understanding of complex systems. In-class and out-of-
class interventions such as case-based learning, project-based learning, field
trips, student presentations, teamwork, and guest lectures are being developed
to show students how engineering is applied to help people. This work is
building on the fundamental premise that if students (especially women) could
envision themselves applying engineering knowledge to helping people (as their
career path), it will build their confidence and they will be more likely to
complete their degrees. The materials are being designed to be gender inclusive
and positively impact all students by developing diverse perspectives and
emphasizing collaboration. In addition to broadening participation of women in
engineering, this project is aiding the service sector of industry by supplying
better-trained engineers.
