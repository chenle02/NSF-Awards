One of the major goals of the undergraduate laboratory curriculum is to graduate
physics majors who are familiar with modern instrumentation and are trained to
interface this instrumentation with a computer. Their physics majors are
required to take a course in the computer control and computer acquisition and
analysis of data. Modern instrumentation is required in the advanced
undergraduate laboratory so that they are able to build on the training students
have received in this course.They are adding a variable temperature facility to
the advanced undergraduate laboratories. This equipment includes a cryocooler
and associated temperature control and measurement instrumentation and
additional instruments with computer interface to use with experiments performed
on this cryocooler. This facility allows them to introduce condensed matter
physics experiments into the laboratory curriculum so that students are being
trained in the area of study most of them will pursue after graduation.
