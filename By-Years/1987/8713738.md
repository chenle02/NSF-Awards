Drs. Caviedes and and Waylen will gather and analyze detailed information on
precipitation and streamflow in parts of South America affected by the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. The purpose of the research is to
determine the influence of ocean-atmosphere anomalies on the surface hydrology
of South America, in order better to understand how ENSO produces devastating
floods in some areas and droughts in others. Whereas meteorological and oceanic
research on ENSO has been intensive, work on the ecological impacts and
geographical extent of the anomaly has been limited. This project will provide
more information on ecological aspects of ENSO. The database that will be
created will form a foundation for further research on ENSO and its
consequences.
