Sedimentary records of particle.associated pollutants contain valuable
informatin on the history of pollution. However, these records are often
distorted reflections of past fluxes because of a variety of processes in the
sediments such as mixing, biodegradation (organics), radioactive decay
(radionuclides), and compaction. This project is aimed at further development of
methods for recovery of the historical input record of pollutants from the
sedimentary profile. Conveyor.belt transfer, molecular diffusion, and
biodegradation of pollutants will be considered, when appropriate. The time
domain deconvolution method will be further investigated with regard to
uniqueness, optimal choice of time and space intervals, and error measures for
deconvolved records. It is also planned to examine an alternative deconvolution
method based on inversion in the frequency domain. The developed methods will be
applied to literature data and to experimental data for cores from Green Bay and
Lake Michigan. Pollutants of interest include lead, zinc, cadmium,
polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
