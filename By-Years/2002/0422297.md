This program creates ten scholarships of four years each to increase the number
of students, particularly women, completing an undergraduate degree in the
computing sciences. The program increases the number of academically talented
students with unmet financial need who choose a major in the computing sciences,
and increases the proportion of women majors in Elon's computing sciences
programs. It emphasizes academic and social support systems to help students
succeed in their studies, and includes experiential learning activities to
prepare students for transition to employment or graduate studies. An assessment
team monitors student progress each semester.
