Flows of complex fluids are ubiquitous and can be found both in nature and in
modern manufacturing technologies. Synthetic polymers, biological fluids and
foods are common examples of complex fluids that display rheological, or flow,
behavior that is difficult to both measure experimentally and predict
theoretically. A novel rheological technique called Continuous Lubricated
Squeezing Flow (CLSF) is used to investigate the rheological behavior of
polymeric liquids in equibiaxial elongation flows, which involves the stretching
of a fluid in two directions. This study allows heretofore unavailable
structure-property relations to be established that will be invaluable to
polymer chemists and process engineers, as well as to theoreticians in their
efforts to develop molecular models for polymer dynamics. An improved
understanding of polymer flow behavior will result in more efficient energy and
materials utilization and to the development of advanced processing
methodologies. An outreach component is integrated with the scientific
investigation that involves the development of instructional modules on complex
fluids by faculty and students in the Department of Math and Science Education
(MSE) at Illinois Institute of Technology. The MSE Department has well-
established education and training programs for high-school teachers in the
Chicago Public Schools.
