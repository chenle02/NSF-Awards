In the history of science, there occurs on occasion a case of a prescient
scientist who examines all the evidence and presents a theory which is rejected
in his or her own life-time, only thave this theory confirmed at some later
point. Alfred Wegener, (1880-1930), is perhaps the paradigm example of such a
scientist for the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of continental
drift, confirmed in the 1960's with the NSF-supported ocean-margin drilling
program. When Wegener proposed his theory, however, it was long before the
results of these expeditions were available. Perhaps as important, though, for
the failure of the Wegener theory, was the fact that the geologists of his time
could see no feasible mechanism for accommodating the drift of the continents--
it took the development of plate tectonics along with the new evidence of the
drilling expedition to present most scientists with convincing arguments in
favor of continental drift. Wegener is important, however, even beyond his work
on this "premature" theory. He also made fundamental contributions to
meteorology (cloud physics, theory of precipitation), geophysics (atmospheric
optics, solid earth geophysics), paleoclimatology (paleo-equator and paleo-pole
fixing by climate zonation), lunar geology (theory of impact craters), and polar
exploration and geology. Despite these contributions, there has been no
significant scholarly study of Wegener's life and work in English. Professor
Greene aims to produce such a study. He will use the support from this grant to
examine archives and museums containing papers, letters, photographs, expedition
diaries, notebooks and equipment used by Wegener. These materials are in
Denmark, Greenland, West Germany and Austria.
