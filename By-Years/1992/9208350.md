A two-component Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) is acquired for a combined
experimental and numerical study to enhance the basic understanding of the
physics of two-way coupling between small spherical particles and turbulence.
The two-way nonlinear coupling between particles and turbulence encompasses the
dispersion of discrete particles due to the turbulent motion of the fluid, and
the modulation of the turbulence structure by the motion on the particles. The
primary goal of the experimental study is to simultaneously measure the
instantaneous velocities of the fluid and particles in two directions and at two
positions using a specially designed two-component LDV. The results obtained
from direct numerical simulation will be compared with the experimental data,
and used to test and improve available turbulence closure models of particle-
laden flows.
