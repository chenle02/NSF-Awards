This project concerns definable equivalence relations and classification
problems that are more complex than the isomorphism of countable structures. One
of the main focuses is the universal orbit equivalence relation, namely, the
most complex equivalence relation induced by a Borel action of a Polish group.
The investigator studies topics such as (1) the Urysohn universal metric space,
the isometry group and its actions, (2) actions of the unitary group, and (3)
classification problems for various topological spaces. The obvious connections
of these topics to analysis, geometry and topology also bring together the
development of descriptive set theory and other fields of mathematics.

The descriptive set theory of definable equivalence relations has provided a
standard scale on which complexity of various classification problems in
mathematics can be measured. The low end of this scale is very well understood
through the previous work in the field. But there has been relatively little
information known for the high end. The investigator seeks to advance the
knowledge of complex definable equivalence relations. Through this research it
is hopeful that not only the complexity or difficulty of the mathematical
problems involved can be better understood but also methods to deal with
complicated and large-scale systems can be obtained and applied to other fields
of mathematics and sciences.
