The Principal Investigator (PI) is a previous Presidential Young Investigator
who has used much of his previous award to design and build a robotic telescope
to monitor the light output of supernovae with time. The PI now proposes to
complement his light curve work with a coordinated program of high dispersion
spectroscopy. His goal is to establish a far greater degree of homogenity in the
classification of supernovae than has existed in the past in order to define the
evolutionary histories of these objects, as will as the characteristics of their
progenitor stars. This work will help determine the mass ranges of stars that
are apt to lead to certain kinds of supernovae. It will provide new estimates of
the dispersion of observable properties, such as luminosity, leading to a more
confident use of supernovae as "standard candles" and to improved distances of
external galaxies.
