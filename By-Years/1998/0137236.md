This award provides partial support for the National Research Council's Solid
State Sciences Committee (SSSC). The National Research Council is the working
arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.
The SSSC monitors field of materials research in the United States and provides
guidance to federal agencies regarding their materials research programs. The
Committee responds to requests for technical information and assistance;
initiates conduct and publication of studies in the solid state sciences, acts
as an educational resource for the community of the solid state opportunities;
and provides a forum for discussion among solid state and materials scientists
and Washington policymakers. The SSSC will continue these activities in the next
three years, with projects such as the Materials Forum 2002 for Washington
policy makers. The interface between the materials research communities and the
biology communities will receive attention: a brochure at the lay level
describing the interface between biology and the materials sciences will be
produced. In addition a more technical study of "biomolecular materials" will be
developed. The central role that solid state and materials science play in the
emerging field of nanotechnology will also receive timely attention. The output
of NRC SSSC an timely and useful materials and information that is widely
disseminated to educational institutions, the Federal Government and technical
industries. The project is co-funded with the Department of Energy and National
Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial support for the National Research Council's Solid State Sciences
Committee (SSSC). The National Research Council is the working arm of the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. The SSSC
will sponsor a Forum for discussion between solid state and materials scientists
and Washington policy makers. In addition the SSSC will monitor and report on
several topics of great current interest, such as nanotechnology, biomolecular
materials, and materials in microgravity environments. The resulting materials
will be widely disseminated to educational institutions, the Federal Government
and technical industries.&lt;br/&gt;
