This program will target an important stage in solar system history, namely, the
dispersal of the solar nebular disk out of which the planets formed, and the
effects of this on the dynamical state of the remnant planetary system.
Depending on how fast this disk material dissipates and the method by which it
is removed, serious disturbances to the orbital properties of the planets may
occur owing to their gravitational interactions. Orbits may evolve in size and
shape to sweep throughout large regions of the disk especially effecting the
terrestrial planets, asteroids, and cometary objects. New dynamical interactions
may be found, and this work will likely provide new constraints on later stages
of planet formation. The project will employ both analytical and numerical
approaches taking into account extensive advances made over the last two decades
in our understanding of planet-disk interactions. ***
