This is an international travel grant to support the Principal Investigator's
visit to the Department of Civil Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology in Seoul, where he will participate in two seminars
arranged by Professor Chang-Koon Choi, Professor of Civil Engineering. While in
Korea, Prof. Ramey will join Prof. D. Parsons in visits to Korean Research
Institutes under arrangements made by Prof. Choi. The proposed activities will
enable Prof. Ramey to understand: a) the differences in earthquake resistant
design approaches in Korea as contrasted with U.S. practice, b) exchange
information on fiber reinforced concrete in seismic joints and computer aided
engineering, and c) current research efforts being undertaken in various
research institutes and organized research units in Korea. This effort will
develop research cooperation between U.S. and Korea in the areas of advanced
technologies involving seismic design, composite materials and computer
engineering in connection with structural and architectural systems.
