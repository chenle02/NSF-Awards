Abstract: This project aims to develop a concrete setting in which the
transition from single operator theory to a multivariable theory becomes very
natural. In single operator theory, the vector valued Hardy space is used to
provide canonical models for contractions. Without loss of generality, we can
identify the vector space with another copy of the Hardy space over the unit
disk, and the vector valued Hardy space then becomes the Hardy space over the
bidisk. By stating and reproving some of the classical results in model theory
in this new context, we can identify some operator theoretically important
things in the Hardy space over the bidisk and develop some general techniques
for further research. The research focuses on the compressions of two shift
operators, namely multiplications by the two coordinate functions, to quotient
Hardy modules.

Single operator theory, which originated in the study of systems of linear
equations, has a wide range of applications, from image processing, to robotic
design, to financial market predictions. "Operator pairs" provide a model for
studying interactions between different systems. Two simple examples are
interactions between different electric networks and the effects of one
financial market on others. This project aims to develop a concrete setting for
the study of operator pairs. There are two main advantages to this setting.
First, it furnishes many computable examples which make the study easier to
apply. Second, it incorporates single operator theory in a very natural way.
This feature, in terms of a practical example, means that it will allow one to
monitor single markets and multi-market systems in a unified way.
