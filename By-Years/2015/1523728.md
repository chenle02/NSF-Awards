A request is made to fund new and refurbished equipment to the Lowered ADCP pool
of equipment maintained and operated by LDEO. With this proposal, the PIs
provide technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the
following Oceanographic Instrumentation: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refurbish WHM300
s/n 150 $10,941&lt;br/&gt;Refurbish WHM300 s/n 299 $10,941&lt;br/&gt;TRDI 150kHz
6000m-rated Workhorse ADCP (WH150) $62,020&lt;br/&gt;
$83,902&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal
Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to
use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
