In this proposal, a group of researchers from the University of Michigan
request support for participation in the L3 experiment. L3 is a successful
international collaboration at LEP, which has the world's highest energies in
electron-positron collisions. In the next two years, this experiment will make
important tests of the Standard Model, and has high discovery potential in terms
of new particles.
