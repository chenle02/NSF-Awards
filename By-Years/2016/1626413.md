This project will establish and evaluate a program to support community college
transfer students in their quest for a 4-year STEM (computing and engineering)
degree. Determining how to reduce the loss of STEM community college students
from 4-year programs attacks a significant problem in producing a STEM
workforce. The project will also create and evaluate a more formal structure for
collaboration between a 4-year institution and six community colleges. The
project will accomplish its goals with an experienced interdisciplinary research
team complemented by two consultants who are experts on diverse community
college transfer students, especially women in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will generate empirical evidence about the impact of innovative models
of transfer success coaching and a first year seminar on the transition as well
as academic success and retention of transfer students majoring in computing and
engineering from community colleges to research universities. It will also
generate new knowledge about the use of inter-institutional collaboration
structures and their impact on two and four-year institutions' efforts to
improve the experiences and success of transfer students in computing and
engineering majors.
