Using ac calorimetry, heat capacity measurements will be carried out on a series
of different hydrocarbon films adsorbed on graphite. A main focus of the work
proposed is the study of the melting transition of two-dimensional (2D) solids.
Using a set of different hydrocarbon films we shall systematically study how the
nature of the melting transition depends on the size and shape of the molecules
which constitute the 2D solid. This systematic approach is of interest because
recent theoretical results indicate that 2D melting is strongly influenced by
molecular size and shape. We have completed the first stage of this research
with their study of ethane films. Following up some preliminary results on
ethane, we shall study the melting of thin hydrocarbon multilayers as well as
the behavior near the bulk triple point of small bulk hydrocarbon crystallites
adsorbed on graphite. In the high coverage regime they purpose is to determine
whether exfoliated graphite can be used as substrate for studying surface
melting.
