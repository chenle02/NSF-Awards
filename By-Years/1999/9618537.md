Phinney, E. Sterl AST 96-18537 Dr. Phinney will carry out a program of
theoretical research on a diverse array of topics related by the general theme
of the physics of compact objects and magnetic fields in young galaxies. His
research program has three major goals : 1) to investigate the ways in which
binary stars can interact with each other through both gravitational and non-
gravitational forces, 2) to improve understanding of the ways in which pulsars
lose energy and the properties of their winds and magnetospheres, and 3) to
develop techniques for determining the origin of the magnetic fields in galaxies
and clusters. ***
