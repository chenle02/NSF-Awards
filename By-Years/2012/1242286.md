The purpose of this award is to provide travel support for PIs and students on
current NSF cubesat projects to participate in a meeting hosted at NSF on May
24, 2012. The purpose of the meeting is to showcase how the current projects
promote innovative and creative STEM education and workforce development as well
as front-line, interdisciplinary scientific research and technology advances.
Presentations will also explore the potential for future cubesat projects to
provide crucial measurements from space that are needed to solve critical
societal problems including: climate change, land use and resource management,
pollution and disaster monitoring, communication and space weather; and enable
further scientific discoveries and engineering innovation, including:
Manufacturing in space, materials research for 3D printing of satellites and
components, sensor miniaturization, micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) systems,
systems engineering, radio science, communication algorithms and networks, cloud
physics, atmospheric chemistry, space physics, Earth radiation budget, ocean
observations, and biology. The goal of the meeting is to identify ways and best
practices for CubeSats to benefit interdisciplinary science goals along with
STEM education and diversity objectives broadly within all relevant research
areas of NSF.
