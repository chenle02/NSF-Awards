This project - the Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project (SIDLP) - is to
develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and "universal"
library, proving uniform access to the large number of emerging networked
information sources and collections. These include both on-line versions of pre-
existing works and new works and media of all kinds that will be available on
the globally interlinked computer networks of the future. The Integrated Digital
Library is broadly defined to include everything from personal information
collections, to the collections that one finds today in conventional libraries,
to the large data collections shared by scientists. The technology developed in
this project will provide the "glue" that will make this worldwide collection
usable as a unified entity, in a scalable and economically viable fashion.
