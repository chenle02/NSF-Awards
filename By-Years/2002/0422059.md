This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) that uses optical forces to move cells
and to sort cell sub-populations. The specific Phase II objectives are : (1) to
build an integrated prototype cell sorter with flexibility to configure multiple
lasers and detectors, (2) to develop a self contained microfluidic cartridge
that can handle 1,000-100,000 cells/sample and sort with purities greater than
95% and total recovery rates greater than 80%, (3) to develop microfluidic flow
assays, and (4) to validate that the mechanical and optical stresses do not
adversely affect cells. The proposed work will result in a prototype cell
sorter, self-contained microfluidic cartridges, and a panel of assays that
demonstrate the broad utility of the instrument.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of cell-based
assays for use in biological and biomedical research.
