Many physical processes are best described mathematically in terms of
mathematical models that involve (partial differential) equations governing the
interactions and dynamics of characteristic physical quantities, such as
amplitude, voltage, or concentration to name a few. Very often, one observes a
group-like behavior, which is attributed to the existence and persistence of the
so-called wave solutions of these mathematical models. The identification of
such solutions and their stability (or instability) properties is of enormous
importance in contemporary technological applications. On the other hand,
precise information about instability and abnormal behavior (such as blow ups)
provides valuable information about validity and applicability of mathematical
models themselves.

This research is aimed at providing new mathematical tools to study non-linear
dispersive equations, which are mathematical models for water wave dynamics,
magnetization of materials, propagation of light in optical devices and related
phenomena of quantum mechanics, to name a few. In particular, the principal
investigator (PI) aims obtaining precise, quantitative information about the
long-time behavior of such systems. In addition, the PI will be actively engaged
in the training of the new generation of scientists, who will need to have the
technical expertise in several areas to meet the challenges in the analysis and
computation of cutting-edge physical systems and their modeling.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
