9529125 KOREN This award is to support the establishment of an Engineering
Research Center on Reconfigurable Machining Systems at the University of
Michigan under a new five-year cooperative agreement. The proposed ERC is to
help the United States respond to the global challenges in manufacturing by
establishing a base of strong fundamental engineering knowledge in
reconfigurable machining systems for flexible manufacturing technology. The
distinct feature of the proposed Center is to focus on fundamental engineering
issues, such as modularity, customization, convertibility, integrability, and
diagnosability in reconfigurable machining system. The vision will be fulfilled
by improved engineering knowledge and methodologies in stream-of-variation
theory, system reliability theory, and open-architecture principles. A testbed
will be developed to demonstrate the systems challenges of reconfigurable
machining systems. The research is organized into five thrust areas: Thrust 1 on
system design &amp; integration with focused research activities on stream-of-
variation theory in relation to economics, reliability, integration, and
diagnosability; Thrust II on software architecture with focused research
activities on open-architecture principles in relation to software
reconfigurability and salability; Thrust III on measurement and control with
focused research activities on sensors development and modular motion control
system; Theory IV on mechanical design with focused research activities on
reconfigurable design theory in relation to components, machines, and systems;
and Thrust V on processes and tooling with focused research activities on
various tooling systems for machining, boring, and drilling, and their process
models. The education programs of the ERC will involve undergraduates and
graduates in research teams involving industry. The ERC will enhance the
industrial exposure to students enrolled in the new practice-oriented M.S. and
Ph.D manufacturing degree programs. The ERC wil l provide curricular modules
which will be developed and tested in partnership with the Greenfield
Engineering Education Coalition. This vision is enthusiastically endorsed by 32
companies in the automotive industry, the machine tool industry, and the
aerospace industry. The research team includes 25 researchers from three UM
engineering departments and the UM Business School. In addition, researchers
from four universities, including Wayne State University, Michigan Technological
University, University of Illinois, and UC-San Diego will be involved in the
research activities within the Center.
