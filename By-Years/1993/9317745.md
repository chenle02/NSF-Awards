9317745 Cerrina The P.I. propose a research program to extend the application of
X-ray lithography to sub-).25 um devices. The previous phases of this research
program have led to key developments in the area of X-ray lithography. The P.I.
will continue the refinement and development of software, processes and
experimental tools, to explore the extendibility of the applications of X-ray
lithography to the new domains of sub 0.1 um critical dimensions. The proposed
research program is twofold, addressing both the need of developing 0.25 (256
Mbit DRAMs) and 0.17 (1 Gbit) um key lithographic processes, as well as studying
the longer term goal of the application of X-ray lithography to sub-0.1 um
dimensions. The proposed program includes (1) the extension of the modeling
codes, (2) X-ray mask optimization and phase shifting masks, (3) High-precision
alignment systems, (4) Diffractive X-ray optical elements and (5) X-ray masks
replication. The research program will be carried out at the Center for X-ray
Lithography, where a full set of X-ray lithography processing tools are
available. Technology transfer is already in place thanks to the collaborations
with the SEMATECH Center of Excellence and with Motorola Inc. ***
