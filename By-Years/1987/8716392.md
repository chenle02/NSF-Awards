This is an award to carry an at sea validation of a system for measuring
patterns of seafloor strain accumulation with centimeter accuracy over distances
of kilometers. The system is particularly suitable to ridge crest studies and
will help describe the manner in which the seafloor makes the transition from
episodic motion to the more or less steady state motion that is characteristic
of the entire plate. The method involves the emplacement of benchmarks on the
seafloor on which transponders can be placed with great accuracy. The
transponders are interrogated from a towed vehicle to which is also mounted a
high accuracy sound velocity meter to convert travel times to distances. Most of
the equipment has been built with other funds (non-NSF); and this award grants
funds for a two week experiment in the San Nicolas Basin off S. California as
the first seagoing test of the apparatus. This is an important experiment
because it will test a new technique for making geodetic measurements on the sea
floor; the development of such techniques are an important step in understanding
sea floor tectonics and evolution.
