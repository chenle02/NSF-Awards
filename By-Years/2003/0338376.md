This grant supports the theoretical work of a distinguished, mid-career PI on
strongly Correlated electron systems. The list of research projects in this
grant includes (1) Disorder and Quantum Critical Phenomena, (2) High Temperature
Superconductivity and (3) Nonequilibrium phenomena in highly correlated systems.
The class of problems here is frequently referred to as non-Fermi liquid
effects. They lie beyond the edge of understanding of electrons in metals
offered by Landau's Fermi liquid theory. The anomalies beyond the Fermi liquid
theory include the large number of thermodynamic/calorimetric results in rare-
earth alloys, which are believed to be near a quantum critical point due to
disorder. There are related effects in materials relevant for high-density
magnetic memories and in relaxor ferroelectrics. There are nonequilibrium
effects such as the high temperature resistivity of high Tc copper oxides. The
projects involve analytical and numerical approaches along with close contact
with relevant experimental work. %%% The theoretical work supported in this
grant comes from two themes in current research on materials. There are certain
anomalies in the properties of electrons in metals, which Apparently lie outside
the conventional paradigm, referred to as the Landau's theory of metals. They
are caused by the presence of substantial disorder and or extreme environmental
such as pressure, magnetic field or temperature. The work here is fundamental
and far-reaching in that it may require development of sophisticated, new
mathematical tools and at the same time it is motivated by a need to understand
materials which are important for high density magnetic memories or materials
which use their ferroelectric properties for memory applications. This work will
be carried out in close contact with experimentalists and will make use of both
analytical and numerical techniques, as may be necessary. ***
