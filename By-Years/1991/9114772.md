A special superconducting magnet with customized superconducting stabilizing
coil which produces a factor fo 50 reduction in effects of external field
perturbations, housed in a customized liquid helium cryostat designed to reduce
temperature- dependent effects by two orders of magnitude, will be pruchased and
applied to mass ratio measurements of unprecedented accuracy. Such measurements
will include the proton's atomic mass, the tritium-helium 3 mass difference, the
15N-14N mass difference, and electronic binding energies in multiply-charged
high-Z ions. Accurate results for these measurements would provide severe tests
of various atomic and nuclear structure theories and models.
