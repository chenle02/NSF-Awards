This award supports three conferences, called KUMUNU, focused on research in
commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and related areas to be held in the
falls of 2019, 2020, and 2021 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with the
2019 conference being held on September 21-22. The general goal of KUMUNU is to
provide a setting to share cutting-edge mathematical research and promote
collaborations among algebraists in or within driving distance of the Great
Plains region. KUMUNU aims to advance mathematics through the dissemination of
new and innovated results and techniques via research talks. These talks may
inspire participating mathematicians with new ideas, and promote collaboration
among them. Informal discussions while talks are not running should also help
spread new results and ideas. The conferences will also give opportunities for
early-career mathematicians to showcase their work. Confirmed speakers for the
2019 conference are Federico Castillo (University of Kansas), Srikanth Iyengar
(University of Utah), Linquan Ma (Purdue University), Hamid Rahmati (University
of Nebraska), Liana Sega (University of Missouri - Kansas City), and Gordana
Todorov (Northeastern University). The conference will also include a poster
session for junior researchers. The talks will be held from noon on Saturday to
noon on Sunday, to minimize expenses for participants. Since some of the talks
will not be focused purely in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry, new
connections may be made. Moreover, the conference will hold a poster session
aiming to give a number of junior researchers exposure in the commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry community, a chance to meet potential
collaborators, and a venue to network with senior researchers. More details are
available at the conference website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
