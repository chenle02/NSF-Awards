The Young Engineering and Science Scholars (YESS) Summer Science Camp, Jointly
sponsored by the Marquette University College of Engineering and the Educational
Opportunity Program (EOP), provides enrichment experiences in science,
engineering and mathematics. The program offers a 4-week camp on Marquette's
campus for 48 middle school students, plus academic-year activities at Marquette
and in four area middle schools. The summer science camp students explore "The
Wonderful World of Robotics" through hands-on discovery activities and
demonstrations in a curriculum designed to provide students with an integrated
view of engineering with emphasis on the underlying fundamentals shared by all
engineering disciplines. Students culminate their summer experience by
constructing a LEGO/TC logo robot to accomplish a specified task based on their
research and learning activities. Academic year follow-up activities include the
monthly "Saturday Science Colloquia" at the MU College of Engineering and
biweekly "School Science Clubs" at each of the four middle schools from which
the summer science campers are recruited. Students who attend either or both of
these follow-up activities may also receive assistance with individual science
projects of their choice and participate in a mini science fair during Open
House at Marquette's College of Engineering. Both summer and academic year
programming provide career exploration, college planning, and personal
development components designed to inform and motivate middle school students
regarding careers in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. ***
