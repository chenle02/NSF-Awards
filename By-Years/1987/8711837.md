In many species of birds, song is important in maintaining a territory and
attracting a mate. However, in other species, song may also allow members of
cooperative groups to integrate the opposing demands of competing with group
members for breeding opportunities and collaborating with them to survive. The
Australian magpie (-Gymnorhina tibicen-) is a cooperatively breeding songbird.
In some areas, magpies live in male-female pairs, like most other songbirds. In
other areas, however, magpies live in groups of 2 to 8 birds. Each group
communally defends a large territory year-round. All magpies, of both sexes,
sing communally in many situations ranging from territorial defense to nest-
building. The research to be conducted by Drs. Brown and Farabaugh will focus on
several aspects of the role of song in social interactions. First, they will
test the hypothesis that song is used in recognition of group members. Second,
they will compare vocal imitation and sharing of songs within groups versus
pairs of magpies, to investigate whether or not song-sharing contributes to
social cohesion. Third, by comparing behavior accompanying song within groups
versus pairs, they will investigate the role of song in social interactions.
This research project offers an important opportunity for uncovering previously
unknown functions of bird song.
