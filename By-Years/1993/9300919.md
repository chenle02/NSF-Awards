This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It will support a study of the coping process of African-American and
Asian-American parents whose children are juvenile delinquents, employing family
stress theory. Interviews with 40 families in each ethnic group will compare
perceptions and coping behaviors, applying a theoretical model that considers
ethnicity to shape definitions of stressful events and the selection of
strategies for dealing with them. This study will contribute to scientific
understanding of juvenile delinquency and of socio-cultural differences between
American ethnic groups, thus building the knowledge base for public policy on
this social problem. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the
future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
generation of sociologists.
