The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in protecting natural and commercial
resources as a result of actionable information on invasive insect pest. The
information will be used by local, state and federal agencies to monitor harmful
pests in real time and to plan optimal intervention strategies. Invasive species
affect vulnerable communities in poor rural areas, who depend on natural
resources, healthy ecosystems, and tourism for their livelihoods. Invasive
insect pests can drive food insecurity and undermine ongoing investments in
development. There is a growing consensus that early detection and rapid
response is the best solution, but early detection is challenging for want of
robust, automatic surveillance systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate problems
at the intersection of entomology and engineering to improve the accuracy and
reliability of autonomous insect traps. New classification models will be
created to allow application to a more diverse set of insects. Novel “cold
start” algorithms will be created to allow the classification of new species
without first obtaining detailed training data. The project will create a
scheduling system for trap servicing that dynamically considers the
probabilistic insect classification/counts from thousands of traps and the
location of a fleet of trap technicians (in their service trucks), in order to
compute the optimal trap-to-technician assignment and order of visitation. These
algorithms generalize fleet dispatch algorithms to consider the probabilistic
nature of the classification and different costs of damage created by different
insects. The proposed innovation of this project will lie in de-skilling the
invasive species monitoring task, decreasing its cost, and reducing the lag
between an insect species’ arrival and its (human)
detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
