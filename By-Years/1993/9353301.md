This disparity in interest and achievement in mathematics and science between
white male students and female and minority students is a problem that needs to
be addressed. At a three day conference in July 1993, Luther College will bring
together college educators from Lutheran Colleges across the United States and
elementary and secondary educators from Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin to examine
current research findings on this topic. Two hundred participants will be
introduced to materials and pedagogical methods designed to remove the disparity
in student interest and achievement. Presentations will focus on changing
classroom activities from elementary through college instruction including
teacher education. The goal is that the event will serve as a resource that will
enable educators at all levels: * to understand the causes of the disparities
math science achievement and interest among student populations. * to implement
teaching methods and materials that remove obstacles and disincentives that can
cause disparities in achievement and interest. * to motivate more female and
minority-group students to pursue careers in mathematics and science. Cost share
