Objectives and approaches. The objective of this research is to create a novel
Cyber-Physical System, a self-reconfiguring ?second skin orthotic sleeve?
consisting of programmable materials. The orthotic sleeve, worn over one or more
limbs of brain-injured individuals, may restore brain function by promoting
enriched exploration of self-produced limb movements. The approach consists of
three steps (1) micro-fabricating sheets with embedded sensors and muscle-like
collections of force-producing actuators, (2) conducting longitudinal recordings
of kicking by typically developing and preterm brain-injured infants who wear a
sensing, but not actuated micro-fabricated second skin, and (3) developing
biologically-inspired programming techniques to help determine an algorithm with
which the second skin embedded actuators may adaptively assist the ever-changing
developmental pattern of infant kicking. The technology can be applied to many
mobility-impaired populations,including children and adults with brain injury,
the ageing population, and injured soldiers. The project will inform basic
scientific and engineering research in areas such as formation of architectural
structures by large-scale multi-agent robotic systems, and self-organization of
swarming small-scale agents that act autonomously in cooperation with biological
systems. The multi-institutional effort of this research endeavor will
positively impact undergraduate and graduate science education via explorations
of the intersection of biology and computation in cyber-physical systems.
Innovation, teamwork, and the value of communication are encouraged. These
efforts will promote education of an American work force that is technically
expert, scientifically comprehensive, and socially aware to sustain national
excellence in a future increasingly based on technologically complex systems.
