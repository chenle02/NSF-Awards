The Institute is developing and implementing an IT and ET Scholars program,
serving two cohorts of 25 full-time students over the course of the four-year
project. Students are enrolled in one of seven information technology or
engineering technology programs of study that lead to an Associate of Applied
Science degree. The project especially recruits women, minorities and persons
with disabilities in the two cohorts. The project has comprehensive student
support services, strong partnerships with the high technology industry and
scholarship support to ensure persistence until graduation. Project guidance is
provided by a diverse group of faculty and non-faculty advisors. Implementation
strategies include recruitment based on community partnerships, selecting
students using an application process incorporating letters of recommendation
and personal essays, development and utilization of an Individualized education
and career plan for each participant, special monthly seminars for students, and
integration of work-based learning activities to provide career mentoring and
real world applications of the knowledge and skills learned in the classroom.
