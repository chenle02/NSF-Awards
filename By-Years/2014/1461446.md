The conference Seminar on Stochastic Processes (SSP) 2015 will be held at the
University of Delaware in Newark DE on April 1-4, 2015. The conference will
provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress
in research in the theory of stochastic processes, and to enable participants to
discuss their work in an informal atmosphere. In addition to talks by invited
speakers on key recent themes in stochastic process research and their important
connections to other parts of mathematics and the sciences, there will be
opportunities for new researchers to present their research, and for the
discussion of open problems, as well as a tutorial on major recent developments
in probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic processes are basic building
blocks of the way that randomness exhibits itself in the real world, and are
used to model a wide range of physical, biological, ecological, and financial
phenomena. The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and
many of the most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year.
The morning invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments
in the field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives
graduate students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose
themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging in high level open
discussions, and by offering the opportunity to present their own research to
leaders in their field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is
very rarely found in more traditional meetings. Financial support to attend the
conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women,
and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to
attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details are available at the
