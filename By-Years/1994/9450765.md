9450765 Ostebee A curriculum and materials development project focusing on
multivariate calculus builds on and extends the work by the PI's on single
variable calculus. Faculty at St. Olaf College are writing, field-testing, and
disseminating complete course materials, including a textbook, for a rethought
multivariable calculus course that emphasizes the development of conceptual
understanding and analytical reasoning skills. The course and its supporting
materials share a pervasive mathematical theme and a consistent pedagogical
strategy: to combine, compare, and move among graphical, numerical, and
algebraic viewpoints on calculus. Graphical, numerical, and symbolic computing
technology is used to support this emphasis. The materials use technology freely
but are not bound to any specific hardware or software platform. The technology
requirements are defined generically in terms of functionalities, rather than by
brand name. The text assumes that students have access to technology that has at
least the capabilities of a CAS. Specific applications to a particular CAS can
be found in supplements and lab manuals.
