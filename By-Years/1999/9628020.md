9628020 Hedlin This research is to analyze global network recordings of
precursors to the inner core seismic phase PKPdf in order to directly image
lateral and vertical variations in short period scattering strength at or near
the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Results to date have produced evidence for large
scale variations in scattering strength near the CMB. This work will investigate
inversion techniques that will form images of scattering strength that are less
subject to travel time ambiguities. Resolution analysis will especially
concentrate on distinguishing between scatters at core entry and exit points and
within the D" layer just above the CMB. ***
