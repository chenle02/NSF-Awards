9506206 Mann The development of a multicellular animal requires that all cells
have two types of information: where they are relative to their neighbors
(positional information) and what structure they should generate (identity
information). In Drosophila melanogaster, the homeotic selector genes link these
two pieces of information: their large cis regulatory regions interpret
positional information and their protein products control cellular identities by
regulating the transcription of downstream target genes. These target genes are
important to characterize to understand how homeotic genes determine identities.
Therefore, homeotic target genes were isolated using a molecular screen. Among
these targets is a putative transcription factor that is predicted to control
neuroblast identities in the central nervous system and a potential component of
the cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the human homologs of both genes are implicated
in oncogenesis, suggesting that, in some contexts, they can control cellular
differentiation and/or proliferation. To investigate their wild type functions
during Drosophila development, loss- and gain-of-function mutations of these
genes will be generated. The consequences these mutations have on both embryonic
morphology and gene expression will be analyzed. Using in vivo misexpression
assays, the functions of the wild type and oncogenic forms will be compared. In
addition, the homeotic-responsive cis regulatory sequences that control the
expression of these genes will be studied using in vivo reporter gene constructs
and in vitro DNA-binding assays. Together, these experiments will provide an
understanding of how positional information is translated into identity
information by the homeotic genes. ***
