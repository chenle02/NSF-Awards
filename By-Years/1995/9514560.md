IBN: 95154560 PI: Margiotta Nerve cells, or neurons, communicate with each other
primarily at functional contacts called chemical synapses. Each synapse is
highly specialized for the release of neurotransmitter molecules from the
presynaptic cell terminal, and for molecular reception of the particular
neurotransmitter molecules by the membrane on the postsynaptic cell. The
receptor structures are made of membrane proteins, and these receptors often are
clustered right near the sites of presynaptic release. It remains unknown how
those receptor molecules become clustered in the postsynaptic membranes. This
project utilizes molecular and biochemical approaches to isolate and identify
the genetic sequences, expression, and functional role of a potentially
important protein that is associated with clustering of receptors for a common
neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Results will be important for neuroscience in
general because synapses are crucial for neuronal signaling. Identification of
the molecules important for receptor clustering will be central to achieving a
better understanding of how synapses form and how they function.
