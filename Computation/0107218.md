The investigator proposes to continue the development of efficient and accurate
numerical methods for unsteady incompressible flow, with particular emphasis on
(i) finding new equivalent formulations of Navier-Stokes equations, often
inspired by physical considerations, better suited to numerical computation;
(ii) proper handling of boundary conditions, a key difficulty in the subject
since important physical interactions frequently occur near the boundary; (iii)
rapid computation of three dimensional flows and generalization of schemes for
flows in complex geometries; (iv) development of efficient schemes for complex
fluids such as magneto-hydrodynamics, liquid crystal polymers, geodynamo,
climate modeling, and large eddy turbulence simulations; (v) design of numerical
schemes that preserves numerically conserved quantities such as energy and
helicity for inviscid flow, and accurately captures their dissipation rates at
high Reynolds number. It is widely believed that different dissipation rates for
energy and helicity is the key mechanism leading to the formation of large
coherent structures of turbulent flows.

The numerical simulation of incompressible flows, which plays an important role
in numerous scientific and industrial applications of current interest, is a
challenging task for both numerical analysts and computational fluid
dynamicists. The proposed fast and accurate numerical methods for incompressible
flow is expected to become an important tool for simulation and analysis of
complex turbulent flow phenomena including vortex breakdown, (massive) flow
separation, vortex shedding, transient jets in cross-stream, wake-body
interaction, high-swirl flow, etc. It is also an essential tool for the design
of advanced flow control mechanisms used, for example, to reduce flow-induced
noise and vibration, and to improve lift/drag performance at reduced energy
consumption rates. Examples include flow over bluff bodies such as ground or
under-water vehicles; in engines; in/around rotating machinery or in data
storage units with rotating and moving parts.
