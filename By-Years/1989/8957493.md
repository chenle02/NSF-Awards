The research plan for this project is to develop an object-oriented model of a
building that represents the physical components of the building; the functional
and spatial systems of which these physical objects are a part; the tasks
performed to construct these components, the timing of these tasks, and the
relationships between these components and tasks (design intent). Although the
initial focus is on building modelling, many of the concepts developed here will
be equally applicable to other designed entities, such as railcars. Such a
modelling environment will provide an information-rich and flexible foundation
on top of which intelligent tools for design, design verification, and
construction management can be built.
