Abstract

This project will investigate three aspects of complex dynamics in higher
dimension: (1) We consider real, birational mappings of the plane, and we will
show how complex-analytic and algebraic-geometric ideas can be brought to bear
on the dynamics of these maps. (2) We study an "inversion" mapping on the space
of matrices. We will determine the degree complexities of this map as it acts on
various subspaces of matrices. (3) We will work with the complex Henon family,
which has served as an important model family to exhibit complicated dynamical
behaviors and has been important because many observed phenomena can actually be
proved in the complex case. We will investigate certain parabolic bifurcation
phenomena within this family.

This work involves the areas of Dynamical Systems and Complex Analysis. More
specifically, the geometric shape of the dynamical set is connected with the
dynamical behavior that takes place on the set, which is an interesting object
of study within Complex Analysis. The mapping studied in (2) arises from certain
fundamental symmetries in Lattice Statistical Mechanics. And part of the study
of the complex Henon family in (3) should impact a "complex" approach to Quantum
Mechanical Tunneling. Thus the work in (2) and (3) will have impact on
Mathematical Physics.
