In Seismic Zone 4, there are many older, existing buildings that do not meet the
lateral strength, drift control, and ductile detailing requirements of the 1991
Uniform Building Code. A preliminary study using hypothetical buildings
indicates the additional strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation can be
provided by a non-invasive retrofit scheme involving the replacement of the
existing cladding with structural (steel) panels and energy dissipating
cladding-to-frame connections. To examine this retrofit scheme in detail, two
older, existing buildings will be studied. A preliminary design will be done
first, which includes: (1) design decisions regarding the relative structural
contributions of the existing frames and the cladding system to the retrofit
building system; and (2) for the cladding system, design of practical cladding-
to-frame connections and their attachments, and development of a design
procedure for the cladding panels. The feasibility of this seismic retrofit
scheme will be assessed analytically by subjecting the retrofit perimeter frames
to a set of ground motions with ranges of peak ground accelerations, predominant
frequencies, and durations. The research will advance the state-of-the-art in
passive control of structures in two ways: (1) by identifying conditions under
which the structural characteristics of cladding and cladding-to-frame
connections can be effective and efficient, and (2) by providing a foundation
for the development of rational guidelines for the designs of energy dissipating
cladding systems for either existing weak buildings or newly designed buildings.
