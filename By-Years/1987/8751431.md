Topics in Modern Physics: Curriculum Materials & Inservice Program is a two
year project of the Friends of FermiLab Association designed to update high
school physics courses in Northeastern Illinois by augmenting the curriculum and
improving instruction. A group of Fermilab scientists and four high school
physics teachers will develop a teacher resource book on modern physics topics
such as particle physics and cosmology. This group will then hold a three week
summer workshop for twenty master teachers to include backgound lectures on
modern physics and a laboratory to try out classroom materials. A comprehensive
physics inservice plan will be developed by the participants and implemented
throughout the region in the following academic year.
