This award provides funding for a new Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at Savannah State University to be called "Bridge to Research in
Marine Sciences: A Summer REU Program in Savannah, Georgia". The program will
support eight to ten students during a seven week summer research program.
Savannah State University along with its local partners the Skidaway Institute
of Oceanography (SkIO), Georgia Tech, and Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary
in Savannah (GRNMS), Georgia have research environments that are well-equipped
and staffed to provide intellectual merit in student research projects. Student
recruitment will focus on freshmen and sophomores from HBCU's and small non-
research colleges and universities. The first two weeks of the program will
focus primarily on whole-group activities including short courses and workshops
in marine science, statistics, technical writing, experimental design and
ethics, guest lectures, field trips, and visits to marine laboratories in the
Georgia/South Carolina coastal region. The second part will consist of a
research cruise on an oceanographic vessel (UNOLS, R/V Savannah), and the third
phase will involve four weeks of research capped with a student research
seminar. Student deliverables will include a log/journal, formal written
research report, a seminar presentation and a completed program evaluation form.
It will include independent research projects by the students, participation in
a semi-weekly summer lecture series on topics like scientific writing, science
careers, ethics and data visualization. The program will conclude with a written
report and student poster presentations. This program is mainly field-based, but
students will have access to global databases and excellent computer equipment.
Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate
in national conferences following the summer research program.
