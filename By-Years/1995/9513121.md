9513121 Cohen This award supports the participation of nine U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan seminar on the Surface Dynamics and Structures in Epitaxial Growth,
to be held in Nagoya, Japan, from March 24-27, 1997. The co-organizers are
Professors Philip I. Cohen of the University of Minnesota and Ayahiko Ichimiya
of Nagoya University. The meeting will last four days and its proceedings will
be published as a regularly refereed, special issue of "Surface Review and
Letters." This meeting will further the increasing interactions between U.S. and
Japanese scientists investigating epitaxy; in particular a special symposium of
the Japanese Physical Society has been scheduled immediately following the
seminar in the same city. This U.S.-Japan seminar should significantly enhance
the interactions and contacts between U.S. and Japanese scientists who are
developing theories of surface processes and who are using new electron probes
to characterize surfaces; the conference will improve our understanding of these
probes, and it will help develop the technology for the growth of new, thin,
film materials. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program
in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through international
collaboration. ***
