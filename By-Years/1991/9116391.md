A group of researchers centered at the University of Maryland will be involved
in mathematical and physical research on chaotic dynamical systems, including in
particular foundational questions of attractor reconstruction through embedding
methods, and the recovery of the dynamics through the embedding method, which is
critical to making the approach useful for experimental data. Other areas to be
investigated are chaotic transients and the rigorous verification of computer-
generated trajectories of nonlinear processes. The focus will be on development
of computer algorithms for the analysis of data from experiments. The study of
chaos and chaotic behavior has attracted attention over the past decade, and
there are substantial opportunities for exciting interactions between
theoreticians and experimentalists, so that new theoretical understanding can be
transferred to the laboratory.
