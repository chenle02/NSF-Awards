Edelman 0209437 The investigator, Marko Huhtanen, studies iterative methods and
develops related matrix analysis for solving large-scale problems in linear
algebra. The emphasis is on problems involving non-Hermitian matrices. Recently
he has extended optimal methods for Hermitian matrices to problems with normal
matrices. This gave rise to two fundamentally different families of algorithms.
One is based on a direct extension of the classical Hermitian Lanczos algorithm
and the other on using real analytic techniques. These methods can be employed,
e.g., in solving linear systems and finding eigenvalues, as well as in
multivariate least squares approximation problems and interpolation. Moreover,
he has introduced a classification of normal matrices to measure complexity of
the algorithms. In light of these methods the investigator aims at finding ways
to extend these solution techniques to nonnormal problems. The matrix analytic
part of the study deals with, e.g., matrix nearness problems and classes of
matrices with which matrix-vector products can be performed inexpensively,
typically with the FFT techniques.

The motivation behind the project is to increase the speed of computations for
solving real world problems. Modeling problems of science and engineering
realistically leads invariably to large scale problems. Then the number of
unknowns to be solved can be millions. To solve problems of this size within a
reasonable time limit calls for new algorithms and solution techniques. A
concrete example can be given with signal processing: a faster algorithm means
faster signal processing and the fast Fourier transformation has revolutionized
this particular field of engineering. The investigator studies methods at the
most fundamental level of numerical analysis because linear systems need to be
solved practically in every problem one can imagine. Consequently, the impact of
the study can be very large. In addition to inventing fast solution methods, in
this project mathematical tools are developed that are of interest from a pure
matrix analytic point of view.
