Reaction diffusion equations may give rise to a variety of pattern like
solutions. These include traveling wave solutions, stable steady solutions,
cellular patterns, oscillatory solutions, and even solutions which behave in a
chaotic manner. All of the systems which the principle investigator will
consider arise as a mathematical model of a biological or chemical system. This
project will consider models for combusion, chemical reactions on catalytic
surfaces, phase transitions, and bursting in excitable membranes. The primary
goals of this research project are to investigate through which mathematical
mechanisms these patterns may arise, analyse the stability properties of each
pattern, and understand what physical significance each pattern has for the
underlying physical problem. The problems to be addressed in this project raise
a number of fundamental mathematical issues. Of particular interest are patterns
arising in more than one space dimension. Much of the analysis will be concerned
with how higher dimensional patterns bifurcate from basically one dimensional
objects such as planar wave solutions and radially symmetric solutions. Simple
examples demonstrate that the structure of the bifurcating patterns may be
incredibly complex.
