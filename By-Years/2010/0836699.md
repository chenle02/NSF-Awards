Traffic Flow

Abstract

Complex dynamical systems, such as traffic flow, are characterized by coexisting
phases acting at different temporal scales. Further, random perturbations,
although small, can have dramatic effects on the overall system behavior. While
many physical phenomena result from the coherent but a priori unknown motion of
a large number of variables most of the current models require that individual
motion of the particles is resolved. Such approaches lead to difficulties in
obtaining predictions that are dependable or timely. We propose a hierarchy of
traffic flow models that can provide a better way of predicting traffic flow
observables. Specifically we employ a novel, energy driven, stochastic noise
model in order to describe the different complex phases of vehicular traffic
flow. The model will be capable of reproducing the flow of traffic for the
chaotic and difficult to resolve higher concentration regime.

Modeling the behavior of vehicular traffic flow is a challenging, current and
open problem demanding an immediate solution. The proposed traffic flow model
can be a breakthrough for several cross-disciplinary traffic related research
areas by enabling much more accurate and potentially faster simulation of
realistic traffic streams containing a large number of interacting vehicles. The
coherent description of traffic can lead to better prediction strategies with
direct and indirect benefits in our energy resources, environmental and safety
issues.
