Proposal ID: DMS-0307616&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert E Kass&lt;br/&gt;Title: VII
Symposium of Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Case
Studies in Bayesian Statistics VII is the seventh workshop in the series that
was begun in 1991. The workshops are held in odd years at Carnegie Mellon
University in early fall. The seventh workshop is planned for September 12-13,
2003. The goals of the workshop are to&lt;br/&gt;(i) emphasize the close
interplay of statistical theory and applications in the context of substantive
scientific research;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) promote the continued development of
Bayesian statistics, by highlighting problems in the sciences that require non-
standard approaches, thereby requiring theoretical and methodological
developments for their solution;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) provide an opportunity for
scientists and statisticians to present their work in depth, highlighting both
the scientific background and the analytical approaches, for the benefit of the
audience;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) encourage young researchers and graduate students to
present their work, interact with senior colleagues, learn about the latest
developments in Bayesian statistics, and participate in discussions, by
providing a small-meeting atmosphere;&lt;br/&gt;(v) highlight the many research
opportunities that exist for statisticians who engage in interdisciplinary
work;&lt;br/&gt;(vi) include as participants women and under-represented
minorities who might benefit from the small workshop environment and the
opportunities for one-on-one discussions with colleagues at other
institutions;&lt;br/&gt;(vii) disseminate the findings presented at the workshop
by publishing a volume or special issue of a journal containing well-documented
and peer-reviewed case studies and related workshop presentations, and by
posting the same information on the workshop's web pages
(www.stat.cmu.edu/bayesworkshop).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
