New methods are being developed for synthesis of thin films grafted onto
polyethylene using entrapment functionalization of block cooligomers and
entrapment functionalization of radical precursors. By incorporating ESR,
fluorescence and UV-visible spectroscopic labels at these surfaces, reactions
like protonation and ion exchange are being examined and is how the structure of
the grafted oligomer affects such reactions relative to their solution
counterparts. Additional experiments using structural and stereochemical probes
examine the effect of such interfaces on reactions such as nucleophilic
substitution at carbonyl carbons. A combination of other analytical techniques
including contact angle measurements, mass spectroscopy, electron microscopy,
and NMR also being used to characterize the oligomeric and polymeric materials
being prepared. In addition, a study carried out of the morphological stability
of these grafted polyolefins and will study the possibility that we can employ
external surfaces to preorganized and enhance the surface selectivity of
entrapment functionalization.
