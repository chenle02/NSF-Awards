Mathematics and science secondary education in the NYC school system is
confronted with a number of serious problems: (1) shortages of mathematics and
science teachers, especially experienced teachers in schools characterized by
poverty and by students historically underrepresented in mathematics and
science; (2) extremely low retention rates among teachers; (3) high failure
rates among students who take the 8th grade mathematics exam and required-for-
graduation state mathematics and science Regents examinations; (4) lack of
preparedness of high school graduates for college level work; and (5) schisms
and poor communication between schools, between (some) university campuses, and
between science, mathematics and education faculties. To address these problems,
the MSPinNYC will use the strategy of a Micro/Macro approach for reform at both
the local level and system wide. At the local level, twelve hub schools will be
created. Each hub school will be a clinical site for teacher training, and an
exemplar for excellence in mathematics and science education. The hub schools
will be developed by teams of college faculty and secondary teachers working
closely together in a novel model for professional development to create
cultures within the schools invested in teaching as a collaborative enterprise
and research-driven classroom practices. Collaborative teaching teams of faculty
and teachers will work during the summer with high school students who have
failed a Regents exam. These teams will continue through the school year with
collaborative lesson development and collaborative research on classroom
learning. Schools of Education will be changed to include more collaborative
teaching practice and a greater reliance on the scholarship of teaching. New
pipelines for recruiting talented mathematics and science undergraduates into a
career of teaching will be created. To create reform system wide, the MSPinNYC
Macro approach will include an Advisory Board of statewide policy makers, a
Council of eminent scholars in mathematics and science education, and a 'jobs-
alike' structure to bring together the leadership at the public school and
college levels. Important questions of policy will be raised and addressed,
informed by both the scholarly and the local perspectives. The MSPinNYC
Micro/Macro strategy provides a new model to approach systemic reform in large
and complex systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
