Data flow analysis algorithms gather facts about the use and definition of data
in programs. Incremental data flow analysis only calculate information affected
by the program changes and avoid total recalculation. This research investigates
the application of incremental techniques to the analysis of large software
systems. The research plan is: o to complete performance studies of an
elimination-based incremental update algorithm using ISMM, a prototype
implementation for interprocedural analysis of C programs, o to empirically
study the behavior of a new hybrid iteration-elimination incremental data flow
analysis algorithm, o to develop more precise analysis techniques to deal with
aliasing through pointers in C-like languages, o to study issues involved in
scaling up incremental data flow analysis techniques for programming-in-the-
large, o to extend previous empirical studies of the calling structure of C
programs, their typical parameter and pointer usages.
