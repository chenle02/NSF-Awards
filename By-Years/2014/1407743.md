This award supports the participation of approximately twenty young U.S.
researchers in the 37th Conference on Stochastic Processes and their
Applications (SPA), to be held July 28-August 1, 2014, in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. The meeting is organized under the auspices of the Bernoulli Society
of the International Statistics Institute, and co-sponsored by the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics. SPA conferences traditionally cover a wide range of
current research topics in theoretical and applied probability, stochastic
processes and statistical mechanics. The core of the present edition consists of
scaling limits for random processes in discrete space, like interacting particle
systems and models from Statistical Physics. Models such as exclusion processes,
percolation and Ising give rise to continuum objects governed by PDEs or SPDEs,
with the KPZ equation and the SLE emerging as the most relevant limiting
objects. More applied topics as neuroscience and mathematic models for adaptive
dynamics are also well represented, as well as Boltzmann equations, aging,
hydrodynamic limits and spin glasses. In addition to plenary lectures by
distinguished speakers there will time for young researchers, post docs and
graduate students to present their results and interact with each other and with
the experts.

Stochastic modeling has become ubiquitous these says. Realistic modeling is done
at the smallest scale where it is easy to understand the physical process. But
questions are often asked about what happens in a much larger scale. The
transition involves a scaling limit and in this process certain universal
behavior emerges. Different models at the micro level exhibit similar
qualitative behavior at the macro scale. This notion of universality is
important to understand from a mathematical point of view. The noise or
randomness present at the micro level, while it is often suppressed in large
scales, sometimes persists. When it does, the statistics of this noise shows a
universal behavior, and it is important to understand what to expect in a given
situation. There has been considerable progress recently along these lines and
this has created a buzz. The conference will provide a forum for learning and
exchanging ideas about them.
