This award will support Professor John L. Kardos of Washington University in a
research collaboration with Professor L. Nicolais of the University of Naples.
The investigators plan to continue previously supported work in the area of
advanced polymer composites. More specifically, over the next three years they
intend to work on: (1) Processing of thermosetting resin composites; (2)
processing of thermoplastic resin composites; (3) master model property inputs;
and (4) vapor and liquid permeabilities of carbon and glass fiber beds. The
researchers are experienced collaborators; their recently completed effort on
thermosetting processing research, in which many of the processing models were
developed in the U.S. with much of the basic data needed as input to the models
obtained from Italy, is an example of the complementarity intrinsic to much of
their work. The proposed projects are on the forefront of emerging technology
that is critically important to the strategic materials base as well as the
economies of both countries.
