Funds are provided to support the construction of a new Low-Temperature Flow
Facility (LTFF) at the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research. This facility will
be part of a laboratory complex devoted to ice and cold-region engineering
research. The LTFF will contain a test room for determining strength and
physical properties (e.g. crystal structure) of ice under the various conditions
such as frazil ice growth, generation of ice covers, formation of ice jams, and
deformation behavior of ice rubble.
