Dr. Spangler proposes to study the molecular basis for recognition of receptor
ligands by bacterial toxins, characterizing the amino acid residues and
structural conformation of the toxin's receptor- binding site and modeling the
receptor-toxin interaction with conformationally restrained peptides. This goal
will be accomplished in part by a combination of computer-assisted molecular
modeling and experimental binding studies of specific peptide fragments recently
shown to inhibit pertussis toxin binding to receptor analogs. To initiate this
study and facilitate the molecular dynamics portion of the project, three-
dimensional structural information for these peptides will be required, coupled
with an experimental determination of the binding characteristics of the
peptides. The proposed preliminary study will consist of: (a) peptide structure
prediction by computational methods (b) peptide structure solution by NMR
methods (c) computer modeling of peptide interaction with receptor analogs (d)
experimental verification of the ability of the peptides to bind receptor
analogs and to block the binding of the intact toxin %%% The long range goal is
to explore protein-ligand interactions and provide a rational basis for
understanding and manipulating molecular recognition in both binding functions
and protein folding. The techniques and information developed are of value in
prediction of receptor structures to aid design of drugs, herbicides or
pesticides; antigens in vaccine design; or novel molecules, such as catalytic
antibodies and new molecular electronic devices based on proteins, that can be
developed by protein engineering to provide a template for catalysis or electron
transfer.
