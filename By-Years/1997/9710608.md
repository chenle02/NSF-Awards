9710608 Browne This grant is a renewal of this mid-career PI's research program.
Coming from an EPSCOR state, this theorist has emerged as an ambidextrous expert
in both numerical and analytical techniques, ranging from kinetic Monte Carlo to
real space renormalization group and finite size scaling etc. He studies the
role of spatial correlations and fluctuations in nonequilibrium phase
transitions. These phase transitions can be between different steady states in
heterogeneous catalysis or in various states of traffic flow on highways or data
network flow. These problems are mathematically related as belonging to the
paradigm of nonlinear systems driven by external forces. They can exhibit
transitions to steady states, to periodic temporal or spatial oscillations and
even chaotic behavior. %%% What is common between oscillating chemical
reactions, stop and go traffic on highways and similar phenomena in network data
flow? They are all mathematically related as problems involving nonlinear
systems subject to external driving forces. There are different patterns of
behavior and the transitions between different patterns are the subject of study
in this renewal grant. This mid-career PI from an EPSCOR state is emerging as a
leader in sophisticated mathematical analysis of these problems using cutting
edge tools. ***
