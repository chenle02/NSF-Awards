The Women in Engineering Programs &amp; Advocates Network (WEPAN) has had a
significant impact on the development of mentoring programs and activities for
female and underrepresented minority students in engineering. Its strengths
center on the established and sustained partnerships and collaborations that are
designed to ensure that all WEPAN activities and initiatives have a broad and
enduring impact at the individual and institutional level. The project advances
knowledge of effective mentoring strategies, training, and programs that change
the engineering infrastructure to enhance the academic experiences, professional
development, and career success of underrepresented minorities in engineering.
Further, WEPAN has fostered the integration of research and education activities
to enhance mentoring in engineering program administration, undergraduate and
graduate education, preparing future faculty, and K-12 education. The project
has taken a significant leadership role in the development, training, and
widespread dissemination of a mentoring curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WEPAN
has had an amplifying effect through activities that train individuals and
institutions that mentor large numbers of underrepresented minority students in
engineering and has been instrumental in contributing to and documenting the
increase of Women in Engineering Programs from 18 formal programs in 1990 to 85
in 2002.&lt;br/&gt;
