The vertebrate limb arose approximately five hundred million years ago from the
fins of advanced fish. Despite this enormous amount of time, the evolution of
the limbs of vertebrate animals has been extremely regular--certain patterns
frequently recur, other patterns are never encountered. Many workers have
suggested that the mechanisms of development may limit the amount of
evolutionary change possible in different species. This proposal focuses on the
relationships between development and evolutionary diversity in the most
primitive living group of limbed animals--salamanders. Comparative and
experimental studies will enlighten the extent to which the evolutionary history
of the salamander limb has been limited by developmental mechanisms. In
particular, the relationship between body size, the timing of key developmental
events, and evolutionary diversity will be analyzed. Comparative studies of
developing and adult limbs will reveal the regularities seen in the evolution of
the pattern of bony elements of the hands and feet of salamanders. Experimental
studies will reveal the manner in which developmental mechanisms are responsible
for these regularities. Many of the regularities seen on limb evolution may be
related to the size of the developing embryo and larva. Changes in body size are
an important trend in salamander evolution. Body size will be experimentally
manipulated through both chemical and surgical treatments to explore the role of
body size and the pattern of bones in salamander limbs. These studies will
elucidate the role of an important constraint, body size, on salamander limb
evolution.
