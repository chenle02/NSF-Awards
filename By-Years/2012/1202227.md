This award funds the research activities of Professor Daniel Boyanovsky at the
University of Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last two decades have been
an exhilarating journey of discovery in particle physics and cosmology. In this
project, Professor Boyanovsky will continue his interdisciplinary research in
cosmology and particle physics. He will focus on developing a deeper
understanding of quantum processes and correlations during the inflationary
stage in the early Universe, and study their potential observability in
forthcoming measurements. He will also undertake an assessment of neutrinos in
extensions beyond the Standard Model as possible dark matter
candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also likely to have a broader
interdisciplinary impact, as Professor Boyanovsky's research involves
implementing and merging methods from different branches of physics to study
aspects of quantum correlations and entanglement and possible observational
consequences both in cosmology and in neutrino physics. He will also mentor a
graduate student who will work with him on the goals of this project, and train
this graduate student to perform cutting-edge research in particle physics and
cosmology.
