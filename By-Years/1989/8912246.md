The objective of this research is to develop an in vivo system for study of the
effects of maternal serum Insulin.like Growth Factor (IGF) levels on fetal rat
development. The recognition that> growth factors may influence several aspects
of development has excited interest in defining the true range of their effects
and action mechanisms. IGF.II has been implicated as a regulator of embryogenis
and fetal growth, and the proposed research seeks ultimately to determine the
soundness of this implication. The experimental approach will utilize IGF.II
secreting tumors to raise maternal IGF.II levels, and explore the relation of
these elevated levels to placental.binding and passage of the factor, and to
patterns of fetal growth. The initial objective is to determine the
effectiveness of the tumor system for perturbing placental and fetal IGF.II
levels. Subsequent efforts will be devoted to reducing the interpretive
complexity of the system to a level that will permit direct analysis of IGF.II
effects on the fetus. If successful, this system may generate data not easily
available by other approaches, and increase our understanding of regulatory
mechanisms of growth and development. //
