This project will investigate the arithmetic and geometry encoded in the modular
varieties arising from the study of automorphic forms, as well as in certain
Calabi-Yau manifolds. The first part of the project will investigate the
possibility of proving the Tate conjecture for the entire class of quaternionic
Shimura surfaces, which if successful, will lead to progress on this question
for divisors on all Shimura varieties of classical type. The second project,
joint with K. Paranjape, will aim to associate Calabi-Yau varieties with
involution over the rationals of dimension m to certain basic holomorphic cusp
forms of weight m+1 and rational coefficients. The emphasis here will be on the
3-dimensional case, with a view to understanding quadratic twists and functorial
products. The PI will also continue his investigation into certain other topics,
including the works with N. Dunfield on the circle fibrations of hyperbolic
3-manifolds of arithmetic type, and with P. Michel concerning the exact averages
of L-values.

Many problems one encounters become amenable to elucidation by the mathematical
method when they exhibit some symmetry such as periodicity or invariance under
mirror reflection. This is important in the cracking of codes and in the study
of crystals and precious stones, for example. The main thrust of this project is
to comprehend some of the manifestations of symmetry, especially when their
presence is not evident. Mathematicians, Physicists, and others often start with
discrete collections of numbers, possibly from experimentation, then form their
generating functions, and ask if they encode hidden symmetries. When such
harmonious arrangements arise in nature, they frequently describe the tones of
automorphic functions, which are continuous entities like the waveforms on a
disk. Their discrete frequencies are linked to exciting constructs like lengths
of curves, prime numbers, and congruence solutions of polynomial equations. A
particular focus of the project is to determine when the presence of Galois
symmetries implies the existence of special curved subspaces of the ambient
space, relating in turn to the poles of certain zeta functions. The ultimate aim
is to understand the ubiquity and power of number formations better through
geometry and analysis.
