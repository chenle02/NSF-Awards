This Major Research Instrumentation award is for the development of the
Polarimetric Advanced Imaging Radar (PAIR). PAIR will be a truck-mounted weather
radar system capable of extremely fast updates and the ability to observe
advanced characteristics of raindrops and snowflakes. The radar will be a
phased-array system, which has traditionally been used by the military but is
now gaining broader usage by the weather radar community. The radar will combine
some of the best attributes of current mobile radar systems, such as very fast
scanning, high-resolution, and dual-polarimetry into one system. Radar uses will
include studies of tornadoes, supercell thunderstorms, lightning, hurricanes,
radar data assimilation into computer models, and even radar aeroecology, which
is the study of the movement of birds and insects through the air. The broader
impacts of the project on society will come through increased knowledge of
severe weather which will result in better warnings to alert the public of
hazardous conditions. Students will gain hands-on engineering experience to go
along with a background in meteorological science. The participation of
underrepresented groups will be assured through partnerships with the University
of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez and the OU American Indians in Science &amp;
Engineering Society (AISES) chapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PAIR will be a phased-
array radar system capable of electronic scanning in the azimuth and a
floodlight mode in the vertical where a 20° fan beam would be transmitted. PAIR
seeks to bridge the gap between existing systems by providing the highest sector
volume update rate, simultaneous dual-polarimetric estimates, and the highest
native range resolution of current mobile radars, while maintaining an effective
beamwidth of 1.5°. The radar will be used for the scientific topics mentioned
above as well as more fundamental topics in weather radar technology and
polarimetric phased array systems.
