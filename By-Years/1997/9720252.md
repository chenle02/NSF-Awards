The quality of vision is significantly influenced by the shape of the cornea,
and even subtle shape variations, at the micron level, can have significant
effects on visual performance. The proposed research will develop effective
scientific visualization techniques for the cornea. In such areas as eye disease
diagnosis, eye surgery, and the design and fabrication of corrective contact
lenses, the need for more precise measurements is apparent. Improved scientific
visualization techniques will convey to a clinician the shape of a cornea to aid
in the fitting of lens, the acuity of the visual field and after surgery, and
will show how modifying the parameters of a contact lens affects its shape.
