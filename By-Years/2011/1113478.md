This project will use global images of energetic neutral atom (ENA) data from
the NASA IMAGE and TWINS missions to determine the ion density and temperature
as a function of position in Earth's magnetotail. The project will examine how
the heating varies between magnetic storms that are driven by coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) and those driven by high speed solar wind streams. These
observational results will then be used to establish temporally varying boundary
conditions for a model of Earth's ring current (the Comprehensive Ring Current
Model - CRCM). This will allow the investigation of how the effects of ion
heating affect the dynamics of the inner magnetosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ion
heating occurs in the magnetosphere primarily as a result of solar wind forcing
and the heating is particularly strong during geomagnetic storms. Thus,
understanding the dynamics of the magnetosphere requires the ability to
accurately measure the ion temperature and understand how it is affected by
varying processes in the solar wind. The dynamics of the terrestrial
magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms are important to understand as we become
increasingly reliant on satellite-based technologies for tasks from personal
communication to national defense. Reliable measurements combined with models
that can accurately represent the near-Earth space environment are an essential
element to improving our ability to mitigate the adverse effects of space
weather. The project includes educational impacts because a postdoctoral
researcher and a graduate student will participate in the work. The project also
has impacts on under-represented groups. The Principal Investigator is an early-
career woman scientists who is involved with public outreach activities
