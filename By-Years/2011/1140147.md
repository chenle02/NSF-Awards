A new virtual speaker series, led by Dr. Donald Figer from the Rochester
Institute of Technology (RIT), will be dedicated to the advancement of detectors
for a broad range of applications, including astrophysics, biomedical imaging,
Earth system science, solar energy, and quantum information. The objectives of
this series are to enable future national capabilities by disseminating
knowledge, increasing interdisciplinary opportunities, enhancing interactions
between academia, industry, and government, and providing student and
professional training opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-institutional
committee of technology and discipline experts will select speakers based upon
their ability to deliver material that supports the objectives of the series,
especially the ability to connect experts from a broad range of fields. The
talks will be delivered to audiences around the country through a streaming
audio/video facility, and they will also be recorded and archived for later
public use. The talks will be given twice per month, with RIT hosting one, and
the speaker?s home institution hosting the other. All archived talks will be
accessible through a simple browser interface. Funding for this activity is
being provided by NSF?s Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced
Technologies and Instrumentation program.&lt;br/&gt;
