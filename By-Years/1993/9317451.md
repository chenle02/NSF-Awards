9317451 Yeo Mount St. Mary's College requests support from NSF for connection of
their campus networks to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the
southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Mount St. Mary's College a 56 thousand
bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
per second) National Backbone network. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. By linking to the mid-level and national networks, Mount
St. Mary's faculty and academics will maintain a position of leadership in
research and educational innovation by profiting from remote access to super
computer centers, data bases and information services, high speed
communications, file transfer and remote login, and access to library resources.
This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative
educational resources.
