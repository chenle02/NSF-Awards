Systematic biology is the discipline that describes and classifies living
organisms, and reconstructs the evolutionary relationships among species and
higher taxa. The ability to identify, classify, and compare organisms in an
evolutionary context is critical to many other areas of biology, such as
functional morphology, ecology, biogeography, behavioral studies, and population
biology. Dr. K. Elaine Hoagland, Executive Director of the Association of
Systematic Collections, has organized a symposium entitled "Systematics,
Society, and Public Policy", at which systematists can interact with
governmental policy-makers and a broad range of biologists impacted by
systematic biology. The proposed symposium will provide a timely forum for a
discussion of the critical role played by systematics in resolving the
international crisis in biological diversity. The meeting will generate
important position papers and will set in motion ongoing interactions between
systematists and policy- makers.
