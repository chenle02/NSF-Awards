This grant supports the research of Dr. Hendrik Lenstra as a principal
investigator. Dr. Lenstra will continue his investigations on developing
algorithms in the area of algebraic number theory. This research will also
impact on the fields of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, finite fields and
group theory This is research in the field of number theory. Number theory
starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one
whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was
originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half
century, it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
