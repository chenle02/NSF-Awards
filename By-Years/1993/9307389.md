9307389 Kerrick The objective of this exploratory project is to develop a
microbeam technique (~40 um spot size) for the in situ analysis of ferric and
ferrous iron in silicate minerals and glasses in polished thin sections. The
proposed technique involves analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
of a fresh surface produced by cleaving or scraping the material of interest
within the high vacuum sample chamber. Successful development of the technique
would enable geoscientists to study the spatial variations of feric iron in
compositionally zoned minerals, and it would eliminate the need for sample
preparation that is both time-consuming and potentially oxidizing. The
analytical results would find application in the study of redox processes and in
thermobarometry of metamorphic rocks.
