The springtime arctic troposphere has been shown to be a major reservoir of
many anthropogenically derived pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons. Based on the available data, it is estimated that the arctic
troposphere contains roughly 10% of the global tropospheric burden of NOy during
spring. Additionally, tropospheric ozone concentrations are known to be
increasing at about 1-2% per year during spring and summer at high latitudes.
The springtime measurements of NO at Borrow, Alaska suggest that photochemical
activity and ozone production is possible during the late spring period when NOy
and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC's) are still high, temperatures are warming,
and solar intensity is increasing. In this study, the PI will further develop
and validate instrumental capabilities for making measurements of the nitrogen
oxide species at low ambient mixing ratios. Once validated, he will focus on
gaining an improved understanding of the temporal distribution of NO, NO2 and
NOy at Barrow during the spring-summer transition period. These measurements,
along with J(NO2) and O3, can then be used to calculate the O3 production rates
and to evaluate the change in NOy speciation as a function of temperature and
solar intensity.
