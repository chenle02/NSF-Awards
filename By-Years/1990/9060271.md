This program is directed towards the experimental evaluation of mixed ionic and
electronic conducting membranes for promoting the cathodic decomposition of
nitrogen oxides in automobile exhausts. Perovskite cathode electrocatalysts are
used to promote the electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide and nitrogen
dioxide. The selection of oxide-ion-conducting solid electrolytes will premit
removal of the oxygen formed and prevent poisoning of the catalytic site.
Electrochemical cells based on this strategy are fabricated and tested. If
successful, this approach will permit efficient removal of nitrogen oxides from
automobile exhausts even in oxidizing environments. This would allow (unlike
present systems) simultaneous optimization for removal of both hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides.
