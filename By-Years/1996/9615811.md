This award is to Cornell University and the IBM Research Division to develop
workstation telephony. The project will create methods for carrying telephony
over an integrated services network. In addition, a key result from this project
will be the ability to interconnect that network transparently with existing
PBX-based system and the world telephony network. In this effort, Cornell will
build on its success in creating technology for low-cost pervasive QoS-capable
networks (Cells in Frames), and on its success in creating a useable and widely
deployed communications application (CU-SeeMe).
