This research-initiation grant seeks to fundamentally change how students learn
programming using Second Language Acquisition and Blended Learning (SLA-aBLe).
This approach can be easily transferred to K-12 curricula, increasing access to
STEM learning for diverse student populations. By developing an engineering
faculty member's expertise in engineering education research, it will enhance
communication and collaboration among faculty members and student researchers in
different disciplines.

The project seeks to apply well-developed cognitive frameworks in Second
Language Acquisition (SLA) to develop a new Blended Learning (aBLe) approach to
teaching programming languages. This approach will accommodate a variety of
learning needs and abilities, while potentially increasing student engagement in
online components. It will provide better preparation for face-to-face classes
that will emphasize the problem solving needed in other general education
courses instead of just keywords, syntax, and symbols. It will also encourage
the development of problem solving skills students need to persist in a lifetime
of learning.
