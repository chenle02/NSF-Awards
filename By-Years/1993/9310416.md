A workshop to discuss research opportunities and scientific challenges in the
North Atlantic Current (NAC) where the northern branch of the Gulf Stream
separates near the Grand Banks will be held in Woods Hole in the spring of 1993.
The NAC is a little understood current system, which has major implications on
the interaction between the ocean and atmosphere and for climate variability.
The output of the workshop will be a scientific report documenting what is known
about the region, outlining the fundamental scientific issues that need to be
addressed, and synthesizing these into specific program goals and an outline of
a coordinated research plan.
