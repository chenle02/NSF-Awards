In this project, the PI will obtain measurements of Chlorofluoro- carbons on a
line along 135 degrees West in the Pacific from 35 degrees N to 35 degrees S.
This line is designated as P-17C, and is part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) one-time survey of the ocean. Data will be used to study
circulation and mixing in the eastern tropical/subtropical Pacific Ocean.
