The special program on the Geometry of Outer space will be hosted by the Aix
Marseille Universite. It will include a summer school and introductory workshop
June 24-29, 2013 and a research program July 1-28, 2013. The summer school will
include four lecture series, as well as several research talks. The research
program will include a minimum of five weekly seminars, as well as discussion
groups.

One can often better understand an abstract group by viewing it as the group of
distance-preserving functions of a geometric object, such as the group of
symmetries of a crystal. We will focus on two particular examples. We will focus
on how the geometry of a surface's Teichmuller space has been used to study its
mapping class group. And, in analogy, we will explore using the Outer space for
a free group to study its outer automorphism group. To do this we will bring
together many of the world's experts in both Teichmuller theory and in outer
automorphism groups of free groups.
