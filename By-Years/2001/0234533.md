This interdisciplinary study, combining organic isotope geochemistry and
freshwater ecosystem science, seeks to determine the importance and role of Aged
Terrestrial Organic C (ATOC, which is naturally depleted in 14C) after it is
exported from landscapes to large rivers. The investigators will to determine
what happens to old terrestrial organic matter once it enters a river. The
Hudson River is the focus of this study because prior work has shown terrestrial
organic matter of considerable age (1000 to 5000 years old) dominates C inputs
to this river. Observations, experiments and modeling will be used to determine
(1) the variability in ATOC delivery to large rivers across seasons and among
tributaries, (2) decomposition rates of ATOC within rivers, (3) controls on the
balance between ATOC decomposition and export, and (4) the importance of ATOC in
fueling riverine metabolism, relative to younger terrestrial inputs and to
primary production within rivers themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and
undergraduate students working on this project will receive multi-disciplinary
training that will strengthen research and education linkages among three
collaborating institutions. The investigators will continue to develop
interactions with Hudson River outreach organizations (Clearwater, Scenic
Hudson) to communicate project results to the general public. The idea that a
modern river is influenced by organic matter produced in forests centuries ago
is a captivating framework with which to educate the public about the C cycle in
general and rivers in particular, and the inextricable link between continents
and the ocean. &lt;br/&gt;
