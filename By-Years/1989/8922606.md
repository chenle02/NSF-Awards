Spray combustion serves as the source of a substantial portion of the energy
production in the United States and as the basic for virtually all the major
propulsion systems. Phase Doppler interferometry is now regularly used as the
diagnostic tool for studying non reacting sprays in the absence of swirl. This
project deals with the research, development, manufacture, and application of
this technique for the measurement of two phase transport and air-fuel
interaction in liquid spray combustion systems. The objective of Phase II of
this program, which are a requisite before this technique can be successfully
applied to spray combustion systems, are: 1. To resolve the limitations
associated with the application of the phase Doppler technique to liquid swirl
spray combustion (LSSC) systems. 2. To expand the capabilities of the phase
Doppler instrument to more effectively analyze the turbulent transport processes
associated with LSSC processes. 3. To thoroughly evaluate the new instrument for
measurement of drop and gas transport in LSSC environments. 4. Develop and
demonstrate a fully functional prototype instrument. The technical approach to
fulfill these objectives will be to resolve the current limitations, expand the
capabilities, exhaustively test the advanced diagnostic technique by performing
carefully designed experiments in non reacting and reacting conditions in a
practical combustor, and develop a prototype of the new instrument. Significant
results of Phase II will be the development, manufacture, testing, and
application of an advanced instrument for the complete diagnostic of spray
combustion systems. Potential application of an instrument which can be applied
to the analysis of LSSC systems are numerous: gas turbine engines for aircraft,
power plant generation, furnaces for space heating, rocket engine combustors and
incinerators for hazardous waste incineration. These applications account for
more than 50% of the total energy consumption in the U.S.
