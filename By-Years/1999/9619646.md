9619646 Goel ABSTRACT The Michigan Technological University site for the
National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program will
provide research training for ten undergraduates selected from 18 schools in
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota for each of three summers. These
undergraduates will work on designing, modeling, and experimental measurement of
propagation delays in the Gallium Arsenide-based very high-speed integrated
circuits - the state of the art technology for the fastest computers. The
project goals are to: 1. Enhance student experience, competence, and self-esteem
by working on a state-of-the-art research project; 2. Encourage students to
pursue graduate studies and a research career in electronics; and 3. Improve
students oral and written skills through seminar presentations and written
reports. The expected impact of the project is in an increased number of
talented students choosing research careers in this field which is vital to the
nation's technological advances. ***
