Earlham College will purchase a 12-channel seismograph which will be used for
student research on depth to bedrock under the surficial glacial deposits in
Wayne County, Indiana. This will afford geology students the opportunity to
learn shallow seismic reflection techniques while carrying out significant
research projects. The equipment also will be used in a new course on
geophysics. Earlham College will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
