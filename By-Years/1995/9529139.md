9529139 Jablonski The haloalkaliphilic archaebacteria play an important
ecological role in high pH hypersaline environments. Little is known about these
microorganisms at both the biochemical and genetic levels. Many of the enzymes
which these organisms synthesize may be biotechnologically important and
techniques are needed to manipulate the genes encoding these proteins. The goal
of this exploratory research project is to develop a transformation procedure
for the haloalkaliphilic arachaebacteria ( Natronococcus and Natronobacterium
spp.). This will allow "classical" genetic analysis of these organisms, and the
reintroduction of archaebacterial genes into the haloalkaliphiles, including
genes that have been altered in vitro.
