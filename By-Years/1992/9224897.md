This REU Site Award provides an opportunity for ten undergraduate students in
science and engineering to conduct twelve weeks of independent research under
the guidance of faculty in the NSF Science and Technology Center for High
Performance Polymeric Adhesives and Composites at Virginia Tech. The students
will be doing research focusing on polymer synthesis, surface and interface
science, fabrication and processing of composite and adhesive materials, testing
and characterization of materials systems and final constituents, and computer
modeling and simulation to understand and predict performance of advanced
polymeric adhesives and composites. %%% The interdisciplinary nature of this
program provides a realistic exposure to large scale research on complex
problems wherein many lines of attack involving different scientific and
engineering disciplines must be brought to bear on key issues in order to make
progress. Students have an opportunity to work closely with faculty and other
graduate students and to utilize state-of-the-art equipment and instrumentation
in their work. They also receive professional development training through
technical presentations of their work at a technology symposium held at the end
of the summer, and through preparation of a final written report.
