9512428 Chin The scope of this proposal covers the study of the energetics,
structures, excitations, impurity distribution and final-state interactions in
helium droplets, the thermodynamics, quark condensate, and collective modes in a
hot pion gas, the collective excitation and dynamic structure function of finite
nuclei, and the development of new algorithms for sampling wavefunctions with
cusps. Students in this project will not only learn physics, but will also be
trained in the highly useful art of doing quantum Monte Carlo calculations on
parallel supercomputers. ***
