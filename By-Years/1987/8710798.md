This award supports a three year project with Dr. D. Capone of U. MD Center for
Esturine and Ecosystem Studies applies biotechnology to problems in biological
oceanography. The investigators propose to examine the distribution and activity
of nitrogen fixers in the sea with enzymatic and immunological assays. The
potential importance of marine nitrogen fixers to nutrient cycling is unknown
but suspected to be significant. This work will apply new techniques to the
study of the distribution and activities of marine nitrogen fixation.
