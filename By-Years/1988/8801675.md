This project will focus on four areas of mathematical analysis. Work will be
done on estimating two-dimensional harmonic measure which is used in potential
theory and in measuring growth of analytic functions. At the present time
estimates are known for the harmonic measure of curves in a disc meeting all
radii in some sector. The width of the maximal sector remains to be determined.
Theoretical and numerical efforts will be combined in this process. Work will
continue on problems of optimization using bounded holomorphic functions. These
investigations have been underway for several years. They arise from certain
engineering problems in optimal control and involve finding best approximations
to given functions by bounded or continuous functions defined on a circle which
have analytic extensions to the interior. A third, and more recent, goal of this
project will involve methods for the computation of conformal maps. There are
many techniques extant for such computations and mappings of domains with smooth
boundaries that generally have numerical approximants which converge rapidly.
The present work is concerned with approximation involving maps of domains with
corners. Recent progress has been encouraging although repetitions of the
approximation process shows degradation after several passes. Efforts will be
made to single out the best boundary curves for which current methods are
practical. It is likely that these curves will fall into the class known as
chord-arc curves which have restricted bending. Finally, in a more theoretical
vein, studies will be made into the existence and nature of inner functions
which are constant on Gleason parts of the maximal ideal space of a disc. While
general theory indicates existence of such inner functions there is little known
as to whether there are Blaschke products in this class. Related to this work is
a characterization of the zero-distribution of such products. In addition to
applications to potential theory, this work adds to fundamental knowledge
regarding numerical approximation schemes for partial differential equations.
