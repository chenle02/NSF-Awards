Astronomy is a relative newcomer among the science offerings in the community
colleges of the area. The new observatory is designed to bring a modern, well-
equipped, accessible observatory to the institution's students, as well as
students from nearby colleges, high schools, and elementary schools, and the
general public. Cooperative work is taking place between the astronomy and
computer science staff to accomplish this objective. The centerpiece of the
program is an observatory with a 16" telescope, which is to be equipped with a
CCD camera, spectroscope, photometer, and auxiliary equipment. Several smaller
telescopes are also being purchased to be used for training purposes, along with
two computers for image processing, data reduction, analysis, and storage.
