The study of stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions of
natural phenomena governed by "random" or "chance" mechanisms. Mathematical
models of such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or
both. The research to be preformed is concerned with developing methods for
specifying these mathematical models, approximating complex models by simpler
ones, and constructing models addressing specific scientific applications. This
research consists of three parts. The first part explores the theoretical
foundations of the martingale characterization as well as applications to
nonlinear filtering, and a new approach to understanding the physical phenomenon
of metastability. The second part aims to develop new methods of representing
stochastic partial differential equations and measure-valued processes in terms
of large aggregations of "particles." These particle representations provide
powerful tools for analyzing and approximating the associated models. The third
part aims to systematically develop stochastic models for chemical reaction
networks, beginning with classical Markov chain models and developing new models
that take into account the stepwise development of reactions involving RNA and
DNA molecules.

The proposed research is motivated by interdisciplinary problems and addresses
specific applications in physics and chemistry. In addition, the theory and
methodology to be developed have applications in other areas such as computer
science and finance. The project will also provide a fertile training ground for
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. In particular, there is a high
demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise
necessary to contribute to the solution of problems arising in cell and
molecular biology.
