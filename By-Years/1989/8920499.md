The Twelfth International Conference on Atomic Physics will be held at the
University of Michigan July 29 - August 3, 1990. The Conference surveys the
broad range of subfields of atomic physics, with special emphasis on testing
fundamental principles and calculating from first principles the properties of
atomic and molecular systems. The conference also deals with the application of
atomic physics to other fields, such as fusion and plasma research,
astrophysics, surface physics, quantum electronics and metrology, and it reviews
the impact of new research tools, such as heavy-ion accelerators, laser- cooled
particle traps, etc. The program is designed around invited and contributed
papers; the proceedings will be published.
