Abstract

Award: DMS-0072164 Principal Investigator: Jose F. Escobar

Professor Escobar proposes to work in three different variational problems: The
first one is on conformal deformation of metrics. He proposes to work on the
scalar curvature problem on scalar flat manifolds of dimension five or more. In
addition, he will study the prescribed scalar curvature and prescribed mean
curvature problem on manifolds with boundary; particular attention will be given
to this problem when the manifold is the Euclidean ball and the dimension is
three. Earlier investigations indicate that the problem in three dimensions is
special. The second topic he proposes to study is estimates for the first non-
zero Steklov eigenvalue on compact manifolds with boundary. Escobar proposes to
study relations between the geometry of the space and the first non-zero
eigenvalue and apply this information to problems in conformal geometry, heat
flow problems, and to the study of eigenvalues of minimal surfaces. The third
topic is to study Einstein metrics on manifolds with boundary. There are three
different kinds of equations that arise naturally as a variational problem of a
functional introduced by the proposer; they are Einstein metrics satisfying that
the boundary is totally geodesic or, more generally, that the boundary is
umbilic, and Ricci flat metrics with umbilic boundary.

The three problems above have their roots in Riemannian geometry as well as in
physics. The Steklov problem initially appeared in physics, then in harmonic
analysis, partial differential equations, conformal geometry, and minimal
surfaces. In physics, it describes the temperature of a body where the flux
through out the boundary is proportional to the temperature. We will investigate
how the geometry of the space influence the first non-zero eigenvalue, that is,
the smallest nonzero constant of proportionality. The Einstein equation proposed
in this project is the generalization of the Einstein's equation in boundaryless
spaces studied by Hilbert and Einstein in general relativity to the case of
spaces with boundary. The boundary conditions we will imposed are the natural
ones if one studies this problem from the point of view of the calculus of
variations. The scalar curvature equations that we will investigate are the
average version of the Einstein equation on manifolds with boundary. Nowadays
they are known as the Yamabe type equations. These equations appear in
relativity and in other branches of physics.
