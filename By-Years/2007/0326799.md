This project will address the tendency of El Nino to exhibit persistence
properties which are phase-locked to the calendar year. It is hypothesized that
this locking may arise in response to the amplification of Rossby waves by the
seasonal mean flow. The dynamics of this locking to the seasonal cycle are to be
studied by employing observational data and a simple atmospheric model. The aim
is to incorporate the mechanics of this phenomenon into an intermediate coupled
ocean-atmosphere model, in order that is may represent the major calendar-year
phase-locking seen in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El Nino/Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) climate fluctuations influence agriculture, water resources, fisheries,
the number of hurricanes and wildfires, heating oil consumption, and the
prevalence of famine and disease in certain regions. Increased understanding of
these fluctuations will probably benefit many people in many countries.
