The PI proposed to continue research during the tenure of the FAW award along
the following lines: the evolution of foreland basins with emphasis on the
Mediterranean region, including the Apennines, Hellenides, and Carpathians.
These studies provide information on the mechanical response of the lithosphere
and mechanism of subduction, as well as the variation in sedimentary styles as a
function of tectonics and subduction dynamics; the evolution of back-arc
extensional basins, especially in the Aegean region of Greece, as they progress
toward and interfere with, younger tectonic systems of eastern Europe; the
thermal structure of orogenic belts using theoretical models constrained by
structural and metamorphic data; and finally to investigate the role of regional
scale flow in the lower crust, and complying to the mantle and upper crust, in
areas of continental deformation.
