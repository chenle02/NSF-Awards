EAR-0207787&lt;br/&gt;Emilio Herrero-Bervera&lt;br/&gt; Paleomagnetic directions
measured from 240 lava flows in 5 sequences on the island of O'ahu (Hawaii)
cover about 0.36 Ma of geomagnetic field changes and include detailed records of
the successive Gilbert-Gauss (3.57 Ma), Lower Mammoth (3.33 Ma) and Upper
Mammoth (3.22Ma) reversals. Thus, it is clear that proper analysis of these
observations require to document the total field vector and thus to conduct an
exhaustive study of absolute paleointensity. The objectives of the study are
primarily related to the knowledge of the field variations during periods like
reversals or excursions but also to the critical time intervals that precede and
follow reversals that so far have been only documented from a few sedimentary
sections with conflicting observations. The Wai'anae sequences offer the first
exceptional opportunity to document field variations over a time period that
includes several polarity intervals and thus document the field vector over
various time constants. This is a basic condition to extract and bring up
significant constraints for theoretical and numerical modeling of the geodynamo.
Multiple records offer the best approach to determine the suitability of the
field values and the degree of confidence of the results.&lt;br/&gt;
