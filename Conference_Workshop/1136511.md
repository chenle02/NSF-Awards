The Seventh William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day,
directed workshop on Geometry and Dynamics of Teichm端ller Spaces, to be held at
the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August
30-September 3, 2011. This years workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course
for graduate students and junior researchers on Teichm端ller theory, followed by
a three day lecture series. Among the main topics of the workshop will be the
recent work of Kahn and Markovic which combine methods from hyperbolic geometry
with ergodic and mixing properties of geodesic flow to make a number of
important breakthroughs including the proof of the surface subgroup conjecture
for closed hyperbolic manifolds and a recently posted proof of the Ehrenpries
conjecture. Another topic will be to generalize work on classical Teichm端ller
space to other moduli spaces such as the Hitchen component H_n(S) of surface
representations into SL(n,R) and the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space X_n of a free
group.

The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to
investigate common themes and techniques among significant areas of current
research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested
in these areas. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry
and topology with graduates students and junior researchers who have a special
interest in problems related to Geometry and Dynamics of Teichm端ller Spaces and
will investigate a number of important questions at the forefront of research in
these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new
collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the
participants.
