This dissertation investigates the meaning of consumption for parents seeking
the "good care" of their children. The research focuses on the emotional
processes by which these consumers decide just what is good care and what kinds
of "things" are part of that care. Textual analysis of toy catalogs will be
combined with ethnographic fieldwork on shopping trips and interviews with
parents about consumption and raising children. These multiple methods
(conversations about buying, observations of spending, and considerations of
selling) seek to explain how people make sense of the convergence of
consumption, class, and care in our contemporary culture.
