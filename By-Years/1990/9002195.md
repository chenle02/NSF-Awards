Dr. Jorge Colon has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Colon's doctoral degree was from Texas A &amp; M University under
the supervision of Professor Charles R. Martin. Dr. Colon intends to continue
research at the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of
Professor Harry Gray. Dr. Colon's area of postdoctoral training and research
will be photoinduced electron transfer reactions of metal complexes. These
studies will ultimately be applied to long-range electron transfer in proteins
and in model systems relevant to solar energy conversion. The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
