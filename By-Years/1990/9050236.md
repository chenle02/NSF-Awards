The Association of Science-Technology Centers, in partnership with the Franklin
Institute Science Museum, requests $360,523 from the National Science Foundation
in support of a major hands-on traveling exhibition about global climate change.
The 3,500-square-foot exhibition will provide a broad public with accurate,
balanced scientific information about global warming and insight into its
economic and social context. In so doing, it will help to spark interest in
science and mathematics among the many young museum visitors who are concerned
about the future of our environment. Approximately 2,000,000 citizens will visit
the exhibition during its two-year tour of 11 U.S. science museums. Workshops
conducted at each site before the exhibition arrives and educational materials
to supplement program planning will assist host museums in broadening the
exhibition's impact. ASTC and the Franklin Institute have a history of highly
successful collaborative traveling exhibition projects. We will be assisted by a
group of eminent advisors, a leading developer of hands-on science exhibits, and
the Museum's experienced team of exhibit evaluators. The exhibition may serve as
a model for other museums that are now developing permanent exhibitions about
environmental issues and other topic issues in science.
