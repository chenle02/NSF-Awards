Disease-producing and parasitic species are important agents of natural
selection in the evolution of their hosts. Disease-producing species are often
bacteria or fungi; parasites are often insects or other invertebrates. Each of
these classes of organisms has a different physiology, and therefore can present
a different challenge to a host. Ford and Haldane postulated that this diversity
of challenges produces a diversity of selective pressures which help explain the
high genetic diversity observed in human populations. The PI plans to test the
generality of this hypothesis by using a woody perennial plant, the wild thyme
(Thymus vulgaris L.) and three species that parasitize it or feed upon it. These
include the mollusk Agriolimax reticulatus Muller, the lepidopteran Pyrausta
sanguinalis L., and the mildew fungus Oidium sp. Thyme plants can be
characterized by their terpene composition, and single plants contain a single
terpene. The biochemical pathways of terpene production are known, and the
genetic control of terpene production involves single Mendelian loci. Thyme
populations are highly polymorphic for these terpene chemotypes. The PI proposes
to (1) study the differential sensitivity of these terpene variants to parasites
and (2) document the diversity of selective pressures generated.
