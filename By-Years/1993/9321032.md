9321032 Enchautequi Despite the fact that women in the United States have
migration rates comparable to those of men and that women comprise about half of
the moves, there is a dearth of research on women migrants. The purpose of this
research is to analyze female migration in the United States and to begin
filling this gap in our understanding of the decision of women to migrate and
the consequences for them of migration. This research will also contribute to
the theory of household migration decision making by extending bargaining models
to the case of family migration decision-making. To carry out this study, the
investigator will use the Public Use Micro Files of the 1990 Census data and the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics. From a policy point of view, results from this
project will illuminate debates of gender inequality, affirmative action, and
welfare migration. ***
