This research into automatic theorem proving, program verification and
mechanization of mathematical reasoning will be carried out over a period of
three years. The basis is the study of logical formalisms for program
verification and mathematical reasoning. This includes metamathematical
reasoning and the proof checker (implemented at Stanford under NSF grant
MCS-8206565) intensional semantics of programming languages and use of theorem
proving tools to formalize semantics as a basis for proving intensional and
extensional properties of programs and for mechanizing (aspects of) programming
activities such as specification, transformation, and modification. the
formalisms under study will be implemented using a common software platform.
This software will be formally specified and proved to meet its specifications
by the techniques to be investigated under the grant.
