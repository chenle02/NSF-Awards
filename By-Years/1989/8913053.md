Adsorption of proteins at fluid interfaces play a vital role in many biological,
chemical and biotechnological processes. However, the molecular mechanism of
adsorption of proteins is not well understood. Specifically, the fundamental
questions that need to be investigated are: what are the molecular forces
responsible for adsorption and retention of proteins at fluid interfaces and how
these forces are affected by the protein conformation and what is the role of
bulk water structure in this vital transport process? Thus, the focus of the
proposed research is to elucidate: 1. the influence of protein conformation,
molecular flexibility and the bulk water structure on adsorption at interfaces;
2. the conformation of proteins in the adsorbed state and its relation to their
surface properties; 3. the additivity of polar and apolar groups of peptides on
the kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption at interfaces. The fundamental
information obtained from this study will not only enhance understanding of
macromolecular adsorption processes, but also will facilitate development of
genetic engineering approaches to improve the surface properties of biologically
and technologically important proteins.
