0929796&lt;br/&gt;Degnan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This strategy project will engage
84 middle school teachers and 2,688 of their students from 6 New York City Title
I middle schools in learning and using science, math and IT to research New York
City urban ecosystems services of energy, water and biodiversity. Using inquiry,
scientific method and project based learning students will acquire 21st century
workforce readiness skills while being exposed to the urban jobs connected to
the natural infrastructure on which the City depends. The project brings
together several partners to achieve its goals and objectives: Columbia
University; New York City?s Department of Education; Six Title 1 NYC middle
schools; and representatives of the public and private sector. Teachers attend a
3 week TREES Summer Institute to train them in Community Ecology and ICT and a
model of project based learning, Integrated Projects Week (IPW). Then teachers
implement IPW during the academic year. Students will share their data,
findings, and Showcase projects through social networks. Teachers will compile
and assess practices and promulgate their professional development knowledge
through a Learning Community Model. A focus on community ecology links to urban
ecosystem goods and services: (1) Water; (2) Energy; and (3)
Biodiversity&lt;br/&gt;
