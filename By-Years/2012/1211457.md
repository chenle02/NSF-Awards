This is part of a collaborative project to search for low-frequency narrowly
beamed, highly circular polarized radio emission from "hot Jupiter" extrasolar
planets, as part of the HJUDE project. This emission is predicted to be bright
enough to be detected by the newly commissioned LWA1 (Long Wavelength Array)
radio telescope, and thus the detections (or upper limits) will be used to test
planetary magnetospheric physics models. As part of the project, the PIs will
train undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in
instrumentation, computational expertise and data reduction and analysis
techniques. They will also make the software spectrometer available to other
scientists in the community.
