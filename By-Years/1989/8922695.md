This project is in power electronics. The work deals with resonant converters.
The research focus is in the synthesis of new topologies for switching mode
resonant DC/DC converters which are suitable for high frequency operation and
the analysis and design of new Class E rectifiers which are suitable for high
frequency operation. Also, the project includes characterization of new
configurations of resonant converters and the improvement of power factor of
these power supplies. Experimental verification of the results are expected. The
project is under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
