The American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI) will celebrate its
30th anniversary in the summer of 2009. In honor of this celebration, and with
support from NSF's Documenting Endangered Languages (DEL) Program, AILDI will
host a workshop which brings together presenters who are actively involved in
both documentation and revitalization for Indigenous languages. There are
several interesting aspects to this event. First, it will reunite the fellows
from the 2006 NSF/AILDI partnership in language documentation. Second, ten new
fellows will be invited to AILDI for this summer's workshop as participants in a
course to build more capacity in language documentation through the month-long
training opportunity AILDI offers every summer. Third, the workshop also will
include presenters who have been lead PIs on DEL projects involving Indigenous
languages. The over-riding goal of this workshop is to gain an Indigenous
perspective on language documentation and to better understand its place in
relation to community goals of revitalization.
