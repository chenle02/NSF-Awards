Zehr 95-03593 The primary productivity of the oceans is intertwined with the
biogeochemical cycling of nutrients required for autotrophic growth. Although
there is not clear agreement on which nutrients limits ocean productivity, it is
evident that the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are present at
low concentrations in the oligotrophic ocean gyres. The argument for N
limitation has always been complicated by the fact that N deficiency could be
alleviated by the biological reduction of atmospheric N2. Yet few N2 fixing
organisms have been found in the open ocean. The development of DNA
amplification and probe techniques for characterizing N fixation genes are
powerful tools for assessing N2 fixation potential in the environment. Recent
advances have demonstrated that this approach can be used to assay the
expression of N2 fixation genes, which will be developed further as part of this
program. The goals of this research will be to complete, substantiate and extend
the conclusions from prior studies of N fixation in the context of physical,
chemical and biological parameters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This
research will answer the question of the presence of N2 fixing species in the
oceanic environment and the factors limiting the distribution and expression of
N2 fixation genes.
