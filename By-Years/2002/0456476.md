The University of Maryland Experimental Nuclear Physics group will carry out
program of research focused on the use of electroweak interactions to study the
quark-based structure of nucleons. Particular emphasis will be placed on two
major themes: the use of parity violating electron scattering to measure the
structure of the proton as seen by weak interactions, and the use of
polarization observables to provide precise measurements of the electromagnetic
structure of both the proton and neutron. The primary component of the first
theme is the G0 experiment at the DOE Jefferson Laboratory, which is about half-
way through a multiyear program to measure the strange quark contributions to
the nucleon structure over a wide range of momentum transfer. The second main
component of the overall research program is to extend the measurement of the
neutron's charge distribution to significantly higher momentum structure, and
thus shorter distances, than has previously been achievable. The group's work
will continue to development and maintain instrumentation for use on their
experiments at Jefferson laboratory, as well as to analyze data and interpret
results. The group will extend research opportunities to a number
undergraduates, as well as to graduate students.
