Software engineering is a composite of data and rules about how those data are
composed, presented to various users, and transformed as software development
proceeds. An appropriate computer-aided software engineering environment must
easily handle data and rules. Currently available commercial programming
languages and database management systems tend to be able to handle either data
or rules well, but not both simultaneously. Using a standard RDBMS and an open
architecture would allow CASE tools to be defined as sets of schemas and
semantic rules. Development would be defined as sets of transformational rules.
The automatic nature of this approach improves the reliability of developed
software and decreases the time and cost of it. Feasibility of the approach will
be established by expanding a previously initiated example application. The
example will span all views including development and implementation phases. The
requisite syntactic, and project constraints will be identified. A constraint
language syntax will be specified. Two areas of potential commercialization
exist: (i) an extended constraint subsystem, and (ii) individual CASE
methodology tool rule bases.
