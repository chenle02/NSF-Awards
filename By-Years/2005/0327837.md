This project explores the idea of developing an approach to data assimilation
based on methods for synchronizing two chaotic systems, one being the real
atmosphere and the other being a numerical forecast model of the atmosphere. The
research will progress from simple low-dimensional models to models more
characteristic of weather models. One of the synchronization methods will be
based on bred vectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovations in data assimilation
that increase the efficiency or effectiveness of environmental forecasting
systems might have a number of important applications such as the prediction of
terrestrial and space weather, coastal ocean currents and ecosystems, or surface
and sub-surface hydrology.
