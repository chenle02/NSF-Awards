Year 2015 is designated as the "International Year of Light" by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This event
will educate the community on the advances, applications, and impact of light-
related technologies. The event is organized by an ad-hoc committee with
representatives of all major Engineering Societies and supported by the National
Science Foundation (NSF). The event will take place in Washington, D.C. on
Saturday September 12, 2015 and includes an educational event for K-12 children
and a technical session.

Optics and photonics is one of the most active and fast developing fields in
engineering and science. Technological advances in optics and photonics have
significantly advanced a broad range of areas from communication, medicine,
aerospace to advanced manufacturing. The U.S. has invested significantly in
optics and photonics research and applications, with leading teams conducting
pioneering work across the spectrum. As technological breakthroughs continue to
be achieved and new topics of optics and photonics, such as silicon photonics,
plasmonics, new lasers and 2D materials, continue to emerge, the importance of
research in optics and photonics and its potential societal impact should be
disseminated. Hands-on demonstrations will be provided to inspire children at
the Museum of American Indian during the day. The evening event will include
prominent researchers in the field of optics followed by discussions and
networking.
