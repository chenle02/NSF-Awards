This equipment award is for a Phase/Doppler Particle Analyzer (P/DPA) which will
be used in research programs directed towards (1) developing a better
understanding of the atomization process in electrostatic paint sprayers which
incorporate conventional fan spray nozzles (2) developing a better understanding
of the physics of spray formation and subsequent droplet dynamics in coal-water
slurry atomizers which incorporate airblast nozzles and (3) to investigate a
promising new method of twin fluid atomization, effervescent pressure
atomization. The instruments capability for simultaneous point measurement of
drop size and velocity will accentuate each program. The relative importance of
aerodynamic and electrostatic forces in determining drop-size distribution and
drop trajectories will be determined experimentally. These results will then be
utilized in the development of models to predict atomization quality and
trajectory as a function of paint properties, atomizer geometry, and operating
conditions.
