The theory of arrangements has connections to various fields of mathematics and
beyond, from algebraic and geometric topology, algebraic geometry, and
combinatorics to applied topology, physics, and engineering. This award supports
research on nonlinear arrangements and on elucidating the topological
implications of the associated combinatorial data. The mentoring,
organizational, and outreach activities of the PI will impact the education of
undergraduate and graduate students and support the participation and
advancement of women and other underrepresented groups in the STEM fields. The
project is jointly funded by Topology and the Established Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central theme in
arrangement theory is the interplay between the topology of the complement to a
family of submanifolds in a given space and the combinatorics of its
intersection data. While there are considerable developments in the case of an
arrangement of hyperplanes in a vector space, there has been a recent surge of
activity on nonlinear arrangements. This project explores new directions and
develops new techniques in the study of arrangements, especially arrangements of
hypersurfaces in a complex torus or a product of elliptic curves. This involves
using ideas motivated by topology and algebraic geometry to generalize tools
from matroid theory, and then applying this combinatorial framework to study
topological invariants of arrangement complements and configuration
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
