Abstract for Proposal No. 0105195 by Jiang-Hua
Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will continue
&lt;br/&gt;to develop Poisson Morse theory, the theme of which is
to&lt;br/&gt;use Poisson structures to study the topology of the
underlying&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. She will also study a moduli space of a class
&lt;br/&gt;of Poisson structures, which is closely connected to semi-simple
&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces and their compactifications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisson structures first arose in the 19'th
century in the &lt;br/&gt;study of classical mechanics. Nowadays Poisson
geometry is &lt;br/&gt;being influenced by and has applications in
&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics such as string theory. In the same
spirit,&lt;br/&gt;this proposal is about the rich connections between Poisson
geometry and &lt;br/&gt;various other fields of mathematics and mathematical
physics, such&lt;br/&gt;as topology, Lie theory, Hopf algebras, and integrable
systems. &lt;br/&gt;It also has applications in control theory and
robotics.&lt;br/&gt;
