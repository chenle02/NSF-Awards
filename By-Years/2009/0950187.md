This award will support the participation of ~40 students and young scientists
in the 10th International Conference on Paleoceanography (ICP), which will be
held in late summer 2010 at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in LaJolla,
CA. The ICP meeting is held once every three years, and is the largest and
longest-standing meeting dedicated to the field of Paleoceanography. This will
be the first time a US institution has hosted the conference in over 20 years.
The ICP meeting offers an important means for intellectual and social
networking, particularly for students and young scientists. Participant support
will be based on applicants? statements of purpose and will target under-
represented groups. This award will also support a professional development
forum at the meeting, and advertising of the meeting in relevant trade journals.
