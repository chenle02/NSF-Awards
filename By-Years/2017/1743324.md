One of two NSFCloud mid-scale experimental computing research infrastructures,
Chameleon is a deeply reconfigurable cloud computing testbed supporting large-
scale Computer Science experimentation. Located at the University of Chicago and
the Texas Advanced Computing Center, it is composed of over 600 compute nodes
and a total of 5 petabytes of storage supporting data-intensive science. Since
its public availability in July 2015, Chameleon has attracted a community of
over 1,300 users working on over 200 education and research
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase 2 of the NSFCloud program, this project
will expand Chameleon capabilities and capacity, and will fulfill its mission of
serving as a testbed that is used extensively by the research community
by:&lt;br/&gt;1) broadening the set of supported experiments through the
addition of new hardware and software supporting high bandwidth and Software
Defined Networking (SDN)&lt;br/&gt;2) providing operational sustainability by
streamlining operations, packaging the testbed as open source software that can
be leveraged by others, and developing a process for adding resources to the
testbed&lt;br/&gt;3) provide support for managing, understanding, comparing and
reproducing Computer Science experiments, and&lt;br/&gt;4) focusing effort on
building an engaged community around the testbed via both traditional outreach
including targeted training and education efforts, and direct personalized
outreach to experimenters.
