9625861 Martin This award will support the acquisition of a comprehensive
dynamic thermal analysis system for materials characterization. The system will
include five (5) modules for high-sensitivity differential scanning colorimeter
(DSC), a high-temperature DSC, a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), a thermal
mechanical analyzer (TMA), and a dielectric thermal analyzer (DEA), controlled
through a central multi- tasking UNIX based computer controller. The combined
units will provide thermal characterization for materials not currently
available. All types of materials, ranging from inorganic chalcogenide glasses
to intermetallic compounds to low-temperature glasses, organic polymers, and
glass-polymer melt blends, will be studied. %%% This instrumentation will add
needed capability at Iowa State University for use in new materials synthesis,
processing, and characterization, important for obtaining information on
processing dependent properties, and their chemical and phase purity.
