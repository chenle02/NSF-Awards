Bothun, Gregory AST 96-17011 Dr. Bothun will continue the discovery and detailed
study of low surface brightness members of the general galaxy population in two
ways. The first is to continue observations at radio and optical wavelengths to
more fully constrain the stellar populations, gas and dust content, and
metallicity of low surface brightness galaxies. The second is to study the
populations of these galaxies from new CCD surveys, especially the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, and to better understand the result of any selection effects. This
is a collaborative project with Dr. Christopher Impey at the University of
Arizona.
