One of the major obstacles to the use of recombinant DNA-containing organisms
for the large-scale production of proteins in commercial processes is the cells
genetic instability. Genetic instabilities manifest themselves in the
spontaneous formation of non-productive microbial strains which lower overall
yields and preempt the use of long term continuous culture processing
strategies. Host-vector systems containing obligatory plasmids will be
constructed. In each system, the single-stranded binding protein gene will be
removed from the genome of E. coli but provided for the cell by including it on
a plasmid. Loss of the plasmid should then be fatal to the host cell, and
instability caused by plasmid segregation in reactor systems should be
eliminated. Production of B-lactmase will be used as a measure of protein
production culture. A convenient polylinker, a high production plasmid
containing a strong promotor, will be constructed to facilityate future cloning
of industrial interest.
