9312220 VANCAPPELLIN The major mechanism removing silicon from the oceans is the
burial in sediments of biogenic silica remains. The burial flux of biogenic
silica is controlled by production in surface waters, and by dissolution in the
water column and surface sediments. To gain a better understanding of the
dissolution process of biogenic silica, flow-through experiments will be
performed with freshly collected sediment material and natural seawater. The
experiments will address the role of pH, temperature, Na, Mg and Al on the
dissolution process. The proposed research will also establish the evolution of
the reactivity of biogenic silica as a function of depth/time in the sediments.
The study will include dissolution experiments with the superficial fluff layer
material, in order to quantify the amount of deposited biogenic silica that is
recycled at the water-sediment interface. The experimentally determined kinetic
rate laws, rate constants and solubilities will be included in an early
diagenetic model for silica. The model will be used to test the response of (1)
the flux of silicic acid from the sediments to the overlying water and (2) the
burial flux of particulate silica, to variations of the silica deposition flux.
