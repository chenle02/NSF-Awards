The Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) is the NSF mid- level network that
serves the State of Ohio. A primary goal of OARnet is to facilitate
collaborative projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including
those outside the state. OARnet connections are available to Ohio academic
institutions engaged in research or instruction. OARnet intends to eventually
connect all educational institutions in Ohio. This award funds establishment of
five connections and upgrades one connection to a TCP/IP capability.
