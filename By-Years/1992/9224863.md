The research team of Arakawa and Mechoso represents a highly successful and
productive collaboration which has made many contributions to the advancement of
numerical modeling of the atmosphere over the years. Under this award, they will
continue their research, focusing on three topics: (1) the physical and
conceptual basis for cumulus cloud parameterization in global models and the
development of a cloud model for use in that parameterization, with special
attention to role of the cloud's "environment", both above and below; (2)
mathematical formulations for moisture advection in their hybrid sigma-theta
coordinate model of grid-scale hydrological processes, and (3) the effects of
subgrid-scale variations of model lower boundary conditions involving both
orographic and non-orographic gravity waves and variations in the thermodynamic
properties of the surface. Advances in all of these areas will improve the
performance of atmospheric models for research and forecasting purposes.
