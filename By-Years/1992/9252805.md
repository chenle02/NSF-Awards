This camp, designed for Native American middle school students, focuses on
engineering, including electrical, ocean, civil, and mechanical engineering.
Students will design wooden flutes, canoes, model airplanes, and bridges. The
projects are chosen in part to have some grounding in Native American culture.
The camp is integrated into a local ongoing American Indian Science and
Engineering Society program which will keep the students in close contact with
students and faculty at the University. The camp includes field trips to nearby
museums and industrial organizations and involves parents and the community
through Native American story telling activities.
