CDA-9724422 Sarkar, Sudeep University of South Florida Acquisition of a
Cyberware 3D Scanner to Facilitate State of Art Research in Computer Vision and
Graphics The University of South Florida is acquiring range scanner and graphics
workstations to support research in computer vision and computer graphics.
Specific research projects include performance characterization for range
segmentation algorithms, color-texture analysis for range and color images, non-
rigid motion estimates from range images, and algorithms for processing
digitized data using non-uniform rational B-splines. A number of graduate and
undergraduate students will be using the proposed equipment in research
projects. The University is also considering using the equipment in courses such
as Computer Vision, Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and Computer
Graphics.
