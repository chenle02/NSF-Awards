This conference aims to train young scholars in the use of an important data
set, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and an innovative data analytic
technique, event history analysis. Large-scale longitudinal data sets like the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics have been available since the early 1970s, but
they have not been fully exploited for dynamic analyses of changes over time.
One technique for such dynamic analysis is event-history analysis, the name
given to a set of methods for analyzing data on the dates of events, such as
changes in employment or marital status, the composition of a household, or its
poverty status. This conference has two components: a three-day workshop in
which 15 young scholars will receive training in both the event history
methodology and the use of the PSID data, and, 20 months later, a conference at
which completed papers by these young investigators can be presented and
critiqued. This workshop/conference format is especially valuable in training
young scholars and in encouraging an earlier, higher return on investments in
the PSID event-history data funded by the National Science Foundation and other
federal agencies.
