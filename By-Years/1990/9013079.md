An experimental study will be performed to investigate algorithms for problems
concerned with computation of network flows, including the minimum cost flow
problem and possibly restrictions such as the maximum flow problem, the shortest
path problem, or the assignment problem. The experimental study will proceed as
a cooperative competition among members of the research community. Participants
will submit code for evaluation or will perform specific experiments at their
home sites. The competition will culminate in a workshop where participants will
describe their results; the best implementations for several input classes and
computing environments will be identified. Competitors will generate a large
amount of data about the performance of these algorithms. Parametric and
nonparametric methods of data analysis will be applied to obtain quantitative
descriptions of performance as a function of input parameters. Some particular
results to be obtained include: analysis of the relationship between running
time and standard combinatorial measures of performance; identification of input
properties that are "hard" for certain algorithms; and development of realistic
random models of networks. Besides providing substantial new knowledge about the
performance of these algorithms, the project will also give insight into
experimental methods for algorithm analysis and into the viability of using
computer research networks in such cooperative projects.
