0935271&lt;br/&gt;Huser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This support for an international
doctoral dissertation enhancement project (DDEP) will enable biophysics graduate
student, Gregory McNerney from the University of California-Davis, to travel to
Finland for cooperative work with experts on imaging studies of Echovirus (EV1),
a human pathogen virus. The purpose is to study EV1 entry with a highly regarded
team in Finland, headed by Dr. Varpu Marjomaki at the University of Jyvaskyla,
who has studied the molecular mechanisms that regulate endocytic membrane
traffic. Furthermore, she and colleagues at her institution are innovative
developers of model systems, analysis software, and optical probes. While at his
Finnish host?s laboratory, Mr. McNerney?s plans include the testing of analysis
tools for optical imaging via the open-source software platform BioImageXD which
will be used to obtain new data on colocalization, size measurements and
diffusion rates. Thus, the DDEP will provide the U.S. student with desirable,
early career access to leading European virology expertise, techniques, and
tools. Furthermore, the project is expected to solidify a promising
collaboration between Dr. Marjomaki?s research group and that of McNerney?s
physicist advisor, Dr. Thomas Huser at UC- Davis, whose research group works on
advanced approaches to live cell imaging at high speed and high
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through participation in the Finnish team?s
refinement of BioImageXD functions and the software?s robustness, Mr. McNerney
should gain new insights about cellular uptake pathways while using EV1 as a
model virus. If successful, results from the joint project and improved image
analysis techniques could benefit the broader research community, including
other biology students and medical investigators who have interest in EV1-like
infections and self-replication.
