The Math and Science Teaching (MAST) Fellows project represents a partnership
among New Jersey City University, three high needs school districts in northern
New Jersey (Jersey City, Union City, and Academy Charter High School), and the
non-profit partners Latino Institute and the Urban League. The Liberty Science
Center is also a participant on the project. The partners are working together
to develop and retain twenty Teaching Fellows who will be secondary mathematics
and science teachers who are highly qualified and who utilize evidence-based
teaching innovations in their classrooms. Fellows are being recruited from
recent STEM graduates in the region. The Fellows are participating in mentoring
and professional development activities designed to enhance their teaching and
to provide them with a support structure for retention in teaching. The project
is being rigorously assessed to determine the impact of the program on the
Fellows' content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, instructional
practices, and ultimately the impact of the program on their students'
mathematics and science learning.
