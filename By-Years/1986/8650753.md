This project involves the development of a computer laboratory for applied and
computational mathematics. A number of recent national reports have stressed the
need for stronger emphasis on computational mathematics education. The
laboratory will enhance San Jose State University's applied mathematics and
computational mathematics courses by providing them with a good laboratory
component where students can carry out numerical experiments and see
illustrations of results in applied mathematics. In addition the lab will
provide support for San Jose State's innovative Applied Mathematics and Computer
Science Clinic. The purpose of the Clinic is to give students the opportunity to
do real-world problem solving as part of a team in a setting which is not
usually encountered in undergraduate education. Problems arising in the Clinic
are usually complex and evolve as the problems are studied. For such problems
substantial computing power is required. The laboratory will consist of 8 IBM AT
microcomputers and DSI co- processor and memory boards. This combination will
result in a machine much faster than the basic computer and with 4 MB of memory.
