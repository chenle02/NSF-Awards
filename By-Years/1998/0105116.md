Unlike humans, plant species often have more than two sets of chromosomes. These
polyploid plants, 30 to 70% of all plant species, are usually unable to mate
with diploid individuals with two sets of chromosomes, and so they are
considered different species. When a polyploid plant originates from diploid
progenitors, how does it succeed, if the surrounding plants interfere with
reproduction? One possibility is that the two types of plants have different
habitat requirements. If so, their spatial separation may prevent reproductive
interference. This project will examine whether the plant species, Ranunculus
adoneus, with 16 or 32 chromosomes have different requirements for their
survival, growth, and reproduction. Populations with different chromosome counts
grow in separate places in the Colorado Rockies. This experiment will monitor
survival and growth of seedlings transplanted between locations. Reproductive
interference will be demonstrated if adding pollen from the other plant type
reduces the number of seeds produced.

Understanding the forces generating and maintaining biological diversity is one
of the fundamental goals of biology. Polyploid speciation has been an important
process leading to new plant species, but is not well understood. This study
asks how new plant species originate, and so seeks to understand a major source
of plant diversity.
