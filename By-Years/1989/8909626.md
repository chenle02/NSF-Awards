Parametric optimization deals with problems where the objective function is a
function of one or more independent parameters. Such questions arise in a
variety of settings, including dynamic computational geometry and the problem of
allocating modules to processors in a distributed system (where the amount of
time needed to execute a job on a given processor may depend on the load of the
processor). The minimization diagram of a parameter problem is a partition of
the parameter space into regions, where each is the maximal set of parameter
values for which a particular solution is optimum. The optimum solution for
given parameter values can be efficiently obtained from the minimization diagram
using point location techniques. This project investigates the following: 1.
Obtaining bounds on the geometric complexity of the minimization diagram for
particular problems. These bounds allow one to estimate the amount of time
needed to locate a point within it. 2. Devising efficient general-purpose and
problem-specific strategies for constructing the minimization diagram.
