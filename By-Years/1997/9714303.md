Stahl 97-14303 Diversity and Habitat Range of Sulfate-Reducing Microorganisms
The biogeochemical cycling of elements (e.g., C, N, S, P) is the most general
characteristic of the biosphere. The persistence of key biogeochemical cycles
through different environmental extremes is the most general question
encompassed by this research. More specifically, this study will focus on one
step in the sulfur cycle, dissimilatory sulfate reduction (sulfate respiration),
and better define the microbial diversity associated with, and the environmental
constraints on, this key process. The need for this focus was indicated by
recent comparative analyses of a highly conserved enzyme in the pathway for
sulfate respiration, the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR), suggesting that
sulfate (or sulfite) respiration is an extremely ancient metabolism, possibly
predating the divergence of the three domains of life. If this is so, then the
diversity of sulfate-reducing microorganisms is almost certainly poorly
described. In order to more fully evaluate their diversity and activity,
environments demonstrating extremes of pH, temperature, and salinity will be
characterized using a DSR-based analysis in combination with complementary
microbiological, molecular (165 rRNA), and functional analyses. These studies
should greatly expand understanding of the evolutionary origins of organisms
mediating this key step in the sulfur cycle and the roles they play in
contemporary ecosystems. This project, which is being supported by the Division
of Environmental Biology, the Chemistry Division, and the Office of
