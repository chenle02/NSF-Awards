This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will continue support to Dr. Richard H. Holm of the Chemistry Department,
Harvard University, for research in the area of bioinorganic chemistry. Three
systems will be investigated: oxygen atom transfer chemistry of molybdenum and
tungsten dithiolenes, which is related to the behavior of molybdenum enzymes;
hydrogen evolution from reduced nickel and formation of thioesters from nickel-
acyls and thiols, which are studies relevant to the behavior of hydrogenase and
carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; and binuclear iron-copper bridged molecular
assemblies related to the binuclear sites of heme-copper oxidases. Kinetics and
other aspects of these processes will be examined to provide descriptions of
reaction pathways that may be feasible in enzymatic reactions. In addition, low-
temperature syntheses of metal clusters containing chalcogenides or
chalcohalides will be developed. Enzymatic reactions provide rapid low-energy
routes to reactions important not only in biological systems, but also in
synthesis of important organic and inorganic chemicals. By investigating the
detailed mechanism of fundamental reactions involving oxygen atom transfer,
oxidation-reduction, and hydrogen transfer, Dr. Holm may elucidate spatial and
steric requirements useful for the development of new synthetic routes, as well
as increase understanding of biological action
