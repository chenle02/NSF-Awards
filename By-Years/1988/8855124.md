Southwest State University has designed a program to expose 8th grade females
to a learning experience in the biological sciences, chemistry and mathematics.
The sixty students, selected by their respective schools, will choose two of
four five-day workshops in which to participate. The inquiry approach workshops
will involve university faculty and advanced female college students, who will
serve as role models for the participants.
