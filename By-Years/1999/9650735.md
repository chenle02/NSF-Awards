This project supports the development of a geographic information systems
laboratory with 10 personal computers. The laboratory is being used to teach
undergraduates the principles of geographic analysis and geographic information
systems (GIS) and to provide them with hands-on experience with applications in
both the natural and social sciences. Computers with the ability to run state of
the art GIS software are essential in providing a complete education for the
undergraduate students. The project laboratory is located within the Department
of Geography, Geology, and Anthropology and offers opportunities to students in
a variety of disciplines across the campus. This project is establishing
cooperative arrangements with state and local governments and businesses to
acquire local data and expertise in the development of a central Indiana-
Illinois GIS database that can be used as the foundation of the GIS education.
