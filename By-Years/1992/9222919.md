This proposal aims to study two important problems in ceramic high Tc
superconductor (HTCS). They are the dynamics of flux flow and effects of
chemical doping. Two major techniques will be used to study both problems
together in a systematic way. These techniques are the direct flux-motion
monitoring (DFMM) technique and the x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS)
technique. by a combination of these two techniques, the results are expected to
provide information on flux dynamics and microstructures which will be useful
for a clear understanding and effective control of the magnetic properties as
well as critical current density of the high transition temperature
superconductors. %%% This experimental study aims to connect the phenomena of
flux flow/flux pinning with their microscopic causes, namely, the impurities.
Both the direct flux-motion monitoring (DFMM) technique and the x-ray absorption
fine structure (XAFS) technique will be used in combination for this study. It
will provide a clear understanding and effective control the magnetic properties
and critical current density of the ceramic high transition temperature
superconductors.
