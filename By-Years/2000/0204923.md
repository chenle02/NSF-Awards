0204923&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 36 month
project submitted by Dr. Yang Wang, Florida State University with Professor DENG
Tao, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, CAS, China, to
study isotopic evidence for late Cenozoic climate and ecosystem changes in
China. They propose to collect isotopic evidence of the expansion of C4 plants
in China, and to see whether this expansion corresponds to the late Miocene C4
plant expansion noted in America, Africa, Pakistan and Nepal. This project will
advance our knowledge of the timing and extent of the global C4 grassland
expansion in the late Cenozoic. The long-term climate data collected in the
course of this project can fill a data gap for the area adjacent to the Tibetan
plateau. A U.S. graduate student and undergraduate student will benefit
considerably from collaborating with the Chinese scientists and from the
experience of working on this research in China. The NSF and the Chinese Academy
of Sciences jointly support this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
