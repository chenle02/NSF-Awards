Kalamazoo College is seeking funding for renovation of space in the Olds-Upton
building (originally built in 1927), previously devoted to chemistry, biology
and physics. The renovated building now will house the Departments of
Mathematics, Computer Science, and Psychology, in addition of Physics.
Renovation will include: improvement of the building's heating, cooling, and
electrical systems; bringing the building into compliance with modern building
codes and refitting for proper ventilation, handicap accessing, and fire
sprinkler systems; removal of fume hoods, plumbing, and specialized laboratory
benches; and cleaning and flushing of two organic chemistry laboratories in
order to meet health codes. These improvements will have a major impact on
approximately two-thirds of the Science Division graduates who select a senior
individualized project that involves experimental research and who go on either
to graduate programs or directly into research and development environments.//
