Abstract for proposal EAR 0107129 (PH # 6x)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Stress
Transfer and Accelerating Seismicity Before Large
Earthquakes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's: David Bowman, California State
University-Fullerton, and Charles Sammis, University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, observational and theoretical
descriptions of spatio-temporal patterns of seismicity have focused on two
fundamental (and controversial) observations: static stress (Coulomb)
interactions between earthquakes and accelerating seismic moment release before
large earthquakes. We have previously shown that simple stress change
calculations can be used to define a region of accelerating seismicity before
large earthquakes in California. In this project, we have three main goals: 1)
To test the "false-alarm rate" of our method using seismicity in California, 2)
To test the stability of our methodology in other seismically active regions
worldwide, and 3) To develop a geologically realistic numerical model of a
spatially-extended fault network that produces accelerating seismicity before
large events. The goal of our project is to advance our understanding of fault
interactions and ultimately to develop a method of monitoring the earthquake
hazard in seismically active regions.&lt;br/&gt;
