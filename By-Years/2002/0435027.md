This symposium will assemble, at the Society for Integrative and Comparative
Biology Conference, a group of researchers from the United States, Canada, and
several European nations who have been addressing various problems in
reproductive biology in hermaphroditic organisms. Dr. Leonard has included both
young and established researchers, and a high proportion (40%) of the invited
speakers are women. The goal of the symposium is to present both theory and
data, to test theory, and to identify new generalizations by covering a wide
range of organisms. Hermaphroditic organisms have not been the subject of a
symposium of this nature before, and it is expected that many new ideas will be
forthcoming and have significant impact on evolutionary and behavioral biology.
Funding will be used to help defray the travel costs of U.S. participants, as
well as several young participants from overseas who could not obtain travel
support from their national scientific agencies. Most overseas participants will
be providing their own travel support, however. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
