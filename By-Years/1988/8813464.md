The nonlinear optical interface problem has been of great current interest for a
long time. Analytic, numerical and experimental techniques have been used in
attempting to understand the behavior of an optical beam incident at small
glancing angle on the interface between two dissimilar nonlinear dielectrics.
The most detailed numerical studies to date have suffered from the defect of
being only two- dimensional in nature, and so cannot model accurately the three-
dimensional experimental results. Recently, the PI received a grant of
Supercomputer time from the Peer Review Board of the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications to develop such a three dimensional model. This
proposal is submitted to NSF to obtain funds for the purchase of a graphic
display device to aid in the development of visualization techniques for
displaying results of the aforementioned numerical simulation.
