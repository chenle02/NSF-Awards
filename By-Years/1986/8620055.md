Conventional probability theory has, since the 17th century, been enormously
successful in characterizing chance, uncertainty, and indeterminate phenomena.
Its success has been so great that there has been little interest in developing
alternatives to the conventional position. Professor Fine has, however, argued
persuasively that there are considerable advantages to an alternative approach
which he has been investigating under previous NSF support. The conventional
approach, for example, has not worked for a number of specific cases such as
natural language studies, studies of individual and group beliefs, and gross
measurement errors. This new approach which he calls the frequentist theory of
lower probability refers to a probability-like but superadditive set function.
Under this grant, Professor Fine and his students will continue research on the
structure and the objective frequentist interpretation of lower probability.
Structural issues include the generation of families of lower probabilities that
have potential for modeling objective and subjective nondeterministic phenomena
and a definition of expectation applicable to the whole class of lower
probabilities. This definition of expectation has great potential for
development of ideas of conditioning. Previous interpretations of lower
probability have been of the subjective epistemic varieties. Professor Fine's
development of an objective interpretation of a frequentist variety promises to
have significant application to the important but little understood case of
flicker/semiconductor/l/f noise in semiconductors and in quartz crystal
oscillators.
