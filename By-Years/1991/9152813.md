The goal of this project is the improvement of the undergraduate biochemistry
laboratories by providing opportunities for biochemistry majors, and majors in
other life sciences and secondary education to gain experience in the
acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data generated by modern
methodologies. UV-visible spectrophotometers interfaced with computer systems
are used for the analysis of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of enzyme
reactions. The computers are also interfaced with HPLC systems for analysis of
peptide sequences and enzyme purification. A centrifuge and microfuges are used
in the preparation of membrane proteins, subcellular fractionation of tissues,
metabolic regulation experiments, and in purification of RNA/DNA. Fraction
collectors are used in peptide sequencing and enzyme purification, and a vacuum
concentrator is employed for peptide analysis, protein characterization, and
isolation of RNA/DNA. Gel electrophoresis equipment is used in the analysis of
membrane proteins, in enzyme purification, in Western blotting, and in Northern
blotting of mRNA.
