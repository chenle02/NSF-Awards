This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of the 20 US
participants to attend the "School on Geometry and Dynamics" to be held from
March 31-April 4, 2014, in Luminy/Marseille, France.

The school, which is hosted by the Centre International de Rencontres
Math√©matiques (CIRM) in Luminy/Marseille, France, will be organized by
international organizing and scientific committees. The PI and co-PI are on the
organizing committee. The lecturers are leading researchers in this field and
have been chosen for their record of mentoring and nurturing young talent. The
members of the organizing and scientific committees will participate as mentors
to the young participants, and a small number of carefully picked additional
senior participants will do the same. The schedule centers around five 3-hour
courses and is designed to leave ample time for one-on-one interactions. The
environment at CIRM is ideally suited for concentrated activity and maximal
interaction.
