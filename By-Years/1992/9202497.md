The Fellow will attempt to determine the relationships among orogeny, erosion,
and basin sediment accumulation. Studies will be made in the northern Andean
chain of northwest South America, a good place for such studies because of
extraordinary topographic relief, great thicknesses of Neogene foreland
sediments, and Neogene orogenic phases. Isotopic and fission track databases are
available and will be integrated with data sets of foreland basin stratigraphy,
tectonics, maps and lithologies, and with original data to be acquired as
needed. The Fellow will work at Cornell during the fellowship tenure period.
