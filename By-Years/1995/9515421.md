9515421 Kalai This project studies issues in rational interactive social
learning. This includes learning in long term strategic interaction, e.g., firms
engaged in market competition, and in recurring short interactions, e.g., real
estate transactions involving different buyer-seller pairs. It develops further
theoretical results and applies the theoretical findings to specific problems in
economics. The theoretical developments include the following subjects: (1)
asymptotic accuracy of forecasts as captured by notions of merging; (2) testing
forecast performance using past realization as done by notions of calibration;
(3) relationships between merging and calibration; and (4) economic and game-
theoretic calibrated forecasts. The applications include the following issues:
(1) how long-term learning affects classical models of industrial organization,
e.g., pricing, bargaining and auctions; (2) how social learning can be guided to
bring about social efficiency; (3) developing long-term implementation schemes;
and (4) developing tests that enable experimentalist to determine, based only on
observed past realizations, whether a long-run or recurring equilibrium is being
played.
