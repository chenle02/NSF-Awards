Scientists are increasingly called upon to explain their research to the public,
to elected officials and to members of the media. Giving presentations to a
general audience requires skills that are different from those required to give
a scientific presentation. Three workshops will be organized each year at
scientific conferences in 2020 and 2021 to provide scientists with the
opportunity to learn how to communicate with the public and other general
audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following workshops will be organized at
the February 2020 Aquatic Sciences Meeting run by the Association for the
Science of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) and two other oceanographic
societies and the February 2021 Ocean Sciences Meeting run by ASLO:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Science communication workshop - small group hands-on
sessions where pre-registered participants will be given guidance in improved
communication skills to use with lay public, elected officials, and
media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Interdisciplinary presentation workshop - a
workshop where oral presentations will be critiqued in a generic sense to help
promote presentations more accessible to broad aquatic science audiences beyond
the specific expertise of the presenter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. A workshop,
titled: How and why do you attempt public outreach? that will address various
goals of public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the aquatic sciences
community are increasing interested in learning how to improve their
communication skills and present their work to the public. This effort will
encourage the wider dissemination of information about NSF-supported research to
the public and other audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
