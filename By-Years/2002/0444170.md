The National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs (NSF/OPP) has
established the South Pole Station Modernization project as a multi-year project
to replace the facility infrastructure of Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. A
component of this large activity addresses the development of enhanced satellite
communications capability utilizing the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
System (TDRSS). NSF requires the development of a gimbaled antenna ground
station that will establish Ku-Band and S-Band single access links with NASA
White Sands Complex for any first generation TDRSS satellite that comes into
view at South Pole Station.

NSF has determined that a SBA 8(a) set-aside award will meet the requirements
for design, build, and install for the earth station. NSF has obtained the
services of LJT, Inc. of Huntsville, AL (Columbia, MD office) for these
services. The company's engineering subject matter expertise and prior
experience systems engineering for NASA TDRSS projects is a key consideration in
making the set aside.

Project kick-off activities have been defined in a narrow scope letter contract
intended to refine systems design and system cost estimates. The scope of the
letter contract has limited the performance period to with a not-to-exceed cost
of $200,000. The deliverables at the end of the performance period will better
define the scope and system cost for follow-on build and implementation.
Definitization of the final contract will occur during the letter contract
performance period.

An initial funding increment of $200,000 is recommended for award.
