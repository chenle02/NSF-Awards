Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proof-of-concept project is
developing a combination of multimedia-based and traditional educational
materials for an Introductory Calculus course. It is also extending the current
practice of student portfolios into electronic portfolios (or e-folios) in
Calculus I, and for presentation of student mathematics research. Building on
the successful programs of Multimedia Programming and Design and Calculus
Reform, the Computer Information System and Mathematics Departments are
collaborating to produce materials that utilize multimedia presentation methods
to develop a set of educational materials that integrate multimedia technology
for enhancing Calculus I. These materials use techniques such as three-
dimensional visualization, animation, and dynamic problem solving to facilitate
students' comprehension of complex topics. Activities include product design
sessions and training workshops to facilitate the creation of educational
materials to be published on the web. These materials include electronic class
notes, laboratory manuals, research problem sets instructors' guide and various
exercises, and assessment tools with links to appropriate sources of information
and software tools and that enable students to learn through a hands-on problem
solving approach. This project extends this innovative learning model by
facilitating the integration of Multimedia technology into Student Research
Projects. The students are being introduced to Multimedia Technology and can
author their e-folios and publish their findings on the World Wide Web through
exposure to the educational material and presentation techniques introduced in
the classroom. This in turn provides students with knowledge and experience in
Multimedia and World Wide Web, industries which are currently experiencing a
tremendous demand for skilled workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
