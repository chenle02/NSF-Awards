Dr. Mauzerall is continuing to study the photophysics of photosynthesis whereby
light energy is converted into chemical energy. He plans to measure the absolute
optical cross section of photosynthetic systems using single turnover,
monochromatic flashes. Energy flow and trapping at the reaction center of
photosystem II will be examined via changes in components of fluorescence with
differing lifetimes. In addition, Dr. Mauzerall will develop and apply pulsed
photoacoustic spectroscopy techiques to photosynthetic systems.***//
