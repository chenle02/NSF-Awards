The JOI (Joint Oceanographic Institutions) is being funded to establish a
Project Office for the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) and the Ocean
Research Interactive Observatory Networks (ORION) Program. JOI in collaboration
with the Consortium for Ocean Research and Education (CORE) will draw on the
complementary strengths and experience of these two organizations in managing
large scientific programs, in working with science advisory structures, and in
dealing with community-wide education and outreach activities. The Project
Office will be located in Washington D.C. and will be headed by Dr. Kenneth
Brink, a well-respected research scientist with managerial experience and a
broad perspective on the field of ocean sciences. By utilizing existing
personnel and infrastructure structure support at JOI and CORE, the OOI Project
Office will be established and staffed with experienced personnel within days
after award. The governance philosophy is that research-driven observatories
should be under the control of the scientists who use them, and the day-to-day
operation of the different observatory systems should be the responsibility of
the entities (academic institutions or consortia including industry) with
appropriate scientific and technical expertise. The role of project management
should be one of coordination, oversight, and fiscal and contract management.
JOI/CORE will undertake responsibility for 1) setting up a scientific and
technical advisory structure for the OOI, 2) developing a specific Science Plan
and Project Execution Plan, 3) engaging the ocean science research community in
consensus-building, and 4) setting up and operating a state-of-the-art web site.
