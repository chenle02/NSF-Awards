This proposal has four separate experimental parts, all related by their goal
of attempting to solve different aspects of the problem of how a set of
regulatory gene activities turns undifferentiated floral primordia into complex
and precise arrays of many differentiated cell types. The experiments proposed
are 1) to study in great molecular detail two floral regulatory genes that we
have already cloned (APETALA3 and PISTILLATA); 2) to clone and similarly study
the cadastral gene SUPERMAN 3) to find new genes with regulatory effects on
flower development, and others which interact with the regulatory genes, whose
study should reveal as much about floral pattern formation as has been revealed
by the study of the homeotic and cadastral genes so far known; and 4) to take
the description of wild-type and mutant flower development to a new level of
cellular analysis, using laser scanning confocal microsopy, as a way of
answering many of the questions left unanswered by the analyses that have been
done to date. %%% Plants flower and then produce, thus although Arabidopsis is a
weed and of no commercial concern, if an understanding of how flower development
is genetically controlled results from this work, the economic implications are
significant.
