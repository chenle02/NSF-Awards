The project will investigate several chemical reactions that will shed light on
important chemical processes in calcic amphiboles. It will address the following
processes: (1) The pressure and temperature dependence of Al solubility in
amphibole (2) The upper thermal stability of natural tremolite will be compared
with that of synthetic tremolite in the pressure range of 1-10 kbar. (3) A study
of the solubility of Ti in pargasite will be made to see if the Ti content of
amphiboles is a good indicator of temperature, as field studies suggest. (4) the
kinetics of F- and Cl-OH exchange in tremolite will be investigated to determine
how rapidly halide metasomatism can occur. (5) A unique method of forming
H2O-CO2 fluid inclusions in spontaneously nucleated crystals of clinopyroxene
and forsterite, resulting from incongruent dissolution of tremolite, will be
employed to test how accurately fluid inclusions represent the composition of a
fluid during prograde metamorphism. The study has strong basic application to
the determination of conditions during regional metamorphism.
