The National Conference of Lawyers and Scientists (NCLS), a joint body of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Bar
Association, will address ethical and legal aspects of computer use and abuse in
two interdisciplinary, invitational conferences. A broad based advisory
committee will oversee all aspects of the project, including preparation of
meeting agendas, selection of authors and topics for commissioned papers,
development of invitation lists, and dissemination activities. A call for open
submissions of papers, in addition to commissioned papers, will be issued and
places at the meetings will be reserved for those selected. Conference one will
address the manner in which ethics and the law frame issues of computer use and
abuse. Discussions will encompass current statutes and law enforcement efforts
related to computer abuse. They will also look at the role of extra-legal
institutions in shaping responsible computer use and discouraging and providing
remedies for abuse. The conference will consider what professional, legislative
and other public policy remedies are available. The second conference will
examine international aspects of these issues. It will include foreign experts,
and discuss different models for encouraging ethical behavior among computer
users and for limiting problems of abuse. The international focus and
participation will help to set the stage for future international cooperation.
Two conference reports will be distributed. Primary dissemination of the
conference papers will be through journal or book publication, as well as in
summary articles in journals and newsletters of professional and policy groups.
