This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, uses seeded
nozzle beams to study the dynamics of organic chemi-ionization reactions where
the reactants are neutral molecules and the products are ions. This project will
provide a qualitative picture of how the reaction proceeds, how bonds are made
and broken, and how energy flows from reactants to products. The transfer of a
proton from an acid to an organic base to produce an ionized salt will be
investigated in a crossed beam apparatus. A second type of reaction involving
solvated clusters of molecules will be investigated in the same apparatus. In
both cases the experiments consist of measuring the integral reactive cross
section as a function of the initial energy. The angular and energy
distributions of the products will also be determined.
