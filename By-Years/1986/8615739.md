The principal investigator intends to continue his research on developing and
analyzing models of mechanoreceptors, and in particular, transduction in
auditory hair cells. This also involves the development, simulation and analysis
of a systematic model, as well as a micromechanical model describing the motion
of sterocilia associated with individual hair cells. In previous studies, the
investigator has developed a model of hair cell transduction based on
experiments on the changes in receptor potential in response to individual hair
bundle displac- ements. Parameter estimates were obtained from experimental
observations on one animal species (frogs), but properties of the model are
believed to be valid for many other species. In this project, several extensions
of the model will be done. Terms representing basal membrane currents will be
added to the equations. The hair cell model will be coupled to a firing rate
model to obtain the behavior of the postsynaptic afferent nerve due to
simulation of the ciliary bundle. Ultimately, this model will be coupled with
macromechanical and micromechanical models describing the motion of the basilar
membrane and the hair bundles. The investigator also plans to initiate a study
in dynamic networks of nerve cells.
