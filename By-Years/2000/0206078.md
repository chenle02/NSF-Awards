AST 0206078&lt;br/&gt;McGaugh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Stacy McGaugh, at the
University of Maryland, will carry out a two-pronged investigation of the low
surface brightness (LSB) galaxy population which constitutes the frontier of our
knowledge. One aspect is the analysis of a large, very deep survey for local
"ultra" LSB galaxies. The data for&lt;br/&gt;this survey exist, and Dr. McGaugh
will now process and analyze these data The second aspect of this project is the
acquisition and analysis of high accuracy, high spatial resolution rotation
curves of known LSB galaxies. This topic has become exciting and controversial
because of its potentially pivotal role in testing cold dark matter structure
formation simulations. Such simulations predict dark matter halos with cusps
which are difficult to reconcile with the observations to date. A number of
outstanding questions have been raised over this issue, creating an enormous
demand for more and better data on this subject.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
