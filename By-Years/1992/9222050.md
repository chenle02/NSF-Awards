ABSTRACT The aim of this research is to produce a definitive lexicon of Wiyot,
a native American language of a northern California whose last living speaker
died in 1962. A previous NSF grant has been applied to phase I. This part of the
project, now complete, has as its issue the Wiyot Glossary, a lexical index to
Teeter's The Wiyot language (1964). In phase II, the glossary is expanded into a
comprehensive Wiyot Lexicon, which takes as its subject the entire corpus of
materials collected by Teeter (in field notes and on tape), and by
anthropologists Gladys A. Reichard and Alfred L. Kroeber. This should
approximately double or triple the number of entries of the glossary and lead to
a lexicon covering everything ever recorded on Wiyot.
