97-31350 Carlson This project creates materials for professional development
providers so they can enhance teachers' ability to facilitate inquiry science
and track student learning progress at the elementary level. It builds on a
former project that used ongoing student assessment in a way that is congruent
with instruction, monitoring student growth, and serving instruction.
Specifically, the project will design and pilot test a set of six to eight
modules; conduct national field testing; and revise, publish and disseminate the
materials. The materials developed through this project will help professional
development specialists work with teachers to assess student progress in science
while fostering inquiry. The approach will emphasize helping teachers ask open-
ended questions, systematically listen to and observe students, and review
children's work. Diverse materials will be developed including notes, video
taping, and audio taping. The National Science Education Standards will be the
guide for all work conducted by this project.
