Phase Change Memories (PCMs) are a cutting-edge type of computer memory
technology that can revolutionize data storage and retrieval. PCMs use special
materials that can switch between two states, similar to how ice can change from
solid to liquid with temperature. This unique property allows PCMs to store and
retrieve data quickly, even when the power is turned off. However, PCMs face
challenges related to their endurance and reliability. Researchers are working
to improve the durability and reliability of PCMs to make them more robust and
suitable for various applications. The significance of PCM research extends and
has the potential to bridge the performance gap between storage and main memory,
leading to faster and more efficient computing systems. This can have a profound
impact on fields such as data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific
research by enabling faster and more reliable data access. Investing in PCM
research through organizations like NSF is vital because this research has the
potential to shape the future of computing, leading to faster and more energy-
efficient systems with transformative applications that benefit society.

This project aims to explore efficient computer algorithms and architecture for
the design and implementation of PCM to fulfill the storage requirements of
consumers. The main focus is on enhancing the reliability and durability of PCM
technology, which serves as a crucial technology for non-volatile electrical
data storage at the nanometer scale. This project tackles problems from both
hardware and software perspectives. On the hardware side, all proposed solutions
strive to improve the performance of a PCM main memory system while addressing
concerns related to limited endurance, hard errors, and drift-induced soft
errors. From a software standpoint, it involves operating system support for
address translation from virtual memory addresses to physical addresses and from
physical addresses to actual PCM addresses.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
