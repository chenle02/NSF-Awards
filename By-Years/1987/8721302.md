Considerable research effort has been directed at understanding the controls on
initiation and propagation of thrust faults in contractional deformation
environments. Much of this work has been done on upper crustal, thin-skinned
thrust belts. This proposal will extend this work to a thrust zone that formed
at intermediate crustal levels near the brittle/ductile transition. The zone
lies within the Tuscan nappe of the Northern Apennines, Italy, and is exposed in
a window through the Liquride sequences located west of the Apuane Alps. The
study will focused on the mechanism that accommodate the contractional
deformation and will include study of environmental conditions and the role of
fluids. Results of this research should contribute to understanding of how
thrust zones at mid-crustal levels initiate and propagate hand thus allow better
interpretation of deep crustal structure.
