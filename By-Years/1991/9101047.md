This is a two year research program in response to the joint NSF/EPRI program
announcement on ADvanced Polymeric Materials. Strong, durable, and lightweight
composites are suitable materials for construction of electrical transmission
structures. This research is aimed toward the development of composite members
with superior properties at reasonably low cost for construction of power
transmission tower structures. A novel composite processing method will be
studied which combines the braiding process with the pultrusion process to make
composite members with a uniaxially reinforced core and a braided sheath.
Composite structural members from such process will be evaluated and compared
with pultruded (uniaxial reinforcement only), pultruded with ordinary off-axial
reinforcement (e.g. winding), and braided parts. The evaluation will include
theoretical analysis and experimental assessment of joint strength, shear
resistance, and compressive behavior. Aging study (e.g. UV, temperature,
humidity), field test, and cost- benefit analysis will also be conducted, in
corporation with the Transmission and Distribution Research Laboratory of the
Georgia Power Company.
