This grant supports a program of research in experimental nuclear physics by a
faculty member and undergraduate students at Hope College. The research aims to
provide a better understanding of the evolution of excited compound nuclei,
through measurements of the reaction decay products and of correlations among
them. The experiments are being carried out principally at Argonne National
Laboratory, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and at Notre Dame
University. Data analysis and interpretation are carried out at Hope College.
