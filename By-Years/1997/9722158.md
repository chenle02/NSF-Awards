This research will focus on the development of theories and models capable of
describing the varied phenomena expected to influence the propagation of ultra-
intense, ultra-short laser pulses through gases. Particular emphasis will be
given to propagation through channels. Both analytic theories and computational
models will be explored, the latter being derived from the simulation code WAKE.
An extension of the code from the current two-dimensional form to the three-
dimensional form will also be undertaken. This work is supported as part of the
NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering.
