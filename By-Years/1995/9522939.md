Convolutional codes have long been recognized as the preferred method of
providing error control over a variety of communication channels. Examples of
their practical application can be found in deep space communication, digital
satellite transmission, military communications, mobile cellular telephony, and
high speed data modems. Despite the many examples of their practical importance,
relatively little research has been conducted into the fundamental properties of
convolutional codes, compared to other methods of error control. This project is
a program of basic research into several new approaches to finding efficient
methods of encoding and decoding convolutional codes. Spurred by recent advances
in trellis coded modulation, iterative decoding techniques, and the decoding of
very complex codes, five areas of research are undertaken: cascaded
convolutional codes, multilevel convolutional codes, product convolutional
codes, non-standard rate convolutional codes, and unbalanced memory
convolutional codes. The goal is to uncover new code structures which can offer
better trade-offs between error performance, decoder complexity, and system
delay than the standard structure. Particular emphasis is given to studying the
fundamental role that delay plays in determining the relationship between
performance and complexity. The results of this research may provide viable
alternatives to existing coding schemes in applications such as low earth
orbiting satellite networks, digital mobile cellular communications, and
wireless indoor packet transmissiol systems.
