This proposal will bring together three specific, recent advances to study the
behavior of hybrid systems, most notably those systems for which the traditional
algorithmic methods fail because the reachability and omega-language problems
are undecidable. The tools that will be used include:

1. The recent development of a model for the probabilistic process algebra PCSP
in which the expected laws for both nondeterministic choice and for
probabilistic choice operators hold, 2. The recent development of a quantified
m-calculus and associated quantified temporal logic for reasoning about finite
state systems that support both nondeterministic choice and probabilistic
choice, and 3. Recent results about the expressibility of simple measures on
locally compact spaces - in particular, the fact that any probability measure on
such a space is the directed supremum of simple measures.

These results tie together to provide an interesting and novel approach to
modeling hybrid systems.
