Dr. Joseph Wilson and other members of the Chemistry Department at theUniversity
of Kentucky are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. In addition to research group meetings, activities provide
information on career possibilities, on current major research issues, and on
the development of effective scientific communication skills. Participants are
drawn from Kentucky and neighboring states.
