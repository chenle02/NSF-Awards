9450861 Strommen Under this project a concerted effort to integrate Raman and
Resonance Raman spectroscopy into the undergraduate curriculum beginning with
Organic Chemistry and proceeding through upper division laboratories in
analytical, inorganic, and physical chemistry is being undertaken. The
experimental sequence has been formulated to both highlight the uses of Raman
spectroscopy and to show its complimentarity to standard IR information. The
experiments demonstrate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to probe low-frequency
modes, obtain quantitative information on mixtures, differentiate between
structural isomers and obtain values for fundamental physical constants of
molecules.
