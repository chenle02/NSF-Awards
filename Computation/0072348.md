Low Dimensional Manifolds and Computation

This project concerns problems in low-dimensional topology and geometry, with an
emphasis on computational aspects. Manifolds in two and three dimensions provide
the geometric models for many physical phenomena. Computational issues are
playing an increasing role in mathematical investigations in these areas.
Research in low-dimensional manifolds in turn is making contributions to
computational geometry and topology. It also impacts computational complexity
theory, which studies questions such as how long it takes a computer to solve a
problem. Techniques of computational topology have already led to improvements
in algorithms in computer graphics, visualization, medical and molecular
modeling and image recognition. Several problems on the theme of computational
topology will be investigated in this project.

The computational complexity of many important problems in topology and geometry
is unknown, even when explicit algorithms exist. Recent results have revealed
intriguing connections between complexity theory, minimal surface theory, normal
surface theory and isoperimetric problems. The project will pursue research in
this direction, examining the complexity of Knot Recognition, Knot Genus,
Homology Genus and related topological problems. The project also includes plans
to investigate the generalized theory of normal surfaces. Normal surfaces are
particularly simple surfaces relative to a fixed triangulation of a 3-manifold.
They are the analogs of minimal surfaces in the PL Category. The collection of
such surfaces is discrete and well suited to computation, leading to
applications in classification, complexity, enumeration and algorithmic
recognition. Index-one, or almost normal surfaces, were applied with spectacular
success in recent work on manifold recognition. A third focus of the project
concerns multi-region isoperimetric problems, which ask what are the shortest
boundaries enclosing multiple regions of a given size. The goal is to give a
mathematical proof that the configurations assumed by soap bubbles are optimal.
Questions such as finding the shortest curve enclosing three given areas in the
plane remain open. Also missing is an understanding of general properties of
stable soap-bubble-like configurations, such as whether the minimizing
configurations always have connected regions. Finally, the project examines
questions of curve and surface evolution, using ideas based on normal surfaces.
Such evolution methods have the potential for practical applications in many
areas, similar to the many applications of mean curvature evolution.
