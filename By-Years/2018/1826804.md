In many mammals, male characteristics and behaviors may limit female mate
choice. Discrepancies between observed mate choice and actual paternity suggest,
however, that females may exert influence over offspring paternity through
physiological preference. This doctoral dissertation project will explore how
genetics and physiology influence primate mate choice, generating novel data on
primate reproductive physiology. The project also will provide mentorship and
training in field, laboratory, bioinformatics and statistical methods for
students from groups under-represented in STEM fields.

This study will explore physiological mechanisms by which olive baboons may
exert post-breeding mate choice. The co-PI will collect reproductive
physiological data for both males and females. Social behaviors will also be
recorded to investigate the concordance between pre- and post-breeding choice.
This study will improve understanding of post-breeding mechanisms of choice in
primates and inform the broader primate comparative context for understanding
the unique suite of reproductive and morphological characteristics seen in
humans.
