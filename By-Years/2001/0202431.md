Analyzing Evidence is focusing on the Forensic Science Program at Prince
George's Community College (PGCC). Individuals who are competently trained in
forensic science are essential to the quality of justice administered in the
court system as these personnel are responsible for evidence gathering,
analysis, and court testimony relevant to that evidence. The overriding purpose
of this award is to increase the number of forensic science personnel with the
scientific knowledge and instrumentation skills needed for the rapidly changing
forensic field. To achieve this purpose, the College is 1) creating inquiry-
based mock crime scene modules that incorporate laboratory experiments using
state-of-the-art instrumentation to infuse into a variety of forensic science
courses, 2) creating an inquiry-based Analytical Forensic Chemistry
Identification and Instrumentation course, 3) improving the instrumentation at
the College by the purchase of equipment and accessories to perform the
laboratory experiments in the crime scene modules and new forensic chemistry
course, 4) training faculty to use the instrumentation, and 5) improving career
opportunities for students by enhancing internships with local crime
laboratories and creating pathways from high school through the baccalaureate
degree in the field of forensic science. Modules with laboratory experiments and
other teaching materials are being published online and linked from the Payton
Scientific website for dissemination to other forensic programs. The Forensic
Science Program was created at PGCC in response to a documented need in the
metropolitan Washington, D.C. area for well-trained forensic technicians. The
award has the support and cooperation of state and local police departments and
crime laboratories, the University of Baltimore to which the PGCC A.S. program
articulates, and the local school system.&lt;br/&gt;
