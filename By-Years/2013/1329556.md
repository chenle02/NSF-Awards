This project will engage in empirically-based research on the use of geospatial
technologies by supranational organizations. The PI will study documents
including policy statements, field notes, scientific publications, supplementary
maps, GIS coverages, demarcated areas, reports, memos; and identifying human
(organizations, groups, individuals) and non-human actors (landforms,
technologies, infrastructures), as a group of complementary and competing actor-
networks. NVivo computer software will be used to store, organized, categorize,
manipulate, and analyze data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will disseminate
results directly to the populations studied via a one hour presentation and
informal roundtable to be held at several of the sites. Two journalism
undergraduate students will help with the production of a non-academic report,
production of a video, and creation of a website and interactive blog page.
