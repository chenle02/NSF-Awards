In collaboration with a previously funded program by Pickart (WHOI), the PIs
will contribute to the identification of the origin of Classical Labrador Sea
Water (CLSW) in the Irminger Basin, map the pathways of CLSW, Denmark Strait
Overflow Water (DSOW), and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) IN THE
Irminger Basin, estimate the rate of DSOW flow to the Irminger Basin, and
document variations of DSOW and ISOW in the Irminger Basin and the source of
these variations. They will use, primarily, CFC-11, -12, and -113. They will
perform inverse modeling to understand diapycnal mixing in the Deep Western
Boundary Current and controls on how the overflow water mixes with and entrains
surrounding waters.
