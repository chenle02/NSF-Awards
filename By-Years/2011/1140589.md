This project is developing, delivering and evaluating an innovative first-year
seminar for computing majors that is designed to increase retention, completion,
and success among students, especially women and those from underrepresented
groups. Elements from successful first-year engineering courses, introductory
computing courses, general first-year seminars, and the new AP CS Principles
course combine to create a seminar that provides new computing majors with an
overview of the discipline, foundational technical skills, a group design
experience, and relevant professional development. A team of computing
professors, staff with student affairs experience, and undergraduate students is
delivering this highly interactive and learner-centered course. Peer mentors
facilitate cohort building and provide informal advice, while undergraduate peer
teachers directly support learning. The project is developing a novel course
model and materials that are grounded in the research literature on student
success, developing a framework for peer-led team learning in introductory
courses in computing disciplines, and performing a thorough assessment of the
outcomes of these activities. This intervention is improving the pedagogy in
beginning computing and technology courses by assessing interventions that
increase the retention and success of students in general, and women and
underrepresented minorities in particular, resulting in a larger and richer pool
of talent to solve important problems. The project also includes regional
workshops to share course materials and insights with computing faculty from
local two and four- year institutions.
