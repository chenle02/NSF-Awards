ABSTRACT CTS-9424169 M. Maxey The influence of spherical in the range of 10-500
(m on dispepsed, two-phase turbulent flow will be investigate. Numerical
simulations for the motion of a large number of particles in suspension will
include the coupling of the particle wakes and the turbulence. A multiple
momentum procedure will be used to represent the effect of particles on local
flow disturbances, for finite particle Reynolds number, in viscous fluids with
concentrations up 5% by volume. The overall fluid flow field will be simulated
with pseudo-special methods. Preferential particle concentrations due to local
flow characteristics (vorticity, rate of strain), and the dynamic coupling of
the particles with the small scale vorticity, will analyzed. The computational
results will be compared to bubbly and slurry flow experiments. This study will
help develop fundamental understanding for improved modeling of two-phase
turbulent flow of interest in engineering and environmental applications. ***
