The field of nanotube and graphene optics has recently witnessed some exciting
developments. The recent advances in this field have not only broadened our
horizon regarding the optical properties of carbon nanostructures and their
potential towards new applications, they have also stimulated intense
discussions regarding issues of fundamental interest as well as more technical
issues. NSF funds will be used to provide partial support for graduate students
and invited speakers to attend the 5th International Workshop on Nanotube Optics
and Nanospectroscopy (WONTON 2013) in Santa Fe, NM, USA., June 16-20, 2013. This
four-day workshop will bring together world leaders and young researchers to
discuss recent advances and discoveries related to the spectroscopy of nanotubes
and graphene. It will feature 26 invited talks and about 70 contributed talks
and poster presentations. Its small size and focus on nanotube and graphene
spectroscopy will provide an ideal forum for fruitful and stimulating
interactions among young and established researchers.
