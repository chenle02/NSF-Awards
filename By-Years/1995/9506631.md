9506631 Candela The P.I.s will obtain experimental data and construct models
that bear on problems of geothermal energy systems, volcanic hazards, volcanic
inputs to the atmosphere, and exploration for mineral deposits. In the first,
and most extensive part of this research endeavor, experiments will be performed
on the partitioning of many elements, between melt, brine, vapor, and crystals,
covering a range of melt compositions, temperatures, oxygen fugacities and
pressures at and below 1 kilobar. In the second part, the P.I.s will completely
redo their magmatic devolatilization model to account for the effects of a
percolation model on the chemistry of devolatilized vapor+brine, and account for
the new equilibria that have been collected by our lab and by other workers. The
third part of the proposed research will study the observable effects of
volatile exsolution on hydrous minerals, and on textures of the associated
granitic rocks. Detailed mineralogy, geochemistry and petrography (micro- and
marcroscopic) will be conbined with, and interpreted in light of , the results
of modeling and experimental efforts outlined above.
