The project is offering a one and one half day working conference for 40
attendees at the National Science Foundation in June, 2012. Participants address
opportunities and challenges for the mathematical sciences (including
computational and statistical sciences) communities to engage in and to
strengthen their participation in STEM educational reform efforts, in general,
and modeling across the curriculum, in particular. Through the engagement of the
various mathematical sciences components, the workshop contributes to the
development of an effective model for engaging not only collaboration within NSF
but also with SIAM and its community (including business and industry), allowing
all to collaborate in the realm of education with those who have experience in
teacher professional development. This workshop clarifies the details for
developing, advancing and implementing an agenda focused on mathematical
modeling across the curriculum, contributes to the ongoing effort to promote
broader participation of the mathematical sciences communities, and facilitates
the exchange of best practices and strategies between NSF program officers and
workshop participants.
