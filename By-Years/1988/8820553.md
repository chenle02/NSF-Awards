The energy-driven movement of intracellular membrane-bounded particles from one
region of the cell to another is mediated by translocator molecules which
transport the particles along microtubules. In axons, retrograde movement is
mediated by a protein called "cytoplasmic dynein," while anterograde movement is
mediated by a different protein called "kinesin." In this project, the
subcellular distribution of kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein will be determined by
immunolocalization at the light and electron microscopic levels. The
differential association of these proteins with vesicles moving in the
orthograde vs. retrograde directions in axons will be assessed. The components
of the outer mitochondrial membrane will be analyzed to determine the
characteristics of that organelle which allow it to move bidirectionally in
axons. Finally, cDNA clones of the genes coding for the translocator proteins
will be isolated. These experiments have as their focus increasing our
understanding of the motor molecules involved in the important cell biological
phenomenon of intracellular particle motility.
