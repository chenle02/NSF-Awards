The equipment purchased will contribute to a growing lightwave facility at this
institution. The work to be carried out will involve the detection of radiation
with unique structures which enhance coupling between lightwaves and the
electronic current flow. The laser compliments nicely the other facilities
presently being at this university and is a basic laser system which can serve
as a general facility.
