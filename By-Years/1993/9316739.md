9316739 Voight The proposed research focuses on debris flows and is intended as
a contribution to the Decade Volcano Program of the International Decade of
Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). It has the general objectives to enhance our
understanding of past sector-collapses via characterization of deposits and
reconstruction of source areas, and to improve our understanding of mechanisms
of transformation of debris avalanche to cohesive debris flows. These objectives
will be met through detailed study of megaclast and matrix facies relationships
in flow deposits, and detailed megaclast mapping of lithologies, igneous
structures, key alteration minerals, and textures. A primary task of the
proposed research is to characterize the megaclasts and adjacent matrix in the
Greenwater Lahar-Osceola Mudflow deposit. The study should significantly
contribute to our understanding of cohesive debris flow processes and hazards at
Mount Rainier and similar volcanoes worldwide.
