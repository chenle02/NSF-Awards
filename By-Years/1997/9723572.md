Abstract 9723572 Willliamson and Schlegel During the developent of the
lymphocytes of the immune system, some cells are created which are
nonfunctional, and others which react to normal body components. These
lymphocytes are removed by a process of programmed cell death called apoptosis,
a series of changes which can be triggered by a wide variety of circumstances,
but which finally occurs by a common pathway using machinery which is ready and
waiting to be activated in virtually all cells. This pathway includes one step
in which the surface of the apoptotic cell is altered, and after this surface
change has occurred, the cell can be recognized as q doomed cell by its
neighbors. Their response is to engulf and consume the apoptotic cell before it
has a chance to die and fall apart (which can result in tissue damage). The
critical step in the alteration of the apoptotic cell surface is a change in the
membrane which surrounds the cell. This membrane is a two- layered structure
made up of phospholipids. One of these, phosphatidylserine or PS, is normally
kept in the inner layer of the membrane bilayer, facing the interior. In
apoptotic cells, PS appears in the external layer of the membrane because the
membrane enzyme which normally keeps it inside is turned off, and a new enzyme
is activated which allows it to move to the cell surface. This project will
study these events in lymphocytes which grow in culture and in which apoptosis
can be triggered. The object of these studies will be to try to understand how
the changes in the arrangement of PS are induced. Other studies have suggested
that degradative enzymes (the ICE proteases), changes in the energy producing
organelles (the mitochondria), or changes in the amount of calcium inside the
cell may be necessary for apoptosis to occur. These studies will determine
whether these factors must be involved to change the distribution of PS in
apoptotic cells. In addition, these studies will investigat e how other kinds of
cells recognize the PS on the surface of the apoptotic cells after it has
appeared there. %%% This research is looking at changes that occur in the cell
membrane during apoptosis, programmed cell death, and the mechanisms responsible
for these changes. ***
