This project will focus on the geometry of two important classes
of&lt;br/&gt;groups: mapping class groups of surfaces; and outer automorphism
groups&lt;br/&gt;of free groups. Mapping class groups will be studied using the
tools of&lt;br/&gt;large scale geometry, with the aim of learning about quasi-
isometric&lt;br/&gt;properties of mapping class groups and proving quasi-
isometric rigidity.&lt;br/&gt;Along the way we expect to develop new tools for
understanding&lt;br/&gt;quasi-isometric properties of relatively hyperbolic
groups. Outer&lt;br/&gt;automorphism groups are not as well understood as
mapping class groups,&lt;br/&gt;and will be studied from a more foundational
point of view. The focus&lt;br/&gt;will be to develop analogies with the theory
of Teichmuller spaces which&lt;br/&gt;is a very well developed tool for studying
mapping class groups, with the&lt;br/&gt;particular aim of developing analogies
with the ending lamination&lt;br/&gt;conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric
group theory is the study of symmetry groups associated to&lt;br/&gt;highly
symmetric geometries of infinite extent, such as a crystal lattice&lt;br/&gt;in
3-dimensional space, whose symmetry group is the set of all motions
of&lt;br/&gt;space which move each point of the lattice to another point of
the&lt;br/&gt;lattice. The theory of groups was developed in the 19th century
for&lt;br/&gt;studying symmetry, and it quickly developed into a deep and
rich&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tool. Groups and geometries go hand-in-hand: every
group has&lt;br/&gt;a corresponding geometry, and one can use tools of geometry
to learn about&lt;br/&gt;the group. This project will focus on two classes of
groups which have&lt;br/&gt;assumed importance in the field of topology. Given a
surface, such as the&lt;br/&gt;surface of a doughnut with one or more holes, the
"mapping class group" of&lt;br/&gt;that surface describes all the ways in which
that surface can be mapped&lt;br/&gt;back onto itself. Similarly, the "outer
automorphism group of a free&lt;br/&gt;group" is a group that describes all of
the ways in which a finite&lt;br/&gt;1-dimensional network or graph can be
mapped back onto itself. In both&lt;br/&gt;cases, we will study geometries
associated to these groups, with the aim&lt;br/&gt;of learning more about the
groups themselves. In the case of mapping&lt;br/&gt;class groups our aim is to
prove one of the central geometric conjectures,&lt;br/&gt;known as quasi-
isometric rigidity. In the case of outer automorphism&lt;br/&gt;groups of free
groups, where the geometry is less well understood, we will&lt;br/&gt;attempt to
build new tools and make a deeper study of existing tools, in&lt;br/&gt;order to
reach a better understanding of the geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
