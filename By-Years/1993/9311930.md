9311930 Hoover In this project, Professor Hoover is building a bridge between
the analysis of causality in the philosophy of science and the practice of
macroeconomics and macroeconometrics. To build this bridge, he is taking the
constraints imposed by the nature of macroeconomics on useful causal analysis as
seriously as philosophers of science typically take the constraint imposed by
quantum mechanics. A central theme of the first part of Professor Hoover's study
is that probabilistic theories of causality, especially those that rely on
assumptions about temporal order, are not adequate for macroeconomics. In
contrast, a counterfactual analysis that stresses the importance of the
invariance of economic structures and the transmission of the effects of
interventions is more suitable. Probabilistic theories have a clear function
only within such a structural account. The second part of the study uses results
from the first part to motivate and justify methods of causal inference that are
then applied to empirical questions of causal direction in macroeconomics. The
study aims both to improve applied macroeconomics and to provide a richer and
more general philosophical analysis of causality. ***
