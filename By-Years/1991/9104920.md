There are three principal applications for data recorded by magnetic
variometers regionally or globally distributed over the Earth's suface. These
are: a) large scale regional or global induction studies of the solid earth, b)
solar-terrestrial physics studies, and c) monitoring of external transient
source fields. This grant focusses on the first application in describing a
regionalized global induction study of the solid earth. This research will
produce an animated video of two classes of transient magnetic disturbances
important to electromagnetic induction studies at periods of hours to days,
quiet time solar variations, and storm time magnetic variations.
