This award is for renewed support for the National Research Council's (NRC)
Committee on Earthquake Engineering. The committee was established in 1983 as a
standing committee at the NRC to provide a national focal point for earthquake
engineering research activities under the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
Program. The committee conducts analyses and assessments of earthquake
engineering and related activities and offers recommendations to agencies and
programs which can serve as the basis for future planning.
