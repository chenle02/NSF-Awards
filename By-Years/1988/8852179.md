This project supports a new undergraduate program in Manufacturing Systems
Engineering at this institution and the capstone course, Computer Integrated
Manufacturing (CIM). The new lab consists of several pieces of flexible
manufacturing equipment (numerically controlled machine tools, robots, automated
guided vehicles) and integrated computing equipment. The CIM laboratory is
networked to an existing Computer Aided Design System so that students
experience a complete production cycle (from product design, to manufacturing,
to assembly) in a "factory of the future" computerized environment. This award
is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
