Three or four well-documented engineering designs that have failed under
surprising circumstances will be studied. In particular, the research will focus
on identifying what (if any) characteristics or tip-offs were available during
the design process. In addition, a few well-documented engineering designs that
have not failed under surprising circumstances will be studied. The surprising
successes will be compared with the surprising failures to determine what
special features may have been designed into the surprising successes. From
these studies, generalized design principles will be created that will result in
more rational integration of constraints and an improved basis for selecting
among options.
