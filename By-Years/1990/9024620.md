This grants will help the Los Angeles Council of Black Professional Engineers
provide tutoring and mentoring activities for minority students from
disadvantaged and other backgrounds. The activities will focus heavily on
science, mathematics, and computer science. The unique part of this proposed
project is the comprehensive approach of attracting and nurturing students from
kindergarten through high school. Faculty involved in the project are minority
engineers or other scientific- oriented personnel. One exciting aspect of this
proposed program is that it is community-based and will employ all available
resources in the area to encourage a large number of minority students to
utilize the academic enrichment services of the project. Tracking and evaluation
plans will be used to monitor student progress through this comprehensive
program. Many of the approaches are novel and will help increase the
participation of minorities in science and engineering.
