Research will be carried out in experimental nuclear physics and new tools will
be developed for teaching nuclear physics at the graduate level. The central
research activity is a series of experiments designed to elucidate nuclear
structure contributions to weak interaction processes in complex systems. The
decays of unstable nuclei are driven principally by the weak interaction. The
proposed measurements are very precise in nature and will address small effects
which limit our detailed understanding of the weak interaction. Specifically,
measurements will be carried out aimed at improving the understanding of the
rare double beta decay process, of isospin symmetry breaking and the
complexities it introduces in extracting the weak interaction strength using
weak probes or hadronic probes, of possible effects of meson exchange currents
on weak interaction strengths, and of possible small scalar parts of the weak
interaction (which is predominantly vector/pseudo- vector in nature).
Integration of education and research is an equally important facet of the
proposed activity. The experiments will be carried out at the Notre Dame tandem
Van de Graaff, and at several particle accelerators in Europe. Graduate and
undergraduate students will work on all aspects of the proposed research to
broaden their research training and develop their research skills. Relating
explicitly to the teaching part of this PI's overall academic activity, a new
set of problems in nuclear physics will be developed which will provide a more
contemporary basis for teaching nuclear physics at the graduate level.
