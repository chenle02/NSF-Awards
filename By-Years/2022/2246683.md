The project aims to study the properties of limiting random fields arising from
a broad class of physical and probabilistic models, including random growing
interfaces, interacting particle systems, and polymers in random environments.
This class is called the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, and it models
many real-world phenomena, such as fire propagation, traffic flow, or disordered
polymer chains. It has been conjectured and partially proved that all models in
the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class exhibit the same limiting behaviors.
Understanding these behaviors has become an important area in probability theory
and more generally in mathematics. The awardee mentors graduate and
undergraduate students and is engaged in educational
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The height functions of models in the Kardar-
Parisi-Zhang universality class are expected to converge to a limiting space-
time fluctuation field, which is called the KPZ fixed point. Moreover, there is
a random directed metric on the space-time plane that is expected to govern all
the models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This directed metric
is called the directed landscape. While both the KPZ fixed point and the
directed landscape are central to the study of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
universality class, they have only been characterized very recently. The project
aims to study these random fields using the approach of exact formulas. The
research will first focus on finding exact formulas for the limiting fields in
certain exactly solvable models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class,
such as the directed last passage percolation; these formulas can be used to
understand probabilistic properties of the limiting fields. A second goal of
this project is to extend the approaches described above to periodic
domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
