Abstract

Award: DMS 1105813, Principal Investigator: Lev Buhovski

Rigidity in functional spaces is a relatively recent discovery in symplectic
geometry, and these projects will continue the principal investigator's study of
rigidity of Poisson brackets and other multilinear differential operators on
symplectic manifolds. An approximation problem will also be studied: Given two
smooth functions on a symplectic manifold, is it possible to approximate them by
another pair of functions whose Poisson bracket is small in the uniform norm?
Another line of investigation concerns the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms,
in the Hofer metric. The behavior of geodesics under the Hofer metric and under
perturbations of it is an example of the kinds of questions that remain open
regarding these diffeomorphisms.

Symplectic geometry is the study of the background structure for the Hamiltonian
version of classical mechanics, and the Poisson bracket referred to above is an
operation on pairs of functions that is used in mechanics to compare integrals
of motion for a mechanical system and in passing from a classical mechanical
system to a counterpart system in quantum theory. The subject has been studied
since the nineteenth century, but the introduction of new tools into symplectic
geometry from the 1980s onward has opened up many surprising phenomena,
including the rigidity property cited above, which shows that small
perturbations of the definition of a Poisson bracket operation have only small
effects on the way it acts on pairs of functions.
