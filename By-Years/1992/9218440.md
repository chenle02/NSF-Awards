The goals of this study are (1) expression of individual histone H1 variants,
(2) quantitation of their interactions with DNA of defined sequence, (3)
determination of the effects of histone binding on the conformation of DNA
utilizing CD spectroscopy, and (4) determination of the roles of various H1
domain structures in the interaction with DNA. The results of this work will
help clarify the nature of the interactions of relatively non-specific DNA-
binding proteins with DNA. These studies will provide a preliminary indication
of the nature of structure-function correlations in histone:DNA interactions.
%%% The complexity of eucariotic organisms dictates a requirement for large DNA
structures which can only be accomodated in the limited volume of the living
cell by means of interactions with proteins such as the histones which wrap the
DNA into tightly packed structures which nonetheless permit access of the cell's
biosynthetic machinery to the DNA. The studies proposed investigate the
interaction of naturally occurring variants of histone H1. The histones are
extremely difficult to purify. This study involves the novel use of pure
histones produced by molecular biological methods. The affinity of the histones
with a variety of DNA structures will be examined and to some extent the
structures of the histones and DNA in the complexes will be determined.
Comparison of the affinity of the various histone variants with DNA structures
will establish the relationship between the structures of histones and their
affinity for DNA. The interaction of histones with DNA structures is an
important subject for study because of the potential importance of DNA:histone
complexes in controlling the function, development, and maturation of living
cells.
