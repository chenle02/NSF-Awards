Performing financial transactions on a smartphone raises a number of security
concerns. How can a bank be certain that a request is authentic? How do we
prevent the same transaction to be unintentionally repeated? How can we ensure
your sensitive information cannot be copied even if a phone is lost? Strong
hardware security functions such as device fingerprints and true random number
generators are essential in addressing these questions. However, traditional
hardware security functions are difficult and expensive to build. This project
investigates using off-the-shelf Flash memory, which is already in most digital
systems today, to provide security functions like device fingerprints, random
number generators, and secure information storage. These security functions will
be extracted in a plug-and-play fashion from today's Flash without any
customized modification, enabling hardware-based security in virtually all
electronic devices. Therefore, this project will greatly enhance security and
privacy in an era where computing devices are everywhere. Also, the project will
train and educate a new generation of interdisciplinary engineers who can
understand both security and semiconductor device.

To enable the proposed security functions, this project taps into inherent
analog behaviors of Flash memory such as hidden variations, noises, aging, etc.
For example, random numbers can be generated from thermal or quantum noise in
Flash memory. The device fingerprints can be extracted from program/erase timing
variations of each memory cell, which cannot be predicted or controlled even by
the Flash memory manufacturer. Information hiding can be achieved through
selective stressing of bits to create probabilistic differences. Such hidden
information will be very difficult to copy or even detect unless a specific
secret key is known. These analog behaviors can be observed through the standard
Flash memory interface without interfering with normal memory functions.
Therefore, the proposed security functions will be broadly applicable to
electronic systems with Flash memory.
