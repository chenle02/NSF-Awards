The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a new method of treating Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS).
This technology utilizes a new type of therapeutic agent, called ?polymer lung
surfactants?. RDS is a life-threatening condition that occurs primarily in
infants who are born prematurely. The cause of RDS is the lack of chemical
compounds called lung surfactants in the infant?s lungs. Currently, the standard
treatment for RDS involves injection of animal-derived lung surfactant compounds
into the patient?s lung. However, this animal-derived treatment has major
drawbacks: (1) the harvesting process carries the risk of pathogenic
contamination; (2) these conventional lung surfactants (containing proteins
susceptible to denaturation) require sophisticated delivery procedures that can
only be practiced in locations where skilled healthcare professionals and
advanced care facilities are available. Due to these factors, RDS remains a
serious problem, particularly, in under-developed countries. These significant
drawbacks of the current methods offers a potential opportunity for the new
polymer lung surfactant technology developed here.

This I-Corps project will develop a fully synthetic material (polymers) as a
cheaper replacement for costly lipid-based formulations for treatment of
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung surfactant plays a critical role in
the lung?s ability to process air by lowering alveolar surface tension. For
potential lung surfactant applications promising candidate materials have been
identified that are capable of replicating the surface-tension-lowering
properties of natural lung surfactants. The research will advance understanding
of how certain polymers are able to produce extremely low air-water interfacial
tensions under dynamic compression (similarly to the natural lung surfactant)
and what molecular factors contribute to these behaviors.
