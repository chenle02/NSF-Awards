Sedimentary systems are a constantly shifting mosaic of sites that are more or
less risky for settling larvae. The infauna move, and the biogenically
controlled aspects of the habitat shift with their movements, movements that
occur on short temporal scales. The juveniles of many infaunal organisms
emigrate in response to such biogenic degradation of the habitat. How important
are these movements to the survivorship of the juveniles, how costly are they in
terms of growth? These are the central questions of the research proposed
herein. Without measurements of the cost and/or benefits of such movements by
juveniles, we cannot evaluate our models of recruitment in sedimentary systems.
The proposed research will provide those measurements for members of the three
dominant infaunal taxa, the bivalves, polychaetes and small crustaceans.
