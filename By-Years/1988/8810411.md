A model for the large deformation processing of thermoplastics in the solid
phase will be developed based on a viscoplastic finite element formulation in
order to take advantage of the inherent rate- dependent behavior of solid
thermoplastics during forming. An implicit time integration scheme will be used
to account for elastic effects during forming. Special attention will be paid to
the form and origin of the material descriptions. Models motivated by
microstructural considerations will be given preference with some developmental
effort expected in that area. Application of the forming model will be made to
thermoplastic forming processes for which experimental data is available in the
literature. Consideration will be given to transient problems, such as sheet
forming, and to processes which may be modeled as steady-state, such as
extrusion and cold-drawing. The ultimate product of the research should be a
predictive model with application to the design and development of processes for
the manufacturing of thermoplastics.
