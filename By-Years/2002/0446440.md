Analysis of the Autonomous Floral Induction Pathway

The initiation of flowering in plants is the major developmental switch in the
plant life cycle. Most major crops are annual plants (plants that flower, set
seed and then die), and for annuals the timing of flowering is particularly
critical. This project will focus on investigating the mechanisms that control
the timing of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis was chosen because
it has features that permit rapid progress to be made in understanding flowering
at a molecular level; in particular, it is a small plant with a relatively rapid
life cycle and the DNA sequence of its genome is available. These features
provide a model system in which to combine genetic studies with the
identification of the genes involved in flowering and the proteins they encode.
This work will provide a foundation for understanding flowering-time regulation
in other species such as crops. For example, premature flowering is a problem in
many crops in which the leaves or roots of the plant are harvested. In other
crops it is desirable to accelerate flowering. This work may provide strategies
to manipulate flowering time in desirable ways. This project will also provide
training in genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology for graduate,
undergraduate and K-12 students.
