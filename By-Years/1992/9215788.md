The wear behavior of strongly ordered intermetallic compounds which have been
modified by introduction of a ductile phase will be studied. The effects of
volume fraction, size and spacing of the ductile phase on the deformation
mechanisms and wear resistance of Ni-Al-Fe and Ni-Si systems will be studied.
Wear behavior will be compared with fracture toughness data obtained at several
different rates of loading and evaluated in terms of deformation mechanisms. The
effects of environment will be evaluated also to assess the extent of oxidative
wear.
