Abstract SOIFER, B. T. AST-9618686 Funds will be used to construct a near-
infrared integral field spectrograph to be used on the 200-inch telescope of the
Palomar Observatory. The instrument will permit unique and detailed studies of a
wide variety of astrophysical environments such as star forming regions, the
Galactic center, starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, ultraluminous infrared
galaxies, and high redshift radio galaxies. The imaging spectrograph will
provide simultaneous two- dimensional spatial information and spectral
information over a field of view of 5" x 10". Slit widths will be ~ 0.7",
delivering a resolution, R = 1500, corresponding to a velocity full width at
half maximum of unresolved spectral lines measuring ~ 200 km/sec. Velocity
centroids of high signal-to-noise spectral features will be measurable to &lt;
20 km/sec. An innovative component of the instrument is a simple design for the
construction of the image-slicing front end and the use of two slits to double
the field of view above that of a spectrograph with a single slit. The
instrument will be patterned closely after a recently constructed longslit near-
infrared spectrograph. An existing infrared camera will be used as the detector
for the instrument.
