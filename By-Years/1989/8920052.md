Professor El-Sayed is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
in a continued investigation of gas phase photodissociation processes. The
current work emphasizes time-resolved kinetic energy release following one-
photon absorption in rapid, nonstatistical photodissociation of prototype
systems involving the carbon-iodine bond. Initial experiments involve a one-
dimensional projection technique, time-delayed pulsed-extraction mass
spectrometry, to determine kinetic energy profiles in rapid one-photon
photodissociation. Additional work will include the use of femtosecond pump-
probe laser techniques to measure the correlation between the fragment
appearance times and their resulting kinetic energies.
