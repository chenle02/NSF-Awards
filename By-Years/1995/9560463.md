This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address in-
situ forming of environmentally protective coatings over engineering material
surfaces subject to degradation. Most failures of large scale engineering
systems result from the progressive environmental degradation of metallic
components over time. Due to operational and cost constraints, timely repair or
restoration is not feasible, and premature failures of these systems result in
loss of productivity and wasted materials. Phase I will develop a low cost
thermal process for engineering materials to combat corrosion-related problems.
Material designs and processing criteria will be examined in dry and wet
conditions in order to evaluate resultant coatings for high-temperature
oxidative and hydrogen environment applications. Phase I will demonstrate basic
concepts for material compatibility and key process parameters that could lead
to desired coating quality and resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Phase II
would proceed to process and material optimization. If successful, this process
will provide a significant cost reduction for restoration or modification of
engineering material surfaces leading to an extension of the usefulness or life
of manufactured systems. The process is specifically adaptable to on-site
surfaces that are inaccessible to conventional surface treatments, such as
plating, laser cladding, or plasma spraying. It would also be commercially
useful in forming durable surface layers since a genuine alloying of the
electrode material to substrate occurs.
