This award provides support for the ninth meeting in the February Fourier Talks
(FFT) series. The 2014 FFT will be held at the University of Maryland, College
Park. The FFT is a high-level forum for harmonic analysts to bring their work to
scientists from industry and government agencies. In addition, it allows experts
in applied and pure harmonic analysis to become familiar with the latest
problems in need of mathematical formulation and solution. Finally, it
introduces young mathematicians and scientists to applied and pure harmonic
analysis. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts,
registration information, and an archive of past conferences, can be found at
the conference webpage: www.fft2014.org.

The February Fourier Talks directly encourage dialogue and collaboration between
mathematicians and scientists working in industry and government. The structure
of the conference consists of three main lectures, 30 minute invited talks, and
a poster session that showcases the work of students (both undergraduate and
graduate) as well as postdocs. The conference encourages and financially
supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of
groups underrepresented in mathematics.
