A massively parallel computing system which will be dedicated to support
research in computer science will be purchased. The equipment will be used for
several research projects including in particular: Signal processing and data
analysis employing fast Fourier transform algorithms for non-abelian groups and
homogeneous spaces and wavelet and other phase space techniques. Experimentation
with parallel implementation is an important new direction for this work.
Applications in medical imaging are emerging from this effort. Building a
prototype checkpointing system for multiprocessor file systems on massively
parallel computers, with follow-on-research in interfaces, caching and
prefetching, workload studies, and remote heterogeneous file system access.
Development of virtual memory for data-parallel computing with applications in
scientific computing. Applications in image processing involving ongoing
projects in human brain labeling, fossil leaf classification, handwriting
analysis, and simulation of visual attention. Implementation of PRAM algorithms
aimed at elimination of concurrent references to memory in implementations on a
massively parallel synchronous computer, using techniques taken from work of the
current researchers in new algorithms for the PRAM model.
