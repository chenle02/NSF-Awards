This award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program of
the Division of Chemistry, supports the research of Prof. Barbara Wyslouzil and
her students at The Ohio State University. The overarching goal of the proposed
research is to explore the physics of freezing including the limits to which
liquids can be supercooled, the transformation kinetics and the structure of the
emerging solid phase. This research integrates experimental and molecular
modeling. The specific experimental objectives include: 1) measurement of
liquid-solid nucleation rates as nanodroplets freeze, 2) the exploration of the
role of molecular structure on the relative importance of the surface versus
bulk freezing and 3) the development to x-ray scattering techniques to follow
the transformations in situ. Molecular modeling is used to understand the
driving force for the surface freezing in chain-like molecules and to calculate
liquid-solid nucleation rates to compare directly to the measured values.
Freezing, or crystallization from the melt, is a fundamental physical process
that plays a central role in a broad range of industrial and natural processes.
Developing a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, measuring phase transition
rates and exploring the role free surfaces play in freezing are all crucial for
developing accurate models of industrial processes, atmospheric chemistry and
global climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a broader context, this work develops
novel applications of small angle scattering, aerosol spectroscopy, and
molecular modeling techniques that address fundamental problems in aerosol
science. The results stemming from this work are of interest to researchers in
nucleation, polymer physics, materials science, and aerosol and cloud physics.
The program provides a rich and varied research environment for students, from
high school to graduate level that is highly interdisciplinary.
