The 57th Maize Genetics Conference (MGC) will be held at the Pheasant Run
Resort, St. Charles, IL on March 12-15, 2015. This conference is not only an
exciting scientific meeting but provides outstanding opportunities for graduate
students and postdoctoral scientists to interact with outstanding scientists
within and outside the maize community. The meeting actively emphasizes and
supports the training of students and postdocs in developing their communication
and interpersonal skills. The conference is unique in that it attempts to
support the hotel and meal costs of all student attendees. Detailed efforts are
planned to broaden the participation of women and members of groups under-
represented in the sciences. The funding provided by NSF will broaden
participation and help defray the costs of participation of students from the
U.S. scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maize Genetics Conference
assembles scientists from industry and academia to discuss the latest research
developments on many areas encompassing maize genetics. The 2015 conference will
feature four plenary speakers: Drs. Xuemei Chen (University of California-
Riverside), Dirk Inze (Ghent University, Belgium), Shawn Kaeppler (University of
Wisconsin-Madison, and Paula McSteen (University of Missouri). The core program
will include approximately 35 18-minute talks by speakers selected from
submitted abstracts, and two poster sessions. In addition, there will be a
plenary session to award the 2nd Barbara McClintock Prize for Plant Genetics and
Genome Studies to recognize one of the most outstanding plant geneticists of the
present era. In response to rapid developments in targeted endonuclease
technologies, there will also be a special session on genome editing in maize
using CRISPR/Cas-9 technologies.
