This project is to improve understanding of the fundamental details for the
reaction forming ozone from a combination of molecular oxygen and atomic oxygen
and how it effects the distribution of heavy isotopes of oxygen (17O and 18O).
The rate and distribution of products in this reaction impact ozone's chemistry,
production, lifetime and loss in the atmosphere, and the effect ozone has on
global climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will calculate the
influence of the Coriolis effect on energies and lifetimes of symmetric and
asymmetric ozone molecules and to predict the energies of quantized rotational
vibrational states in symmetric and asymmetric ozone molecules. Finally, this
theory will be applied to isotope effects in other similar molecules. These
calculations and insight into the isotopic distribution or the mass-independent
fractionation (MIF) will be used to understand chemical processes occurring in
the ancient atmosphere on Earth and other planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
