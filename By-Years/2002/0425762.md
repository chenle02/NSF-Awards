Arnold&lt;br/&gt;0425762&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this research is
to implement and validate a novel approach towards quantitative functional
genomics, referred to as the computing life paradigm, which integrates state-of-
the-art experimental probes of the time-dependent intra-cellular kinetics with a
recently proposed ensemble-based kinetics modeling technique. Its starting point
are quantitative RNA and protein profiling experiments to monitor the cell's
responses to controlled external perturbations such as gene knock-outs, protein
inhibition and various time-dependent schedules of external food sources and
starvation. The ensemble modeling technique then utilizes such time-dependent
experimental data to not only constrain the topology and the parameter space of
the genetic network model(s) under study; but also to make quantitative
predictions and, most importantly, to provide quantitative criteria for the
rational design of a "maximally informative next experiment". The full
implementation of the computing life paradigm thus results in a workflow cycle
wherein rationally designed new experiments further constrain the "ensemble of
models" while the model ensemble becomes more and more refined and
discriminating in its predictive capabilities. The initial applications of this
approach will focus on two previously well explored genetic model systems in
fungal organisms, specifically in Neurospora crassa, exhibiting widely different
dynamical behavior: the quinic acid (qa) gene cluster, involved in transient
responses of the cell's carbon metabolism; and the biological clock, the proto-
type of an oscillatory system.&lt;br/&gt;
