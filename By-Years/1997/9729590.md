9729590 Chappell Plant isoprenoids comprise a structurally diverse group of
compounds; some are essential for plant growth and development and others are
important mediators of plant-environment interactions. For example, when
attenuated pathogens are added to solanaceous plant cell cultures, the cultures
cease sterol production (essential metabolite), and instead synthesize and
secrete antibiotic sesquiterpenes. The decline in sterol biosynthesis has been
correlated with the suppression of one key enzyme (squalene synthase), and the
induction of sesquiterpene biosynthesis with the induction of another key enzyme
(sesquiterpene cyclase). The PI's long range goal is to understand how this
control is imposed onto these two key enzymes. The current objectives are to
evaluate how two particular signal molecules might orchestrate this regulation,
and to examine how several molecular mechanisms might contribute to the
regulation of squalene synthase and sterol metabolism. These studies should
provide important insights into how this pathway can be manipulated for enhanced
value using genetic engineering technology.
