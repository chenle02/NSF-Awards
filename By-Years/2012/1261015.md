The International Research Experiences for Students program trains twelve
students to conduct research on climate change in Australia, in collaboration
with the CSIRO Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre in the Northern Territory of
Australia. Undergraduate and graduate students are conducting climate change
research under the mentorship of CSIRO scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigations conducted by the CSUDH-CSIRO collaboration use the living
laboratory of the Northern Territory to test hypotheses on the relationships
among fire frequency, fire intensity, climate change, and biodiversity.
Investigations are evaluating how management regimes affect rates of carbon
sequestration, changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Projects may be
conducted at multiple sites throughout the Northern Territory, including the
Kimberley, Tiwi Islands, western Arnhem land, and in the Darwin region,
including the Territory Wildlife Park.&lt;br/&gt;This project provides long-term
immersive research experiences in an international setting that are designed to
recruited talented students into graduate study emphasizing climate science, and
commence the interest and ability to maintain and develop international
collaborations. Most students will be members of groups underrepresented in the
sciences, reflecting the student population at CSUDH.
