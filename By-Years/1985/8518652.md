A series of innovative techniques has been developed to study microcrystalline
materials and the changes that occur during and after exposure to the reactive
environments and temperatures of interest in catalysis. This research has been
relevant to petrochemical processing and pollution abatement. This research plan
will extend research methods to possible microelectronic applications.
