Wilkinson will continue to extend her previous work toward an
understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the dynamics of partially hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, with her collaborators, Wilkinson
proposes to address&lt;br/&gt;the issue of density of stable ergodicity in the
space of partially &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, and the existence of
Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures &lt;br/&gt;for these diffeomorphisms. Wilkinson will
also study the dependence &lt;br/&gt;on smooth parameter of invariant structures
for partially hyperbolic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diffeomorphism is a way
of smoothly rearranging the points&lt;br/&gt;in a space. A diffeomorphism is a
natural object, arising, for&lt;br/&gt;example, in the study of planetary
motion. By applying a &lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphism repeatedly, one obtains a
dynamical system; each iteration&lt;br/&gt;corresponds to a unit of time in the
evolution of the system. For any &lt;br/&gt;given space, there are infinitely
many diffeomorphisms, with widely&lt;br/&gt;varying dynamical behaviors; a goal
of dynamics is to arrange &lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms into classes whose
dynamical behavior can be understood.&lt;br/&gt;One class of diffeomorphisms
whose dynamics are now well-understood&lt;br/&gt;are Smale's Axiom A, or
hyperbolic, diffeomorphisms, which &lt;br/&gt;are chaotic: among other things,
they display sensitive&lt;br/&gt;dependence on initial conditions. This project
aims to better&lt;br/&gt;understand the behavior of another important class of
diffeomorphisms,&lt;br/&gt;called partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.
Partially hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms have many of the features of
Axiom A systems,&lt;br/&gt;but their dynamical behavior is yet to be completely
understood.&lt;br/&gt;
