The Department of Chemistry is purchasing thermochemical equipment to update,
broaden, and improve the thermochemical emphasis of its physical chemistry
laboratory. Students perform experiments involving the observation and
measurement of critical temperature and pressure, fusion points and heats of
fusion, phase diagrams, polymer phase transitions, and heats of reactions. These
experiments are designed to improve student understanding of thermochemical
processes by modernizing existing equipment and including student operated
computer data collection and analysis. This approach lays the foundation for
further Physical Chemistry based research and coursework, and prepares students
for the technical approach to chemical observation and analysis prevalent in
contemporary science.
