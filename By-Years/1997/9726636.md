This award supports Dr. Peter Winkler and a graduate student from the
University of Nevada-Reno to collaborate with L .S. Cederbaum of the Department
of Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Heidelberg. The collaboration will
develop propagator theory for atomic and molecular structure calculations as
well as for scattering problems. The research focuses on atomic calculations
with a novel multi-channel propagator approach. The research is likely to lead
to many interesting applications of the new formalism to the study of atomic
processes in various environments. Working with the German group will give Dr.
Winkler's group access to a considerable reservoir of knowledge and
computational expertise.
