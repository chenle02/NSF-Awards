An electron calorimeter will be constructed for use in a new generation
measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The detector will be used in
conjunction with a large muon storage ring being built at Brookhaven National
Laboratory, where the experiment will be conducted. A twenty- fold increase in
sensitivity over previous measurements is anticipated, providing improved
understanding of electroweak renormalization effects and muon substructure to an
equivalent mass of several teV.
