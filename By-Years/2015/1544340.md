This workshop builds upon the success of the 2014 CC-NIE Campus
Cyberinfrastructure Workshop, providing an opportunity for NSF Campus
Cyberinfrastructure award recipients to meet in-person, exchange project
findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate
across project areas and project regions. The proposed workshop will be co-
located with two other community meetings, the ESnet Site Coordinators Committee
(ESCC) meeting and The Quilt Fall Member meeting. The workshop will promote
dialogue across a range of important and timely topics in campus networking
including the larger context of campus cyberinfrastructure. Joint programming
with the Quilt and ESCC on Day 2 of the workshop will provide an opportunity to
develop stronger ties between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven
applications and regional networks as technical and cyberinfrastructure
resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the
exchange project findings, interaction between national cyberinfrastructure
experts, collaboration across project areas and project regions that will lead
to new ideas, relationships and collaborations associated with an in person
workshop. The broader impact includes the dissemination of workshop information,
including the workshop presentations along with a final workshop report to
Campus Cyberinfrastructure award participants as well as to the campus and
research community in general.
