9320445 Emanuel It is increasingly apparent that many facets of the tropical
climate are sensitive to cloud microphysics. Microphysical processes acting
within cumulus clouds strongly control the water vapor content of the
surrounding atmosphere and so modulate atmospheric temperatures. Cloud
microphysical processes also influence the distribution and properties of
stratiform clouds in the tropics and elsewhere. These same processes affect the
dynamics of large-scale flows in convecting atmospheres. The cloud
parameterization schemes used in large-scale and climate models are woefully
inadequate and the representation of microphysical processes, or lack thereof,
may be responsible in large part for this deficiency. The principal investigator
intends to test the sensitivity of climate models to the convective
parameterizations, using the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM2). He will
compare the results of simulations done with different parameterizations and
further test them against atmospheric observations. This project will contribute
to the goals of the Role of Clouds, Energy, and Water in Global Climate Change
effort. ***
