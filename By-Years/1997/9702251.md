This project will have two primary objectives: (1) to continue to extend the
development and understanding of more advanced reinforcement learning schemes,
which have demonstrated the ability to handle larger-scale problems and to mimic
aspects of learning in the brain more than the conventional reinforcement
learning schemes; (2) to apply advanced reinforcement learning to the
development of more powerful intelligent agents for the Internet--and to use
this application as a stimulus to the development of more powerful designs. For
example, existing search engines for the Web are an extremely important class of
agent, but also very limited in their capability because they tend to rely on
simple string-mating techniques, occasionally supplemented by -and+ and -or+
operators and limited types of user-supplied clues. This work will explore a
novel approach to this problem, based on a distributed system of intelligent
agents which focus on different domains but learn to understand each other, in
effects. If this approach is successful, it could have further implications well
beyond the need for better search as such Ultimately it could contribute to the
vision of converting the Internet itself into one large distributed intelligent
system. This project will also include a substantial effort to apply these
emerging tools in education, and the development of new courses related to this
work.
