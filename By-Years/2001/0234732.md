A grant has been awarded to Dr. Joan Slonczewski of Kenyon College to study acid
and base stress in the bacterium, Escherichia coli, and to train undergraduate
students in microbiological research. Bacteria make different proteins to help
them survive extreme changes in pH, both in natural environments and within the
human body. For this project (a continuation of MCB-9982437), a model of pH-
regulated proteins has been developed. This model predicts that growth in acid
leads E. coli to convert its food into alkaline fermentation products, and vice-
versa. This model will be tested using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to
observe induction of metabolic enzymes that lead to different end products,
which will, in turn, be identified by using high-performance liquid
chromatography. In addition, the effects of various acidic and alkaline end
products on bacterial metabolism will be studied.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Acid and
base regulation are important for bacteria to survive in soil and aquatic
environments, as well as in the human intestine. E. coli is particularly
interesting as a model organism whose genome has been sequenced, and as a
"neutralophile," a species that can grow in either acid or base. Many mechanisms
of food preservation, such as the use of weak acids benzoate and sorbate, depend
on pH; yet increasingly food-borne pathogens are acid resistant. Revealing the
mechanisms of response to pH change will help us to better understand its
environmental effects, as well as the role of pH in food quality and
preservation. Furthermore, understanding of pH and metabolism in bacterial
cultures will contribute to biotechnology by helping improve growth conditions
for bacterial production. Kenyon College emphasizes undergraduate education, and
students will be involved in every aspect of this project as they are trained to
perform research experiments in microbiology. Several undergraduates have
already been attracted to work on the project, and they are encouraged to pursue
careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;
