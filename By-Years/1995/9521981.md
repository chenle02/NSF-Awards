ABSTRACT CTS-9521981 It is proposed to provide partial travel support to a group
of academic researchers to participate and present papers at the conference
entitled "Frontiers in Industrial Process Tompography", to be held 10/30 to
11/38/1995 in San Louis Obis, CA. About 60 papers andsix invited lectures from
several countries will be presented. The meeting is a timely forum for the
latest scientific and technological development in process tomography, an
emerging field of research. Application of Process Tomgraphy plays a critical
role in process design and control in chemical, agricultural, pharmaceutical,
mineral processing, energy, and environmental industries. The conference aims to
disseminate new findings and to identify future direction of research. The
meeting is co-sponsored by industry and Engineering Foundation. ***
