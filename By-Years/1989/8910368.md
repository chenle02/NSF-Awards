This Research Initiataion Award is for theoretical investigation of
generalization in artificial neural networks. Dr. Munro will study the effects
of parameter variations, including use of a new "squashing function," on
internal representations learned by simple multilayer networks. Advances in
technique or understanding will then be tested on large-scale problems that have
been reported in the literature.
