9318181 Gombosi This highly interdisciplinary effort is to develop tools for
modeling nonequilibrium fluids and plasmas using adaptively refined grids on
parallel supercomputers. The development of parallel adaptive-grid methodology,
including effective strategies for load balancing and efficient utilization of
high-performance microprocessors, will have a major impact on the solution of
problems in all areas of fluid and plasma physics. Specific examples include
geospace environment modeling, high-altitude aerodynamics, atmospheric science,
nonlinear systems generally and advanced propulsion systems. The first
application of this model development will be the development of a global
magnetospheric model which will be made available to the magnetospheric physics
community. This model will use high-order moments of the Boltzman equation with
solutions on a 3D adaptively-refined, unstructured mesh which will allow
multiple scale analyses, including sub-grid- size kinetic effects. ***
