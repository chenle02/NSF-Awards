This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides support for the work of Dr. Steven
Zimmerman, University of Illinois. This work is focused on two areas of
mechanistic bioorganic chemistry: (1) the molecular recognition of DNA and (2)
biomimetic chemistry. Molecular recognition of DNA will allow probes to be
developed which selectively bind to DNA. These subsequently will provide the
means for changing the properties of DNA so subtle alterations in its design can
be made. Biomimetic studies will allow a better understanding of the various
aspects of enzymatic catalysis. More specifically, molecular "tweezers" are
being prepared which are expected to bind exclusively at the end of DNA helices
or at structural abnormalities such as the proposed beta-kink site. In addition,
major groove intercalators are being investigated. Biomimetic studies have
produced a stereoelectronically correct charge relay model for chymotrypsin
which is currently being studied in detail.
