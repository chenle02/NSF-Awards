According to the 2015 Women in Manufacturing Study, women comprise 47% of the
total United States labor force, but hold only 27% of manufacturing jobs. The
Skills Gap in US Manufacturing estimates that six of every ten manufacturing
jobs are unfilled because of a shortage of qualified applicants. One approach to
increasing the labor pool for the critical manufacturing sector of the US
economy may be to recruit more women into the field. This project aims to
achieve this goal by implementing model practices to recruit and retain
underrepresented groups, particularly females, in manufacturing education
programs and employment. It will implement an apprenticeship-style training
model, with the expectation that this experience will increase entry and
retention of women in manufacturing jobs. Project findings may inform other STEM
areas in which females and other groups are also underrepresented. The project
may serve as a guide for evaluating project effectiveness in increasing
participation of females and other underrepresented groups in manufacturing
education and careers.

Owensboro Community and Technical College proposes to increase the number of
underrepresented groups, particularly females, in manufacturing training
programs and careers in the greater Owensboro region of western Kentucky. The
primary audience will be underrepresented groups, particularly females, already
employed in production positions. The project includes the following goals: 1)
Expand current program offerings to provide manufacturing training to female
students and other underrepresented groups; 2) Implement proven retention
strategies to ensure students are successful (intensive advising, an early
orientation program, instruction and mentoring from a manufacturing faculty with
experience working with females and underrepresented groups, and facilitated
discussions); 3) Incorporate proven techniques to recruit underrepresented
groups, particularly females, in non-traditional fields (ambassadors/mentors,
underrepresented groups depicted in marketing activities, and information
sessions); 4) Host facilitated discussions with experts to create dialogue
between schools, colleges, and employers that promote increased awareness,
perceptions, and communication leading to greater gender diversity in the
manufacturing industry.
