This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on the
development of highly stable and sensitive metal oxide semiconductor sensors for
high-temperature applications. Currently available semiconductor sensors are
typically restricted to the 200 C to 500 C range in order to have adequate
response times and the necessary selectivity. In order to operate in the 600 C
to 900 C range, stability of the porous sensing materials has to be enhanced in
order to have a fast responding, sensitive sensor. In the project, the unique
nanocomposite sensor materials will be developed first, followed by preparation
of the substrate with high temperature electrodes, on to which the sensor film
is deposited and then evaluated for sensitivity, response time and stability.
The sensors to be developed will be applicable to high temperature engine
control and monitoring, combustion system control for fossil-fueled power plants
and incinerators, and monitoring of product gases from chemical process
reactors.
