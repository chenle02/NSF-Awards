Lehigh University hosts a summer research program for students completing the
sophomore or junior year of an undergraduate physics or related major. Fifteen
to twenty students recruited nationwide work for ten weeks each summer under the
guidance of faculty members in the Department of Physics. The program includes
research projects mentored by Physics faculty members, weekly seminars and lab
tours, an end-of-the-summer symposium, and various social functions involving
faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Housing in dormitories
on campus is provided without charge to the students; this arrangement greatly
enhances both the academic and social experiences of the participants.

The student research projects reflect the specialties of the faculty, which
include astrophysics, experimental and theoretical atomic and molecular physics,
biophysics, studies of complex fluids, laser produced plasmas, theoretical
plasma physics related to the fusion program, photonics and nonlinear optics,
experimental and theoretical solid state physics, and statistical physics. More
information about research activities can be found on the Department website
<http://www.physics.lehigh.edu>. The participating students gain research
experience at a critical point in their undergraduate careers, as well as an
excellent preview of graduate school. Over the past 15 years, more than 70% of
program participants have gone on to graduate studies in science and
engineering, while most of the remaining students have pursued careers in
science and technology.
