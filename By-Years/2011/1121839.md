Transcription factors are responsible for the development of organisms by
regulating the activity of the genome. Understanding how transcription factors
control the development of the mammalian brain is complicated by the sheer
number of distinct transcription factors that operate in cells as well as the
intricacy of the organization of the brain. The cerebellum is in the lower part
of the brain, and it plays a role in brain functions such as motor control,
language, and emotions. While the organization of the cerebellum is complicated,
it consists of a fairly simple structural plan suggesting the possibility of
actually deciphering how its morphology is specified by the
genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how the pro-neural
transcription factor neurogenin1 (Neurog1) controls the development of the
cerebellum in mice. The project uses transgenic mice technologies to label or
delete Neurog1 activity. Conventional and conditional gene deletion strategies
will be used to study Neurog1 during pre- and postnatal development. Loss of
Neurog1 function effects on cerebellar anatomy and motor behaviors controlled by
this part of the brain will be determined. The development of a conditional gene
knockout approach will permit behavioral studies unattainable in existing
conventional knockout mice that die at birth. It will also generate a valuable
mouse resource for distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance
our understanding of how genetic determination programs are linked to adult
motor behaviors in mice. Neurogenins are highly conserved and broadly expressed
in the nervous system and knowledge generated by this project will be of
considerable value to the neuroscience community. The broader impacts of this
project will be to provide fellowship support and research training to a
postgraduate student in the Universitys Graduate Program in Neuroscience and
internships for three local high school students.
