The current interest in interdisciplinary studies recognizes the value of
tearing down some of the walls between disciplines in order to address the
problems students face in making connections between disciplines, recognizing
commonalities and distinctions in ways of thinking and knowing, and transferring
what they learn in one context to another context. The greatest impediments
which prevent faculty from teaching in an interdisciplinary context are not
knowing what to do and not feeling comfortable teaching out of field. The
Mathematical Association of America (MAA) seeks support for seven intensive six
day workshops over three summers (1998, 1999, and 2000) serving over 100 faculty
teams (some 210 faculty) from mathematics and partner disciplines. Each of the
seven workshops will focus on the interdisciplinary curriculum materials
combining mathematics and a partner discipline. For example, one workshop will
focus on mathematics and biology and another on mathematics and economics. A
participating institution will send a team of faculty from each of the
disciplines being studied. The team will study and work together on
interdisciplinary materials and develop materials to use at their home
institution. Each team member will study in both of the workshop subject
disciplines, be introduced to interdisciplinary materials in those disciplines
developed at one or more of the Mathematics Sciences and Their Applications
Throughout the Curriculum (MSATC) projects, and develop new materials under the
guidance of experienced interdisciplinary teams from the MSATC projects. Each
workshop will be led by an interdisciplinary team of faculty from one of the
MSATC projects with an additional stimulus - a keynoter from the partner
discipline. Teams will be chosen based upon a commitment to introduce
interdisciplinary materials and teaching at their home institutions. A balance
will be sought to reflect different types of institutions and the populations
they serve.
