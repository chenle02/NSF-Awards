Mark Ratner at the Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, is
supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to
organize a one day symposium in honor of John Pople from Northwestern. This
symposium is also supported by a grant from the Northwestern University Alumnae
Association. It will be held at Northwestern on Thursday, May 11 and will have
lectures by seven very distinguished senior theorists. For this symposium, it is
intended to bring together senior people with enthusiastic and talented young
scientists. The symposium will be followed by the Midwest Theoretical Chemistry
Conference which will take place at Northwestern on May 12 and 13.
