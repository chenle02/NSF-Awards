The investigator proposes to track deaf children's school, college, and
employment success over time by applying profiles of success to both the college
admission and career training process at the National Technical Institute for
the Deaf, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and other institutions. The
researcher would conduct secondary analysis of available data sets to examine
math and reading achievement, to specify the success of deaf children in their
transition from school to work, and to identify a profile of career success for
recent deaf alumni. The study will contribute to existing knowledge by analyzing
existing national survey studies of labor force behavior and a new longitudinal
studies of deaf students from New York State that would be collected during the
5-year CAREER project by the investigator. The results of the research will be
adopted in courses the investigator teachers in secondary deaf education
teacher-training programs at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The study
has implications for instruction of deaf children.
