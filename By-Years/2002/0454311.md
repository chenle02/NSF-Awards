This award supports the development of a new shortwave radiation
parameterization for the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) sea ice
component. The parameterization will be designed to increase the accuracy,
consistency, and generality of the treatment of shortwave radiation and its
interactions with snow and sea ice. The new parameterization will use a two-
stream radiative transfer model that explicitly accounts for multiple scattering
and employs physically realistic inherent optical properties for snow and sea
ice. This approach is simple, efficient, and consistent with the treatment of
shortwave radiation in the atmospheric component of CCSM.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: It is anticipated that this
parameterization will result in improvements in CCSM sea ice model simulations
and will increase climate scientists' ability to quantitatively assess the ice-
albedo feedback mechanism in climate. Such improvements have the potential to
substantially enhance the applicability of the CCSM model and the science
related to climate and climate change. This research also has the potential to
produce improved scientific information relevant to better-informed
environmental policy decisions related to climate change.
