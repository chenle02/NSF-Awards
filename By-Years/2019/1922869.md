This award provides support for 15 U.S.-based students to attend The Web
Conference 2019, held in San Francisco, California, from May 13-17, 2019. The
students will attend the conference to present their own work, to get the
opportunity to learn and discuss current research topics with leaders in the
field, as well as to further their career through the numerous additional events
and networking opportunities provided by the conference. Events at the
conference include Research track sessions, Demonstration sessions, Workshops,
Tutorials, Exhibition sessions, as well as events specifically geared towards
students, including a PhD Symposium. As part of The Web Conference's wider
effort to champion diversity, a particular emphasis is on the inclusion of
underrepresented minority students, women, and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Web Conference (formerly known as the WWW
conference) is the premier international conference on the topic of the future
directions of the World Wide Web. The conference series began in 1994 at CERN,
when it was organized by the Web's co-creator Robert Cailliau. The conference
brings together researchers, developers, users, as well as commercial ventures,
and provides an open forum in which all opinions can be presented, subject to a
strict process of peer review. The location of the conference rotates among
North America, Europe, and Asia, and 2019 will mark the first time in almost ten
years that it is organized in the US. Also, the 2019 edition of the conference
will be a reflection point, as it will acknowledge the 30th anniversary of the
Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
