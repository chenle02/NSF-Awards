This project will combine spin-polarized tunneling methods with some of the
techniques of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in an ultra high vacuum
environment. The techniques will be applied to probe the surface magnetism of
superconducting and magnetic materials. The research will include low
temperature studies of spin-orbit and magnetic scattering in superconductors,
magnetic impurities in normal metals, and tunneling measurements with oriented
single-crystal ferromagnets. Part of the project will involve continued
development of superconducting and ferromagnetic tips crucial to operation of
STM and spin polarized tunneling SSTM apparatus. Ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
tunneling measurements will be made at temperatures up to 300 K with various
materials and modulation techniques. The STM techniques will initially be used
to position the tunneling tip at a proper site within tunneling distance. Later
the limits of spatial resolution will be investigated in the study of individual
impurities or antiferromagnets. These results will be compared with theory. It
is expected that this study will give information leading to eventual design of
a spin-sensitive tunneling microscope with close to atomic resolution.
