NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0204455 Mathematical Sciences: Emphasis Year: Nonlinear
Partial Differential Equations and Their Applications

Abstract

0204455 Chen



This award supports participants in a workshop, held in Fall 2002, and an
international conference, held in Spring 2003, at Northwestern University. The
meetings, part of an emphasis year on nonlinear partial differential equations
and applications, will bring together a diverse group of applied mathematicians
and analysts who are able to explore connections between their fields.
Discussion will be devoted to the development of new connections between
nonlinear partial differential equations and such diverse areas as fluid
dynamics, kinetic theory, free boundary problems, phase transition phenomena,
biophysics, and modeling and computation, as well as nonlinear analysis,
approximation theory, geometric measure theory, and harmonic analysis. The
interdisciplinary meetings will provide excellent opportunities for
communication and collaboration between senior and junior researchers.
