These studies will elucidate molecules and mechanisms involved in directional
growth of axons. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies will be raised and
employed to identify antigens expressed in the chick neural retina that play a
functional role in retinal axonal growth and directionality. Transplantation
experiments in vivo and in organ culture will be performed to study the role of
chemotropic mechanisms in orientation of retinal ganglion axons. These studies
promise to provide fundamental information on the molecular mechanisms involved
in axonal growth in development, as well as in regeneration.
