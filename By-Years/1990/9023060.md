By channeling the energy flux from the energy-containing motion below the
photosphere to the solar atmosphere, magnetic fields play an important role in
the energetics of the chromosphere and of the corona. The mechanical energy
which must be supplied at the higher altitudes may have its origin in quasi-
steady magnetic fields relaxing themselves via microflares, and/or in waves
propogating in the magnetized plasma. Most of the magnetic flux emerges from the
sun in high intensity flux tubes. Near the surface of the sun, the flux tubes
expand as they reach the solar atmosphere. Previous studies have shown that this
expansion strongly affects the equilibrium structure and the observed emission
measure. The propagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves is also affected by
the expansion. A numerical study of these processes in multidimensional geometry
will bring a better understanding of the coupling between the photosphere and
solar atmosphere, such as e.g., estimates of wave energy output. It is planned
to use a previously developed magnetohydrodynamic numerical code with
curvilinear coordinates adaptable to the geometrical complexity of the magnetic
field and to the strong density stratification. The focus of this study is on
the effects of magnetic structures on MHD wave excitation and transfer in the
solar atmosphere. These multidimensional results will be compared with the
previous one-dimensional estimates as well as with the mechanical energy
requirements given by transport models.
