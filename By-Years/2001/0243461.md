0243461&lt;br/&gt;Burkholder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project requests funding
support for the Student Paper Competitions at the 2003 IEEE AP-S International
Symposium and USNC/URSI North American Radio Science Meeting, to be held in
Columbus, Ohio on June 22 to 27, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A requested sum of
$6,000 provides a travel subsidy averaging $750 per person to 8 top applicants
in the IEEE AP-S Student Paper Competition. The IEEE AP-S provides financial
support of various forms including assistance in finding low-cost housing, but
does not reimburse travel expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without financial
assistance many young scientists and engineers selected to participate in these
student paper competitions will not be able to attend the conference. The PI
believes it is important that these most talented new researchers be present
with fresh and innovative ideas to discuss their work with those who have more
experience. &lt;br/&gt;
