Next generation wireless networks will focus on the open &lt;br/&gt;wireless
architecture platform. In such a network, heterogeneous &lt;br/&gt;wireless
systems will be integrated to provide reliable, &lt;br/&gt;high-bandwidth, on-
demand services with performance guarantees &lt;br/&gt;to a variety of users
with di®erent tra±c characteristics, &lt;br/&gt;security requirement, and
hardware capabilities. This SGER &lt;br/&gt;project is exploring three key
issues in the resource management &lt;br/&gt;of such systems. First, utility-
based model is investigated to&lt;br/&gt;deal with access selection and vertical
handover decisions in &lt;br/&gt;which policies governing the network operations
are embodied &lt;br/&gt;in the design of marginal utility functions. Second, a
&lt;br/&gt;utility-based QoS enabling scheduling model is developed in
&lt;br/&gt;which the utility at a given moment can re°ect the received
&lt;br/&gt;productivity of the system in the long term run and scheduling
&lt;br/&gt;decisions to deal with multiple QoS parameters are made using
&lt;br/&gt;reinforcement learning. Third, an integrated model that
measures&lt;br/&gt;security overheads experienced by security-critical tasks and
is &lt;br/&gt;applicable to the security-aware admission control is developed.
&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on the development of solutions
&lt;br/&gt;that are critical for next generation wireless and mobile
&lt;br/&gt;communication networking systems. Written reports of research
&lt;br/&gt;findings will be disseminated through academic
publications.&lt;br/&gt;
