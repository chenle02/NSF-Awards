9406745 Freese Research in theoretical astrophysics will involve an examination
of the occurrence of phase transitions in the early universe. Two specific
phenomena are studied. The first concerns the rapid expansion of the universe
not long after its beginning, and the research focuses on the mechanism for this
inflation. The second concerns the effects arising from the binding of quarks
into ordinary particles. Research in this area focuses on the formation of
"stringy" objects that accompany this transition. The results of the work
provide a clearer picture of what happens during a critical period in the
evolution of the universe. ***
