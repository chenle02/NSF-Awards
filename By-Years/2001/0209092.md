Models are the foundations of science and engineering. Well known examples of
models can be found in physics, geology, economy, astronomy, weather
forecasting, etc. It is important that for each application the correct model is
used. Indeed, the progress of science relies on finding models that describe
accurately the main features of the application. Frequently models must be
radically adjusted to take into account new technological developments or to
make the models more accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most models used in trusted
systems are over 20 years old, that is before the introduction of the internet,
computer viruses, the World Wide Web, hacking, denial of service attacks, poorly
tested operating systems, etc. Since computer systems changed dramatically
during this period, the models used for computer security are outdated and often
unrealistic. There is a need to start a process of analyzing whether some of the
earlier models are still appropriate, and if not, adapt them. If one does not
address this issue the gap between reality and research is going to widen,
making research in this area irrelevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals
are:&lt;br/&gt;- to critically analyze existing models for trusted
systems,&lt;br/&gt;- to propose new models using techniques from such
disciplines as computational complexity, discrete mathematics, and
economics.&lt;br/&gt;- to compare these models and evaluate them.&lt;br/&gt;
