This grant supports the research of Professors David Kazhdan and Benedict Gross
as principal investigators and Dr. Boas Erez as a post-doctoral associate.
Professor Kazhdan will work on tensor categories, the representation of quantum
groups and the theory of integration over supermanifolds. Professor Gross will
study Euclidean lattices constructed from group representations and triple
product l-functions. Dr. Erez will study problems in Galois module theory. This
is research in the field of number theory broadly conceived. Number theory
starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one
whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was
originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half
century, it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics. Moreover,
techniques developed for their applications to problems in number theory have
become useful for theoretical physics - as in the proposed research in quantum
groups and infinite dimensional representation theory of Professor Kazhdan
supported by this grant.
