The importance of marine macroalgae in coastal food webs of the Antarctic
Peninsula is not well known. Dr. Kenneth Dunton, using marine flora and fauna
collected from several sites on the Antarctic Peninsula, proposes to determine
the contribution of macroalgal carbon to the rich benthic communities by using
stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures. The density of coastal
macroalgae is extremely high, the productivity of which probably matches or
exceeds that of the local phytoplankton. The hypothesis to be tested is that
macroalgae serve as an important dietary carbon source of many benthic and
epibenthic fauna, as recently demonstrated for kelps in low latitudes. The
stable isotopic analysis of the collected fauna and flora will provide an unique
opportunity to evaluate the contribution of macroalgal carbon in high latitude
food webs, as well as trophic relations and feeding strategies of marine fauna
on the Antarctic Peninsula.
