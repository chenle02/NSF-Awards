It is proposed to develop a simple and clear language for use as a digital
interface in Solid Free-Form Fabrication. This language is called "SIF" for
"Solid Interchange Format" inspired by CIF, the Caltech Intermediate Form for
LSI layout description. The role of SIF would be to describe the ideal solid
part desired, in a fabrication-process-independent way. It is further proposed
to create a foundation for some of the key tools needed with such an exchange
language, in particular, a robust slicing tool to create 2.5D layers needed for
process planning, as well as checker programs that will verify that the shape
specified in the SIF file is indeed a closed solid, has the required topological
and geometric properties, and specifies only realizable features containing
certain minimum feature sizes and separations. Finally, it is proposed to
develop test structures of various kinds that will test the robustness of
analysis and conversion tools working from SIF input for different SFF
fabrication processes and to monitor the quality of individual production runs.
