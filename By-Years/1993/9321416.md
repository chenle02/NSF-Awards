ABSTRACT The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) proposes an ARCSS
(Arctic System Science) Data Coordination Center at NSIDC to integrate
management of data for LAII, OAII, GISP2. PALE, and the emerging Arctic
Archaeology component. In this three-year view, NSIDC envisions a distributed
set of ARCSS data archives with data sets held in appropriate centers (including
NSIDC), linked by NSIDC's "front end" coordination to ensure that ARCSS-funded
researchers can easily obtain required data, and to guarantee archival of data
they collect during ARCSS. The "front end", or Data Coordination Center, will
produce these results: a. ARCSS and other Arctic data sets and products of
importance to ARCSS science priorities will be catalogued and described in a
published ARCSS Catalog and in the Global Change Master Directory; b. ARCSS and
other Arctic data sets and products will be easy to access and to use for
research; c. ARCSS data sets will be coordinated and managed within the
framework of established and emerging U.S. and international data systems and
centers; d. A data accession and archival system for ARCSS data sets and
products will be established at NSIDC; e. Guidelines for data formats and
documents, including GIS and model output data sets, will be developed and
promulgated within the ARCSS aommunity; f. Tailored data products, on CD-ROM,
diskette, and via electronic file transfer will be delivered to ARCSS
investigators; g. NSIDC will work with the ARCSS Data Management Working Group,
ARCSS Modeling Working Group, and ARCSS Science Steering Committees to identify
data priorities for ARCSS- funded research; h. Exchange of information about
data sets and data-related activities among members of the ARCSS community will
be facilitated by an electronic bulletin board, newsletter, and information
clearinghouse at NSIDC; and i. Initiate work on a geocryological database by
capitalizing on recent opportunities to obtain da ta from the former Soviet
Union.
