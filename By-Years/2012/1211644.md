This project will investigate the population of galaxies that are in transition
from star-forming to non-star-forming, with greater accuracy than was previously
possible. The Principal Investigator and graduate students supported by the
award will combine optical-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
ultraviolet data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) spacecraft, and mid-
infrared data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) spacecraft, to
identify transition galaxies and to constrain their metallicities, star-
formation rates, dust extinctions, stellar masses, and active nucleus content at
low redshift. They will then use PRIMUS, a 120,000 galaxy survey sampling the
redshift range between 0.2 and 1.0, combined with GALEX and Spitzer Space
Telescope data, to perform a similar analysis at higher redshift. The objectives
are (1) to obtain an accurate and representative census of the transition
population; (2) to determine whether star-formation is turning off the same way
in isolated galaxies as in cluster populations; and (3) to determine whether
active galactic nuclei are related to the transition phenomenon. In addition to
supporting graduate student training, the project will enable expansion of the
NASA-Sloan Atlas of galaxies to include newly released WISE data and development
of educational and outreach tools within the existing web interface.
