The development of reliable design procedures for the design of earthquake
resistant structures requires an understanding of the manner in which the
surrounding earth material at the site of a structure responds to seismic
loading. However, due to the infrequent nature of earthquakes, and to the
variability in the geology and physical properties of the soil at different
locations, it is virtually impossible to provide such records for every proposed
site. This action is to provide equipment to measure the long period
microtremors in the entire Los Angeles basin. Microtremors, or microseisms, are
small tremors or vibrations of the earth that are generated by natural
occurrences such as the pounding of surf on the shore, or road traffic. They are
not associated with earthquakes, but may be used, as is proposed here, to
understand better the process of ground shaking due to earthquakes. The measured
microtremors in the Los Angeles basin will be compared with existing strong
ground motion measurements in the basin. Previous studies of microtremor data in
Japan strongly suggests that microtremor data can be used to understand the
strong motion response at a particular site to a damaging earthquake. The
principal investigators are recognized for their expertise in earthquake
engineering studies, and have the institutional resources to use effectively the
equipment to be purchased.
