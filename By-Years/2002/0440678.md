The University of California at San Diego has been granted an award to
facilitate student and young scientist participation in the Intelligent Systems
for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in Glasgow Scotland in July of 2004. The
conference provides a generalforum for disseminating the latest developments in
bioinformatics and other computational aspects of molecular biology. The
conference is annual and alternates between North America and non-North American
sites. The 2004 conference will be held as a joint conference with the 2004
European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB). The combined goal of the
ISMB and ECCB meeting is to bring together biologists and computational
scientists in a focus on actual biological problems, i.e., not simply
theoretical calculations. The combined focus on "intelligent systems" and actual
biological data makes ISMB a unique and highly important meeting that will be of
major benefit to those who will be enabled to attend by this award. &lt;br/&gt;
