The use of wireless networks is expanding, including mesh networks that increase
the geographic coverage of an access point, and ad hoc networks that provide
instantaneous and self-configuring communications when wired infrastructure is
not available. The viability of these networks is hampered, however, by the poor
performance of TCP when it operates over multiple wireless hops. Many
alternative transport protocols are being designed, but the lack
of&lt;br/&gt;experiments on deployed networks severely limits the impact and
relevance of current research in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
designs a software toolkit that simplifies the process of developing wireless
transport protocols. Protocols can be written in user space, enabling
researchers to avoid the complexities of kernel development and focus their
efforts on experimental evaluation. The project uses the toolkit to implement a
number of leading wireless transport protocols, comparing their performance,
examining the decomposition of functionality between end hosts and routers, and
evaluating TCP compatibility. The end result will be a comprehensive study of
wireless transport protocols in an experimental setting,&lt;br/&gt;demonstrating
how to obtain high throughput while working seamlessly with existing TCP
stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The toolkit will be developed as an open source
project, so that it can be used by the research community to develop new
transport protocols or to examine the interaction of wireless transport
protocols with new MAC designs, network coding, or routing protocols. The
project will also develop curriculum for incorporating a mesh testbed into a
senior-level course in networking, with accompanying labs and instructional
materials.&lt;br/&gt;
