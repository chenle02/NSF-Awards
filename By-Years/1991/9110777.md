This is an award to support preliminary research on the extent to which the
pheriphytic biolayer of stream sediments mediates the transfer and
transformation of polychlorinated biphenyls and to determine rates of their
transformation and/or bioaccumulation and/or transformation. The research to be
conducted will involve use of laboratory-scale artificial streams to assess
interstream variability, to refine the technical protocols for determination of
polychlorinated biphenyls in the sediment and periphytic layers, and to obtain
preliminary data on the function of these layers in the transfer process. The
proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to the Program
Announcement NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards
for Women Scientists and Engineers. Results of this planning phase are expected
to be utilized in developing a full research proposal for consideration of
further support by the National Science Foundation.
