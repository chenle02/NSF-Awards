Both fundamental theory and design algorithms are developed for systems which
convert analog data into digital representation. The examples of principal
interest are oversampled analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and vector
quantization systems. The latter emphasizes low-rate communications and data
storage systems where the PI has made significant contributions in the past. The
former emphasizes recently developed architectures for high rate ADC by using
scalar feedback binary quantizers at a sampling rate much higher than the
Nyquist rate. An additional research topic is the interplay between these
systems, e. g. the use of an oversampled ADC front end to a data compression
system using vector quantization. The main application area for this work is
speech transmission and recognition. Signals exist mainly in analog form, thus
prior to digital processing they must be sampled and converted to finite-length
computer words by a process called quantization. This task is performed by the
so-called analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The PI brings new mathematical
methods to bear on the analysis of oversampled ADC's, a particularly attractive
class of quantizers from the implementation point of view.
