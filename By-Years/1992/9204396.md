This project will explore the synthetic potential of several important radical
processes: the fragmentation of cyclopropyl and cyclobutylcarbinyl radicals; the
generation, inversion and cyclization of dioxolanyl, oxiranyl, and aziridinyl
radicals. These latter functionalized radicals can be generated from readily
available chiral precursors that will lead to enantiomerically pure compounds.
Dioxolanyl, oxiranyl, and aziridinyl radicals have not been the subject of
extensive study and in the case of the latter two, all but ignored as potential
chiral reactants in chemical synthesis. In addition to the synthetic potential
of these processes, interesting mechanistic questions have also been posed. The
success of these studies will provide new avenues of synthesis that may be
applicable to the preparation of important antibiotics through pathways
inaccessible by anionic and cationic methods. Modern methods of chemical
analysis, i.e., nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy, will be used
in the identification of the new materials prepared in this work. %%% With this
award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the research of Dr. Frederick
E. Ziegler at Yale University. The research explores new synthetic methodology
based on free radical based reactions that could replace the more well developed
anionic and cationic based methodology.
