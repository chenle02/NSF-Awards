The principal investigator will experimentally study the high
pressure/temperature equilibrium and kinetic properties of crustal- rock
accessory minerals, especially zircon. Natural samples of these minerals will
then be used as recorders of crustal processes. The goal is to be able to
interpret the geologic record in as much detail as possible.
