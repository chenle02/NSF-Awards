The promise of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) is that they will enable
many different parts to be produced automatically and continuously on a single
set of machines. One major barrier to widespread commercial use of flexible
manufacturing systems is that, with current technology, it is difficult to
create fixtures to hold parts that are not similar in shape and size. Thus, many
flexible manufacturing systems can produce only a limited variety of parts. If
flexible fixtures were available, the number of parts that could be produced in
a single FMS would increase, and flexible manufacturing systems would be more
economically attractive. Much of the current research in flexible fixturing has
centered around creating modular mechanical fixtures that can be automatically
reconfigured for each part. Other methods such as phase-change fixtures and
fluidized-bed fixtures have not received as much attention and consequently
their uses are more limited. The proposed research will focus on the latter
class of flexible fixtures. In particular, mathematical models of phase-change
fixtures subjected to varying forces will be developed and verified. These
models will then be used in the design, fabrication, and testing of phase-change
fixtures. Finally, research will be undertaken to integrate the fixtures into
flexible manufacturing systems. The study will encompass both authentic phase-
change materials (those that undergo phase changes due to thermal or electrical
pulses) and pseudo-phase-change materials (those that can be induced to act as
solid or liquid depending on an external force field).
