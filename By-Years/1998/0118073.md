This work is proposed as a starter grant to support a follow-on effort to
PFSIVIETE fellowship grant number 9896381, "A Longitudinal Study of Eight
Engineering Colleges using the SUCCEED Longitudinal Database." The primary goal
of the original fellowship was to prioritize factors that contribute to
engineering student success by studying programs designed to help engineering
students at nine institutions. The breadth of data required to conduct such an
analysis could not be collected within the fellowship tenure, so this greater
goal remains a subject for continuing research. During the fellowship tenure, a
number of individual studies were completed, and results from these have been
published or are being developed in collaboration with the investigators who
originally designed and implemented the programs under study. This request asks
for support necessary to complete the study of data already collected and to
collect additional data needed to begin to address the more aggressive goal of
characterizing factors that contribute to engineering student success. The
Southeastern University and College Coalition for Engineering Education
(SUCCEED) will continue to significantly leverage this work.
