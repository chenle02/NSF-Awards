Research is in progress along two lines. The first line of research concerns a
two-person pebble game model of synchronous parallel computation and some of its
applications. This game extends the two- person pebble game defined previously
by Dymond and Tompa, and provides a combinatorial framework for the study of
issues in parallel computation. The extensions are being used to abstract the
control structure of parallel algorithms. This game has motivated the discovery
of a key property, semi unboundedness of computations in the parallel complexity
class LOGCFL. The second line of research deals with some interesting
theoretical questions raised by this property. One of these questions involves a
study of Boolean circuit models in which fan-in is considered as a resource in
addition to the traditional resources such as size and depth. Among other
applications, these models are providing a framework in which to address the
question of closure under complementation of complexity classes such as LOGCFL.
The P.I. is a 1986 Ph.D whose proposal contains fresh ideas for approaching
important questions in the complexity of parallel computation. The proposal and
the P.I.'s initial research demonstrate that he knows the appropriate background
material and has the capability of successfully attacking the problems proposed.
