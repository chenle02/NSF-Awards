Funds are requested for the purchase of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer for the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Mississippi. Acquisition of this
spectrometer will greatly enhance ongoing research programs in areas of organic,
inorganic, biochemistry, and biophysics within this department. The core user
group requires a higher-field NRM spectrometer with more advanced pulse
techniques than is currently available in the Department of Chemistry to extend
our studies involving large molecules such as proteins, oligonucleotides and
related species as well as structurally complex "small" organic molecules.
Specific applications of five core users include (1) the study of ligand-
oligonucleotide interactions, (2) polypeptide structures using conformationally
contrained amino acid analogs, (3) structual analysis of alkane thiols used to
form self- assembled monolayers, (4) structural analyses of organic donor-
acceptor molecules, (5) structural elucidation of biologically active natural
products.
