This research planning grant will enable Dr. Pamela Shapiro to initiate a
research program which entails the synthesis of bent metallocene complexes with
novel heteroannular bridges. The bridges will involve the group 13 elements B,
Al, or Ga. These have the virtue of presenting an opportunity for switching
between different reaction states through coordination with Lewis bases. The
effect of chiral Lewis bases will also be investigated and it will be determined
whether chirality can be induced at the metal center. %%% Research planning
grants are awarded to women who have not yet been awarded federal funding for
their research. Dr. Shapiro is a new faculty member at the University of Idaho
and will be initiating a research program leading to the preparation of a class
of novel catalytic molecules which could become commercially important in the
polymer industry.
