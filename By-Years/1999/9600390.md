Abstract 9600390 Storm The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to
discuss recent findings and current thinking in various areas of science.
Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of established
scientists, young investigators who are making important contributions in these
areas, and post doctoral fellows. They are usually held in small isolated New
England towns away from other distractions and are conducive to the free
exchange of ideas. These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the
latest advances in research and also indicating the future trends which are
likely to be most productive. ***
