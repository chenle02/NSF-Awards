In recent years American manufacturers have faced increasing competition from
abroad. In addition to having low prices, being competitive now requires
outstanding quality, short lead times, and increased responsiveness to
customer's changing demands. Companies that have successfully responded to this
changing environment have done so by decreasing work in process (WIP) and
finished goods inventory levels thereby allowing early detection of quality
problems, shorter lead times, and less vulnerability to changing demands. A
major cause of high WIP levels and long lead times is the lack of
synchronization between fabrication and assembly. Where they are applicable,
Kanban and other such pull systems achieve a high degree of synchronization.
Unfortunately, Kanban is suitable only for repetitive manufacturing
environments. Thus, less effective but more applicable systems such as Materials
Requirements Planning continue to find application. This project will develop a
production control strategy, called Synchronized Production, that offers the
increased performance of Kanban in a much wider variety of manufacturing
environments. IBM Corporation is funding certain portions of the research that
pertain directly to a circuit board plant. The result of the joint NSF and IBM
funding will be the basic theory behind the new control strategy as well as
experience with portions of its implementation. By combining industry and
government support, this project will develop both the theoretical and applied
results needed to enable Synchronized Production to play a role in restoring the
competitiveness of American manufacturing.
