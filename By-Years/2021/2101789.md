Algebraic geometry studies the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.
A theme of the subject is to classify different geometric shapes that naturally
arise in the study of these solution sets. This has a root in classical
problems, and nowadays it finds deep connections with modern tools, especially
moduli spaces, stability conditions, and derived categories. This project aims
at further applications of these tools to concrete geometric questions open for
a long time. It also supports graduate students to explore the subject through
travel opportunities to conferences and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project contains three related research goals: The first is a systematic study
of the connection between Fano geometry and hyperkähler geometry, like
generalized Kummer varieties and Gushel-Mukai varieties, using tools from
derived categories. The second goal is to construct stability conditions in
several important cases including Calabi-Yau threefolds, Fano fourfolds, and
hyperkähler varieties. The main approach is via various restriction theorems to
reduce to lower dimensional cases. The third goal is to revisit several long-
standing questions on moduli of sheaves on surfaces, including the computation
of Picard groups and linear series. The recent development in moduli theory will
play a central role in this study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
