In this project, the P.I,s will perform modal analysis,m and electron and ion
probe analysis of the minerals in abyssal peridotites recovered from MAR in the
vicinity of 15o20' Fracture Zone. The intriguing aspect of the 15o20' FZ is that
an unusual large duniteharzburgite complex is exposed here. Their objective is
to evaluate the origin of this complex and the magmatic processes which operate
at local scales and control the composition of the oceanic crust.
