9503426 Sinton The East Pacific Rise from 15-19 S is the fastest spreading of
all the ocean ridges. This is also an area of extensive volcanism on the flanks
of the ocean ridge, which is evident from strings of seamounts that stretch
northwest from the ridge axis. The investigators plan to analyze rocks that are
already in hand to determine their major and trace element chemical compositions
and to measure selected isotope ratios. The major and trace elements will be
used to determine when and where melting occurs in the mantle by inferring
conditions and depths of melting. The isotope ratios will be used to identify
the location and longevity of chemical heterogeneities in the mantle. This
project is in the same area and is related to the large seismic experiment
called MELT which intends to determine the distribution of melting in the
mantle, and the two projects complement each other. ***
