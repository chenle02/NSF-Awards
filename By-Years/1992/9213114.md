This grant provides research equipment that will greatly enhance our ability to
analyze sediment core samples in a non-destructive fashion. The multi-sensor
core logger is a state-of-the-art system that allows a number of geotechnical
and geophysical measurements to be obtained on seabed cores or terrestrial
boring samples while they are still in the sampling tubes. The system will
initially be configured for acoustic velocity measurements, density profiles
(gamma-ray attenuation), magnetic susceptibility for sedimentological studies
and natural gamma measurements for correlation with in-situ measurements and
determination of sediment composition. As a parallel development a new triaxial
compression cells will be equipped with acoustic instrumentation to enable
detailed studies of compressional and shear-wave characteristics in controlled
laboratory stress-strain tests. The combination of the core logger, which can
easily be taken on oceanographic or engineering research expeditions, and the
enhanced laboratory testing capabilities will give us a powerful system for
conducting sedimentological and geotechnical research.
