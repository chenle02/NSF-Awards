ABSTRACT The general goal of the proposed project is to investigate the syntax
--semantics interface through an investigation of a constraint known as the
"weak island effect." The project aims to reinterpret and revise some recent
developments in the research of weak islands, using algebraic semantics. The two
central hypothesis are as follows: (i) The weak island effect is a scope
phenomenon, and (ii) The scope-taking abilities of WH-phrases and other
operators are determined by their denotational semantic properties as well as
their syntactic positions. Cross-linguistic comparisons involving specific
phenomena in English, Hungarian, and Dutch will be used to facilitate the
clarification of how syntax and semantics interact. The results will be
accommodated in Government-binding theory and in Categorial Grammar.
