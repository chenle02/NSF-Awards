Semiconductor device technology is going through rapid changes in order to
achieve ultra-large-scale integration. The increasing demand for more complex
chip functionality and higher speed have led to decreasing device feature size.
Development of new concepts and theories of mechanical reliability of
microelectronic devices has been an emerging interdisciplinary subject because
of the continual downsizing of the microelectronics devices. This project funds
equipment for a laboratopy course on Mechanical Reliability of Microelectronics
to be offered to upper-division engineering undergraduate students at Georgia
Tech. The objectives of offering such a course to mechanical engineering
students are (1) to introduce them to the field of mechanical reliability of
microelectronics, (2) to make them aware that there is an urgent need in the
electronic industry for mechanical engineers in packaging, and (3) to give them
a head start in their engineering careers so they can face technological
challenges in the 21st century. The new equipment includes a microtester system
and an optical microscopy system.
