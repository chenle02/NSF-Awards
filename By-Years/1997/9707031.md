9707031 Gorelick This award provides partial support (72%) for the acquisition
of a computer system for the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences
at Stanford University. The system will be used primarily for research and
teaching in the Stanford hydroscience programs on a broad variety of
hydrogeologic and near-surface hydrologic problems such as the spatial patterns
of aquifer and fractured-rock flow, the migration of non-aqueous liquids through
the unsaturated zone, the use of groundwater storage for drought protection, and
soil classification and geostatistical approaches for improving the
characterization of near-surface soil hydraulic properties. Much of the work of
the hydrology group at Stanford requires intensive computing. Stanford
University is committed to providing the remaining 28% of the funds required for
this acquisition. ***
