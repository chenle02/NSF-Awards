Sion and Oswalt will obtain spectra of white dwarfs in order to determine their
masses, to learn more about their evolutionary histories, and to recognize new
white dwarfs, especially those of unusual classes. White dwarfs are Earth-sized
stars, the final state of stars like the Sun after they have exhausted all
nuclear fuels. Recent observations have demonstrated surprisingly many kinds of
atmospheres on white dwarfs. Sion and Oswalt will take spectra of several
hundred white dwarfs in order to determine their masses. These fundamental
parameters provide information how stars originally rather like the Sun end up
as members of apparently rather unlike sets of white dwarfs. Sion and Oswalt
also expect to identify many more white dwarfs, so that the more unusual kinds
can be studied better. This award is made under the Research in Undergraduate
