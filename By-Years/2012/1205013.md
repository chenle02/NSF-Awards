Kingsborough Community College and Brooklyn College collaboratively promote
biotechnology education in New York City through 1) basic and advanced Summer
Institutes in which middle and high school science teachers expand their
knowledge of biotechnology and ability to engage students; 2) development of a
graduate course in teaching biotechnology in which pre-service teachers focus on
real-world learning; 3) opportunities for middle and high school students to
perform experiments in a college laboratory and in their own schools via a new
lending laboratory; and 4) creation and implementation of embedded virtual
enterprise simulations in which college biotechnology majors improve their
workforce skills. Activities are guided by input from biotechnology industry
representatives. Improvements in skills, knowledge and attitudes are evaluated.
The project's methodology and outcomes are disseminated through local and
national conferences, articles, an on-line e-community, and a capstone
conference.
