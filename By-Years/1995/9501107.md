Wilson DMS-9501107 Wilson will prove weighted norm inequalities that show how
the interior smoothness of solutions of certain classes of partial differential
equations are controlled by the size of their boundary data. This allows one to
gauge the speed of convergence of numerical approximations to the exact
solutions of the pde, and to determine how perturbations of boundary data
effects the rate of convergence. Partial differential equations form a basis for
mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis
is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and
quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of
these approximations.
