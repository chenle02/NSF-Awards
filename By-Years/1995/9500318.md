Simon 9500318 This is a Research Equipment Grant for the purchase of a Perkin
Elmer DSC-7 differential scanning calorimeter and an upgrade for the PI's Perkin
Elmer DMA-7 dynamic mechanical analyzer. The DSC-7 will replace a twenty-year-
old DSC-2. The DSC-7 has faster cooling and heating rates, better temperature
control, improved sensitivity, and improved data analysis. The upgrade of the
Perkin-Elmer DMA-7 to a DMA-7e is necessary in order to facilitate the
measurement of glassy and high-modulus materials far below the glass transition
temperature and to improve measurements of creep in the vicinity of Tg where
films cannot be used. Projects which will entail the use of these instruments
include an investigation of the effects of network constraints on the properties
of thermosetting polymers in the glassy state. Other projects which will benefit
from the upgrade include investigations of the effect of cure cycles on the
internal stress of thermosetting materials, a project on the physical aging of
polymers, and project on the interaction of moisture and chemical and physical
aging in polycyanurate materials.
