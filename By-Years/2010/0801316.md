This proposal's main purpose is to investigate an area of mathematics which grew
out of the science of interpreting data of large number of measurements. The
basic problem is this: under normal circumstances, when people have to make
repeated measurements of some data to draw statistical conclusions, they try to
make the measurements at regular intervals, like once every second. The existing
theories usually assume that the measurements are taken _exactly_ at every
second. In reality, measurements are made at every second only approximately.
The proposal's investigations are aimed to look at these possible random
perturbations, and try to develop tools to help interpret the obtained data. One
of the main motivation for these investigations is the fact that random
perturbations may result in a completely different set of data from those one
could obtain under the ideal circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it may be
guessed, many of the problems we face are difficult, and to solve these problems
we resort to tools used in several different branches of mathematics.
