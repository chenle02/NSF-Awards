Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is in partial support of the 2008
Gordon Research Conference on Environmental Sciences: Water. This conference is
to be held June 22-27, 2008 at the Holderness School located in Plymouth, New
Hampshire. The overall objective of the conference is to present, discuss, and
rekindle new research approaches and directions at the interfaces between
chemistry and environmental engineering, relative to the big issues surrounding
aquatic sciences in the coming decades. Presentations and discussions will
emphasize aquatic processes and systems chemical, physical, and biological that
are the underpinnings to understanding any one contaminant issue. In addition, a
major emphasis will be placed on issues of sustainability. The funds requested
are all for participant costs, particularly graduate students.
