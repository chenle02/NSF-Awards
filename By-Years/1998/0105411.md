With modern processor architectures, programs can achieve
good&lt;br/&gt;performance only if they possess sufficient data locality to
exploit&lt;br/&gt;on-chip caches. This research focuses on developing and
evaluating&lt;br/&gt;software support for improving locality for advanced
scientific&lt;br/&gt;applications for both sequential and parallel machines. The
basic&lt;br/&gt;premise is that both compile-time analyses and sophisticated
run-time&lt;br/&gt;systems are necessary. Run-time systems are needed because
many&lt;br/&gt;programs are not analyzable statically. Compiler support is
crucial&lt;br/&gt;both for inserting interfaces to the run-time system and for
directly&lt;br/&gt;applying program transformations where
possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal investigates locality optimizations
needed for three&lt;br/&gt;features found in advanced scientific applications
(3D arrays,&lt;br/&gt;irregular accesses, and pointers). It focuses on
extending&lt;br/&gt;locality optimizations to handle cache conflicts between
multiple&lt;br/&gt;data, deep memory hierarchies (multi-level caches and TLBs),
hardware&lt;br/&gt;and software prefetching, nonlinear memory layouts, parallel
and&lt;br/&gt;cluster architectures, and memory performance tools.
Locality&lt;br/&gt;optimizations will be applied to representative programs
and&lt;br/&gt;experimentally evaluated on advanced computer
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research should help improve
the performance&lt;br/&gt;of computationally intensive scientific applications.
Because&lt;br/&gt;of trends in computer architectures, lessons learned are
also&lt;br/&gt;likely to be useful for application domains such as
image&lt;br/&gt;processing and high-performance databases.
