The objective of this project is to investigate the feasibility of a potential
application of machine vision or image processing technology to automatically
record the pavement surface and to interpret the crack pattern and other
deterioration by means of artifical intelligence techniques. The successful
completion of this investigation will lead to the development of new equipment
for obtaining and recording images of pavement surfaces and their interpretation
by artificial intelligence techniques.
