Cosmogenic He in surface rocks is produced in situ by cosmic ray induced
spallation reactions. As shown by recent studies of radiocarbon dated lava
flows, measurements of cosmogenic helium can therefore be used to determine
exposure ages. This research will apply the technique to glacial deposits in the
Antarctic Dry Valleys. The goal of the research is to resolve some existing
questions regarding the helium exposure-age method, and also to constrain the
history of the Antarctic ice sheet and its relation to global climate. The Dry
Valleys are ideal to test the technique because of uniquely exposed, well-dated
moraines (Arena valley) indicate that quartz is a suitable mineral phase. The
initial emphasis of the research will center on further measurements from dated
moraines, and gaining a better understanding of the distribution and retention
of helium within quartz. Quartz is such a ubiquitous mineral that this will be
of general interest to glacial geology. Application of the technique to glacial
deposits in the Ross Sea and glacially straited surfaces in the Transantarctic
mountains will help elucidate the history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
