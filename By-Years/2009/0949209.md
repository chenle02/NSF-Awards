This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education award to the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will develop innovative new
graduate degree programs in mechanical engineering that are customized to the
needs and strengths of veterans. A particular emphasis will be including
research experiences and industrial internships within the degree program. The
results will also be presented on the web, at technical conferences and
published in professional journals. The project is expected to assist the
transition of veterans to civilian life and to enhance the number of students
who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start
new high tech businesses.
