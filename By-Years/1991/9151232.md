This project develops a microcomputer laboratory to be used for undergraduate
mathematics courses and advanced undergraduate courses in computer science.
Students in Calculus and Linear Algebra will become acquainted with a computer
algebra system, such as MAPLE. The use of this system continues in subsequent
mathematics courses and, hopefully, in the professional practice of mathematics.
The first course in calculus is augmented by a computer laboratory course
carrying one hour credit. Computer science students use the new equipment
especially in courses in Object-Oriented Programming, Graphics, and Operating
Systems. Software to be run includes OBJECTIVE C, C + + and SMALLTALK V.The
equipment includes 16 microcomputers of 486 type networked to a LAN running the
UNIX operating system. In addition, there are three mobil overhead work stations
equipped with computers and LCD projection pads for classroom instructional use.
