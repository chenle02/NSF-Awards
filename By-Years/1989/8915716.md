This equipment will be used in materials research to analyze the
microstructural features of materials. The equipment provides rapid information
on the materials structure in a digitized format permitting in-depth analysis.
Examples of research that would benefit from the availability of this equipment
include studies of mechanisms of fatigue microcrack initiation and growth,
advanced materials processing, and cavitation in superplastically deformed
materials. The generic goal in these research programs is to relate the
materials structure to properties and performance. The equipment aids in
gathering valuable statistics relating microstructure to fatigue damage,
cavitation and atomization.
