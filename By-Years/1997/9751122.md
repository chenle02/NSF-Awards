Oakton Community College is reforming its mathematics offerings by: (i)
applying and assessing effective pedagogical approaches and technologies that
meet the needs of a diverse student body; (ii) conforming to a new policy of the
Illinois Board Higher Education to raise and align the mathematics standards for
students in baccalaureate transfer programs; and (iii) meeting the expressed
needs of business and industry to use a learning format that parallels the
workplace and emphasizes technology and teamwork. The goals of the project are
to (a) increase students' ability to use software tools to solve realistic
problems in a team environment; (b) employ cooperative learning techniques; and
(c) increase student enrollment and retention in mathematics classes. The design
includes a variety of teaching and learning techniques including cooperative and
experiential learning and visualization techniques within a technologically
integrated laboratory/classroom that simulates the academic research or
industrial workplace setting. Undergraduate students team together to work on
realistic problems using the Internet, interactive multimedia applications, and
Derive to extend their problem-solving capabilities. Cooperative learning
activities are being supported by a laboratory/classroom equipped with notebook
computers and TI-92 graphics calculators. The project's significance exists in
the faculty's efforts to develop the use of new pedagogies in mathematics. These
approaches are being shared through traditional and electronic media. The
project also provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to have a
rigorous and exciting encounter with mathematics as well as achieve mastery in
the use of mathematical applications and technology to solve real-world
problems. *
