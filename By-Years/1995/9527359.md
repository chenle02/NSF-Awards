With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Robert L.
Kuczkowski of The University of Michigan is continuing his research in the area
of fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy of weak complexes. He will
investigate the structure and dynamics of a) sulfur dioxide complexes, b)
cyclopropane complexes, c) complexes involving strong acids, d) metal complexes,
and e) termolecular complexes. Calculations using models provided by Stone or
Muenter will be performed for comparison purposes, which will yield highly
accurate tilt and torsional angles. Results from the above studies will provide
fundamental information on the nature of weak binding forces between molecules
and on intermolecular potential functions. Such results will help to test models
and develop theories which can guide chemists on how compounds interact, grow
into larger clusters, and arrange themselves in condensed phases. This has
potential implications for a wide spectrum of important phenomena ranging from
biochemical applications such as drug design and transport of species across
membranes, to physical processes such as cloud formation, acid rain phenomena
and substrate-catalyst interactions.
