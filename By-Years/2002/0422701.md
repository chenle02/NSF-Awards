This project will provide 120 hours of information technology (IT) instruction
to 20 West Virginia middle school STEM teachers each year. The program will also
serve 30 students and 5 guidance counselors annually. The lead institution is
the Institute for Scientific Research, Inc., a not-for-profit, and collaborators
include the EdVenture Group, Inc, the GLOBE Program, Fairmont State University,
the Marion County School System and eight other school districts in north
central West Virginia. School district administrators will recruit and screen
potential program participants with the following prerequisites: current
certification in science or mathematics, teaching experience and prior
participation in NSF-funded teacher enhancement projects that have served the
region for several years. The IT professional development focuses on integrating
3-D modeling and cluster computing skills in existing STEM curriculum units. A
two-week institute for teachers followed by a one-week program that includes
students will be offered each summer. The school year component provides two
full-day sessions and four hours of mentoring and on-line support. &lt;br/&gt;
