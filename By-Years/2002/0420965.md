This award supports purchase of a number of instruments and related items to be
used for investigation of organismal physiology. The instruments will be managed
as a shared facility that provides core infrastructure to support research,
coursework and training of both undergraduate and graduate students. The
facility will be used by a dozen faculty members within the Biology Department
who are active in research that spans animal, plant, and microbial physiology.
Among the instruments to be acquired are a gas-exchange system for measurement
of photosynthesis, animal respirometry systems, an oxygen sensor system, pH
meters, micromanipulators, and growth chambers. These state-of-the-art
physiological instruments will be used by faculty, student researcher, and
participants in biology courses. Faculty research projects that will benefit
from instrumentation include examinations of animal metabolism in dimorphic
spiders, bat physiology, physiology of plant stomata, and microbially-mediated
decomposition in wetlands.
