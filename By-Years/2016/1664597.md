Award: DMS 1664597, Principal Investigator: Steven Rosenberg

This award provides partial support for participation by U.S.-based
mathematicians at an international school and workshop in mathematics related to
topological phases of matter to be held in Leiden, the Netherlands, on February
27 - March 10, 2017. Remarkable phenomena of current interest in condensed
matter physics have been described as new phases or properties of material
systems, subject to rules specified by sophisticated mathematical structures.
This international meeting will include a one-week school to give junior
participants background in the mathematics and physics of the area and a second-
week workshop of advanced research talks. The conference aims to spark
collaborations between researchers of varied backgrounds and to enhance the
contributions of the mathematics of K- and KK-theory (Kasparov's bivariant
K-theory) to the subject.

Few researchers have background in all three topics of the workshop (gauge
theory, Kasparov KK-theory, and topological phases of matter), so this
interdisciplinary conference aims to be of benefit to all of these communities.
Recent developments in KK-theory and noncommutative geometry, such as a
constructive approach to the Kasparov product, seem relevant to current
condensed matter physics. Related mathematical topics on which discussions are
expected include correspondences in KK-theory, boundary issues, new methods in
gauge theory, applications to index theory.
