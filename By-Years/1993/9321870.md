9321870 Hovy This project supports a group of American researchers and students
in the area of natural language generation to attend a workshop on that subject.
The objectives of the project include but are not limited to those aspects of
natural language generation involving systems and applications that are relevant
to technology transfer, that have an international and multi-lingual
orientation, and that consider text planning as it influences automated
generation, database description, automated documentation, and other aspects
related to machine translation from the language generation point of view.
