The project will investigate the physical principle underlying the plasma-
assisted laser deposition process for the in situ growth of high critical
temperature superconducting thin films on a substrate. An understanding of the
physical mechanisms governing the process are critical for reproducible thin
film deposition on a low temperature substrate and subsequent integration into
existing semiconductor technologies. The successful modeling and control of the
deposition process may allow the manufacture of superconducting thin films with
the consistent properties that are needed to produce devices that are of
practical usefulness.
