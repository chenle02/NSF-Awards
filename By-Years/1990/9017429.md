A Renewal of support is sought for research on proton glasses, in which one will
examine the effects of cation and anion substitution and of deuteration. The
experiments will be carried out in the temperature range 3K to 450K, at
hydrostatic pressures up to 4kbar and at higher pressures using opposed-anvil
cells. Field-cooling experiments will be conducted in a search for the onset of
non- ergodicity, and non-linear effects will be studied by means of 3rd- order
dielectric susceptibility measurements.
