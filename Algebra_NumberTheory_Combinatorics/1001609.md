The main objective of this project is to study the geometry of moduli spaces of
sheaves on low dimensional varieties and reveal possible connections of the
subject with other fields of mathematics. The celebrated Gromov-
Witten/Donaldson-Thomas correspondence is a conjectural correspondence between
the integrals of characteristic classes of the universal ideal-sheaf over the
Hilbert scheme of curves in the threefold and integrals over the moduli space of
maps into the threefold. The conjecture is proven for toric threefolds and the
lowest degree nontrivial characteristic classes. The project proposed is
intended to extend the known results beyond the toric case and study the case of
higher degree characteristic classes. Another part of the project is devoted to
studying the topology of the Hilbert scheme of points on singular planar curves.
A conjectural formula was proposed by the PI and V. Shende for the Poincare
polynomials of the Hilbert scheme in terms of link invariants of the links of
the singularities of the curve. To prove the formula is one of the goals of the
project.

Moduli spaces of sheaves are mathematical models for the field theories.
Mathematical physics predictions, such as duality between the field theories and
string theory or path integral formulas for knot invariants, can be translated
into fascinating mathematical conjectures. The goal of this project is to find a
proof of some of these conjectures.
