9418842 Brahamsha Certain unicellular cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus
exhibit a unique form of prokaryotic motility. Unlike other motile cyanobacteria
which move by gliding on surfaces, these motile Synechococcus sp. are capable of
swimming in liquids. Moreover, although the swimming behavior of Synechococcus
resembles that of flagellated bacteria, numerous ultrastructural studies have so
far revealed no organelles of motility and the actual mechanism of swimming
remains a mystery. At issue are such fundamental questions as how organisms
convert chemical energy into motion. The mechanism of swimming is being
addressed at the genetic and biochemical levels. Mutants impaired in motility
are being obtained by interposon and chemical mutagenesis. The mutations are
being complemented by conjugation of a genomic bank of wild-type Synechococcus
into the mutant strains. The genes responsible will be cloned, their nucleotide
sequences determined, and their products localized. A protease-sensitive cell-
surface component(s) implicated in motility is being purified, and the gene(s)
encoding it will be isolated, sequenced and inactivated. To accomplish this Dr.
Brahamsha is making use of the following recent developments in her laboratory:
1) an agar plating technique that allows the discrimination between motile and
non-motile colonies and will make possible the selection of non-motile mutants;
2) the ability to introduce DNA into marine motile Synechococcus sp. and to get
recombination into the chromosome; 3) the availability of both a replicative and
a suicide vector; and 4) the indication that there is a protease-sensitive cell-
surface component(s) that is involved in the ability to swim in liquids. %%% The
results of this research should provide insights into the mechanisms by which
organisms convert chemical energy into motion.
