***&lt;br/&gt;9732636&lt;br/&gt;Torre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
investigates a number of issues and problems in classical and quantum relativity
and, in particular, Einstein's theory of gravitation. The following topics are
addressed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Construction of a general theory of symmetry
reduction in relativistic field theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Investigation of
the status of unitary dynamical evolution of quantum fields along arbitrary
foliations of a fixed spacetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Completion of a general
theory of local cohomology (p-form conservation laws) which is tailored to
relativistic field theory, including development of computational tools and
detailed applications to the Einstein equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Investigation of the status of curvature scalars as privileged canonical
variables representing "many-fingered time" in the Hamiltonian formulation of
general relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Further development and applications
of a new approach to asymptotic conversation laws in gravitational field
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Further development and applications of a
parametrization of the jet space of vacuum metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Rigorous treatment of Dirac constraint quantization of spacetimes admitting two
commuting Killing vector fields using the techniques of parametrized field
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Development of a theory of path integrals in
quantum gravity based upon results obtained using Ashtekar variables and
canonical quantization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of work on these topics is
to improve the state of knowledge regarding general relativity, gravitation, and
quantum mechanics as well as the interaction of these branches of
physics.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
