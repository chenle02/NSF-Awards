Two replicate 30-m sediment cores from Owens Lake California have been
recovered. Paleomagnetic data from older Owens Lake core suggest that a high-
resolution paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) recorded can be recovered from
these cores. This record should completely overlap the Mono Lake PSV record
which includes the Mono Lake excursion and a distinctive pattern of repeating
waveforms after the excursion. A PSV record from Owens Lake for late Pleistocene
time will be recovered and the validity of the Mono Lake record tested.
Paleointensity studies on both the new Owens Lake cores and our stored samples
from Mono Lake will also be carried out. The combined study of both lakes will
provide an important cross-validation for the paleointensity records. Finally,
the PI will use PSV correlations, radiocarbon dates, and rock magnetic data to
asses the timing of paleoclimatic changes recorded in the sediments of Mono and
Owens Lakes. This study will provide an important new higher-resolution view of
PSV (both field vector and paleointensity) in western North America and will be
linked with other ongoing studies to provide a broader picture of North American
PSV for more than the last 30,000 years.
