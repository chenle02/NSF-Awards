Currently, the lack of modern equipment for computerized stimulus presentation,
response measurement and data analysis seriously hampers the training of
students in the sophisticated research methods needed to investigate cognitive
processes. This project will establish a network of seven Macintosh
microcomputers to improve instruction in research methods and cognitive
psychology for undergraduate psychology majors. Lower-division research methods
classes, two upper-division laboratory courses, an intermediate statistics
course, and individual student research projects will employ the new equipment.
It is essential that students have adequate training in this area because of the
important role cognitive psychology plays within the larger field of psychology
and in the rapidly advancing interdisciplinary field known as cognitive science.
