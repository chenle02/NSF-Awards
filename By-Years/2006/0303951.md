Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Isomeric Sugar
Recognition Using Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hydrogels&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
Number: CTS-0303951&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Peter
Kofinas&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Maryland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the
proposed research is to prepare and test polymer hydrogels that have been
molecularly imprinted with recognition properties for different materials.
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) will be synthesized and imprinted against
specific simple sugar isomers. Methods will be developed for the detection and
quantification of each molecular imprint. The MIP's total sugar binding,
specificity, and rate of sugar diffusion will be evaluated in aqueous and
physiological media. Specific sugar recognition will be optimized through
combinatorial synthesis methods. A non-covalent approach to imprinting will be
carried out in aqueous solution. Mechanistic studies will attempt to clarify the
roles of molecular shape and functionality on selectivity. In terms of the
broader impacts, novel MIPs might offer new avenues for biorecognition and
isomeric separation techniques. The MIPs developed in this study may be used for
bio-separations in conjunction with chromatographic techniques to separate amino
acids, sugars, drugs, viruses and other bioactive compounds. In previous work
K-12 activities have been developed. An interactive Website for K-12 will be
developed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;
