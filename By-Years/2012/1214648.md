This award funds the research activities of Professor Manoj Kaplinghat at the
University of California, Irvine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the next few years,
astrophysical observations will play a pivotal role in the effort to detect dark
matter through non-gravitational means. The focus in this project will be on two
promising ways forward. One will be to use observations of gamma-rays towards
the luminous satellites of the Milky Way in order to constrain or detect weak-
scale thermal dark matter. Weak-scale thermal dark matter is the most widely
studied dark-matter candidate and is motivated by particle-physics models at the
high (electroweak-scale) energies currently being probed at the Large Hadron
Collider. The other way forward will be to develop simplified models to describe
dark-matter halo density profiles in the presence of significant self-
interactions and compare to observations. As part of the project, the PI will
provide a map between these preferred models and the underlying particle-physics
models in which such phenomenology is realized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The PI will
develop a cosmology and particle-physics cluster for the California State Summer
School for Mathematics and Science (i.e., the "COSMOS Program" at UC Irvine).
COSMOS is a program for motivated high-school students and currently has a
cluster in astronomy at UC Irvine but none in particle physics. Based on input
from faculty teaching the astronomy cluster, it is envisioned that a particle
physics and cosmology module will be highly subscribed.
