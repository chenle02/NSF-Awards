9602950 Heil This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Drs. Wolfgang Heil, Florida State University, and Carlos Gomez-
Larranaga and Victor Nunez, of the Centro de Investigaciones Matematicas
(CIMAT), Mexico, to study non-orientable 3- manifolds. A 3-dimensional manifold
is a particular topological space that locally looks like standard 3-dimensional
Euclidean space. The theory of 3-dimensional manifolds splits such manifolds
into two subclasses: orientable and non-orientable manifolds. Of the two
subclasses, the non-orientable have a uniquely different behavior and possibly a
richer structure than the orientable. To understand this structure, the
investigators intend to study decompositions of such manifolds into orientable
pieces and associate with these decompositions an ordered triple of numbers, the
trigenus, that may provide a useful approach to their classification. The
mathematicians involved in the collaboration have been at the forefront of
advancing the trigenus concept; support for this work will allow them to apply
it to a wider class of 3-manifolds and obtain new results in this area. ***
