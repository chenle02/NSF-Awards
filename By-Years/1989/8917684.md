Trichoptera ("caddisflies") represent a significant component of many stream
and terrestrial habitats. Their egg cases are important factors in the flow of
nutrients through stream ecosystems, and they are used as environmental quality
indicators. Dr. Ralph Holzenthal proposes to complete a Manual of the
Trichoptera of Costa Rica. This effort would entail further field collecting at
sites that represent the major habitat types (moist- and dry-forests on both the
Caribbean and Pacific sides, plus montane sites), description of scores of new
species, preparation of species' lists, identification keys, and an illustrated
manual (published in Spanish with English text made available separately). The
Manual Project will also allow two employees of the Costa Rican National
Biodiversity Institute to acquire advanced training in Trichoptera taxonomy and
ecology, and will produce a comprehensive systematic reference collection for
future in-country research. The proposed caddisfly inventory of Costa Rica will
have broad implications beyond insect systematics. At an organizational level,
the project sets a new standard for international collaboration, training of in-
country practitioners, and construction of systematic reference collections. At
the level of applied research, the manual will be invaluable for ecological
studies and environmental quality assessment. At the level of pure research, the
project will advance our understanding of a diverse tropical insect group, and
will lay the foundation for future studies of evolution and biogeography in the
tropics.
