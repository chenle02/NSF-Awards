Magnetic media and flash memories are currently the main platforms used for mass
data storage. As the need for storage capacity grows, new methods are being
explored to increase the density in such media, and new nano-scale technologies,
such as memristor-based memories, are being developed. This project concerns the
analysis of fundamental limits on the information storage capability of these
emerging storage technologies, as well as the design of coding schemes to
approach those limits. The theoretical component of the project requires new
approaches in information theory and discrete mathematics, while the development
of new coding techniques extends the reach of the theory into practice,
hastening the evolution of new commercial technologies. The project provides a
stimulating research environment for graduate students, and contributes to
curriculum development in electrical engineering and computer science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the domain of magnetic storage, the research addresses
lower and upper bounds on the capacity of grain and Ising channels; the
construction of codes that correct errors in these channels; and the extension
of these results to non-binary channel models. The research on multilevel flash
memories involves computing bounds on the capacity of the one-dimensional inter-
cell interference channel; constructing codes that combat inter-cell
interference in one, two, and three dimensions; and designing codes that
mitigate the wear of cells and the erase-program asymmetry in flash memories.
For memristor-based memories, research topics include the design of two-
dimensional codes with weight constraints on the rows and columns; the design of
fast methods for overwriting a two-dimensional weight-constrained array onto
another constrained array; and the study of the notion of Hamming connectedness
of constraints.
