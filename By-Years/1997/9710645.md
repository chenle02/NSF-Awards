The Science and Gender Equity Program (SAGE-VA) builds upon the achievements of
others who have developed and tested female friendly, hands-on science modules.
This 24 month project targets middles school girls as well as science and
mathematics teachers from the rural and economically depressed counties of far
western Virginia. The project will solidify a collaboration between scientists
and science educators at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
(VA-Tech) and classroom teachers in these isolated areas. The main goal of the
project is to establish a collaborative network among teachers, professors,
community organizations and middle school girls in rural schools. The activities
that will support this goal include establishing the above network; a summer
camp for middle school girls and teachers; distant learning activities for
collaboration and instruction; and, Saturday Academies. This project will:
increase teacher awareness of gender equity issues in science education, act as
a mentor program to encourage girls to pursue science careers; incorporate the
use of computer-based technologies for all participants and encourage
participants to use these technologies as efficient, powerful learning and
communication tools.
