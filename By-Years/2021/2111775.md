The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a novel image-guided
full-thickness suturing system that is simple, easy to use, and cost-effective
for gastrointestinal (GI) defects. These issues are more likely to require
intensive care and a long hospital stay and have high rates of morbidity and
mortality. Managing gastrointestinal defects endoscopically has obvious
advantages over surgical intervention, including shorter hospital stays, reduced
post procedure pain, faster recovery, and reduced total cost of care. The
proposed technology is single-use, disposable, and attached to an endoscope
(such as colonoscope, gastroscope), for better patient outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
advance the development of a novel, low-cost, image-guided suturing device for
flexible endoscopes simple and intuitive to use. Currently, no good solutions
exist for endoscopic tissue approximation and closure of large gastrointestinal
(GI) defects. Endoscopic clips are only effective for mucosa closure and small
size defects and the only endoscopic suturing device is considered cumbersome,
difficult to use, and expensive. The technical innovation of the proposed device
comprises a circular needle and a novel needle drive mechanism for a simplified
suturing technique. This project will be specifically focused on the advancement
of the technology, product development, design verification and validation of
the device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
