The proposed work will investigate the present occupancy of, use of, and noise
levels in selected portions of the radio spectrum. The instrumentation described
in the proposal body provides a fully calibrated time-history view of emissions
in any desired band over the frequency range of 10 MHz up to 8 GHz. In addition,
the temporal and spectral structure of all emissions or of any single emission
as received by an operational antenna or any other antenna can be provided.
Since existing instrumentation will be used during the first year, it will be
possible to initiate field measurements very rapidly.. It is anticipated that
more advanced instrumentation will be usedl after the first year to better
define the properties of noise generated by new wireless devices.
