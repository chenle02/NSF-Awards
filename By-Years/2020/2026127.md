The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research Phase II (SBIR) project is to help remote monitoring of patients with
chronic liver disease to reduce unnecessary procedures, improve quality of care,
and lower costs. This project will advance a novel internet-of-things (IoT)
smart-toilet for passive urine testing. This project will help provide a passive
way to monitor the 4.5 million liver disease patients in the United States, an
estimated market valued at $860 million. The proposed solution will enable
quality care to be delivered at home and in remote locations, improving
treatment for traditionally underserved populations. It can potentially be used
for other medical conditions as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II
project will develop a novel urinalysis system. The systems engineering include
integration of: mechanical and electrical engineering solutions to power
passive, automated mechatronics and sensor-testing equipment, biomedical
engineering for the development of biosensors, signal analysis to measure
physiological urinary biomarkers, software engineering related to the aspects of
firmware and internet-connected data processing, and data science for algorithm
development informed by longitudinal health data. The technical tasks include:
hardware design for manufacturing and assembly compatibility; development of
architecture for database management, device registration, over-the-air (OTA)
updates, and error handling; and front-end development for both web and mobile
data integration and visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
