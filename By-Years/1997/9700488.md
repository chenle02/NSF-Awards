9700488 Stopple/Imamoglu This award funds research by the second named principal
investigator on the following topics. First, she proposes to investigate a
series of conjectural liftings from classical modular forms to Siegel modular
forms. Second, she proposes to establish a Kronecker limit formula for the
symplectic group of degree 4. This involves finding the Laurent series expansion
of Siegel Eisenstein series about its pole. Such a result would have
applications to arithmetic and geometry. Third, with J. Hoffstein, she proposes
to develop a generalization of metaplectic forms. These new forms, as in the
case of metaplectic forms, are expected to lead to striking results in the
theory of L-functions. Last, jointly with L. Walling, she proposes to work on
generalized Jacobi theta functions. These theta functions can also be used to
make an appropriate Saito-Kurokawa conjecture since they provide a constructive
example of such a lift. This research falls into the general mathematical field
of Number Theory. Number Theory has its historical roots in the study of the
whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility
of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics
and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within
the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse
applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
