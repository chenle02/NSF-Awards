Many important image processing tasks involve solving some type of inverse
problem. Examples include: eliminating noise, compensating for low quality
optical systems, enhancing a black-and-white image with plausible colors and
improving the resolution of an image. All are ill-conditioned and so their
solutions must incorporate assumptions about natural images. Although
researchers have made astounding progress on these problems in the last fifty
years, a key limiting property of current techniques is that they analyze their
input more or less in isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will ask the
question of whether an image can be improved by evaluating trillions of image
patches constructed from millions of on-line images and using the set of
relevant patches to improve the quality of the original. This work will focus on
one particular inverse problem: super-resolution, or increasing the resolution
of an image to reveal missing details. The IBM/Google compute cluster in
conjunction with the MapReduce programming framework will be instrumental in
developing and evaluating these data-intensive algorithms. This research will
investigate scaling existing example-based techniques to use a massive training
database and develop entirely new techniques that better capitalize on this
amount of data by incorporating higher-level patterns in images such as scene
categories and object boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;
