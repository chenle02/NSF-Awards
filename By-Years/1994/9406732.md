Abstract ATM-9406732 Jacoby, Gordon C. Cook, Edward R. D'Arrigo, Rosanne D.
Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Title: Derivation and
Analysis of Climatic Information from Tree Rings This award supports
dendroclimatic research at the Tree-Ring Laboratory (TRL) at the Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory. Analysis of growth rings of old-aged trees provides an almost
unique tool for determining seasonal and year-by-year variations of past climate
to evaluate recent climatic changes. Large-scale reconstructions and local
studies show unusual warming in the past century, occasional abrupt climatic
changes, and more prevalent extremes in dry and wet events. The current effort
will update and improve the coverage of climatically-sensitive forest-ecotone
sites with the addition of sampling for moisture stress variations and inclusion
of subfossil material to extend the tree-ring record farther into the past. This
extension is crucial for comparison of the present, possibly anthropogenic,
warmer period to natural warmer periods of the more distant past.
