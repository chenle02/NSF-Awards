DNA sequence is the primary means by which information is propagated from
generation to generation. However, information can also be propagated as
chemical modifications of both DNA and proteins, such as histones, that are
associated with DNA. Heritable variation not associated with changes in the
primary DNA sequence is called epigenetic variation. What makes epigenetic
variation particularly intriguing is that it involves changes that can be both
heritable and reversible. The rules governing how and why those changes occur
remain poorly understood. Transposons, or "jumping genes", exhibit an
extraordinary degree of easily identifiable epigenetic variation, making them
ideal models for understanding its causes and consequences. Among transposons,
Mutator elements in maize have proved to be particularly useful. Using a series
of genetic resources, particularly a maize line that carries a single active
Mutator transposon, it has been possible to induce and propagate a wide variety
of distinct epigenetic states. The goal of this project is to determine the
molecular correlates to each of these states. Particular emphasis will be placed
on the ways in which epigenetic states can change over time, either over the
course of the development of an individual plant, or over the course of multiple
generations. These data are meant to complement global analysis of DNA and
histone modification by providing functional assessments of particular patterns
of these modifications in the context of a well-defined model system.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A sophisticated understanding of the
means by which epigenetic information is retained, stored, inherited and altered
has implications for fields as diverse as development, ecology, human disease
and evolutionary theory. In addition, because the Mutator system is a primary
means by which genes are mutated in maize, an ability to modulate Mutator
activity will benefit the entire maize community. Material and information
having to do with the use of Mu killer will be made freely available via web
sites (http://tinyurl.com/6xftvh and http://tinyurl.com/59fdwo), the Maize
Newsletter and the Maize Cooperation Stock Center. The project will benefit from
participation in project SEED, a program designed to expose historically under-
represented high school students to research environments. Through a
collaboration with Berkeley High School, the project will also host two students
as interns each summer. Each student will work in close collaboration with the
primary investigator on a specific problem, and each will present the results of
their work at the end of each field season.
