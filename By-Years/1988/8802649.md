This research is concerned with studying questions regarding open boundary
conditions for wave propagation problems and with implementing numerically these
boundary conditions. The topics on investigation include an analysis of the
effect on Rayleigh waves of radiation boundary conditions previously developed
by the investigator for elastic body waves, the development and analysis of
radiation conditions for water waves, and the investigation of some theoretical
questions involving derivative boundary conditions that rae used at open
boundaries. The first two problems will require extensive numerical computation.
