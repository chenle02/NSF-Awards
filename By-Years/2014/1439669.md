The planned University of Louisville (UL) site of the Electric Vehicle
Transportation and Electricity Convergence (EV-TEC) I/UCRC will have a research
focus on realizing energy efficient ground vehicles (REEGV). Topic areas include
hybrid and hybrid electric powertrain systems, lightweight structures, high
performance computing tools for vehicle architecture optimization, conventional
powertrains, frictional loss management, and advanced automotive manufacturing
methods.

The University of Louisville J.B. Speed School of Engineering has committed to
developing and launching an interdisciplinary graduate certificate program in
automotive engineering by the end of the planning period, followed by an
interdisciplinary Master of Science program in automotive engineering one year
later. The university and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) plans to
establish a professional chapter in this region in support of the industry.
Finally the UL site will sponsor an REEGV research seminar series, student
projects, and an SAE Supermileage team.
