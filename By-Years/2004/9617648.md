Project Abstract Project Abstract: This doctoral dissertation research is
conducted by Nicole Bouchez under the supervision of Daniel Friedman. The
economy is full of businesses buying and selling goods and services, but how do
they know about their rivals' incentives? Little is known about how groups of
people or businesses learn about each other's incentives when they are not
directly observable. Several competing theoretical models have been suggested
that show learning through economic interactions, however few empirical
comparisons of these models have been made. This project conducts a series of
computerized laboratory experiments to investigate group learning in three-
choice bimatrix games. The bimatrix games allow players to see their own options
and contingent payoffs, but do not allow them to see their opponents' payoffs.
This structure is broadly applicable and is a key step towards general, multiple
choice, strategic interactions. The data collected are used to compare how well
the different models of learning predict individual actions.
