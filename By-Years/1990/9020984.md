One of the most critical areas where law and medicine intersect is on medical
informed consent. From a scientific standpoint little is known about the range
of information that should be disclosed to patients to enhance their ability to
make an informed decision. Both theoretically and methodologically, there is
need for an analytically based approach to enable such decisionmaking. Dr.
Fischhoff and his colleagues are seeking to develop such an approach to
disclosure that is applicable to physicians' legal obligations to insure
informed consent from patients. Their work aims to model quantitatively the
variation in evaluations of possible health outcomes of patients. The research
draws on a new technique whereby logistic regression is used to explain the
variable contribution of input information to decision variation in a Monte
Carlo simulation of a model. This method will produce an objective, "reasonable"
range of subjective differences. These objective values will then be applied in
a decision analysis modeling of several medical procedures. This study promises
important advances. It will show the strengths and limitations of the analysis
and permit the further development, generalization, and implementation of this
approach within the medical-legal setting. Also, it is an essential precursor to
examining the ways in which the law can accommodate quantitative analyses
underlying professional disclosure practices.
