This award will provide funds to equip a laboratory course in recombinant DNA
techniques for undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin. The
purpose of this course is to provide "hands-on" experience in common molecular
research techniques used in the plant biotechnology industry. Experiments to be
covered include creating "recombinant" plants using Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation, and basic biochemical procedures for extracting and analyzing
proteins and nucleic acids. The horticulture undergraduate curriculum has
historically not included such techniques. With the increasing use such
techniques in horticulture graduate research and with the increased
incorporation of biotechnology techniques into the horticulture industry, it is
now important to provide horticulture undergraduates with hands-on familiarity
of these techniques. In the long-term, these students become our leaders in
their respective industries. Therefore, by providing better- educated future
leaders, the proposed project may help to dispel myths and fear concerning the
role and safety of biotechnology procedures. The grantee institution is matching
this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
