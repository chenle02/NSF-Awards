This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the
formation of improved performance, lead-free, piezoelectric ceramics for various
high performance sensor and transducer applications. The piezoelectric response
of Barium Zirconium Titanate (BZT) ceramic compositions will be enhanced by
altering the degree of grain orientation within the ceramic. Seeding with a
small percentage of properly oriented anisometric, isostructural particles
(template particles) within the bulk BZT ceramic will produce the texture during
thermal densification. The piezoelectric response of the textured BZT ceramics
would be comparable to current lead-based materials, which would allow for
greater utility in the commercial sector due to environmental constraints.
Commercially textured, piezoelectric BZT ceramics can be used for various
electromechanical transducer and sensor applications, which include the
aerospace, marine, biomedical, and ultrasonic industries. The BZT ceramics have
the potential of replacing all applications currently using lead zirconate
titanate (PZT) ceramics, which are environmentally unacceptable because of the
lead content.
