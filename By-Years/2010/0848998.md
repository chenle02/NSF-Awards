This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enhance the
capabilities of imaging biomolecular ions from solid tissue samples using matrix
assisted laser desorption time-of-flight imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS).
Currently, organic acid matrices are used to promote the desorption and
ionization of biomolecules from the tissue surface, however, these types of
matrices have a number of limitations. Specifically, extensive fragmentation can
interfere with the analysis of lipids, peptides and pharmaceuticals in the low
mass region (m/z &lt; 500), and organic matrices tend to form large crystals
upon drying which can limit imaging resolution and repeatability. NanoComposix
is developing a new matrix that utilizes gold nanoparticles to efficiently
ionize biomolecules from tissue samples. This gold nanoparticle matrix has much
lower background ion signal, has improved imaging resolution, and specifically
ionizes molecules not observed using traditional organic matrices. MALDI-IMS
will be used to validate optimized nanoparticle formulations and application
methods using hepatic and neuronal tissue slices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this research are the potential for profound affects on the
scientific communities understanding of disease, capabilities for early disease
diagnosis, and our ability to find new drug targets. Information on the content
and spatial distribution of biomarkers in tissue will accelerate the development
of ?personalized medicine? where drugs can be selected based on individual
patient characteristics. The current organic matrices used for MALDI-IMS are
limited and there is an immediate need for new matrices with unique specificity
and sensitivity towards biomarkers that are not observed using standard
matrices.
