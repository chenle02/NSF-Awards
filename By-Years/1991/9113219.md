This research focuses on semiconductor heterostructures grown in a Riber 32P
molecular beam epitaxy machine dedicated exclusively to nonlinear optics,
probably the only one in the world. Over the last several years considerable
experimental and theoretical capabilities and experience have been acquired and
developed to understand the band-edge nonlinearities of semiconductors and to
design, fabricate, and operate nonlinear optical devices. Having under one roof
capabilities for design, growth, fabrication, linear and nonlinear spectroscopy,
and many-body theory has accelerated this process, leading to synergistic
interactions. In the area of nonlinear materials, research will focus on the
bandstructure, optical nonlinearity, and gain of strained layer superlattices,
relevant as materials for low-power nonlinear devices and low-threshold lasers.
Research on waveguide structures includes nonlinear directional couplers with
and without current injection, as many-n phase shifter by current injection, and
a 10-um intersubband-transition laser. Research on etalon structures
concentrates on all- optical switches for optical communication, low- power
slow-response etalons, and the sensitivity to external feedback of vertical-
cavity surface- emmitting lasers. All findings for nonlinear optics apply
equally well to optoelectronics, since the steady-state room-temperature band-
edge properties of a semiconductor are determined solely by the carrier density
however generated. //
