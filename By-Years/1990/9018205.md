Dr. Honzatko proposes to carry out x-ray crystallographic investigations which
will reveal the structural basis for the mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition
of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli, the enzyme which governs
the first committed step in the de novo synthesis of adenine nucleotides. The
synthetase from E. coli may be the first enzyme of the purine biosynthetic
pathway for which a high resolution crystal structure will be available.
Furthermore, the synthetase is a prime example of an important class of enzme
involved in ternary reactions. Indeed, adenylosuccinate synthetase is a
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolyase which is either distantly related to GTP
binding proteins of mammals or represents an altogehter distinct class of GTP
hydrolyses. Two different crystal forms of adenlylosuccinate synthetase have
been obtained and are under investigation . The complex of the enzyme with
succinate and the complex with succinate, inosine monophosphate and magnesium
guanosine diphosphate. Studies of these two crystal forms will reveal the
details of substrate-enzyme interactions and the conformational changes induced
in the synthetase by the binding of substrates and substrate analogues.
Additional structural investigations are planned as well, specifically of the
complex of the antibiotic hadacidin with the first crystalline form and several
mutant forms of the enzyme.
