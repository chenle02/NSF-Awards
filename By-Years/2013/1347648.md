This proposal will integrate young scientists into a Gordon Research Conference
focused on the emerging field of macroecology, which incorporates a synthesis of
ecology, evolution and physiology to develop a mechanistic approach to
understanding ecological patterns in nature. Students and postdocs will be
mentored in an atmosphere where young scientists are comfortable sharing ideas
with their peers and with more senior scientists. The increased participation of
the future leaders of cross-disciplinary research will improve the scientific
discourse at the meeting by bringing fresh ideas and perspectives on this
important new synthetic field of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macroecology
holds significant potential to increase our scientific understanding of plant
and animal responses to climate change, habitat alterations, and other
environmental perturbations. This proposal will help support and mentor the next
generation of cross-disciplinary scientists by providing them access to a
network of scientists with similar interests, providing venues for them to
improve their presentation skills, and receive mentoring from leaders in their
fields. The program will also target members of under-represented groups in
biology, to ensure that these individuals have access to the ideas presented at
the Gordon Research Conference.
