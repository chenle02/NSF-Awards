This proposal requests funds for equipment and software to improve laboratory
activities in four courses in Cognitive and Linguistic Science and to transform
the present laboratory, which can serve only a small number of students from
these classes, into a virtual laboratory that will be accessible to the growing
numbers of students from their dormitories and other sites on campus. Space and
equipment will continue to be reserved for close, direct use and supervision on
site. Two Unix workstations are central to the project, one to serve as a
gateway to the campus-wide ethernet network and the other to serve as the
working laboratory computer and storage node for speech and visual data. In
addition, five Powermacs and six PCs provide students with access to the
laboratory and instructional software native to those systems and remote
connections to the Unix workstations. Improvements supported by the equipment
include computer-assisted programs in language analysis, graphic illustration of
speech mechanisms during articulation, instruction in semantics and logic via
Tarski's World, experience with design and data analysis using interactive
design programs, instruction in parsing via neural net programs, and instruction
in and manipulation of canonical findings in vision via Visionlab and the Active
Eye.
