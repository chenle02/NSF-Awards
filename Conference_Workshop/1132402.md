The main goal of the UNCG Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference is to
provide a venue for promoting education and research in the field of mathematics
and statistics specifically tailored for undergraduate and graduate students to
present results of their research and to allow students of all levels to
interact with and learn from each other. Our conference has started as an annual
undergraduate student conference 2005 and expanded to include graduate
researchers since 2009. The conference has now established a tradition of
attracting active student researchers and their faculty mentors from the North
Carolina and Virginia. With the support of NSF, we hope to attract diverse group
of participants from the whole Southeastern Atlantic region.

The opportunity for personal interaction among students and between students and
faculty is a hallmark of our conference. These interactions enhance the research
infrastructure and are essential for the success of (student) research and for
training a new generation of mathematicians and statisticians. Moreover, women
and minorities currently underrepresented in mathematical research are
especially encouraged to participate in the conference and in the past students
from these underrepresented groups accounted for about half of the supported
participants.
