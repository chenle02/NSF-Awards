This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop
anisotropic hard magnetic nanoparticles, based on rare earth transition metal
compounds, with particle size in the range of 200 nm down to 100 nm. These
nanoparticles will be consolidated by screen-printing into permanent magnet
structures with dimensions to bridge the gap between the permanent magnet thin
films (few nanometers to a few microns) and micromachined permanent magnets
(larger than 500 microns). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anisotropic hard magnetic
nanopowders consolidated by screen printing can serve as small permanent magnet
structures with dimensions between ten microns to hundreds of microns for
various devices. The improved magnetic properties will yield enhanced
performance in these applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
