This planning grant to Tufts University Department of Chemical and Biological
Engineering, to integrate chemical and biological engineering under one unifying
banner and thus adds biology to the base in a transparent manner. To achieve
this integration, five systems (a biological cell, a biological organ, a polymer
plant, a silicon plant and an ammonia plant) will be introduced into the
beginning courses in parallel and followed throughout the rest of the course of
study in each core course. This approach, called a "threaded curriculum",
provides the seamless integration desired. The "threads" also provide an ongoing
context for the curriculum.. The powerful paradigm of chemical engineering can
be utilized and we expose both &lt;br/&gt;the commonality and differences
between these systems in terms of both complexity and scale.&lt;br/&gt;
