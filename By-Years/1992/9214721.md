Medical research and clinical practice will benefit form real time access to
supercomputers, direct interaction with other researchers and clinicians, and
the ability to transmit images and other large data files in a real time mode.
This will be made possible by the High Performance Computing and Communications
(HPCC) Project and the National Research and Education Network (NREN)&gt; The
availability and description of these capabilities needs to be made known to the
medical informatics community. The conference theme, together with the published
abstracts of the presentations, is designed to accomplish this objective. This
conference will bring together policy level representatives from the numerous
constituencies which are essential for the design, development, deployment, and
operation of a robust, high performance computer network to meet pressing needs
for improved research collaboration and productivity in the United States.
