0339201 Cantu The Adelante: Focus on Latinas in Math, Science and Engineering
Project seeks to add a number of Latinas to the rolls of graduate programs in
math and science and ultimately to the numbers of faculty in these fields. The
proposed project will bring together established women in these areas with
promising young scholars and undergraduate students for a 3-day summer
institute. The proposed project integrates 70 participants into the existing
annual Mujeres Activas en Letras Cambio Social Summer Institute (MALCS-SI), to
be held at the University of Texas San Antonio campus in August 2003. Although
the Institute is multi-disciplinary, the MALCS event is generally attended by
Latinas in the humanities and social sciences, with little emphasis or
attendance by Latinas in math and science and engineering. The 2003 organizing
committee would like to sponsor the first annual Adelante! Focus on Math and
Science and Engineering. The program will consist of parallel concurrent
sessions to the Institute where nine senior faculty members all Latinas in Math
and Science and Engineering will offer advise, present their current research
and career achievements, as well as, speak about the process for achieving a
graduate degree in math and science and engineering. In short, they will serve
as role-models and mentors to the 30 participants who will be drawn from South
Texas institutions of higher learning, whose student body is predominantly
Latino. The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of Latinas
pursuing doctoral degrees in math and science and engineering. By targeting 30
undergraduate and master degree level Latina students in South Texas, the event
will generate an interest in doctoral programs and subsequently will increase
the number of applications to graduate programs in math and science and
engineering in the next 3 years. Since the MALCS was formed, the annual
conferences and institutes have inspired undergraduate students to pursue
doctoral degrees. Several students who first attended as undergraduates are now
participating as graduate students or as assistant professors. Indeed some who
began attending the conference in the mid 80s as graduate students have already
achieved full-professor status. The MALCS 2003 committee would like to do the
same for math and science and engineering and plans to work with Latina members
of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science
(SACNAS) to make that goal a reality.
