The laboratory component of a curriculum option in electronic materials,
offered jointly by the EE and MSE Departments, will be enhanced. This will
provide state -of-the-art training in synthesis and characterization of bulk and
thin film electronic and optoelectronic materials by adding to existing
capability in the Microfabrication and Electronic Materials Laboratories. The
emphasis is on establishing structure/property relationships.
