The Robert Noyce Urban Mathematics Educator Program (UMEP) is increasing the
number of high-quality secondary mathematics teachers who teach in urban school
districts and are committed to remaining in urban school environments. The
project is awarding stipends to 40 UMEP students (10 per year) who hold a
baccalaureate, masters or doctoral degree in mathematics, science, or a related
field and commit to teaching in the Atlanta Public Schools or the DeKalb County
School System. The UMEP students are matriculated into the Teacher Education
Environment Mathematics and Science (TEEMS) Program at Georgia State University.
TEEMS is a Master's Degree alternative certification program that began in 1994
as a nontraditional approach to mathematics and science teacher education for
grades 7 through 12. The UMEP program includes strategies to recruit talented
individuals with mathematics backgrounds who demonstrate a commitment to teach
secondary mathematics in urban high need schools. UMEP students participate in
the Metro-Atlanta Beginning Teacher Induction and Support Consortium, an
induction program that provides personal, group, and web contact between
beginning teachers and mentors. Mentoring is provided from entry into the
program through the first three years of teaching and includes participation in
Professional Learning Communities consisting of UMEP students, the UMEP
Leadership Team, teacher mentors, and TEEMS faculty. The evaluation plans focus
on the effectiveness of the UMEP program in recruiting, preparing, and retaining
high quality mathematics teachers. The project includes a longitudinal research
component to investigate how the alternative certification program prepares high
quality teachers for urban school environments.
