The research program will develop a large-scale digital archive of children's
literature and explore problems in technology for access and use by children,
and in rights management. There are five primary&lt;br/&gt;goals: (1) to give
children around the world access to international children's literature, (2) to
understand data acquisition and rights management in the creation of a large-
scale digital library, (3) to develop interface technologies that support
children using large amounts of digital information, (4) to evaluate the impact
of such a collection on children's librariesa and children's librarians, (5) to
evaluate the impact and benefits of such a collection for children. The project
plans to develop a digital library of 10,000 children's books representing 100
cultures.
