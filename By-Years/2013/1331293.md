To what extent is human cognition (e.g., visual perception, memory, and
categorization) augmented by language? Does language only allow us to
communicate with more flexibility or does language transform cognition, allowing
humans to represent and manipulate information in novel ways? A series of
studies previously conducted by this investigator has shown that language has
pervasive and surprising effects on a range of abilities, such as learning new
categories, using knowledge about familiar categories, visual memory, and even
perception: Hearing a word can literally change what one sees. The proposed
studies build on this earlier work by exploring the design features of language
that make it an especially useful tool for constructing and manipulating mental
representations. The studies use a variety of behavioral paradigms together with
noninvasive brain stimulation to explore the behavioral and neural processes
involved in the interaction of language, learning new categories, and retrieving
information about familiar concepts and categories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed studies are critical not only for understanding the broad issue of
language-augmented cognition, but also for the potential to understand applied
issues related to linguistic and cognitive development. Hearing less language in
early childhood leads not only to negative outcomes in using language to
communicate, but appears to extend more broadly to other cognitive abilities. By
understanding the mechanisms by which language augments cognition, we will
better understand the broad consequences of language disorders, which may inform
the development of effective interventions. The work will also enhance
infrastructure for research and education by implementing and disseminating
tools for efficient and cost-effective data collection over the web using crowd-
sourcing services, which allow for generalizability to broader populations and
will allow undergraduates to more easily conduct original research projects.
