A challenge facing theoretical computer scientists today is not so much to
obtain more trendy results of limited long term significance, but rather, to try
to formulate a more coherent framework and methodology. To meet this challenge
more traditional branches of mathematics, in addition to combinatorics, will
play a more significant role. This project will investigate circuit complexity,
cooperative games and interactive proof systems and develop new proof techniques
and methodologies in hopes to obtain a more coherent framework for complexity
theory and contribute to our understanding of the nature of computation.
