In the era of big data, data sets may be massive in size and have high
dimensionality. Examples include social media data, high-resolution image data,
and genomic data. High dimensionality and massive sample size pose great
computational and statistical challenges. This project aims to investigate novel
optimization techniques and statistical analytic tools for big data collected in
important applications. The project will significantly enhance the capabilities
of optimization and statistics in analyzing big data. Results of the project are
anticipated to benefit a broad range of areas including public health, medical
studies, and financial portfolio management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
consists of three sub-projects to advance knowledge in modern optimization
techniques and statistical procedures for big data. (1) The project studies a
unified framework for high-dimensional constrained regularization, and further
investigates the statistical performance of a general framework for high-
dimensional data under folded concave penalty and fixed constraints. (2) The
project explores efficient distributed algorithms for constrained statistical
learning, investigating communication-efficient sample-splitting algorithms to
handle the vast number of samples and high communication cost in high-
dimensional constrained regularization problems with folded concave penalty. The
project will study the convergence of the new algorithms for non-convex learning
as well as statistical convergence. The work demonstrates the necessity to
consider statistical analysis and optimization analysis simultaneously. (3) The
investigators plan to apply the methodology in analyzing big data sets to
address clinical and scientific questions related to Parkinson's
disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
