This project supports development of a microprocessor-based and computer-
interfaced data acquisition system for the undergraduate Mechanical Engineering
laboratory. In addition to data generated in the laboratory, the students will
also have the capability to acquire real world data through remote sensing.
Sensors are installed in the field for the measurement of temperatures,
pressures, flows, volt- amperes, strains, and mechanical vibrations on a
mechanical system. The signals from the sensors are transmitted to the data
acquisition laboratory via telephone lines. This provides the students
opportunities for "hands on" experience with telecommunications in the
acquisition, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data. Implementation of the
undergraduate instrumentation laboratory at this institution enables the faculty
to respond to the revolutionary effects of digital technology in mechanical
engineering education. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
