The project aims is to identify a set of psychometric and growth models that
will permit researchers and curriculum developers to describe and test the
interrelationships between students' progress along two or more learning
progressions. Unlike the current thinking in the field, these psychometric and
growth models will not assume linearity, continuity, or unidimensionality of
student learning. The project proposes three goals: gathering evidence for the
existence of non-linear patterns of learning that demonstrate branching of the
learning progressions; gathering evidence for the existence of non-linear
patterns of learning that demonstrate parallel learning progressions, and
proposing the psychometric and growth models for these types of learning
progressions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The psychometric models will be developed to
estimate the cognitive models underlying complex learning patterns. The work
will progress in four phases: (1) exploring, statistically, existing datasets
from NSF-funded projects containing simultaneous measures of learning on more
than one learning progression; (2) testing the psychometric and growth models
using the existing data; (3) collecting and analyzing new data; and (4) testing
the psychometric and growth models using new data.
