This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will advance the
implementation of Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP) computers by providing a
commercially available hardware scheduler to replace the inadequate scheduling
software used by all operating systems. Hardware scheduling is a critical
enabling technology in the evolution of sophisticated parallel processing
computing systems that simplifies scheduling of complex multithreaded
applications, permits inter-SMP computer scheduling, eliminates the extremely
complex scheduling software, and ensures that all processors are always
executing applications code in place of scheduling. The objective of the
research is to make a commercially available product that will benefit a wide
range of operating systems and hardware platforms by specifying a simplified
operating system interface to support any processor and validating that a full
implementation of a sub-microsecond hardware scheduler is feasible using
commercially available, large programmable hardware components. The research
will include preparation of a software requirements document to permit any
operating system to be easily interfaced to the hardware scheduler, preparation
of a hardware requirements document for the hardware scheduler's behavior,
investigation of commercially available, large programmable hardware components
with the capabilities of meeting the requirements of the hardware scheduler,
selection of several components, and verification that the required logic can
fit in the components and obtain sub-microsecond hardware scheduling. At the end
of the initial effort it is expected that all objectives will have been met
permitting the building of a cost-effective, prototype hardware scheduler
suitable for any processor running any operating system on any system bus. This
prototype could then be put into production quickly and cost effectively. The
hardware scheduler could become a part of every computer system, including
single processor systems, because they would also benefit from elimination of
software scheduling code. Therefore, any operating system would be capable of
running SMP and inter-SMP scheduling without writing and maintaining the
extremely complex scheduling software required for SMP scheduling. In addition,
because the scheduling is done by the hardware scheduler, the processors have
more time to execute application code. In addition, it will enable the
configuration of massively parallel computing systems with guaranteed scheduling
behavior but no additional overhead. This technology is particularly applicable
in the client/server environment and transaction processing.
