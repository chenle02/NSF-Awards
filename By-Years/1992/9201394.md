The Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) Observatory has two fine telescopes in a good
site and some very useful instrumentation. It serves a substantial constituency
of astronomers who pursue a wide variety of projects. However, the observatory
computer systems have become outmoded and overloaded. New computers are needed
to support instrumental developments already in progress. We propose to replace
the current observatory computers with relatively inexpensive RISC-based
workstations and modern peripheral equipment. This will make it practical to use
large- format CCD detectors and to properly reduce and inspect data on site. The
result will be a great enhancement of scientific productivity of the
observatory.
