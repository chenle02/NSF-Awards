9416825 Altan This workshop addresses German practices in design and
manufacturing related to technical education, training and technology
interchange. The attendees will present, review, debate, and summarize the
principles which are thought to underlie the perceived success of the German
system and relate these principles to the education system in the United States.
Recommendations will be made for educational institutions, government agencies,
and industry. The purpose of the workshop is to contribute to the acceleration
of education and training related to design and manufacturing. It is intended to
provide the opportunity for the United States to learn from the German
experience and to cause thoughtful consideration of related approaches in the
United States.
