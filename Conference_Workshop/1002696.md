This award provides support for participants in a one-day multidisciplinary
workshop on Third-Generation Solar Technologies to be held in conjunction with
the 2009 Materials Research Society Fall Meeting, to be held in Boston,
Massachusetts. The workshop is part of the Super Sunday events that precede the
Fall Meeting on November 29, 2009.

The purpose of the workshop is to provide information to the Materials Research
community about the CHE-DMR-DMS Solar Energy Initiative (SOLAR)
(http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503298). The workshop features
a series of lectures and panel discussions to highlight the current state of
materials research and mathematical modeling for solar science and technology,
as well as a poster session showing work that involves collaboration between
mathematicians and physical scientists.
