This research project explores questions in commutative algebra. Commutative
algebra is the study of solutions of polynomial equations, which are ubiquitous
throughout science. One way to study polynomial functions is to view them
instead in a simpler clock-arithmetic-like setting (where for example, 6+7 = 1,
in other words, 7 hours after 6 o'clock is 1 o'clock). Translating between these
two number systems has been a fruitful strategy for centuries, with applications
on both sides; for example, this sort of mathematics is essential in modern
secure communications systems. This project aims to develop tools to help work
directly in what is called a "mixed characteristic" setting, which sits between
the classical numerical world and the clock-arithmetic-like setting. These tools
will help unify the classical and clock arithmetic settings. The investigator
plans to develop packages for open source software and to write a book on these
topics. The project includes training of graduate students through involvement
in the research.

This project aims to develop a theory of singularities in mixed characteristic
commutative algebra, with an eye towards geometric applications. This theory
will unify and generalize the singularities coming from the minimal model
program in algebraic geometry with the singularities coming out of tight closure
theory in commutative algebra. Recent advances in commutative algebra utilizing
the theory of perfectoid algebras and spaces has made now the right time to
develop this theory. These tools should be able to replace Kodaira-type
vanishing theorems in some applications where the latter do not apply. Inspired
by these connections, the investigator will also study characteristic 0 and
characteristic p > 0 commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
