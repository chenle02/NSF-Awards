This project supports the storage system enhancement to an existing high
performance cluster (HPC) already located at PI?s institution to address
continuously increasing I/O and data intensive computing need among the
participating institutions and beyond. While sharing physical resources among
multiple institutions is clearly cost-effective, protection of data and privacy
is an ongoing concern that inhibits large-scale cooperative resource sharing.
The multi-terabyte data storage system deployment at a remote institution with
multi-gigabit connections achieves fast migration of research data for seamless
computing while achieving maximum protection of the data at the remote site. The
system allows research collaborators to stream real-time data to the HPC;
thereby supporting remote HPC facilities for their computational needs. When
successful, time-sensitive applications such as disaster response / emergency
preparedness systems can be executed in an ad-hoc manner. The networked HPC
infrastructure provides optimal access to areas of the state that remain less
supported; thereby supporting the needs of the broader science and engineering
communities.

The acquired system will enable collaborative research including the following:

- Data-Mining, Prediction and Data Analysis Frameworks Using Social Network
Analysis;

- Hybrid Monte-Carlo/Data-Mining Modeling of the Structure-Property Relations of
Polymeric Materials;

- Biomedical Image Processing (Treatment Planning/Tumor Detection/Genome wide
high throughput SNP analysis of Human Spit);

- Detection and Analyses of Electrophysiological Signals from Neurons
Interacting with Ligands, Neurotransmitters and Nano Materials;

- Analysis of Soil conditions and Ground Motions for Earth Quake Related
Applications
