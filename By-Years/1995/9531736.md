The PI will build on previous work improving the understanding of the role of
photospheric magnetic activity in determining solar irradiance variation. The
main objectives are: (1) improving empirical models of variations in total
irradiance using the digital, full-disc CaK images produced from the Mount
Wilson daily spectroheliograms obtained between 1915 and 1985; (2) using these
digital CaK data to produce the first empirical models of long-term solar
spectral irradiance variations in the ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet,
extending back to 1915; (3) extending digitization of the Mount Wilson data to
include plates of different format obtained between 1905 and 1915; and (4)
extending previous study of the behavior of plages and spots at times of highest
solar activity.
