This award provides support for a one-day conference, The NYC Regional Math
Alliance Conference, to be held at Kean University in New Jersey on September
15, 2018. The NYC Regional Math Alliance is an affiliate of the National
Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences (Math Alliance) that
is focused on an effort to increase the number of students from underrepresented
groups who obtain doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. The conference
will highlight the research of students being mentored by the NYC Regional Math
Alliance and will promote a continued interest in mathematics by fostering an
atmosphere conducive to mathematical discussion and to the formulation and
nurturing of new collaborations.

The conference will further the goal of increasing the numbers of students from
underrepresented groups obtaining doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences
in several ways. On the one hand, the exposure of student participants to poster
presentations and talks on mathematical research by their peers will heighten
their interest in the subject. Meeting and interacting with faculty from PhD
programs at nearby institutions presents the pursuit of a PhD as an accessible
and realizable goal. Additionally, the conference will contribute to the
building of a community of faculty interested in mentoring students from
underrepresented groups. There are already a large number of faculty in the New
Jersey and NYC area committed to the aims of the conference and this meeting
will help organize and further their efforts. More details on the conference can
be found on the webpage, http://mathalliance.ccny.cuny.edu/conference-2018/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
