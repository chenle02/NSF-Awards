This project will require substantially enhanced efforts of international
coordination on part of all STEP (Solar- Terrestrial Energy Program)
participants. To assure the continuity of operations, the Bureau of the
Scientific Committee on Solar Terrestrial Physics re-appointed the Principal
Investigator for another term of his functions as the International STEP
Coordinator. His participation during the coming years will be of benefit to the
STEP scientists in the United States, because through his office, a close link
to the international STEP activities and information will be assured.
