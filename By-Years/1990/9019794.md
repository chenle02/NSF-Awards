The objective of the proposed research is to extend the University of Denver
atlas of high resolution (0.002 cm-1) infrared solar absorption stratospheric
spectra and the corresponding laboratory studies initiated under previous NSF
grants. The currently published 0.002 cm-1 stratospheric atlas covers the
intervals 800-810 cm-1, 934-960 cm-1, 992-1002 cm-1 and 1240-1260 cm-1. The
major objectives of the proposed research are: 1) to extend the 0.002 cm-1
resolution atlases over additional intervals in the 2.5-30 region, mostly with
solar and laboratory spectra already obtained, and new spectra anticipated to be
obtained in 1990-1992. 2) to extend the spectroscopic analysis of specific
stratospheric molecules, such as O3, HNO3, COF2 and others, from the laboratory
and the stratospheric spectra.
