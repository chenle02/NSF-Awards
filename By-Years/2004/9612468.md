ABSTRACT EEC-9612468 STINNER Management of pest species in agricultural
environments has become highly technical since the introduction of synthetic
chemicals as pesticides. The judicious use of these chemical tools, integrated
with cultural, mechanical and biological controls to minimize effects on the
environment is an integral part of Integrated Pest Management. (IPM). The North
Carolina State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) continues to meet the criteria of the I/UCRC
Program. The Center helped start the Global IPM Informational Database
Management system during its first five years as an I/UCRC. This has grown into
a national program that is an outstanding accomplishment. The research of the
Center will continue to address: 1) Impact of pest management on environmental
quality; 2) Crop loss assessment and economic threshold determinations; 3)
Genetic engineering for improved pest management; 4) Improved understanding of
pest biology and ecology; 5) Pesticide resistance detection and management; and
6) Development of communications and decision support systems for IPM.
