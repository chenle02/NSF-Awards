9408201 Thompson The goal of this study is quantitative understanding of the
origins and evolution of texture during grain growth in thin films, and the
ability to accurately predict grain size and orientation distributions as a
function of thermal and process history of different film/substrate
combinations. Experimental and theoretical research on grain growth and texture
evolution in polycrystalline films is focused towards the competitive effects on
minimization of the film/substrate interface energy and minimization of strain
energy densities. The research includes the polycrystalline-silver/single-
crystal-nickel system, silver/copper, and a number of polycrystalline metallic
films on a variety of silica-coated substrates with different thermal expansion
coefficients. Strain energy is controlled through the choice of substrates and
through modifications in thermal history. Known strains are imposed using
4-point and 3-point bending. Texture evolution is characterized using thin film
X-ray diffraction and several electron diffraction techniques. Grain sizes are
characterized using electron and focused ion beam microscopy and film stresses
are monitored by measurements of wafer curvature, both during and after heating
and grain growth. A computer program for simulation of grain growth in thin
films will be improved to account for orientation-dependent strain-energy-
density differences, in both elastically strained and plastically deformed
films. %%% This research should improve technology for creating thin films used
in a variety of industrial applications. ***
