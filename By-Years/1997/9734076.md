Minsker 9734076 The objectives of this research are to: 1) develop improved
methods for solving field-scale groundwater remediation design problems; 2)
improve access to optimal groundwater remediation design tools by practitioners
and students; 3) use active learning techniques to improve education of students
at all levels; and 4) teach graduate students how to develop and apply coupled
optimization and simulation models. Multiscale optimization methods will be
developed to improve the computational efficiency of an optimal control model
for aerobic in situ bioremediation design developed in previous work. This will
enable accurate modeling of heterogeneous, field-scale sites. A hybrid genetic
algorithm will be developed to address difficulties with local optima and to
allow fixed costs to be considered in an efficient manner. Once the multiscale
method and hybrid genetic algorithm with the best computational efficiency have
been identified, an integrated model for field-scale in situ bioremediation
design will be developed that will incorporate multiscale methods into a hybrid
genetic algorithm. Undergraduate research assistants will program graphical user
interfaces to facilitate use of the design models developed in this research by
students and practitioners from industry. The models will then be used as the
core for an educational game to teach students the utility of optimal design
tools for designing cost-effective remediation solutions. The game will be
played in undergraduate and graduate courses and in outreach programs using a
contest format between small student teams. A new graduate course on coupled
optimization and simulation modeling will also be created to teach students the
complexities associated with developing and applying such models. The course
will serve as a forum for presenting research results and developing improved
methods. ***
