The sense of hearing plays a crucial role in our lives, as it helps us orient
ourselves in space and communicate with each other; nevertheless, it remains one
of the least understood of the senses, particularly at the first level of
processing. To be sensitive to extremely faint sounds, the auditory system must
detect movements at a scale comparable to atomic dimensions. This project will
explore how the inner ear achieves its remarkable sensitivity. In particular,
measurements will be made of the movements of hair cells, specialized cells that
detect mechanical signals from incoming sound waves and convert them into
electrical signals sent to the brain. Using an internal auditory organ from the
frog, the tissue will be placed in the appropriate chemical environment, and
movements with be recorded with a high-speed camera. The hypothesis is that the
response will show synchronization (i.e., that the cells will move in unison
when given a mechanical stimulus) which can serve to explain the extreme
sensitivity of the whole organ. The goal is to determine how interactions
between individual elements affect the behavior of the whole sensor, and thus
help answer one of the long-open problems in auditory neuroscience. The project
will serve to train graduate and undergraduate students in techniques at the
interface of physics and sensory neuroscience, which will be complemented by new
courses specifically designed for this purpose and recently introduced into the
departmental curriculum.
