Dr. Dean M. Roddick, Department of Chemistry, University of Wyoming, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division for the study of the organometallic chemistry of
fluoroalkylphosphine transition metal complexes in acid and superacid media.
Preparative routes will be developed for new cationic fluoroalkylphosphine-group
10 metal complexes, which incorporate weakly coordinating anions, and for
analogous neutral d8 metal complexes. Using this inventory of compounds the
general area of acid-mediated organometallic chemistry will be outlined.
Initially, the dimerization of functionalized olefins, proton induced carbonyl
insertion, ethylene/CO copolymerization, and acid directed alkane
functionalization will be examined in acidic situations. Based on the results of
this portion of the project, the chemistry will be extended to solution and
solid superacid media. Many important chemical reactions are carried out under
acidic conditions. However, organometallic compounds, which are important
laboratory and commercial catalysts and reagents, often are not stable in acidic
environments. This project targets a newly discovered class of organometallic
compounds that have remarkable tolerance for acidic surroundings and aims at
developing new types of metal catalysts that can promote a variety of reactions
in acid and superacid media.
