This grant supports the development of a radio frequency-scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) for research and education in nanostructures at Boston
University. The radio frequency-STM (rf-STM) has the potential to emerge as one
of the most central tools in nanotechnology. Broadband (ultra-fast) operation
will be accomplished by integrating a radio frequency tank circuit to the STM
tunnel junction. A commercial STM system will be acquired and modified to allow
integration with microfabricated tips, radio frequency circuitry and
electronics. With its superb spatial and temporal resolution, the rf-STM will
have broad impacts in numerous experimental fields of technological and
fundamental importance. Among the experimental systems where the rf-STM might
enable breakthroughs are nano-scale mechanical systems, nano-scale electronic
systems, superconducting systems and spin systems (using the technique of spin
polarized STM). The new system will enable time resolved studies of defect and
adsorbate motion on surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several students and
postdoctoral researchers will be trained in the principles, construction and
operation of the radio frequency-STM. Upon completion, the rf-STM will be used
in studies of particularly interesting problems in nano-scale structures,
thereby enabling important education in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The
developed rf-STM will be made available to interested research groups at Boston
University and the Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the National Security
Agency to take advantage of the collaborative environments in these
institutions. This project initiates collaboration between a government
laboratory with superb facilities, the Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the
National Security Agency, and Boston University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
