This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming in the purchase of a Gas
Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). This new instrumentation will enhance
greatly research in a number of areas including the following: 1) Sterochemical
dependence of vesicle bilayer properties, 2) Biomimetic oxidation of guanidines
by metalloporphyrin oxo and nitrosyl complexes: Toward a rational understanding
of the biosynthesis of nitric oxide from arginine, 3) Photochemical oxidation of
organic sulfides, 4) Reactive geometries of carbonyl-Lewis acid complexes, 5)
Mechanistic and preparative studies of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to
hydrocarbons using polymer/metal electrodes. %%% The gas chromatograph mass
spectrometer (GC/MS) is used to separate the molecules in a reaction mixture, to
measure the relative amounts of the various molecules present and to obtain
information about the molecular weight of the molecules present. This instrument
is essential for research work in modern chemical synthesis.
