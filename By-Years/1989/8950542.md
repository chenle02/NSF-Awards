Equipment is supporting efforts to offer instruction in molecular biology
through formal coursework and independent research. The equipment purchased
(spectrophotometers, transilluminators, electronic balances, microcentrifuges,
pH meters, shaking waterbaths, an incubator, and a vacuum pump) will all be
dedicated to student use, and replace equipment borrowed from research
laboratories. In the Molecular Biology Laboratory, the goals are to 1. develop
generally accepted theoretical and practical aspects of growth, maintenance, and
isolation of host organisms, bacteriophage, and plasmid vectors, 2. complement,
with laboratory experiences, existing lecture courses in genetics and molecular
biology, 3. link techniques in molecular biology with concepts of biological
significance and 4. provide the infrastructure for application of advanced
molecular techniques.
