.he goal of the research is to provide new experimental data in order to
evaluate scientific theses on the role of hydrogen in silicon dioxide and to
provide a basis for atomic-scale modeling of this materials system. Nuclear
magnetic resonance is being used to determine the atomic bonding configuration
of hydrogen atoms in silicon dioxide grown by thermal and chemical vapor
deposition techniques. The data will be analyzed in terms of oxidation kinetics,
passivation and electronic defects in silicon dioxide.
