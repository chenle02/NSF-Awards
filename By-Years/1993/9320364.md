9320364 HAZAN ABSTRACT During infancy and childhood, parents typically serve as
an individual's primary source of emotional support and security. In adulthood,
a peer--usually, the relationship partner--becomes the primary source of
security and support. Thus, in the normal course of development, these basic
social needs are transferred from parents to partners. There has been much
research on the parent-child bond and, in recent years, an increasing amount of
research on adult-adult bonds. However, little is know about the processes by
which emotional attachments are transferred, nor about how emotional bonds are
formed between adults. It is a well documented fact that relationship
experiences in one's family of origin influence the quality and course of
subsequent relationships. Previous research has established that problematic
parent-child relationships put individuals at increased risk for a host of
negative outcomes, including diminished productivity in the work place, drug and
alcohol abuse, and impaired psychological and physical health. Understanding the
developmental transition whereby individuals establish emotional attachments
outside their families of origin has obvious theoretical as well as practical
importance. This project will investigate the transition by studying an
ethnically and socioeconomically diverse cross-section of children, adolescents,
and adults for a period of 4 years. Previous work by the investigator forms the
basis of a model of this transition which will be tested in this research. If
this model proves to be correct, the thoughts, feeling, and behaviors that
eventually lead to well- or poorly-functioning adult relationships may be
evident in early childhood. The results of the project promise to contribute to
our understanding of the developmental course, underlying processes and
mechanisms, and the timing of a critical milestone in human life.
