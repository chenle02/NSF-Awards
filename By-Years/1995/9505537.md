This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will allow the investigator to
pursue the use of data-parallel computers to determine the intons and exons in
DNA sequences. In particular, the main tasks of this award include the use of an
intermediate representation of DNA, the directed acyclic graph, to perform
parallel parses to recognize more complex DNA subsequences. The investigator
will begin collaborations with biologists to complete the exploration. This
award is jointly funded by the Computational Biology Activity and the Theory of
Computing programs.
