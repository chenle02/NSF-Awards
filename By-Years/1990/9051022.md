The Computer Graphics course is a recent addition to the curriculum of the
Mathematics and Computer Science Department. Together with Compiler Construction
and Artificial Intelligence courses, these three provide upper division
electives in the field of computer science for undergraduate majors. The primary
purpose of this project is to augment this new Computer Graphics course by
providing majors with the necessary graphics capability to adequately study the
topic and work with state-of-the-art equipment. In addition, the enhancements to
the Microcomputer Laboratory will benefit other areas within the university. In
particular the mathematics program will add educational software for its upper
division courses in Complex Variables and Optimization Theory; and, the aviation
program, which serves 350 students, will be able to take advantage of
appropriate CAD/CAM software. The award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
