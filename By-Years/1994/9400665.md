9400665 Duncan SMASCH is a collaborative effort by the Association of California
Herbaria (ACH) to develop and implement a distributed database that will store
and manage information obtained from accessions of vascular plants collected in
California. The database will enhance understanding of the state's vascular
plant resources, both living and preserved, and will improve the efficiency of
many herbarium operations, this renewal will allow UC/JEPS to: complete data
entry for the UC/JEPS portion of the SMASCH database; maintain and modify data
entry software, develop an image archive, and develop user access tools; extend
the data model to collection management activities including exchange and
production of labels and forms; further develop connections to literature-based
checklists of taxa, multiple-entry keys, and other aspects of floristic
information management.
