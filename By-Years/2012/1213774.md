With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of
Professor Janis Louie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah.
This project focuses on the preparation of a variety of cyclic and acyclic
compounds from environmentally friendly and readily available starting
materials. Previously, transition metal catalysts that mediate the cycloaddition
of unsaturated hydrocarbons and heterocumulenes had been developed in Professor
Louie's laboratory. This project focuses on the elucidation of the mechanism of
these cycloaddition reactions in order to develop more efficient metal-mediated
reactions. Expanding the scope of these metal catalyzed cycloaddition reactions
will also be a focus. In addition, further studies of a recently discovered
important intermediate in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions will be pursued.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Louie's research efforts revolve around the
development of facile transition metal-mediated methods for the formation of
cyclic and acyclic compounds. In addition, new methods for utilizing benign
starting materials will be evaluated. Successful development of the methodology
will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of molecules
is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and
biological and chemical research. In addition, this project will provide
training opportunities for students from the pre-undergraduates to post-doctoral
level.
