With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Prairie View A&M University will acquire a 400 MHz
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on a) the development of soluble polymer-
support for synthesis of heterocycles; b) the development of second generation
chiral catalysts for nitrone reactions; c) synthesis and development of novel
free radical probes as tools for free radical biology; d) synthesis of
antimalarial compounds isolated from Tecla trichocarpa; e) metalocarborane
complexes; f) synthesis of bio-glass for bone repair; g) anticoagulant and
fibrinolytic properties of polysaccharides; and h) intermediates of fungal
metabolism and assay of metabolites in fermentation.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry.
