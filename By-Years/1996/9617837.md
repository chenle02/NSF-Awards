9617837 Kabanov The objective of this international collaboration is to
investigate: (1) complexes formed by ionogenic block copolymers and oppositely
charged synthetic polyions; and (2) complexes formed by ionogenic block
copolymers and surfactants of opposite charge. These complexes represent new
classes of materials which combine the properties of cooperative polyelectrolyte
or polymer-colloidal complexes (sensitivity to ionic strength and pH, ability to
participate in cooperative polyion exchange and substitution reactions) with the
ability of amphiphilic block copolymers to form micelles and mesophases. %%% It
is expected that these materials could find applications in various fields
including drug delivery and release, membrane technologies, biocompatible
materials, and biocatalysis. ***
