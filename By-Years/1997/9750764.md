A highly innovative polymer laboratory class is created to accompany an
increasingly popular interdisciplinary polymer science lecture class. Carefully
considered and selected state-of-the-art instrumentation is acquired and used in
conjunction with "just in time" learning under the premise of the student's
being faced with realistic industrial situations whereby specific technical
questions have to be addressed within a limited period of time. Five separate
experiments emphasizing and reinforcing the material presented in lecture are
performed. The laboratory class is team taught by one faculty member from
Chemical Engineering and one from the Chemistry Department; heavy contact hours
between the student and these faculty in an intimate laboratory setting are an
indispensable part of the course. *
