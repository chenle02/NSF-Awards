Interdisciplinary (99) Under this Type II award the faculty is planning changes
to the general education curriculum by adapting models that reflect current
understandings of how students best learn science. Course revisions are
improving students' abilities in two areas: utilizing the scientific method and
seeing the relevance of science to their lives. The modifications are based
primarily upon concept, investigative and issue activities central to the
University of Oregon's Workshop Biology program. Materials from ChemConnections
and Workshop Physics are also being adapted to the local environment. The effort
is being facilitated by faculty attendance at several interdisciplinary and
discipline specific workshops addressing strategies for adapting these teaching
practices and course design innovations to fit the institution's needs.
Following these activities, the faculty joined by students are designing the new
courses. The final phase is implementation of the newly created courses. The
project is serving as a model for other institutions reformulating their general
education programs.
