BELOVSKY 9707564 The control of herbivore populations is a hotly debated issue
among ecologists. The PI has been studying the relative importance of weather,
food, predators, and history on the regulation of replicated populations of
grasshoppers in a grassland ecosystem. This proposal is a renewal of a research
project that has continued uninterrupted since 1992. The PI has constructed a
general model of population dynamics based on the manner that density affects
population processes such as reproduction, probability of predation, and
survival. The model employs recruitment curves which relate current population
levels to the previous generation. This renewal will continue the experiments
began four years ago to further test the PI's initial results that shifts in
population dynamics over space and time are predictable. The control of insect
herbivores is of paramount interest in an economy emphasizing crop and timber
production. This project takes a novel approach in combining density-dependent
and independent factors with historical factors to further our understanding of
how insect populations are regulated.
