This project provides physics majors with familiarity and confidence in the
application of modern computational tools to problems of interest to practicing
physicists and other scientists. In addition, this topic provides a natural
arena in which to extend experience with the lecture-free Workshop Physics
course to an intermediate-level physics course. This project includes the
development of a computational physics laboratory and the concurrent development
and implementation of curricular materials for an inquiry-based computational
physics course. This course utilizes a standard spreadsheet program to
investigate the theoretical underpinnings and practical limitations of
computation. The course also uses a high-level package (probably Mathematica)
for application to more challenging, "real" problems.
