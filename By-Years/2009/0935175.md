This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to Tufts University and Northwestern University will study the development
of professional engineering skills in undergraduate engineering students. The
goals is to create a rich educational environment that fosters the development
of engineering knowledge, skills and achievement both within college and in
launching a successful career as an engineer. The techniques to be used will be
drawn from design theory, cognitive science, developmental psychology, and
engineering education research. This is a one year pilot study and the results
will be presented at technical conferences and published in professional
journals. The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering
through more effective development of their professional skills. The results
will increase student?s interest in engineering and will enhance the number of
students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering
jobs.
