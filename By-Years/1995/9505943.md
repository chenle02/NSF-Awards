9505943 Sentovich The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months
of research abroad at research centers of proven excellence. The program's
awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This
award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Ellen M.
Sentovich to work with Dr. Gerard Berry at the Ecole des Mines de Paris. The
researchers will explore effective computer-aided design tools (CAD)for
synthesizing control systems. The study will focus on encoding controllers,
optimizing register selection and analyzing combinational cycles. Control-
intensive electronic systems employed in a variety of new applications,
including automotive, avionic and robotic controlq and communications systems,
are difficult to design correctly because they employ a mix of hardware and
software components. Furthermore, the design process is complicated by stringent
design requirements and time-to-market constraints. State-of-the-art tools are
still not capable of producing optimal, correct and complete control systems. It
is the goal of this research to combine the expertise of the host engineers,
specifying and compiling control-intensive systems, with that of the
postdoctoral fellow's logic synthesis and optimization to further the research
to create effective CAD tools to meet the design constraints. ***
