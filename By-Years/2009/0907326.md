The present proposal focusses on some aspects of the analysis of stochastic
differential equations that the PI investigated during the last years and that
he would like to further develop within the next years. More precisely, the
present proposal focusses on three directions of research. In the first
direction of research, the PI will study stochastic differential equations
driven by fractional Brownian motions. Such equations naturally arise as
candidates for the evolution of rough and non-Markovian systems. A better
understanding of this theory which is now at its beginnings would certainly
provide a deeper understanding of non-Markovian systems that can be observed in
different settings, by e.g. financial mathematics, communication networks,
turbulence phenomena. In the second direction of research, the PI will study
functional inequalities, like gradient bounds for subelliptic heat semigroups.
This study could lead to a better understanding of the control of the rate of
convergence to equilibrium for subelliptic systems and to a subelliptic
generalization of lower Ricci bounds. Finally in the third direction of
research, the PI will study subelliptic heat kernels asymptotics on bundles. In
the elliptic case, this study provides a striking and fascinating proof of the
Atiyah-Singer index theorem. By these methods, the PI would like to study
possible index theorems in subelliptic geometry.

Randomness is a phenomenon present in everyday life. Predicting traffic flows,
communications networks, genetic issues, stock prices on financial markets are
examples where stochastic differential equations can be used to model
performance. Stochastic differential equations are a mathematical tool
describing the evolution in time of a system involving randomness. This project
focusses on the theoretical study of such objects and to its applications in
different areas within mathematics or applied mathematics.
