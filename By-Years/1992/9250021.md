This Minority Research Initiation Planning activity will focus on the structure
elucidation of different anthocyanins found in fruits. Structures will be
compared and the quantities present will be determined. Target species in which
to investigate anthocyanin production, structure and quantity include Vitus
(grape) and Vacinium (cranberry.) The fruits of both species produce high yields
of extracted anthocyanins, and both can be adapted to uniform and consistent in
vitro culture for controlled production of pigments. The results will provide
basic information about the chemistry of anthocyanins and related flavinoids on
which to focus future research. %%% The structures obtained in this research
will help in the understanding of production of color in plant tissue, and will
contribute significantly to our knowledge of one common class of plant pigments.
