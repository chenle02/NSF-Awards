This is a proposal for a planning grant that aims to prepare a full proposal in
the future to develop professional development materials for teachers in the
area of environmental science. Most of the funds requested in the planning grant
are to assemble a group of scientists, science educators (some of whom have led
the development of national standards in science, math, and geography) and
teachers for a two-day conference. The purpose of the conference is to develop a
synthesis of best practices toward education about the environment. The ultimate
goal is to produce a publication (tentatively titled "Resources for
Environmental Literacy') that will identify the concepts and principles every
American should know in order to make thoughtful public and private choices; to
participate in a rational discourse about issues related to the environment; and
to appreciate the interrelation of the human and natural worlds. This
publication will assist teachers by demonstrating how environmental knowledge
can be achieved through the integration and application of learning across the
disciplines, on issues that are of considerable interest and great importance to
students&lt;br/&gt;
