The structure of the southern Appalachian Orogen is dominated by large,
continent-directed thrust fauults that formed during at least two and possibly
three Paleozoic orogenies. One of the earliest faults, the Hayesville, may be
part of a major early Paleozoic suture that extends from Newfoundland to
Alabama. The fault is pre-metamorphism and may be due to the early stages of
tectonic accretion and crustal contradiction following Late Pre Cambrian crustal
extension and passive margin development. This project will map the fault in
southwestern North Carolina, determine the movement history and develop a
structural chronology. Results will contribute to general understanding of
orogenic processes in addition to that of Appalachian structure and tectonics.
