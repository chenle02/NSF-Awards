In previous work, this group has developed a model that describes hydrogen
bonding interactions in polymers. In experimental studies to this point, the
group has successfully tested the ability of this model to predict broad trends
in the phase behavior of various system. In the research to be carried out, an
attempt will be made to develop a much more quantitative study of the degree of
validity of this approach. The work will include: a) An investigation of the
extent to which we need to account for "free volume"; b) FTIR studies of
carefully selected copolymer systems; c) Studies of melting point depression in
blends where one component crystallizes; d) Scattering studies, in collaboration
with Dr. Charles Han of NIST. The long-term goal is to understand and predict
the phase behavior of polymeric mixtures that involve strong directionally
specific interactions.
