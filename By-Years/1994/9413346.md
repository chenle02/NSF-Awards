9413346 Hills This award will establish a high speed, wireless data
communications infrastructure on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University. The
research efforts supported by this new infrastructure are devoted to making
ubiquitious wireless data communications service available to small mobile
computers. The research activities to be supported by the new infrastructure are
the CODA project, which is concerned with shared data access over wireless
links; the development of a series of wearable computers; development of the
Mobile Host Routing Protocol, which provides network layer addressing service to
mobile terminals; and a computer model, which is being used to explore the
engineering and economic aspects of wireless networks. The applications being
developed are: the FRIEND system, which supports emergency management, the
Health Link system, which supports home health care; and Wireless Andrew, a
proposed application which will make available on wireless terminals the full
functionality of "Andrew," Carnegie Mellon's campus computing network. ***
