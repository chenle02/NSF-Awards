The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of focused ultrasound technology. This technology could eliminate
traditional surgeries and invasive therapy complications. This technology can
also be made at a competitive price point allowing it to be more accessible,
especially to clinics in low-income communities. This technology also removes
some of the major performance barriers in the market. A proposed miniaturized
ultrasound solution can be deployed in numerous portable applications, such as
ultrasonic deep brain stimulator, which eliminates complications and cost of
current treatments, and can be used in other emerging applications such as
mental health treatments, without opening the skull and implanting electrodes
into a patient's brain.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of an ultrasound transducer
drive system. Multichannel phased arrays and single channel power modules are
ultrasound transducer drivers, which are used in a wide range of medical and
non-medical applications. These drivers are very high in price, and they have
performance variances. This innovation reduces the cost of these drivers with
some performance breakthroughs, such as generation of sine or harmonic-free
outputs beneficial for both medical and nonmedical applications, as well as the
removal of the matching networks per transducer and providing an increase in the
power limitations of each channel. This technology can be deployed in focused
ultrasound medical applications to cure a wide range of conditions non-
invasively, with these harmless soundwaves. The technology can also be deployed
in other non-medical applications, where economical and high-performance drivers
are necessary. The technology is supposed to be miniaturized to replace current
severely invasive deep brain stimulation with non-invasive ultrasound version
used for different neurologic conditions, such as Epilepsy and Parkinson.
