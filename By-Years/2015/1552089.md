The design, upgrade, and real-time operation of a power network are all
contingent upon sev- eral optimization problems that are hard to solve due to
two main reasons: (i) the nonlinearity induced by the laws of physics, and (ii)
the presence of integer variables. The existing solvers for energy-related
optimization problems either make potentially conservative approximations or
deploy general-purpose local-search algorithms to handle the non-convexities,
which may incur tens of billions of dollars annually. The general intractability
of power optimization problems has a direct impact in the practice of energy
efficiency, and this is arguably one of the most fundamen- tal issues that hold
back the power engineering. The primary objective of this project is to address
this non-convexity issue by developing high-performance optimization techniques
that can be ap- plied to a broad set of nonlinear energy problems. This work is
expected to produce significant breakthrough in nonlinear optimization at large
and nonlinear energy optimization in particular.

Broader Impacts: The results of this project can be utilized for the design,
modernization, and operation of many power grids around the world. This project
will have a significant impact on the power industry by revolutionizing their
energymanagement systems, leading to the following immediate benefits: (i)
reducing the electricity cost through a cheaper way of dispatching and
delivering power, (ii) decreasing the likelihood of power outages by optimizing
the reliability and robustness of the grid, and (iii) reducing gas emissions by
optimally utilizing the sustainable energy. This project has major outreach
activities for a local school, where more than 85% of the student population are
significantly underrepresented in STEM-related fields. Management of
nonlinearities in real time is especially important to the economics of trying
to use more renewable energy sources; thus work on this challenge may be crucial
to our ability to accomplish this in an affordable way.
