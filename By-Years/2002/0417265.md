The Oregon State University, in collaboration with the University of California
Berkeley has been awarded a grant to develop web based GIS software and tools
designed to exploit the capabilities of the existing stand alone DIVA system and
to enable easily implemented and online analyses of the rapidly growing wealth
of natural history specimen distribution data available on the internet. The
project is well integrated in the DiGIR community and will enable sophisticated
analyses of large datasets at institutions that lack both the extensive natural
history collections and significant hardware and software investments that were
previously necessary for large scale spatial distribution analyses of organism
distributions.
