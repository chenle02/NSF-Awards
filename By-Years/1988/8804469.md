Under this two-year continuing award, Professor Carney will establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Site at the Florida State
University (FSU). Undergraduate students will be actively recruited from
historically black universities to participate in summer programs at FSU where
they will be exposed to a wide spectrum of research projects in atmospheric
sciences. Besides being educational, the summer programs also offer the black
undergraduates the firsthand exposure to atmospheric sciences as a viable and
rewarding career choice.
