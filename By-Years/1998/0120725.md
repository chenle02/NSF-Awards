The research focus of the NSF I/UCRC for Membrane Applied Science and Technology
(MAST) is membranes, microporous films, and barrier layers. Membranes are
permable films that permit separation or the controlled release of solutes. They
are used for water desalination, wastewater treatment, artificial kidneys, and
in the controlled release of pharmaceuticals, flavors, cosmetics, inscticides,
and herbicides. Microporous films are used in breathable fabrics, surgical
dressings, artificial lungs, batteries, and fuel cells. Barrier layers are used
in breathable contact lenses, food packaging, water barriers, and protective
coatings. Membranes offer exceptional potential for smart sensor and bioMEMS
technologies since tey are the only separations technology that will work on the
microscale.
