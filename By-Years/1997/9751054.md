This project provides undergraduate students with hands-on experiences in
inspection techniques in this institution's semiconductor manufacturing training
program. The Microelectronics Technology certificate and degree programs are
designed to prepare students for entry-level positions in the semiconductor
manufacturing and production industry. The testing and validation equipment
supported by this grant include: optical inspection stations (used visually
demonstrate the impacts of particle contamination and to inspect mask openings,
wafers, completed circuits, etc.), scanning electron micorscopes (used to
observe film quality and othe photolithography properties), profilometers (used
to measure oxide layer properties), film thickness gauges, and other equipment
to provide students with state-of-the-art experiences relating to semiconductor
manufacturing.
