The focus of this project is the reactivity of vanadium bromoperoxidase isolated
from marine organisms (e.g., Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus distichus Macrocystis
pyrifera). The marine environment is a very rich source of halogenated and
selectively oxidized metabolites, many of which have important biological
activities (e.g., chemical defense,, antimicrobial), and applications as
pharmaceuticals (antineoplastic, antiinflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial)
and specialty chemicals (e.g., dyes). V-BrPO catalyzes the bromination of
certain organic compounds and the oxidation of others. The PI has shown that in
the absence of a good substrate for bromination, V-BrPO catalyzes the formation
of singlet oxygen. V-BrPO is not inactivated by high concentrations of singlet
oxygen or oxidized bromine species, contrary to the behavior of the FeHeme
haloperoxidases. The plan is to investigate the selectivity of bromination vs
oxidation for important marine natural product precursors (e.g., indoles,
furans, B-diketons and B-ketoacids), the kinetics and mechanism of bromination
and oxidation. The mechanism of chloroperoxidase activity of the vanadium enzyme
which the PI has recently discovered , will also be investigated. The non heme
chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis will be studied,
including determination of the active-site metal ion (e.g., likely to be iron,
zinc or vanadium), the kinetics and mechanism of halogenation vs dioxygen
formation, and the relative reactivity of oxidation vs halogenation.
