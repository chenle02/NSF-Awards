In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Gilbert Nathanson of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison will conduct a research program to study collisions and reactions of
reactive gases with pure and salty protic solvents, molten alkali hydroxides,
and organic ionic liquids. The work has four specific goals: 1) To explore
interfacial reactions through observations of gas-liquid deuterium to hydrogen
exchange; 2) to investigate the catalyzation or suppression of interfacial
reactions by ions dissolved at the surfaces of salty liquids; 3) to map out the
pathways for scattering, trapping, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction reactions
in collisions of protic gases with molten alkali hydroxides; and 4) to
investigate how gas-liquid energy transfer and reaction rates are influenced by
the alkyl chain structure of organic ionic liquids. These studies will
contribute to the development of a molecular picture of gas-liquid interfaces,
which will promote the understanding of gas-liquid processes occurring
industrially and in the atmosphere.

Graduate and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented
minorities, will participate in this research.
