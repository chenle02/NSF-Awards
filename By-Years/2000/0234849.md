There are still large gaps in our knowledge of how new species form. One of the
critical stages of speciation may often be the development of mating preferences
that prevent interbreeding between members of diverging populations. Servedio
and Turelli are using a series of mathematical models to systematically examine
the roles that a number of proposed factors may play in driving this preference
evolution. They will assess the importance of several mechanisms that lower the
number of healthy and fertile offspring produced by pairs of hybridizing
individuals. Emerging species may also occupy divergent habitats in which
different traits may contribute to survival. The role of this phenomenon in
driving speciation will also be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By concentrating
on the consequences of contact between populations that are in the process of
speciating, this project will help to elucidate what mechanisms produce and
maintain biological diversity. The exploration of these processes also has
implications for the conservation of this diversity. As human disturbance erodes
barriers and alters species ranges, it is becoming increasingly essential to
understand the conditions that promote species divergence versus extinction in
the face of new contacts between closely related species.&lt;br/&gt;
