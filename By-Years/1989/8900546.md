A REU site program is established involving 8 students in research activities of
the faculty. The program is designed to ncrease the awareness of qualified
undergraduate students in engineering of the opportunities afforded by research
and graduate study. A vigorous seminar program will include outside speakers,
the faculty, and graduate students is planned. A forum will be held to permit
REU undergraduate students to present the results of their research to the
faculty and graduate students. Typical student research projects include: (1)
robotic vision system, (2) constraint translation for design automation
software, (3) nonuniform flow interaction with structures, (4) fluid mechanics
of stranded cables, (5) vibration test methods and dynamic system modelling, (6)
crack propagation in viscoelastic materials, (7) interaction between nucleation
sites in boiling, (8) mapping three-dimensional temperature fields, (9) cold
storage in refrigerators and freezers, (10) low thrust propulsion for planetary
vehicles, and (11) focus-centered Laplace method for orbital determination.
