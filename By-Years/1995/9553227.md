The goal of the project is twofold: research in the area of signal
reconstruction, and teaching in signal processing, both components emphasizing
on the interdisciplinary aspect of signal processing. The main thrust of the
research is the reconstruction of a signal with unknown statistical description
that propagates through a system with unknown characteristics, solely from the
system's output (blind deconvolution). Higher Order Statistics are powerful
mathematical tools to be employed in this problem, capable of revealing a wealth
of information about the signal/process (e.g., phase, presence of
nonlinearities), and at the same time suppressing noise. The theoretical
developments of this work will be applied in the areas of digital
communications, medical diagnostics and earthquake engineering, and are expected
to bring new knowledge to these fields. In the area of teaching the goal is to
develop and maintain a new systems curriculum, highlighting principles that
unite different engineering disciplines. Towards this goal, a state-of-the-art
multimedia signal processing laboratory will be developed, and new courses will
be designed.
