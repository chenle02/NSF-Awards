The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena governed by partial
differential equations with several disparate scales is a formidable
computational challenge. Modern algorithms should be able to resolve fine scales
for certain physical quantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing
the computational effort and making realistic 3d simulations feasible. Phase
transitions in materials science, epitaxial growth, viscous incompressible
fluids, and chemotaxis are typical yet quite distinct examples. The goal of this
project is to design, test, and analyze reliable and efficient adaptive finite
element methods for such problems, with space-time error control and based on
refinement/coarsening mesh modification. This project builds upon our novel
theory for a posteriori error estimation of evolution problems; in fact it
extends and enhances the prior NSF Grant DMS-9623394. It blends quite delicate
analytical and computational issues, and applies them to free boundary problems,
constrained problems, and advection-diffusion equations.

This project has strong connections with areas of strategic interest such as
Materials Science, Micro Electronics and High-Performance Computing, in that it
addresses central issues to all of them such as the development of reliable and
efficient algorithms. This is a collaborative project involving a number of
scientists in the US and abroad, as well as several students. A substantial
effort is devoted to education and human resource development.
