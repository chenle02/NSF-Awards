This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida purchase an
upgrade of the NMR facilities which will include the purchase of a medium field
NMR, and workstation for data handling. This equipment will be used in the
following research projects: (1) Catalysts for Acyclic Diene Metathesis
Polymerization and Reactivity Studies of Palladium Amide Complexes; (2) Kinetic
Effects in Radical, Diradical, Carbanion, Carbene, and Pericyclic Reactions; and
(3) Ketyl Radical Anion Chemistry. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
