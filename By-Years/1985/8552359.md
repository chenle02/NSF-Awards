This project funds a series of workshops designed to show high school biology
teachers and administrators how to use computer technology most effectively in
biology. The workshops will provide an opportunity for 150 teachers from the
state of Texas to attend five-day workshops emphasizing hands-on computer
experience and the associated wet labs. Using courseware modules developed with
funding from previous NSF grants, the program will allow participants to study
plant growth and development, cardiopulmonary physiology, foraging patterns and
energetics, the trophic-dynamic features of a balanced ecosystem, hormonal
control of the menstrual cycle, and patterns of competition among algae in a
lake. A set of wet lab exercises to accompany the computer exercises will be
conducted. The workshops will be held in Houston in the Fall of 1986 and on the
campus of Texas A&amp;M University in the Summers of 1987 and 1988. Three-
person teams at each of 10 high schools will be invited to attend each workshop.
Each team will consist of teachers and administrators. During the Academic Year,
one-day workshops will be held in the Fall and Spring. In addition, visits will
be made to high schools to assist in the development of computer consciousness
among teachers and students.
