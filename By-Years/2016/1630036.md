Cooperation are critical to productivity and economic well-being in settings
where teamwork is efficient. Likewise, patience is critical to economic
prosperity to the extent it enables individuals to adequately save and invest
for the future. Unfortunately, failure of social cooperation (selfishness) and
failure of self-control (impulsiveness or addiction) are pervasive problems in
American society. The research undertaken here develops and extends a model of
decision making in which there is a close correspondence between decisions to
behave cooperatively versus selfishly and decisions to behave patiently versus
impatiently. Cooperation and patience are motivated by thinking in terms of
"what we should do" where the "we" in intertemporal choices are one's current
and future selves. Selfish and impatient behavior is motivated by thinking in
terms of "what I should do." The modeling approach suggests that economically
beneficial behaviors in both domains may be brought about by training or
otherwise inducing people to frame decisions one way versus the
other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research posits that intertemporal and
interpersonal cooperation are extensions of the self along the two dimensions:
time and social space. Extension in time leads to self-control; extension in
social space leads to social cooperation and altruism. A number of experiments
will establish the quantitative relationship of these two dimensions and enable
modeling of the surface created by discounting along both of them. The model
will lead to a wider understanding of that nature of intertemporal and social
preferences.
