This research is concerned with the structure theory of free and finitely
presented lattices. The principal investigator will use the theory of covers in
free lattices and certain infinitary techniques to determine if there are
elements b&lt;c&lt;a in a free lattice such that the interval a/c is the union
of a/c and c/b and both the latter are infinite. The problem of when a finitely
presented lattice is weakly atomic, and when it is of finite width will also be
investigated. An efficient algorithm will be sought for deciding if a finitely
presented lattice is finite. The conjecture that a finitely presented lattice of
infinite width must contain a sublattice isomorphic to the free lattice on three
generators will also be investigated. Lattices are discrete mathematical objects
with a structure reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic.
This very weak structure means that lattices can be found in many mathematical
environments. It also means that problems are easy to state, hard to solve and
of a very general nature. The results of this work will impact many areas of
mathematics, computer science, the social sciences and business management.
