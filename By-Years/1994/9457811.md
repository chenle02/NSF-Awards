This research program addresses a number of fundamental issues related to the
design of novel algorithms, protocols and architectures that enable efficient
fault-tolerant parallel and distributed computing for scientific and commercial
applications. The program is a blend of basic research and experimental systems
activities. It includes work on the understanding of new computing paradigms
inspired by neural networks as well as designing and prototyping of novel
communication schemes for parallel and distributed systems.
