On January 26, 1939 Niels Bohr of Copenhagen read a fateful telegram he had
just received from Otto Hahn in Berlin to the assembled Fifth Washington
Conference on Theoretical Physics at The George Washington University. The
telegram announced "the successful disintegration of uranium into barium with
the attendant release of approximately two hundred million electron volts of
energy per disintegration." To commemorate the 50th anniversary of this event,
the original sponsors, The George Washington University and The Carnegie
Institution, will hold a one-day conference on January 17th at The George
Washington University. The surviving members of the original attendees will be
invited as special guests to the conference. In addition, it is planned to host
300-400 members of the scientific, engineering, and political communities.
