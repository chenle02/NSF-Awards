Compaction-induced stresses, as well as their associated deformations, can be of
major importance in analysis of many types of engineered earth structures and
soil-structure systems. They can significantly affect earth pressures, soil-
structure interaction, hydraulic fracturing and separation, and the strength and
behavior of compacted soil masses. This research is intended to refine and
verify recently developed incremental finite element analysis procedures and
behavioral models for hysteretic soil loading and unloading, extend these models
and analytical procedures to consider cohesive soils, and develop a reliable
basis for establishing modeling parameters critical to the analytical procedures
developed. The research will include laboratory testing, development and
refinement of behavioral models and analytical procedures, and analysis of field
studies. This research will directly address the issue of the variation of
stress and associated time effects for soil masses derived from engineering
processes and will utilize the most recently developed laboratory techniques for
stress measurements.
