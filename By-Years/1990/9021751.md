This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Idaho for the
renovation and repair of Renfrew Hall which houses the research and research
training activities of the Department of Chemistry. This building was
constructed in 1963 and last renovated in 1981. The ARFMP grant of $1,300,000
and $1,948,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize
these research and research training facilities. This project will address the
need to improve the current research infrastructure both in terms of current
standards of laboratory services and of federal and state safety requirements by
upgrading the ventilation, electrical, plumbing, lighting, and fire detection
and protection systems. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science
by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of quality undergraduate and graduate students in the only
Ph.D.-granting chemistry program in the state of Idaho. The ability to train
students in these laboratories to meet the future needs of the state and the
nation will be markedly enhanced by this renovation.
