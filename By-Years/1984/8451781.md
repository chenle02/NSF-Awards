The research consists of studies in two areas, the first being convective
boiling and two-phase flow in compact heat exchangers. A series of experimental
and analytical studies is employed to investigate the effect of flow conditions,
fluid properties, and geometry on convective boiling heat transfer in channels
with offset strip fins. Flow visualization studies and direct measurements of
local heat transfer coefficients are planned. Convective boiling in ribbed-plate
and dimpled-tube geometries is also examined. The second portion of the project
consists of experimental and theoretical studies of mixed convection flows near
the heated vertical walls of a rectangular enclosure in the presence of a
horizontal forced flow. For different enclosure geometries, the experiments
examine the interaction between the forced-flow and buoyance mechanisms, and
determine their combined effects on flow and heat transfer. Numerical
predictions of the flow field and heat transfer are developed concurrently and
compared with the experimental results.
