The Distance and Service-Learning Project at Virginia Tech is a partnership
between the University's Physics Department and science programs at high schools
throughout Southwest Virginia. The Project targets two related problems: the
geographic and professional isolation of rural high schools and teachers that
limits their access to the facilities, resources and research discoveries of
major universities, and the academic isolation of advanced undergraduate and
graduate science students who have little or no opportunity to communicate with
populations outside of their highly specialized scientific field. The Project
design addresses these problems by employing distance learning to stimulate high
school students' interest in and appreciation of rapid developments in the
fields of physics and astronomy; and service-learning to engage selected physics
students in the delivery of this information through ongoing electronic and
face-to-face interactions. The Project will be piloted with Floyd County High
School. It is expected that the Distance and Service-Learning Project will
increase the level of science literacy among the general population of students
at Floyd County High School, lead to the creation of an Advanced Placement
Physics course, improve the oral, written and electronic communication skills of
physics majors at Virginia Tech, and introduce physics majors to new
applications of their discipline, including careers in teaching. All phases of
the Project Pilot will be carefully documented, leading to the production of a
teaching guide for School-College Collaborations using Distance and Service-
Learning techniques.
