Dr. William E. Kurtin and other members of the Chemistry Department of Trinity
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,
inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of this program
is the partnership formed with six local universities and community colleges to
insure recruitment of underrepresented minority students.
