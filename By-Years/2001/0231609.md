This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
reduction of NOx emissions from coal-fired power plants. The concept uses
existing burner technology plus nitrogen enriched air (NEA) based on membrane
technology to reduce NOx emissions. Modeling work projects 300-fold NOx
emissions reductive using this approach. Preliminary estimates suggest that this
approach will be less expensive than existing selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) systems. The program focuses on coal fired electrical power facilities
since they are most demanding due to high flame temperature and high
contamination level. Phase I will demonstrate process feasibility on small
furnace system and will identify leading low cost NEA candidate (membrane or
pipeline nitrogen). The results will be compared to existing SCR NOx cleanup
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this technology offers major
cost effective routes to reduction of NOx in coal-fired power plants and other
facilities.
