This project will address current problems in quark models of strongly
interacting particles and a related topic in exotic atoms. One problem concerns
the production of strange particles (sigma and lambda hyperons) and their
antiparticles from collisions of protons and antiprotons. We will calculate in a
quark model the cross-sections and spin observables for these reactions, and
compare them to experiment and to meson-exchange calculations. Our goal is to
determine the reaction mechanism and the unknown hyperon- antihyperon
interaction. Another problem of contemporary interest is the contribution of
strange quarks and antiquarks to the spin of the proton. We have proposed a
model of polarized, intrinsic strangeness in the proton which we will further
develop in order to test it against spin transfer data from the hyperon
production experiments. A third problem is the asymmetry of different quark
flavors (up, down, and strange) in the sigma hyperon, which we will calculate in
a model in which mesons are coupled to quarks. Finally, we will calculate energy
level shifts and widths in exotic atoms in order to learn about nucleon wave
functions and elementary hadron-nucleon interactions. Research assistantships
will be provided so that undergraduate students can collaborate in this program.
