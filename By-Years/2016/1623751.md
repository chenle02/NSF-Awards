EarthCube is a community-driven effort with the goal of transforming the conduct
of geoscience research and education by creating a well-integrated and facile
environment to share scientific data, information tools and services, and
knowledge in an open, transparent, and inclusive manner. Under the leadership of
University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and in partnership with
the EarthCube community, its governance, and other stakeholders and
collaborators, the EarthCube Science Support Office (ESSO) will support efforts
to advance EarthCube's mission. ESSO's role will be to provide a logistical,
organizational, and administrative foundation to facilitate the advancement of
EarthCube goals to catalyze scientific breakthroughs in the geosciences by
fostering advances in information and computational sciences. ESSO will endeavor
to ensure a high quality of service to EarthCube stakeholders, delivered with
professionalism, efficiency, transparency, and
nimbleness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESSO will provide logistical support to the
EarthCube community and its governance groups in order to stimulate and manage
community dialog, strengthen efforts to define and resolve common challenges
using a consensus-oriented approach, and help realize EarthCube's full potential
and vision. ESSO will provide leadership to improve the coherence and impact of
EarthCube's efforts, bringing a coordinated and well-integrated approach to
managing and supporting governance, science, and technology activities. To
accomplish this, UCAR will draw on the expertise of two of its community
programs -- Unidata and the Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) -- to
provide the services requested of the ESSO. In addition, ESSO will collaborate
with the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Federation to leverage their
long experience with the geoscience cyberinfrastructure community for the mutual
benefit of both organizations and their communities. ESSO will also spearhead
outreach and community engagement activities by participating in national and
international scientific society meetings, scientific career fairs, and other
events. ESSO will reach out to broader audiences through the EarthCube website,
newsletters, and social media. It will leverage the presence of geoscientists
and cyberinfrastructure professionals to offer in-person and virtual seminars,
promoting the work of funded projects, data facilities, and providing backbone
support for education, training, and workforce development activities.
