This proposal is concerned with undertaking Monte Carlo simulations aided by
effective medium approximately to understand molecular diffusion on surfaces and
in microporous solids. In particular the effects of co-adsorbed species, surface
defects and surface steps on chain molecular diffusion will be examined. The
effective medium approximations are a powerful method for making such problems
tractable.
