Flathead Valley Community College (FVCC) will implement "TeaM SCoRE
Biotechnology: Teachers in Montana Strengthening the Continuity of Rural
Education in Biotechnology" to increase the number of high school students who
matriculate into FVCC's biotechnology program. Specific strategies are
professional development workshops for high school teachers and hands-on
biotechnology lab experiences for high school students, both done in
collaboration with the PIs and FVCC students. Many of the high schools in the
FVCC service area are rural and this project will contribute to educating the
workforce in rural, northwestern Montana.

TeaM SCoRE Biotechnology will increase the awareness and the size of FVCC's
biotechnology program by reaching out to high school students and teachers in
rural northwestern Montana. It will also leverage the prior ATE at FVCC,
"Strengthening Continuity of Rural Education in Biotechnology" (Award #1104075),
and the work of the Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative (CCURI,
Award #1524353 and #1118679). TeaM SCoRE will provide professional development
workshops for high school teachers along with equipment and materials needed to
implement biotechnology laboratory exercises, with the goal of preparing high
school students for the FVCC biotechnology program. There is the potential to
learn about effective practices in community college and high school
collaborations, how those collaborations support student transitions and
persistence in higher education, and what practices are most effective in
engaging students in a rural environment. Project evaluation will focus on
identifying the activities that best engage high school teachers, and how these
projects improve the knowledge and skills of high school students. The
dissemination plan will have a local focus, by working with local and regional
media, and will take advantage of the regional and national ATE networks.
