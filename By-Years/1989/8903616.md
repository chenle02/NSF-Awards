Volatiles are extremely important in magmatic systems and control many
properties of the system including: viscosity, liquidus and solidus
temperatures, diffusion rates, and eruption processes. Yet very little of our
knowledge about the amount and types of volatiles come from direct measurements.
This study proposes to determine volatiles in magmas by measuring the volatile
content in glass inclusions in minerals by infrared techniques, along with
microprobe studies. The evolution of a gas phase will be monitored by
determining the C1/F of associated apatites. Samples used for this study will be
minerals separated from glassy pumice samples from five chemical zoned ash-flow
sheets that have been collected previously, and detailed geochemical and
mineralogical data. The infrared studies will be done at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory on their sate of the art Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer attached to a microscope. ***//
