9352146 Hirshfeld The goals of this project are to (i) expand research
opportunities in observational astronomy for undergraduates; (ii) identify and
carry out specific educational research projects that would be transferable to
similar institutions with small observatories, and (iii) produce written
guidelines and materials that would help faculty at these institutions initiate
their own undergraduate research programs in astronomy. The primary instruments
for the project are a CCD imaging camera to supplement an existing telescope and
photoelectric photometer plus computers for data acquisition and image analysis.
The camera will be used by undergraduates to obtain images of planets and
extended celestial objects, such as star clusters, nebulae and galaxies, and to
do long- term aperture photometry of bright eclipsing binary stars, variable
stars, and selected program stars in the Harvard Center for Astrophysics radial
velocity study. The significance of this project, beyond its local impact on the
education of students, is its potential to improve undergraduate science
training by identifying ways to help faculty at other institutions set up their
own observational astronomy research programs for students. The university is
providing release time for the principal investigator to carry out the project.
