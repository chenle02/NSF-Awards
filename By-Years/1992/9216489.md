This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from Stanford University studying how costume is used by people in the
Ecuadorian Andes to express ethnic identity. Using participant observation and
the analysis of media in four areas of Ecuador varying in the degree of
indigenous dress as well as wealth and commercialization, the project will
analyze changes in indigenous costume and how native dress is used as a
political symbol. This research is important because it will increase our
understanding of how people manipulate symbols of ethnic identity to achieve
goals with respect to local and regional governments. Local costume is used as
an ethnic marker in many parts of the world, and rather than disappearing as
people "modernize", is increasing in selective ways. This project will advance
our understanding of how material culture is manipulated by people for political
and social goals. By showing how outsiders' representations of ethnic groups
perpetuate ethnic stereotypes and exacerbate racial tensions, the research can
provide valuable information on how to alleviate these tensions.
