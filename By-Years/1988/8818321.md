This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, utilizes
supersonic beam techniques and lasers to prepare polyatomic molecules in
particular energy states for study. Some of the species to be studied are
fundamentally important biochemical building blocks such as amino acids and
simple peptides. Spectroscopic studies of simple amino acids and peptides will
be used to obtain the geometry of these compounds, and the energetics of the
peptide bond. The rates of long-range intramolecular electron transfer in the
gas phase will be measured and compared to these rates measured in solution.
Laser desorption will be used as a means of generating molecular beams of large,
fragile molecules that cannot be vaporized by traditional methods. This process
will be studied separately, with particular attention paid to the basic
mechanism of laser desorption of large polyatomic molecules.
