Laboratory measurements will be carried out addressing isotope effects in
reactions relevant to atmospheric processes, including gas and solution phase
oxidation of SO2 (sulfur dioxide), surface catalyzed oxidation of sulfur
compounds, and the oxidation of sulfur compounds with NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and
NO3 (nitrate radical). The laboratory studies are needed to better understand
isotopic analysis (sulfur and oxygen) that the PI and his group have carried out
on atmospheric sulfate and nitrate aerosol samples. The PI is using isotopic
data to quantify the relative contributions of the different atmospheric sulfur
oxidation pathways. This is of fundamental importance to understanding the
chemistry of aerosols and their impact on climate.
