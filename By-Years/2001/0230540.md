The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (NSF/OPP) sponsors
and supports scientific research in polar regions ,where some sponsored projects
involve underwater diving. The OPP Health and Safety Officer within OPP's Polar
Research Support Section is responsible for developing and implementing a diving
safety program addressing scientific diving activities in polar regions. The
existing OPP diving safety program is patterned after the American Academy of
Underwater Sciences (AAUS) Standards for Scientific Diving. In order to augment
in-house experience, OPP has entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with
the Smithsonian Institution, another government agency with expertise in
conducting and managing scientific diving operations throughout the country.
This MOA allows the NSF to utilize the knowledge, skills, and experience of the
Smithsonian Institution's Diving Safety Officer in assisting OPP in managing its
scientific diving operations in polar regions. This MOA mechanism provides a
cost-effective mechanism for OPP to obtain scientific diving safety expertise on
an as-needed basis.

The MOA was initiated in November, 2001, with the understanding that each year
in the late Spring a mutually agreed-upon annual tasking statement would be
developed and appropriate funds set aside to support the initiative for the
subsequent twelve-month period. Each year that annual tasking statement could be
modified to reflect current needs at the time, so long as the requested
activities were consistent scope of work defined in the MOA.
