Project Overview &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative, multi-
sited ethnographic study that will examine how the rhetoric used by scientists
serves to influence scientific contributions to policy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers
will examine how scientists engage and argue with one another about policy.
Specifically, they will collect and analyze the rhetoric used by scientists who
are engaged in the development of two types of low carbon energy technologies,
wind power and nuclear power, in order to understand how the composition of
their reasoning influences energy policy, and how their rhetoric could serve as
a productive starting point for integrating scientific knowledge into policy
decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project has societal relevance in terms of training a diverse set of students in
social science methodologies and of making the participating scientists aware of
the results so as to improve the integration of science in policymaking with
respect to the crucial issues of climate change mitigation and energy security.
