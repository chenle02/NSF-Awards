Award Abstract Fellow: Cathryn A. Shaw-Reid Proposal number: DBI 9707847 This
action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1997. This
fellowship supports research and training in the area of metabolic biochemistry.
The title of the research and training plan is "Biosynthesis and resistance
mechanisms of the antibiotic bacitracin." The goal is to elucidate the
mechanisms of biosynthesis and resistance using various methods of enzymology.
Bacitracin is a non-ribosomal cyclic polypeptide that prevents peptidoglycan
formation in bacteria. A focal point of this study is to define the role of
4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PP) in the peptidyl-carrier protein, bacitracin
synthetase.
