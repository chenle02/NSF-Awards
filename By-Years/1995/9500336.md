This award supports the study of problems in the algebraic theory of quadratic
forms and the theory of finite-dimensional division algebras. Questions
considered involve determining the structure of bilinear spaces of elliptic
curves. A central problem is to relate the structure of the Witt ring of an
elliptic curve over local and global fields to other arithmetic invariants. A
second collection of questions involves studying the Brauer group and the
valuation theory of division algebras, in both finite and mixed characteristics.
Both subjects are intimately related to Galois cohomology, and therefore
problems in Galois theory will be considered as part of the research. The
research supported involves the theory of quadratic forms. This, in its simplest
form, is the study of polynomial forms of degree two. Equivalently, it is an
analysis of the types of inner products that can define the metric geometry of
an n-dimensional vector space. The study of quadratic forms has deep
interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic K-theory.
