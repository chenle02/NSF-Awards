The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
supports the research program of Professor Peter Dowben of the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. Prof. Dowben and his coworkers investigate the adsorption and
desorption of molecular adsorbates on self assembled organic layers and
crystalline polymers. The goal of the project is to apply new understanding of
polymer interface chemistry and polymer interface magnetic and electric dipole
ordering to the design of novel organic multilayer electronic devices built
using adroit combinations of polymers and large organic and metal-organic
compounds. The research program provides excellent training opportunities to
students and postdoctoral researchers in basic research which is highly relevant
to the microelectronics industry.
