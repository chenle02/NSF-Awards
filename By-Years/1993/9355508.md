9355508 Naegele This project introduces high school physics teachers to recently
developed strategies for enhancing learning through the creative use of
computers, high tech sensors and real time data. During the three years of this
project two groups of 24 physics teachers, selected from the San Francisco Bay
Area schools, will take part in a two summer teacher enhancement program
involving a total of six weeks of instruction along with ten one-day workshops
distributed over two academic years. Participant will have the opportunity to
fabricate some equipment of their own design based on their curriculum needs.
During the academic year, special workshops for participants will be conducted
by faculty from nationally recognized MBL facilities. Each participant will
receive a variety of teaching materials and $400 in interfacing equipment for
use in their respective schools. Participants may earn 16 units of academic
credit.
