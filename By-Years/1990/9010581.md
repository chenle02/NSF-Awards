This proposal requests funds to be used to obtain a Fourier transform infra-red
(FTIR) spectrometer that would serve the needs of Professor Curtis Frank, Gerald
Fuller and Alice Gast in research investigating the properties and processing
requirements of polymer thin films. The instrument that has been selected is the
Nicolet Series 800 FTIR Spectometer. It is equipped with a Model 600 Data
Processing Unit that includes a 100 megabyte hard disk with direct memory
access. Two liquid nitrogen cooled detectors provide high speed data acquisition
and a wavenumber range of 30,000-10/cm. The resolution of the instrument is
0.09/cm. Scanning rates up to 50/sec are possible.
