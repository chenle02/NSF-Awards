A novel method for strengthening ceramics and allowing strength retention to
high temperature is proposed. The Phase I research will determine the
feasibility of introducing substantial surface compressive residual stresses in
alumina, silicon carbide, and silicon nitride using a differential creep
mechanism. The Phase II research optimize parameters for controlling the
magnitude and stress distribution achievable by this technique which is
analogous to thermal tempering of glass. The novel concepts proposed to create
these residual stresses will allow them to be retained up to the temperature at
which creep is substantial. This will allow strengthening to temperatures on the
order of 1300-1600 C for the materials studied in Phase I. This is in contrast
to other methods of introducing residual stresses where the stresses are
nonexistant above 1000 C. The successful completion of the Phase I research will
demonstrate that this technique is applicable to a wide variety of ceramics, for
example: Structural ceramics with improved performance at high temperatures used
in adiabatic diesel and gas turbine engines. Other applications where improved
performance is expected include cutting tools, wear parts, die liners, valves,
and ball bearings.
