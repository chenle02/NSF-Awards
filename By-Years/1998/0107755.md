0107755&lt;br/&gt;Pham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a eighteen-month
U.S.-Vietnam cooperative project between Dr. Hoang Pham, Rutgers University, and
Dr. Thuy Bich Dong, the University of Natural Sciences, Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam, to study a two-stage general calibrating reliablity model for
predicting software reliability under operating environments. This research is
important and addresses a key quality control problem in computer and
information technology. The inclusion of development process factors in software
reliability models is a first important step in improving accuracy in
telecommunication software. The results of this study can have a wide variety of
applications including use in computer and information technology and in control
and automation systems. This proposal addressess an important scientific
question and meets the NSF focus area of human resource development.&lt;br/&gt;
