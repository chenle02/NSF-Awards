Mental computation and computational estimation are receiving considerable
attention as curricular topics for elementary and middle school mathematics,
mainly because they serve important functions in a calculator literate society.
A careful study of the role of these topics in the curriculum is warranted based
on recent research which shows that the development of computational estimation
is closely related to the development of mental computation skills and number
magnitude concepts. To explore the interrelationships of mental computation,
computational estimation, and number sense, a longitudinal research project
involving students in grades four, five, six, and seven is planned. Long-term
instruction on mental computation and number magnitude will be given in grades
four and five. The effects of this instruction on number sense development will
be evaluated both during the instructional period and the following year.
Instruction on mental computational and number magnitude will be provided in
grade six, and instruction on computational estimation in grade seven. The
influence of the grade six instruction on the acquisition of computational
estimation skills will be studied by comparing performances of seventh grade
students with and without the sixth grade instruction. Transfer effects to
related topics such as rational numbers will also be studied. The proposed
research is challenging and has potential value for both researchers and
practitioners. It has been carefully designed with a reasonable development and
implementation schedule. The P.I. is highly respected and the list of associated
staff and consultants represents some of the top scholars in the field. All
reviewers were enthusiastic about the project and recommended funding. The
project is planned for a period of thirty-three (33) months. An award of
$254,559 is recommended as follows: $109,467 from FY87, $98,862 from FY88, and
$46,230 from FY89.
