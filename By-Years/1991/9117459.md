The primary objective of this research is use the evidence of buried soils to
understand the habitat of one of the best known early fossil apes called
Proconsul some 17 million years old from Rusinga Island, Kenya. Proconsul
belonged to an archaic group of monkey-apes (proconsulids) widely considered
ancestral to both the great apes and to early human ancestors
(australiopithecines). The fossil apes are found along with other mammal fossils
in soils buried within a sequence of river deposits. Some of the fossils are
delicate skulls and articulated limbs that could not have been transported far
from where the animals lived. Of the various kinds of soils buried within these
stream deposits, Proconsul is consistently found in one kind of buried soil. The
microscopic and chemical studies of this proposal are aimed at determining
exactly what kinds of soils these were when they formed, and thus where in the
mosaic of vegetation Proconsul lived.
