This experimental research program is aimed at using an optically trapped, ultra
cold, strongly interacting Fermi gas of atoms as a model for the exotic,
strongly interacting Fermi systems comprising nuclear matter. The experiments
will employ all-optical methods. An ultra stable carbon dixide laser trap will
be loaded with a mixture of spin-up and spin-down Fermionic Li-6 atoms to
directly produce highly degenerate, strongly interacting mixtures by forced
evaporation near a Feshbach resonance. The goals of this program include three
topics which are relevant to nuclear matter: i) The study of hydrodynamic
expansion of the gas in the non-superfluid regime versus the super-fluid regime,
including anisotropy, shear and viscosity, and surface tension; ii) Precision
measurement of universal interactions; iii) Measurements of density modulation
in Fermi gases with unequal spin mixtures. The broader impact of the program
involves student education as well as applications to materials science and
condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, high-energy physics, and
astrophysics.
