Abstract

Award: DMS-0306299 Principal Investigator: Eleny-Nicoleta Ionel

This proposal aims to understand the structure of the Gromov-Witten invariants
of symplectic manifolds by combining together ideas coming from different fields
of research. The first project is motivated by a conjecture made by two
physicists, Gopakumar and Vafa. The conjecture implies several surprising
restrictions on the Gromov invariants of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The goal is to
prove the conjectured formula by adapting some analytical techiques developed by
Taubes to relate the Seiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants in 4-dimensions. The
second project's goal is to obtain new relations in the cohomology ring of the
moduli space of complex structures on a marked Riemann surface. Using the
techniques introduced in a previous paper, the PI found several families of
interesting relations, one of which proves a ten year old conjecture of Faber.
The last project seeks to extend the sum formula for Gromov-Witten invariants to
deformations more general then those appearing from a symplectic sum. There
already seems to be several interesting new phenomena appearing in the general
case.

The proposed work lies at the intersection of string theory and symplectic
topology. String theory developed as a potential candidate for a unifying theory
of the universe, which extends Eistein relativity theory. It is based on the
idea that elementary particles (like electrons, photons) should be thought not
as points, but rather small vibrating loops. Working out the details of this
theory turned out to be quite delicate, and has in turn inspired many remarkable
results in mathematics. But also fundamental results in mathematics have
inspired many new discoveries in physics. It is hoped that this project will
contribute to the increased interaction between mathematics and high energy
physics. In the same time, one of the projects will involve graduate students.
