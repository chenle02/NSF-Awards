This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the "Maryland Dynamics Conference."
This is a long-standing series of conferences that are held each spring at the
University of Maryland-College Park. The award will fund the 2010, 2011, and
2012 conferences.

The theme of the "Maryland Dynamics Conference" varies from year to year. For
example, the topic for the 2010 conference is ergodic theory, while the 2011
conference will focus on applications of dynamical systems to number theory and
geometry, with a particular emphasis on Teichmuller theory. The format of the
conferences provides ample opportunity for young mathematicians to present their
work and otherwise to participate fully in conference activities.
