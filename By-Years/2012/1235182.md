1235182/ Parker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clinical schedule of administration for
anticancer agents is developed currently through a statistically-driven trial-
and-error process based on previous experience with similar effective agents, in
combination with animal studies and Phase I trials, to establish maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and starting dose for Phase II trials. The result of the
ensuing Phase II trial, when successful, is a feasible, but suboptimal, schedule
for a drug administered to an "average" patient. But individuals are a
population of differences from the "average". The researchers employ a systems
medicine approach, interfacing medical practice with rigorous systems
engineering tools in an effort to improve the potential outcomes (better
antitumor effect; fewer toxic side effects) for patients receiving chemotherapy
for treatment of cancer. The mathematical models of disease that they will
construct will be derived from mechanism and physiology and informed from
available clinical data. With an interest in using these models for the design
of novel patient-tailored chemotherapy treatment schedules, the researchers will
focus on models that are control-relevant, meaning of suitable complexity to be
used explicitly in model-based systems engineering algorithms. Finally, they
will explicitly incorporate clinical concerns in the treatment design problem
formulation, such that clinical treatment objectives and constraints will
provide practical limits on the chemotherapy schedules returned by the design
algorithm. With an eye to translating these results efficiently to clinical
practice, the researchers focus on two first-line chemotherapeutics: gemcitabine
and docetaxel.
