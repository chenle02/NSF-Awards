A common objective in many computer networks is to balance traffic across
multiple paths in order to improve throughput, reduce congestion, and achieve
higher utilization. Although there is an extensive theoretical literature on how
best to route traffic through a capacitated network, most networks today rely on
schemes that are easy to implement but do not always perform well in practice.
This is due, in part, to the gap between the community of theory researchers who
study advanced routing schemes and the community of systems researchers who
design, build, and operate networks.

This project will advance the theory and practice of routing by developing
oblivious and semi-oblivious routing algorithms that can be implemented on top
of current hardware. The intellectual merit of this research lies in designing
new programming languages based on probabilistic semantics that can be used to
express and reason about these algorithms, and engineering implementations for
these languages based on software-defined networking platforms. This project
will have broad impact on society by producing tools that could help to make
networks more reliable and efficient while simplifying network management.
