The proposed research will continue a program aimed at accurate theoretical
prediction of the properties of strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems,
at the microscopic level defined by the basic forces between the constituents.
The systems of interest include superfluid liquid helium-four unpolarized and
polarized liquid helium-three, spin-aligned bulk atomic hydrogen and deuterium,
nuclear matter, neutron matter, nuclei, and strongly-coupled electronic systems.
Both static and dynamic properties of selected examples, notably the helium
liquids, nuclei, and nuclear matter, will be calculated. Special emphasis is
placed on predictions which can be compared with the results of current
experiments designed to probe the correlation structure of many-body systems.
Such experiments include deep- inelastic neutron scattering from liquid helium
(e.g. at the Argonne IPNS facility) and inclusive electron scattering from
nuclei at GeV energies (e.g. at CEBAF). The basic goal is a deeper understanding
of the breakdown of meanfield pictures due to dynamical correlations. The
primary theoretical tools are the method of correlated basis functions and self-
consistent Green's function theory, applied in parallel or joint investigations.
