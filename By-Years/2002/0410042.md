ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: 0410042 Principal Investigator: Herlihy, Maurice Institution:
Brown University Proposal Title: Transactional Memory

This project focuses on an new approach to multiprocessor synchronization
called transactional memory. This approach replaces conventional locking
techniques with light-weight transactions: sequences of instructions that ap-
pear to execute atomically. Transactional memory relies on a combination of
hardware and software support. The project explores the interface between
hardware and software support for transactions. Hardware is well-suited for
short transactions that access a small memory region, but is less effective for
longer transactions, or transactions that access more memory. Transactions that
cannot be executed directly in hardware must be executed partially or en-tirely
in software, and the project is investigating a range of possible trade-offs.
The project also explores the implications of the transactional memory model for
the design of highly-concurrent data structures. While transactional mem-ory
provides better support for fine-grained concurrency than conventional ock-ing
techniques, it also provides opportunities for new kinds of data structure
designs and algorithms.

This project addresses a fundamental problem in modern computing. Every year,
processors get faster and cheaper. Recently, however, fundamental limita-tions
such as heat dissipation have made advances in clock speed increasingly
difficult. An alternative approach, called multiprocessing, harnesses multiple
processors to work together. Unfortunately, current techniques for multiproc-
essor synchronization are difficult to use, and scale poorly to large-scale sys-
tems. This alternative synchronization model investigated by this project prom-
ises to one substantial barrier to more effective multiprocessor computing. The
project's results will be disseminated through scholarly publication and open-
source software.
