This project, Partners in Elementary Science (PIES), is designed to improve
elementary science education by strengthening the confidence of elementary
school teachers in teaching process/inquiry science in the classroom; helping
elementary teachers link science activities to other academic areas, especially
writing; and assisting principals in developing strategies to improve their
elementary science programs. Fifty teachers, designated as National Science
Foundation Fellows, will be selected from five representative school systems in
western Massachusetts as participants for the first year of the project. The
school systems represent different types of communities ranging from urbanized
centers to rural communities. The project will include Saturday workshops, a
three-week summer institute focused on inquiry/process methodology in the life
sciences and physical sciences, support during the academic year for the
National Science Foundation Fellows including classroom assistance, and monthly
workshops and seminars for principals regarding their role as instructional and
organizational leaders. Math/science programs of the Western Massachusetts Five
College Public School Partnership as well as community resource centers, such as
the Hitchcock Center in Amherst, will provide continuous support for the
project. Excellent support from the school districts will insure implementation
of the project's objectives.
