Industry demands that graduates of programs in the computing sciences be able
to work collaboratively in teams. However, students have often fallen short of
the industry's expectations in this regard. Today, most universities have only
one or two courses in which students work in small groups. This project is
making use of an initial collaborative learning laboratory course with emphasis
placed on teamwork, effectiveness of communication, and cooperation in problem
solving. Students work together in small groups with the idea that, in later
courses, they will gain experience in working with larger teams made up of
people with a range of backgrounds and abilities. Since research shows that
students' learning is improved by active involvement, this project uses an
interactive-collaborative learning environment, building on several research
projects which have investigated collaborative and interactive learning.
Students meet regularly with the instructor in a laboratory situation. Very
brief lectures are used to introduce the topics, while intensive laboratory work
is used to explore the topics actively. The laboratory has modern groupware and
a user-friendly software development environment with a physical arrangement
that supports collaborative activities. This development environment also
supports work conducted at remote sites.
