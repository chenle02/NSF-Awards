This project proposes research on polytopes, one of the central subjects of
geometric combinatorics. There are many aspects of polytopes one can study. This
proposal is focused on the volume and number of lattice points of polytopes as
well as two tools for connecting these subjects: Ehrhart polynomials and
valuations. Based on her previous work, the PI plans to investigate polytopes
with the property that their Ehrhart coefficients can be written in terms of
volumes or more generally are positive, study the Ehrhart coefficients of
k-integral polytopes (a family of polytopes defined in the PI's recent work)
from different perspectives, and further develop two methods for volume
computations. The PI will also study the intermediate generating function, which
is a valuation on polyhedra, and work on generalizing Linke's real Ehrhart
theorem to a theory on valuations.

Polytopes are higher-dimensional generalizations of polygons. An important topic
of study for polytopes is their volume. Also important are their lattice points,
i.e., points whose coordinates are whole numbers. Two tools for studying these
concepts are Ehrhart polynomials and valuations. They have connections not only
to combinatorics, but also to algebra, algebraic geometry, statistics and number
theory. Progress in any direction the PI proposes can lead to either explicit
descriptions of formulas for volumes or numbers of lattice points, or better
understanding of other aspects of polytopes, and therefore benefits related
areas. The proposed research has the potential to lead to new algorithms and
applications outside of pure math. For instance, both lattice points counting
and volume computations have direct relevance to aspects of statistical
sampling, and some of the valuations discussed in the proposal have applications
in optimization. In fact, the PI's recent work already leads to a new algorithm
for computing volume. In general, these problems are sufficiently accessible
that they may be integrated into course material and student research projects.
