The Accessible Retired Computers in Biology (ARCiB) project will provide ongoing
transitional support for software packages, especially those associated with
structural biology, as existing hardware platforms are replaced. This will
reduce disruption to research and education programs that use these software
packages. ARCiB will be used to help support existing packages and make them
available by remote access. If packages are open source and developer would like
to transfer all or part of the support, the ARCiB will offer both an archive
location for source and binaries as well as making the packages available.
Undergraduates are actively involved in the research program for maintaining
this multi-platform interoperability.
