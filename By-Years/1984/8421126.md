This work involves the application of sophisticated control theory to pilot-
scale packed-bed tubular reactors. The results are expected to provide data for
control schemes that result in more economically and energetically efficient
operation and a technique to eliminate potential hot spots which are sometimes
problems in catalyst-packed tubular reactors. Numerical and analytical solutions
of the mathematical representations that describe the system are planned. These
results will be checked with experimental results obtained on a one-inch tubular
packed-bed styrene reactor. The research will thus provide real time
demonstration on a real reactor of the theoretical solution proposed.
