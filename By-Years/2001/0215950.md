With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Cincinnati will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a)
the study of reactive intermediates in crystals; b) design of novel complexes as
photodynamic therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancers; c) the study of
unusual covalent and hydrogen-bonded geometries of promising catalysts and
composite structures; d) the study of host-guest chemistry and molecular
recognition; e) investigations on polymorphism and its role in drug interaction
and design; and f) the design of supramolecular solids that can function as
molecular machines, magnets and coordination polymers .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts, drug
development, and materials sciences.
