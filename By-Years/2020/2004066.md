The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Chemistry Division funds this
research by Professor James Smith of the Chemistry Department at the University
of California, Irvine. Professor Smith and his students study the growth and
change in chemical composition of small molecular clusters in the atmosphere.
These clusters can grow to become nanometer-sized particles. The goal of this
project is to directly observe, for the first time, compositional changes that
occur in atmospheric nanoclusters (ANs) and to understand, at a molecular level,
the interactions that control these processes. This fundamental understanding
makes it possible predict how particles form and evolve in a number of
atmospheric environments that are natural or influenced by human activities.
Understanding the evolution of clusters is necessary for creating models of AN
growth rates and survival probabilities and in turn, correlates to nanoparticle
impacts on air quality and climate. This project includes a peer mentorship
program that pairs graduate and undergraduate students. This partnership helps
prepare undergraduate students for future careers in STEM.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The formation and evolution of atmospheric nanoparticles
(AN) are studied using a combination of laboratory experiments and computational
chemistry simulations. Laboratory experiments explore AN formation and evolution
from reactions of ammonia and organic bases with sulfuric acid. Experiments
focus on reactions between organic compounds such as benzoic acid and glyoxal
and clusters of known composition. Experimental observations are performed in
concert with computational chemistry calculations that elucidate cluster and AN
growth mechanisms. These simulations explore specific processes such as proton
transfer reactions and the role of trace water in clusters of various sizes, up
to several nanometers, as well as for different initial cluster
compositions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
