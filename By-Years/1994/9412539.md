Tinsley/University of Texas Project Summary This SGER project will analyze data
on changes in distribution of current density in the global electric circuit, in
relationship to solar wind modulation of particle fluxes that affect the global
distribution of atmospheric conductivity. Successfully demonstrating the reality
of solar wind/weather/climate relations could lead to improvements in long range
forecasting and reduce the uncertainty in evaluating the effects for global
change of the increasing amounts of greenhouse gases.
