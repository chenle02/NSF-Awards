With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Vaidya will conduct a year long
investigation of the role, across stages of human development, of specific brain
regions in mediating the ability to consciously record, retain, and recall past
experience. Late childhood is marked by rapid mastery of a variety of cognitive
skills that are instrumental to educational, emotional, and social development.
One such cognitive skill is declarative memory, the ability to consciously
record, retain, and recall past experience. Between the ages of 7 and 13 years,
the human brain undergoes profound physical changes that are thought to underlie
improved memory abilities. These childhood years are also marked by a great
amount of individual variation such that children of the same age differ
considerably in the level of memory performance. Currently, there is little
understanding of what specific brain changes mediate memory skills in childhood.
Dr. Vaidya's study examines how neural networks mediating memory for verbal
materials differ in individuals of different ages and in individuals of the same
age but different levels of memory performance. Her study examines the role of
two brain regions, medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, in mediating
memory in 7-9 year old children, 11-13 year old children, and 20-22 year old
adults. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to examine brain activity
related to memories strengthened by the use of strategies and memories simply
forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings in this study are expected to lead
to important information about the neurobiology of memory development. This work
will advance the understanding of brain function and organization and its role
in individual and developmental differences in a primary form of memory. This
work is also likely to have implications for understanding the effects of closed
head injury in individuals of different age.&lt;br/&gt;
