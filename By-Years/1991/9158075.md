This award is for support of a five year program to study the Cenozoic glacial
and climatic history of the Antarctic region. The objectives are to: (1)
identify marine biogenic paleoproductivity events in former Antarctic
seas/embayments; (2) determine hidden stratigraphy in subglacial basins through
study of recycled (ice- transported) microfossils; (3) enhance the utility of
diatoms as tools for paleoenvironmental interpretation (sea-level changes, sea-
ice cover, paleotemperatures, etc.) and age dating; (4) provide stratigraphic
records from Antarctica to direct and limit interpretations from deep-sea data.
This award is under the Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program.
