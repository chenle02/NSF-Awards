In 1989, Dr. Robert Blumenschine, in collaboration with Tanzanian scientists,
began a long-term archaeological project at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The goal of
the research is to survey across an exposed paleo-landscape and to examine the
distribution of faunal and humanly derived artifactual material. On this basis,
it should be possible to determine how the very early humans who inhabited this
region over 1 million years ago subsisted and were able to survive with
extremely simple technology in a difficult environment. The first exploratory
phase of this project met with great success, and Dr. Blumenschine now wishes to
initiate a much larger second phase. However, because of disagreements between
Tanzanian government authorities, it is very uncertain whether a permit will be
issued to allow continuation of the research. The situation requires skillful
advocacy and negotiation by Dr. Blumenschine, and the funds provided by this
award will allow him to travel to Tanzania and speak directly to the relevant
individuals. It is unlikely that any other course of action will permit research
to continue in 1990. This award is necessary to facilitate continued research at
one of the most important known archaeological sites.
