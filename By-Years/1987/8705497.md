The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small peptides and complex
metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the technique
is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. The acquisition of X-ray
crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists to
carry out frontier research. With the aid of awards from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program and NIH, the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Texas at Austin will purchase an automatic diffractometer and the appropriate
peripheral accessories to establish an X-ray diffractometry facility. The areas
of chemistry that will be enhanced by the acquisition of the instrumentation
include: 1) Cation Radical Pericyclic Reactions in Solution 2) Mechanisms of the
Photochemistry and Electrochemistry of Ions, Radicals, and Radical Ions 3)
Development of a Biomimetic Approach to Trichothecenes 4) Organometallic
Structures of Biological Importance 5) Determination of the Structure of
Covalently Bound Drug-DNA Adducts 6) Ligand-based Systematic Modification of
Properties of Transition Metals 7) Synthesis and Properties of Chromium
Complexes 8) Relationship between Structure and Function of Bioactive Natural
Products 9) Study of Reactive Intermediates Generated by Photolysis or
Thermolysis 10) The Synthesis of Novel Macrocyclic Compounds 11) Synthesis of
Natural Products 12) Synthetic and Bioorganic Chemistry
