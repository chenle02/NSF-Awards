This dissertation research will investigate how adolescents from non-intact
families are affected by the involvement of the nonresident parent in their
lives. The results will extend past work on the importance of financial
involvement to a consideration of parental practices such as talking, arguing,
and engaging in joint activities. Outcomes to be studied include academic
achievement, school attendance, grades, emotional well-being, and behavioral
problems. Secondary analyses of existing national surveys will be complemented
by in-depth interviews with 50 adolescents and 30 parents from the local
area.&lt;br/&gt;
