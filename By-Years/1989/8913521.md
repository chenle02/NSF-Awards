Theoretical investigations are performed for the interaction of lasers with
electrons bound in atoms. The outcome of the interactions is the excitation of
one or more electrons, perhaps also the generation of radiation of wave lengths
different from those of the primary laser. Mathematical and computational
methods will be developed to account for the strong coupling of the strong laser
radiation with the electrons and its dependence on the details of the atomic
structure. Predictions will be employed in interpretation of ongoing experiments
and to provide a guide for design of further experiments.
