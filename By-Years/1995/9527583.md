9527583 HAFNER Despite considerable study, biologists still know very little
about relative rates of DNA change in distantly related groups of organisms,
such as mammals versus insects. In this research, Mark Hafner and Xuhua Xia will
investigate a host-parasite system, from which they will generate comparative
data about rates of DNA change. The hosts in this study are pocket gophers,
which are small, herbivorous rodents found throughout much of North and Central
America. The parasites are chewing lice, which are small, ectoparasitic insects
that live in the fur of their hosts. The association between chewing lice and
their hosts is considered obligate, because the lice cannot survive off their
natural hosts. This intimate and long-term association between pocket gophers
and chewing lice presents an unusual opportunity to examine both the pattern and
rate of molecular change in the DNA of these organisms. Previous work has shown
that each speciation event in the pocket gophers is accompanied by a speciation
event in their lice. This means that one can measure the amount of molecular
change between the species of lice that live on these gophers. Since time is a
constant, such a comparison yields a direct measure of relative rates of DNA
change in the gophers versus their lice. Sequences of two mitochondrial genes
(cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b) will be used to construct independent
phylogenies of gophers and lice. These trees will be compared statistically to
evaluate overall branching similarity, hence degree of cospeciation in the
gopher-louse assemblage. Finally, lengths of homologous branches in the gopher
and louse trees will be compared to determine relative rates of DNA change in
gophers versus lice.
