A central goal of this mathematical research is the use of newly developed
relationships between special functions applied to the evaluation of complex
integrals. The primary focus is that of the famous Selberg formula for the
integration of symmetric functions multiplied against the Vandermonde
determinant, acting as a weight. Work will continue addressing possible
extensions of this closed form expression. Initial efforts will be made to
establish a formula for the ratios of alternantes to the Selberg symmetric
functions. It is expected that they will be given explicitly in terms of
tournaments. Work will also be done on beta type distributions and their
orthogonal polynomials. In addition, the classification of functions which
provide extensions of the q- Dyson theorem of Zeilberger and Bressoud will be
sought. It is conjectured that not all such functions will turn out to be
symmetric.
