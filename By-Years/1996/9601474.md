It is widely recognized that people are strongly motivated to maintain a
positive conception of themselves and a consistent, meaningful conception of the
world in which they live. Until recently, however, little attention has been
paid to the question of why these very basic human motives exist. The current
research is focused on a theoretical explanation for these motives. The theory
(Terror Management Theory) suggests that self-esteem and cultural worldviews
serve the psychological function of protecting people from the terror they feel
when they contemplate or become aware of their own inevitable death. For this
reason, it is proposed that people invest a significant amount of effort in
maintaining faith in their own worldviews and belief in their own self-worth.
Accumulating experimental research, conducted in four different countries,
provides support for this analysis. The goal during the current funding period
is to extend Terror Management Theory to better understand its domain of
application, and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying psychological
processes that produce the documented effects. A broad range of experimental
methods will be used to examine such behaviors as stereotyping, helping, and
efforts to persuade others.
