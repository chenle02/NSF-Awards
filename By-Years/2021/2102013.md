Jeffrey A. Cina of the University of Oregon is supported by an award from the
Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of
Chemistry for the theoretical study of molecular energy-transfer processes of
relevance to the natural and artificial harvesting of solar energy. His research
group will develop and implement methods to efficiently simulate quantum
mechanical aspects of electronic energy transfer in realistic molecular networks
comprising several light-absorbing units and to predict and interpret the
results of useful and revealing ultrafast-laser measurements on these important
and widely studied systems. Cina will serve scientific outreach by organizing a
seminar-style undergraduate course for non-science majors on the science of
climate change. He will continue to foster improved inclusivity in the
scientific community by exercising and modeling welcoming, supportive actions in
his research and teaching roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with his
graduate-student co-workers, Jeffrey Cina will carry out theoretical
investigations of a new measurement strategies that will apply existing tools of
multi-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (also known as multi-dimensional wave-
packet interferometry, or WPI) to spatially oriented ensembles of electronic
excitation energy transfer dimers, trimers, or tetramers (or to individual small
multimers). He will predict and interpret ultrafast spectroscopy signals
containing direct, isolable information on the time-course of intersite or
interexciton electronic coherenceâ€”key determinants of the nature and efficiency
of excitation transport. He will carry out simulations of measurable signals of
this kind on model systems of increasing degrees of complexity and realism. In
support of this objective, he will develop, test, and apply a new protocol that
treats discrete site-excited or excitonic states as a quantum mechanical
subsystem while modeling the dynamics of intramolecular, chromophore-medium, and
medium nuclear degrees of freedom with compactly parametrized, semiclassical
trial wave packets. In addition, Cina will explore the effects of quantum
mechanical "which-path" interference of electronic excitation transport in few-
chromophore complexes, and identify spectroscopic signatures of this specific
coherence-dependent phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
