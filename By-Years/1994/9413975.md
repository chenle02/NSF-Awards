This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of Kansas acquire an
upgrade of Mass Spectrometry which will be used in research. The research
activity to be supported includes conducting a wide variety of fundamental
research in the chemistry of proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and synthetic
macromolecules. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique
of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular
weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in
combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in
mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools
available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
