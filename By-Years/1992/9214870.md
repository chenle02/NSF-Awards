This Industry/University Cooperative Research Fellowship project funds the
University of Washington's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Design of Analog-Digital Integrated Circuits to study the design and test of
mixed-signal systems at Boeing Company. The project which is to take from six to
nine months is being cost-shared by Boeing with approximately 25% of the cost
being provided by the University of Washington. The project is focussing on
design-for-test methodologies for analog microcircuits, as the first step
towards general analog test and diagnosis problems. Theoretical and experimental
approaches will be applied to analog filters to prove the feasibility of the
methodologies. The project has been endorsed by the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Design Analog-Digital Integrated Circuits. The
Program Manager recommends the University of Washington be awarded $25,266 six
months for this project.
