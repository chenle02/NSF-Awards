9625814 Bowden The objective of this research is to design and develop a
prototype sensor fusion adaptive critic neurocontrol system which will generate
the cut paths for a computer numerical control (CNC) machine given only the
desired surface shape and the maximum allowable surface error. This research
will lay the foundation for the development of software and hardware simplify
the interface between the product design and automated fabrication processes and
to improve product quality. It attempts a technological leap in adaptive
controls research for CNC machining processes and a major advance in as well.
This group will develop, test, and demonstrate a novel sensor fusion adaptive
critic neurocontrol system for cutting airfoil shaped ruled surfaces. The
neurocontrol system will provide a 5-axis milling machine with the intelligence
to cut molds for airfoil shapes based on a mathematical description of the
desired shape. The neurocontrol system will make use of the multiple sensor
readings available during the cutting process as inputs to the adaptive critic.
The sensor information will be fused for dimensionality reduction and to provide
greater richness of inputs. The adaptive critic is a powerful method for
adaptive control. To maximize the probability of successfully achieving the
research objective, a cross-disciplinary team of experts has been assembled for
the project. Members of the team come from the Department of Industrial
Engineering at Mississippi State University (MSU), MSU's Raspet Flight Research
Laboratory (RFRL), and Accurate Automaton Corporation. Mississippi State
University's RFRL has a strong precision mold making activity and Accurate
Automation Corporation has an extensive history in neural network system
development. ***
