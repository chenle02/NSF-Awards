9417175 Wagner The Medical Center Internet Connection project will expand and
integrate the existing network at the Lutheran Medical Center with NSFNET and
Internet. This Internet connection will enable physicians, faculty, researchers,
librarieans, staff and students to collaborate with colleagues within the
Gundersen/Lutheran Health System and with those at other Internet sites. Patient
care questions, diagnosis inquiries and treatment plans can be electronically
discussed. Collaborative research can also be accomplished more readily with an
Internet connection. The connection will facilitate access to research resources
for the 30 rural affiliates, including library resources and National Library of
Medicine databases.
