This project concerns arithmetic geometry, hyperbolic geometry, representation
theory and number theory. The first goal is to prove Riemann Roch formulas for
coherent and Weil-etale sheaves on which a finite group acts. Such formulas are
relevant to conjectures about special values of L-series. A second goal is to
study commensurability classes of arithmetic groups and their connection to the
length spectra of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces. A third goal is to study
deformations of complexes of modules for a profinite group. The focus will be on
a conjecture that versal deformations arising from arithmetic geometry are
representable by perfect complexes over the versal deformation ring. The last
goal of the project is to study which finite group actions on curves in positive
characteristic can be lifted to characteristic zero.

The unifying theme of this project is the study of symmetries. Riemann Roch
formulas quantify how symmetries of systems of equations are reflected in their
solutions. One can use results of this kind to greatly constrain the Solutions.
Symmetries enter into the famous problem of recognizing the shape of an object
from how it reflects sound or radio waves. A variant of this problem will be
studied which involves also using the lengths of certain paths on the object to
try to recognize it. A basic problem in considering symmetries is to quantify
how much information is needed to describe them. This problem will be
investigated in the context of describing all ways to deform an object having a
set of prescribed symmetries. Finally, obstructions will be studied to extending
symmetries from a small object (a curve in positive characteristic) to a larger
one (a curve in characteristic zero).
