This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Fifteenth East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium" (ECOAS) a conference series
in which the 2017 event will take place on the weekend October 7-8, 2017, on the
campus of the University of of Louisiana at Lafayette. Additional information
about the conference can be found on the website

This conference is the fifteenth installment of the East Coast Operator Algebras
Symposium, a series that annually brings together a diverse group of
mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator
algebras. The main foci of the 2017 event are the following: subfactor theory,
Popa's deformation/rigidity theory; free probability theory, the Elliott
classification program for C*-algebras, the Novikov conjecture, and C*-algebras
and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for
graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
