The objective of this project is to improve estimates of the high latitude
electrodynamic forcing of the thermosphere through quantification of variable
electric fields and auroral precipitation, and through analysis of their
influences on the thermosphere and on ionospheric currents. The PIs propose to
construct an empirical model of high-latitude electric fields and auroral
precipitation that includes both average and variable components, and that
quantifies magnitudes, coherences, and the correlation between the field and the
precipitation. Data will come from the Dynamics Explorer-2 (DE-2) spacecraft and
from incoherent scatter radars. The PIs will validate this new model by using it
as input to the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation
Model (TIE-GCM) and comparing their results with high-latitude observations of
ground magnetic variations and neutral thermospheric winds and temperatures,
including both mean values and standard deviations.
