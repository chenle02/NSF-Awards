This grant supports research in nuclear astrophysics and nuclear physics. The
nuclear astrophysics work involves study of nuclear reactions involving
radioactive nuclides. Some of these reactions are of importance to primordial
nucleosynthesis, as they determine the possibility of making nuclides heavier
than carbon in the big bang. Others impact the Hot CNO cycle, in that they
describe the ability of that stellar burning process to generate energy or
synthesize nuclides heavier than oxygen. The nuclear physics component involves
a search for a new type of reaction mechanism involving resonant pion transfer
between analog nuclei at energies near the coulomb barrier. Both the nuclear
physics and the nuclear astrophysics studies utilize experimental facilities at
Notre Dame University and at Livermore National Laboratory which allow studies
of reactions on the radioactive nuclei of interest by a double scattering
technique.
