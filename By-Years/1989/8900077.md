This proposal is to collect observations of winds and of latent and sensible
heat fluxes at the sea surface to provide boundary conditions for forcing ocean
circulation models. This data is now provided for certain areas by the PI and by
the major atmospheric modeling centers. As a result of this work, the fields
will be more representative and accurate. This proposal is a component of the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
