Students will have an opportunity to examine the nervous system at the cellular
level. Equipment will be introduced to introductory students through
demonstrations or simple exercises on cell culture and the identification of
cells via immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence. More advanced students in the
neuroscience curriculum will prepare primary cultures of neural cells for
further study. The equipment, which will also be available for senior research
projects, includes a stereo microscope with a color camera and monitor
permitting all to view the cells in the field simultaneously, a
phase/fluorescent microscope to identify the cultured cells with fluorescent
antibodies, and a microscope equipped with an environmental chamber, video
camera and monitor. This will allow direct observation of the dynamic processes
of cell growth and migration. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
