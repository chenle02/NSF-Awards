The research involves the study of interblock rank tests in statistics for
univariate and multivariate factorial designs in which all of the dependent data
is ranked without regard to block or variate membership. The study will include
a comparison of the small sample properties, efficiency, and robustness
properties of certain interblock rank statistics with the corresponding
properties of aligned rank tests, rank transform procedures and intrablock rank
tests. This will be extended to the asymptotic properties of linear rank
statistics with dependent data under general alternatives. Research will also be
conducted on the extension of certain approaches of generating intrablock rank
test from metrics on permutations to include new interblock rank tests.
