Ethical studies in technical communication underscore the importance of teaching
students about effective communication, but much teaching material uses
hypothetical case studies to demonstrate ethical issues. Historical research
suggests that communication errors play a major role in large-scale
technological disasters, but rhetoricians have not studied actual documentation
in detail. Preliminary research into mining disasters that were the subjects of
Congressional oversight suggests that problems in documentation, guidelines and
specifications contribute to disasters. The evidence raises questions about the
consequences of writing practice and the use and interpretation of technical
documents. This study will examine documentation in two disasters to (1) define
categories and functions of different kinds of documents affecting technological
development and management, (2) determine the codes and conventions that govern
the production of documents and allow management to use and interpret them, (3)
describe how writers select or exclude evidence to accept, assign or avoid
responsibility and determine how those decisions affect disasters; (4) determine
whether writers see their role as observers, recording objective facts, or
active problem solvers; (5) compare expert and non-expert testimony to
understand how agencies influence the production of texts; and (6) determine the
function of individual documents in influencing decisionmaking about complex
technologies. The topic of this proposal is of high priority for Ethics and
Values Studies. The qualifications and track record of the investigator are
good. The project provides an important impetus to rhetorical studies of
technical writing in the development and management of complex technologies.
Besides their utility for scholarship in this field, results will be useful for
scientists, engineers, policy analysts, decisionmakers and citizens concerned
about these issues. They will also be useful in courses and curricula in
technical writing. The proposal is recommended for support.
