9402995 Buck Numerical models of mantle flow and melting will be used to model
the dynamic support of MOR axial highs considering the physical parameters
governing subridge mantle flow and melting that are consistent with data on
axial highs and axial lows. In addition to axial strength, cohesion of the
lithosphere will be considered. Detailed two-dimensional models of the effect of
normal fault offsets that allow for elastic, plastic and viscous behaviors in
the lithosphere will be constructed. ***
