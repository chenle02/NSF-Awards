Turbulence is ubiquitous in nature, playing a fundamental role in a multitude of
physical theories, from atmospheric and oceanic dynamics to the birth of stars.
This project is dedicated to an investigation into hydrodynamic and wave
turbulence, both of which, at the core predict cascades of energy. The principal
aim of this supported research is to better understand these energy cascades.
The project is divided into two projects: a study of non-uniqueness of weak
solutions to equations arising in hydrodynamics, and a rigorous approach to the
derivation of the kinetic wave equation in wave turbulence theory. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the first project will be to utilize the theoretical
tool of convex integration to build theoretical energy cascades in order to
resolve long standing open problems related to weak solutions to the Navier-
Stokes equations. The overarching goal of the second project will be to
rigorously determine the validity of the kinetic wave equation which is
theorized to predict turbulence phenomena in a host settings such as water
waves, plasma physics and climate science. The project will draw on a diverse
set of mathematical tools from analysis, number theory and statistical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
