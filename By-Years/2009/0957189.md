The PI will use computational models of the social structure of science to study
several issues associated with the division of cognitive labor. Those issues
include the following. How do individual scientists allocate their cognitive
labor given research costs and limited access to information? How does drawing
on the cognitive resources of the scientific community enhance or retard the
discovery of significant truths? How should the scientific community as a whole
optimally allocate its cognitive labor?

The notion of the division of cognitive labor may be characterized as follows.
Scientists are not lone agents, cut off from the outside world, responding only
to information generated in their laboratories. Rather, they make decisions
about what to investigate by integrating what they discover for themselves with
what they learn from others. They also take into account external factors such
as grants, prizes, and prestige. This feedback leads scientists to divide their
resources among differing approaches to studying phenomena of interest. While
this coordination is neither planned nor explicit, it seems to enhance the
ability of scientific communities to discover significant, true things about the
world.

Although the results of this research project will primarily contribute to the
philosophy of science literature, it has three major areas of potential broader
impact. First, it will involve training undergraduate students in the use of
computational modeling to investigate philosophical problems. Second, while the
models developed in this project are not appropriate for making direct policy
advice, they can investigate sets of incentives that would change the division
of cognitive labor in more epistemically productive ways. Finally, the project
will generate materials that can be reformulated for use in secondary and higher
education with the goal of making citizens more informed consumers of science,
especially in fields such as evolution and climate modeling where critics prey
on public misunderstanding of how theories are tested.
