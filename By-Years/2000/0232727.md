The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
development of novel lithium based cathode materials for high discharge rate
applications. Significant attempts have been made in the past decade to
commercialize lithium manganospinels but have met with limited success due to
poor cycle life and low rate dischargeability. Proprietary synthesis
technologies have been developed to stabilize defective lithium manganospinels,
which in thin film form, exhibit high capacity (> 230 mAH/g), long cycle life(>
700 cycle) and high discharge rates (> 25C). These materials have been
fabricated using a special Vapor Phase Activated Oxygen (VPAO) method. This
project proposes to explore the feasibility of the VPAO method to synthesize
bulk electrodes for high discharge rate applications. Two methods will be
explored using the VPAO techniques: (i) direct scale-up of the thin film
technology to thick films and (ii) synthesis of defective manganospinel powders
by gas phase nucleation process.

Li-based batteries are presently used in low power applications. Success of the
proposed research will allow lithium batteries to capture the market for high-
powered applications such as power tools and electric vehicles, as well as the
portable batteries market.
