The surface condition of a road is critical for driving safety, particularly
during adverse weather. Wet and icy roads occur only 3 percent of the time but
account for more than 18 percent of crashes. The project will develop a model to
estimate tire-pavement friction based on the fusion of tire and vehicle sensors
with advanced algorithms. The ability to collect and evaluate such information
in real time will help drivers make better driving decisions. Transportation
agencies will also be able to design proactive strategies. For example, agencies
could use the friction estimates to identify and treat accident-prone "hot
spots" before crashes happen, or to prioritize the most critical road segments
to treat first during a winter storm. The resulting enhanced decision-making can
help reduce the number of crashes and save lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will combine responses from tire and vehicle sensors to develop models
to evaluate the friction levels between tires and pavement. The project has two
specific goals: (1) to develop a theory to describe the tire-road contact
mechanics and the resulting friction properties; and (2) to conduct experiments
to validate the proposed model. The project fills a critical gap in the
development of mathematical models and algorithms for predicting tire-pavement
contact and friction. The project also integrates knowledge from mechanical
engineering and civil engineering to advance the techniques for evaluating tire-
pavement friction. Available, real-time, vehicle-based estimates of hazardous
driving conditions will help improve operations in transportation agencies and
driving safety.
