This project is concerned with the problem of statistical signal processing for
signal and noise processes modeled as fractional Brownian motions. Fractional
Brownian motions provide analytical models for random processes that exhibit
1/f-type spectral behavior and thus that have unexpectedly strong long-term
serial dependencies. This type of behavior is poorly modeled by the rational
models that are commonly used in the analysis of statistical signal processing
problems. Since many physical phenomena exhibit this type of behavior
(including, among many other examples, flicker noise in oscillators), it is of
interest to study the properties of these processes in the context of signal
processing functions. Several specific aspects of this problem that will be
considered for these models include signal detection, parameter estimation, and
signal estimation; stochastic control; and information theoretic issues. The
principal goal of this study is to establish the general methodology and
performance expectations for processing of signal or noise phenomena that can be
modeled in this way.
