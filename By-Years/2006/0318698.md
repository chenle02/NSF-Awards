Deep submergence technology has a long history with many individuals and groups
at numerous US institutions playing key roles in its development since the
1950's. The construction of Alvin for US Navy, strategic interests, in the early
1960s, and its eventual integration into US oceanographic facilities in the mid
1970s, ushered in an era where scientists could routinely propose to do basic
research and conduct experiments in situ on the
seafloor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early 1990's, remotely operated vehicle
(ROV) technology and capabilities were introduced. ROVs used in the academic
community include ROV Jason and the Argo II and DSL-120 sonar mapping systems,
creating a national deep submergence capability with access to depths as great
as 6000m. Since the mid-1990s there have been several committees, workshops,
reports and technical publications focusing on the communities perspective on
the evolving deep submergence technology in ROVs, autonomous underwater vehicles
(AUVs), and the continuing needs for human-occupied vehicles (HOVs) for basic
research in the deep ocean and seafloor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF's Ocean
Sciences Division (OCE) is interested in assisting the ocean sciences community
as much as possible in the quest for the right mix of deep submergence vehicles.
To accomplish this, OCE has requested an Ocean Studies Board study to: 1).
assess the continued role of human occupied vehicles in deep submergence
science, within the context of current and projected capabilities of remotely
operated and autonomous vehicles, telepresence, seafloor observatories, and
other non-human occupied technologies; 2). make recommendations regarding the
mix of new facilities needed to continue to carry out world-class deep
submergence science; and 3). discuss innovative design concepts and
technological advances that should be incorporated into any new submersibles to
support current and future research needs.&lt;br/&gt;
