This research will study the properties of p-adic complex powers, more
specifically the connections between the poles of the p-adic complex power,
eigenvalues of monodromy and roots of the b-function. The first problem is to
show that in generic cases of arbitrary dimension every eigenvalue of monodromy
must be associated to a pole of the p-adic complex power. The second problem is
to examine the relationship between poles of the p- adic complex power and
eigenvalues of monodromy in the low dimensional case of surfaces with quasi-
ordinary singularities. A third problem related to this would be a geometrical
interpretation of roots of the b-function for this class of surfaces. This
research is in the exciting area which bridges number theory and algebraic
geometry. The powerful tools of the latter subject are brought to bear in
solving problems in the former. This research is in a new and erudite area with
lots of promise. Meuser is one of the real experts here and one can only wait to
see what important and unexpected result she uncovers.
