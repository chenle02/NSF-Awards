The main objective of this research program is to develop methodologies for the
design of nonlinear digital controllers for nonlinear dynamic systems. Since the
choice of a controller structure is highly dependent upon the structural
properties of the underlying system, the first step will be to determine how the
geometric properties of a continuous-time system are deformed by the
introduction of the usual sample-and-hold devices. Recent work of the author and
his students has clarified the linear case, but for nonlinear systems, much work
remains to be done. However, preliminary results show that the additional
flexibility gained by allowing multi-rate sampling is crucial to achieving such
design goals as feedback linearization; this second avenue of investigation will
be further pursued. A third goal will be to develop a notion of "transmission
dynamics" of a discrete-time nonlinear system; this will play the role of the
transmission zeros of a linear system and will lead to conditions for the
existence of controllers which simultaneously decouple and stabilize a nonlinear
discrete-time system. Finally, joint work will be done with Dr. C. Moog, of
France, and Dr. M. di Benedetto, of Italy, on differential algebraic tools for
the analysis of nonlinear systems. The main objective of this research is to
develop methodologies for the design of nonlinear digital controllers for
nonlinear dynamic systems. This research will be valuable in controlling high
performance nonlinear systems such as those encountered in advanced aircraft and
process control.
