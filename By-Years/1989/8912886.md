This project will support the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropologist who will study the effect of biomedical training of traditional
birth attendants (midwives) on maternal health in Belize. The objectives are to
describe similarities and differences in the obstetric theory and practice of
traditionally and biomedically trained birth attendants, and to determine how
these groups affect maternal mortality. The methodology includes participant
observation, health histories and physical examinations. This research is
important because child health and maternal illness are topics of major concern
in the developing world. The understanding of how traditional knowledge and
practice impact on these can help health care policy makers design more
effective programs.
