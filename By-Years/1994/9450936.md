9450936 Compaan The University of Toledo Department of Physics and Astronomy
proposes to enhance its advanced undergraduate Atomic and Molecular Physics
Laboratory (Physics 481) with the addition of a structured sequence of
experiments in high resolution spectroscopy. This sequence will build on
existing experiments, which use grating spectrometers and Fabry-Perot
interferometers, to add several related experiments in high resolution atomic
and molecular spectroscopy. The new laboratory experiences will include 1) Raman
scattering from diatomic molecules, 2) velocity measurements on solar spectra
using the UT heliostat, an echelle spectrometer, and a CCD detector, 3) Doppler-
free tunable diode laser saturation spectroscopy of rubidium vapor, 4)
recoilless gamma ray absorption studies via the Mossbauer effect, and 5)
radiative lifetime measurements with a pulsed diode laser. This sequence will
provide the students with laboratory experiences utilizing modern spectroscopy
equipment, data acquisition, and data analysis while exposing them to classic
experiments which all relate to linewidth broadening in electromagnetic
radiation processes. Among other measurements the students will determine
interatomic separations in O2, N2, and CO2, the nuclear spin statistics and
rotational temperatures of these molecules, the rotational velocity of the sun,
Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening in gases, mode structures of laser emission,
recoil-free radiation processes with high energy photons, and uncertainty
principle limits to radiative linewidths.
