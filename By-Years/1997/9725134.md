9725134 Bruckner The object of the proposed research is to gather additional
preliminary data to support the development of computer models and new
technological tools for the evaluation, treatment and prevention of gait
disorders arising from foot problems associated with subtalar joint (STJ),
located between the talus and the calcaneus in the foot, plays a significant
role in both the efficiency of modern human bipedal locomotion and the
pathogenesis of injuries in the foot, knee, pelvic girdle and low back. The PI's
investigations show that some STJ configurations mechanically restrict joint
range of motion (ROM) while other STJ facet configurations do not. Persons with
the more restricted or "rigid" STJ configurations have a statistically
significant higher incidence of heel spurs than people with mobile STJ
configurations. Others have found that osteoarthritis is more prevalent in
joints with mobile STJ configurations and conclude that the osteophytes probably
form to stabilize a structurally hypermobile system. This SGER proposal is
designed to gather evidence supporting the hypothesis that people with rigid STJ
configurations have a measurable difference in their gait patterns when compared
to people with mobile STJ configurations. This study represents a small-scale,
exploratory investigation in support of a long term goal of uniting
bioengineering with physical therapy to address some of the biomechanical
problems seen in the foot, lower limb and spine. The results will be new
technological tools that will enable clinicians to identify foot deformities
with a high degree of validity and reliability, study the gait of people with
foot deformities and fabricate shoes and foot orthoses dynamically to correct
and, eventually, prevent gait problems. ***
