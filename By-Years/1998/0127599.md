Biological Sciences (61) Biological research has moved from the laboratory bench
to the desktop computer. However, bioinformatics, the use of information
technology to manage, store, and analyze biological data, is seldomly used in
the biology classroom. Not only is it important for students to develop research
skills in this area, but engaging in these types of activities gives students a
better understanding of molecular biology. This project enables college and high
school instructors to use bioinformatics in life science courses by addressing
the lack of "classroom-ready" materials. The project is developing instructional
materials that focus primarily on teaching students how to use the databases and
analysis tools available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI). Students learn fundamental concepts in biology through the use of
bioinformatics tools to perform novel experiments. Products of the project
include: 1) a textbook/laboratory manual written from the perspective of how
biologists use bioinformatics and providing an overview of the field and fifteen
to twenty different experiments designed to help students develop skills in this
area; 2) an instructor's manual to help instructors interpret results and
including guidelines for implementation and inquiry-based activities; 3) a CD-
ROM supplement containing data sets and examples that demonstrate how the
laboratories work; and 4) on-line, animated, tutorials designed for novice users
and made available through the education page at the NCBI web site.
