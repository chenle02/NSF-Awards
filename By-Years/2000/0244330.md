Experimental and Analytical Evaluation of Dynamic Fracture in Graded
Multifunctional Material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
comprehensive investigation of the dynamic mechanical response and failure of
graded multifunctional materials under different loading conditions is proposed.
Procedures for preparing a variety of both transparent and opaque graded
materials will be established. Stress and deformation fields near dynamically
loaded stationary and propagating cracks tips will be measured in real-time
using optical techniques and high-speed photography. Appropriate stress fields
for analyzing the experimental data will be developed, and a unified failure
criterion for dynamic crack initiation and propagation in these materials will
be established. This study will significantly advance knowledge on the dynamic
response and failure characteristics of graded multifunctional materials, and
will be of immense value to industries and defense agencies. This research will
involve graduate and undergraduate students resulting in senior projects, theses
and dissertations. The students will receive valuable exposure to the challenges
of material synthesis and various experimental techniques used for mechanical
and fracture characterization of novel materials.&lt;br/&gt;
