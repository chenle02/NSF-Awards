This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Recombinant source of the first
marine-derived diterpene cyclase for pseudopterosin biosynthesis." This research
is developing a recombinant source of elisabethatriene synthase, a diterpene
cyclase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the antiinflammatory compounds
called pseudopterosins. The principles elucidated in the research will provide
the groundwork for the production of other enzymes involved in this biosynthetic
pathway and for the cloning of other marine-derived terpene cyclases.
