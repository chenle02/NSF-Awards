This is an award to support research on the effect that soil structure has on
facilitation or resisting the passage of light hydrocarbons such as benzene,
kerosene, gasoline, jet and diesel fuels through soils. The project involves use
of a dual energy gamma attenuation system for studying the movement of water,
air and the light hydrocarbons (all of which typically occupy portions of the
void space in porous subsurface media) through soils placed in a laboratory
flume, simulating groundwater aquifers. The light hydrocarbons being studied in
this project are commonly stored prior to use in underground storage tanks,
leakage from which constitutes a common source of groundwater pollutants.
Results of this research are expected to be of considerable value for testing
and validating models that predict the behavior of these pollutants as they move
from the point of origin into the water table.
