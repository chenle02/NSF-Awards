This project aims to develop an undergraduate computing laboratory to support
the expansion of a 2-year pre-engineering program to 4- year baccalaureate
programs in mechanical, electrical, and manufacturing engineering. The project
involves the implementation of Unix-based workstation computing in a laboratory,
which influences all the lower and upper level courses. The lower level courses
involve extensive research paper and laboratory report writing. The upper level
courses involve specialized software such as: Mathcad, Maple V, Auto CAD, CAE
Tools, SIMSCRIPT, ALGOR and others. The industrial-type workstations are ideal
for such software. The following courses are being directly impacted by the
computing laboratory: for all majors, the Senior Design Project; for mechanical
engineering majors, Mechanical Engineering Analysis, Heat Transfer and Theory of
Machines; for electrical engineering majors, Engineering Laboratory, Digital
Systems; and for manufacturing engineering majors, Manufacturing processes,
Computer- Aided Design and Manufacturing, and Facilities Design and Materials
Handling.
