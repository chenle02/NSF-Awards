This Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and Engineers helps to
augment the research potential of the principal investigator through the
development of skills in the preparation of inorganic membranes. Alumina
membranes with various nominal pore sizes and size distributions, with well-
defined non-idealities like pore branching, and with different surface charge
character will be made by anodic oxidation and used to expand fundamental
studies on hindered diffusion.
