9453813 Philip M. Burgess Using Science & Technology to Build High Performance
Communities The proposed activity is to undertake an experimental demonstration
program to enhance the concept and activities of EPSCoR in the West by
establishing and managing a network of resources from state and federal
agencies, including the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense,
Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics &
Space Administration, and the U.S.Department of Agriculture. These agencies
currently conduct EPSCoR or EPSCoR-like programs. The program will convene a
series of workshops to promote and enhance EPSCoR in the West. The Center will
(1) identify western EPSCoR states that will benefit from the use of locally
available science and technology resources; (2) identify western enterprise
formation and long-term job creation, (3) enhance EPSCoR relations with
statewide and regional civic leadership, (4) convene workshops to explore
resources and strategies, (5) develop university/industry cooperative projects
directed at economic development, and (6) provide general administrative support
activities necessary to perform these functions. The project provides for the
assessment of western EPSCoR state potential for technology development. It will
use its assessment process to select those western EPSCoR states with the
greatest potential as pilot states in which to develop experimental projects.
The projects will attempt to integrate university, industry, and federal
resources towards the goal of technology- intensive economic development.
Assessment and documentation of the various strategies used will be catalogued.
