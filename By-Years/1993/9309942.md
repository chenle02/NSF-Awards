9309942 Pruitt Escalation, which can be defined as change toward the use of more
extreme tactics in conflict, is the source of the most important problems
associated with conflict. We know from prior research that heavy escalation is
usually accompanied by changes in perceptions of self (or own group) and of the
other party, leading to progressive worsening of relations between the parties
and further escalation in the next conflict. But the details of the conditions
and processes that produce escalation are as yet unknown. This project will
develop a new, ecologically valid laboratory method for studying the escalation
of social conflict and will test some hypotheses derived from a preliminary
theory of escalation. The new method, which has been successfully used in a
preliminary study, corrects serious defects in past procedures for studying
conflict. The research is designed to reveal the structure of escalation, its
immediate psychological antecedents, and some of the conditions producing it.
Two experiments will examine the effects of blaming the other party for
persistent annoyance and relationships with that party. The rest of the work
will involve the development of measures. New measures of escalation will be
devised by having subjects rate the major tactics used to cope with the
annoyance. Subjects will also rate these tactics on three dimensions that are
believed to influence choices among them: effectiveness, normativeness, and
likelihood of being resented. A multiple regression analysis will assess the
importance of the dimensions under various conditions. Many psychological states
wi ll also be measured. The research will advance knowledge of one of the most
destructive forces in human experience, helping to interpret -- and hopefully
eventually to control -- such phenomena as spouse battering, urban riots, and
armed conflict between nations. om ` ` Baerwald 3. Human Resources D. Material
