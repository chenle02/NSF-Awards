9526903 Davidson The details of differentiation (melting, fractional
crystallization, magma mixing and contamination) in a given magma system are
commonly difficult to decipher. One particularly useful tool in identifying open
system processes is the use of isotopic ratios. Interaction between isotopically
diverse components modifies the isotopic compositions of resulting
differentiates, but bulk analyses of the rocks typically fail to identify the
end members involved. If vestiges of these components retain their physical
identity (early-formed crystals from magmas that have subsequently hybridized,
xenocrysts from assimilants, etc.) then they may also retain their original
isotopic compositions. Complications arise from the for continued - if not
constant - growth phases through complex differentiation scenarios. In
principle, much of the evolutionary history of a magma system is locked into
phases crystallizing from it. Determining isotopic variations within these
phases may help elucidate such histories, particularly when integrated with
spatially correlated major and trace element data. The P.I.s propose to improve
on methods to perform such analyses, and outline some specific studies that may
illustrate its potential.
