This workshop will examine three areas in networking in which combining the
research strengths of both Japan and the US could benefit both countries. These
areas are: network design and modeling, mobility services on a large scale, and
optical networking. The workshop will bring together key researchers from the US
and Japan these three areas of computer networking. Japan brings unique research
strengths to each of the major areas and US research can be expected to benefit
from the exposure to the Japanese technology. Moreover, the areas under
discussion are expected to have significant long-term impact on US network
research infrastructures. To facilitate dissemination of workshop results the PI
will maintain a public website containing workshop presentations and reports.
