This project is for the development of a cooperative research and educational
program involving the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University and the SAFE Research Center
at Sugkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea. Both Centers have on-going activities
in the ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation of complex materials, such as
composites, which are inherently difficult materials to inspect with ultrasound
because of their complicated material behavior. It is planned to join these two
research programs together in a cooperative, international effort to develop
computer models of the ultrasonic inspection of complex materials.
