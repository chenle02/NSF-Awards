This research is to develop the theory and methodology of adaptive sampling
designs. The proposed approach involves a combination of theoretical development
to determine optimal adaptive designs and computer simulation to compare
practical adaptive designs with non adaptive ones. Taking advantage of the
conditional mean square error structure of the population, design-induced
unbiasedness is proposed to provide robustness against possible departures from
assumptions about populations. Simulated sampling of cluster point process
realizations is proposed to examine one important class of adaptive designs.
This research is in the subfield of experimental design, in the general area of
statistics. The goal is to utilize the information in an experiment more
efficiently by developing the theory of designing experiments so that
experimental units may be sampled from a population according to rules that may
depend sequentially on observations of previously selected units. Significant
progress in this direction has the long term potential for revolutionizing the
practice of scientific experimentation and providing for more efficient use of
our national research and development funds.
