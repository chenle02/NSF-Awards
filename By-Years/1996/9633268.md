9633268 Rubin Title: Recent ridge eruptive activity dating and investigations
(The "Rreadi" project). Unlike volcanic eruptions on land, there are no
observations of eruption on the ocean floor. Undersea eruptions are inaccessible
and usually can not be detected by on-land measurements, so it is not even known
when eruptions occur. There are no techniques available to determine the age of
these lavas, so we can not place samples from undersea eruptions in sequence.
The PI has developed a technique to determine the age of rocks based on the
amount of short-lived daughter products of the uranium and thorium decay series.
This technique has been successful for dating one young eruption on the East
Pacific Rise. This technique is only good for samples less than 3 years old, and
he wishes to extend this technique to decay series that will date samples up to
100 years.
