This research aims to further the understanding of, and to improve upon, the
existing methodology for some important problems of statistical estimation and
hypothesis testing. These problems encompass nonparametric estimation and
testing, regression analysis, and the analysis of survey and spatial data. The
main tools to be used fall under the category of data resampling. The chief
techniques involve asymptotic expansion, combinatoric analysis, probability
theory, and numerical computing. This research in the field of statistics
applies new mathematical and computational tools to expand existing theory. The
results should allow more efficient use of resources in the future planning of
and analysis of data from statistical experiments and sample surveys.
