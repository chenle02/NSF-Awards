A wide variety of problems in soft condensed matter physics require the
solution of a nonlinear diffusion equation on a sphere. Examples are the phase
separation of lipids in giant vesicles, the time evolution of liquid crystalline
order, and the distribution of defects that determine the shapes of vesicles.
The goal of this project is to develop a simple and effective scheme for the
numerical description of nonlinear diffusion on a sphere. The first specific
problem to be considered is the solution of the Cahn-Hilliard equation on the
unit sphere. The investigators solve the Cahn-Hilliard and related equations
numerically, using real space discretization. Numerical simulations are
sensitive to details of the underlying lattice. Because it is not possible to
construct a regular lattice on a sphere (if the number of points >20), they plan
to use a random lattice, obtained by placing points randomly on the surface of
the sphere. In devising a strategy towards this goal, three fascinating topics
emerge: Voronoi tessellation of the sphere to identity the nearest neighbors of
each lattice site; stable and efficient scheme to approximate differential
operators; and regularizing the grid.

This project provides a new algorithm to identify nearest neighbors among
random points on a sphere. This is useful for solving a wide variety of
problems, ranging from dominance regions of military bases around the world and
the locating of fuel depots to modeling the behavior of vesicles and related
biological objects. In addition, it gives insights into numerical stability
associated with the approximants of differential operators on random lattices,
and regularization strategies for improving random grids. It enables the
effective numerical solution of nonlinear diffusion equations on a sphere, and
thereby makes possible numerical descriptions of a wide variety of problems in
soft condensed matter physics. An important aspect of the project is to get
students and postdocs from underrepresented groups actively involved in this
exciting research.
