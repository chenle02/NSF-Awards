This research is devoted to problems in mathematical analysis arising from
questions in physics. There are six main areas: (1) The ultraviolet problem in
quantum electrodynamics, (2) analysis of the precise rate of approach to
equilibrium on models of Kac type for kinetic theory, (3) problems of interface
motion arising from phase separation problems in non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics, (4) sharp Lieb-Thirring inequalities, and (5) the search for patterns
in minimizers of simple energy functionals. Our proposed research into these
various problems in each case centers on a strategy in which geometric and
dynamical analysis of problems in the calculus of variations plays a key role.
We expect, as in our past research, that this strategy will lead us to discover
new results and methods in pure analysis, as well as to improve the
understanding of the physical phenomena in question.
