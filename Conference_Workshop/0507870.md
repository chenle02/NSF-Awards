This award furnishes travel support for U.S. participants in the Fourth
International Symposium "Quantum Theory and Symmetries" (QTS-4), held near
Varna, Bulgaria, August 15-21, 2005. The Symposium is a biannual meeting of
physicists, mathematicians, and engineers studying mathematical aspects of
symmetry relevant to physical applications. Topics of the meeting include Lie
groups and Lie algebras, superalgebras, and quantum groups. The Symposium will
include a workshop on "Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics," the sixth in
a series of international workshops on the topic.

The meeting provides an opportunity for interaction between leading experts and
junior researchers in important areas of mathematical physics. A special panel,
"Quantum Theory and Symmetry in the XXI Century," is designed specifically to
provide guidance to new researchers. The conference will provide a valuable
opportunity for postdocs and students to learn about open problems in these
areas and to establish international research collaborations. This award
allocates significant funding to support participation of U.S. students and
young researchers.

Symmetry is arguably the most important concept that guides science in its
exploration of nature. Symmetry ideas from mathematics provide structure in a
wide range of physical theories. The periodic table of the elements, atomic
spectral analysis, classifications of crystal structure, and models of
elementary particles are all based on symmetries. Engineering applications such
as tomography and signal processing, including wavelets, radar, and sonar, are
intimately related to harmonic analysis, the expansion and analysis of functions
on groups that reflect symmetry properties. This meeting will foster
international research collaboration in this interdisciplinary field.
