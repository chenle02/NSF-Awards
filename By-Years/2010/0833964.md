Visualizing Scientific Discovery Workshop Susan E. Cozzens, Georgia Institute of
Technology The development of visualization tools made possible by advances in
cyber-infrastructure offer intriguing possibilities for tracking the impact of
investments in science. These possibilities range from tracing the path from
basic research discoveries to patents and innovation, to the changing structure
of scientific disciplines, and from examining the importance of social networks
to the dispersion of scientific innovations to comparators of international
performance in science. The potential contribution to NSF programs is far-
reaching. Program officers could use information from such tools to examine
whether one particular type or level of investment has been better than another
for achieving a particular short-term outcome, use the information to
restructure or balance their funding portfolio, as well as to provide
information to outside queries about the value of particular investments. In
addition, NSF staff could use the tools to describe the impact of cross-cutting
initiatives, such as cyber-infrastructure and ITR. NSF staff might also be able
to expand by mapping the complex structures of multidisciplinary collaborations
and using the information to identify members of scientifically dispersed
communities as well as emerging leaders in science and innovation. However,
before such a vision is achieved, many questions remain about the robustness,
validity and usability of the visualization tools. The workshop is designed to
bring researchers from a broad range of disciplines to examine the open
questions.

Intellectual Merit. The workshop will explore the research frontier of an
exciting area of the social sciences, surveying the current state of the art and
identifying key issues for further development. Broader impacts. The workshop
will increase the usability of results from this research area. It involves a
postdoctoral scholar and doctoral student fully in the work, and thus
contributes to human resource development in the science of science policy.
