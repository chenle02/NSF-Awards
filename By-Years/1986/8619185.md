This experiment will measure the Newtonian gravitational constant, G, on scale
lengths of 100 m to 1500 m, to an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 or better. The
intent of the experiment is to search for possible scale length variations in G
that have been hypothesized in an effort to produce a unified field theory in
modern physics. If a scale length variation exists it will verify the existence
of a fifth force of nature (about which there has been much recent publicity)
and will have a significant effect on many branches of modern physics including
general relativity, unified field theory, astrophysics, and cosmology. The
proposed experiment consists of measuring the difference in gravity between the
top and bottom of the greenland continental ice sheet through a borehole at Dye
3 using a LaCoste &amp; Romberg borehole gravity meter. By measuring the
acceleration of gravity, the depth interval of the experiment, and the density
of the ice, G can be calculated. Others have found anomalous variations in
gravity with depth in mines that could be explained by allowing G to be greater
than the laboratory value by almost 1%. Uncertainty in the density of rock near
mines makes this result inconclusive, Because the density of ice is much better
known, the experiment proposed here will be much more accurate than any previous
geophysical measurement of G. This investigation is also being supported by: The
NSF Division of Physics, the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, Amoco Production
Co., and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
