9633811 Oblas Northeastern University is working with twenty school districts in
New England to change their curriculum and pedagogy to meet the NCTM Standards.
These school districts are joining with the New England Regional Center for the
Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP), the Center for Enhancement in Science and
Mathematics Education, the Center for Innovation in Urban Education and the
Mathematics Department at Northeastern University to implement the IMP
curriculum in their schools. Teachers of mathematics at the participating
schools receive intensive professional development workshops during the summer
