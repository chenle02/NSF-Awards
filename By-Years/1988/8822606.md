Flower development in the plant family Haemodoraceae and close relatives will
be studied using light and scanning electron microscopy by Dr. Michael Simpson
of San Diego State University. The purpose of the study is to clarify past
evolutionary relationships within this group. Specific objectives include: 1)
recognizing new descriptive characters; 2) assessing character homology
(similarity by common ancestry); 3) determining character ancestry; and 4)
testing hypotheses of evolutionary change. The project is innovative in
utilizing morphometrics, mathematical techniques for tracing changes in shape
and form. Morphometric data will be acquired using a computerized video image
analysis system that measures coordinate, length, and area parameters.
Developmental stages of ovules, seeds, and ovary will be traced by establishing
a relative time scale, calibrated by recording embryological stage, the relative
position of the bud in the inflorescence, or the length of major floral organs.
Statistical procedures, including bivariate plots and principle components
analysis, will be used to trace developmental changes. By comparing growth rates
of organs relative to known ancestor/descendent relationships, the possible
occurrence of heterochrony (change in rate or timing of development) in
structural evolution will be tested. Finally, an attempt will be made to assess
the possible adaptive significance of floral organs by correlating these
developmental parameters with biogeography, ecology, and pollination
mechanisms.//
