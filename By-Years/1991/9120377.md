This project will exploit recent theoretical findings by the coPI, Francos,
which lead to an improved estimation procedure for the spectral distribution
function of a 2-D homogeneous random field (which can also be referred to as a
problem in estimating a 2-D mixed spectrum). By imposing a total order on the
discrete (regular) random field and using a new 2-D Wold-like decomposition for
homogeneous random fields, the original random field can be decomposed into a
purely-deterministic component, modelled as a sum of 2-D harmonic components
with random amplitude and phase, a generalized evanescent component which is
characterized by its spectral distribution attributes, and a purely-
indeterministic component which is modelled by a 2-D AR process. The purpose of
the proposed research is to develop a combined detection/estimation procedure
for detecting the presence of the deterministic components - the purely-
deterministic and generalized evanescent components, and for estimating the
necessary parameters of the components which are deemed present in the original
decomposition.
