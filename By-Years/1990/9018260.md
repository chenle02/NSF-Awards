The objective is to understand in chemical-mechanical terms how ribosomes and
the macromolecules that interact with them form proteins. The primary objective
is to monitor and describe the extension of a nascent peptide as it is extended
by the stepwise addition of amino acids at the ribosomal peptidyl transferase
center. particular attention will be given to the question of whether the
nascent peptide is channeled from the peptidyl transferase to the exit domain
through a tunnel that transversed the large ribosomal subunit, and if so, to
determine how the nascent peptide is inserted into the tunnel. Secondary
objective are to determine when the mRNA moves through the ribosome during the
reaction step of peptide elongation and to further analyze how antibiotics such
as erythromycin and chloromphenical inhibit protein synthesis. The approach is
to covalently attack fluorophores at specific sites on the tRNA, mRNA ribosomal
proteins, and ribosomal RMA, then to use fluorescence techniques to monitor
changes in the position and conformation of the components that occur during the
specific reaction steps of protein synthesis. The results are anticipated to be
directly relevant to the in vitro synthesis of artificial enzymes by
biotechnological procedures and to the control of protein synthesis in certain
pathologies.
