This grant will enable several young researchers, women and minorities to
attend and participate in the Third Meeting of the Canadian Number Theory
Association to be held August, 1991 at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario.
The conference will focus on three areas of Number Theory: analytic number
theory; arithmetic algebraic geometry; and diophantine approximation. The
lectures will provide speakers with the opportunity to explain their recent
unpublished results, thus providing a forum for communicating and discussing new
discoveries.
