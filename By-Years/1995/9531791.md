Dr. Duane Bartak and other members of the Chemistry Department at the University
of Northern Iowa are being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry as a cooperative program with Dillard
University. For the period 1996-98, eight undergraduate students will spend ten
weeks each summer actively engaged in basic research projects drawn from the
traditional areas of chemistry and biochemistry. Faculty members from both
Dillard University and the University of Northern Iowa will participate at the
Iowa campus and direct research projects designed for undergraduates. Students
will be recruited from both the Louisiana and midwestern regions of the U. S.
The faculty and student community will have weekly seminars, field trips,
weekend social events, and a final symposium.
