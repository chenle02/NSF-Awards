The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
of women at all levels of faculty and academic leadership, particularly at the
senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional practices,
policies, climate, and culture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech proposes a
comprehensive program to promote and enhance the careers of women in science and
engineering. The project has four major program elements that address
institutional barriers that have constrained the advancement of women faculty
members in the sciences and engineering (S&amp;E) and target institutional
culture, practices, and leadership development needs specific to Virginia Tech.
Project Activities include retreats and workgroups for faculty and academic
leaders, qualitative assessment of the experience of women faculty in S&amp;E,
and review of policies and programs; half-time placements of faculty in
leadership roles, research grants, faculty development, a named lecture series,
and a flexible work/life fund; intensive work with search committees; programs
to prepare the future professoriate and expanded dissertation year/postdoctoral
fellowship program. Patricia Hyer, associate provost for academic affairs, will
coordinate this project; Nancy Love, associate professor of civil and
environmental engineering, and Karen Thole, associate professor of mechanical
engineering, will serve as co-PIs. The university will provide a full-time
project director and administrative assistant to this project, ensuring its
continuance beyond the period of the grant. &lt;br/&gt;New academic leadership,
restructured colleges, and commitment to an aggressive strategic plan currently
position Virginia Tech for a successful transformation. The Virginia Tech
ADVANCE initiative will focus on the colleges of engineering and science with
the goal of creating an environment that welcomes women and individuals of color
and nurtures their success as part of the colleges' own definition of
excellence. The proposed strategies draw from an extensive literature on gender
equity in science and engineering and organizational change, and experiences of
the five-year project will contribute to the understanding of change management
on behalf of women in higher education.&lt;br/&gt;
