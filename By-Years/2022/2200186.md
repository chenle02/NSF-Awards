Antibiotic resistance may soon make common antibiotics ineffective, and there is
a pressing need to find new-generation antimicrobial therapies. A novel approach
to test antimicrobial drugs is to measure the effect of the drug on the microbes
within living cells. Light reflected by small collections of living cells can
sense when the cells are infected with microbes because the infection changes
how the internal cellular machinery works. The use of natural intracellular
motions in cell clusters that act as “sentinels” is an unprecedented new
approach to detecting microbes. To further educational goals, the effect of
cellular motion on reflected light will be easily demonstrated to high-school
students using simple laser pointers and cell phone cameras.

To improve the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds, a new physics-based
optical screening technology will be developed to fill this need. Biodynamic
Doppler profiling (BDP) performs Doppler spectroscopy of intracellular motions
inside living tissue using low-coherence digital holography. It is a sensitive
probe of the subtle changes of cellular dynamics caused by drugs or infections
inside tissue. Biodynamic profiling has already been used to predict the
response of cancer patients to chemotherapy by applying cancer drugs on living
ex vivo biopsies. In this project the team will develop Doppler detection of
bacterial infection of living-tissue sentinels. The premise of living-tissue
sentinels is that the sentinel behavior is modified by early infection before
the bacteria can be characterized directly themselves. In the proposed research,
biodynamic profiling of microbial invasion will be extended along several lines
by: 1) enhancing the sensitivity of the sentinels to detect lower-level
bacterial infections; 2) assembling a library of sentinel response functions to
microbial infection; 3) performing quantitative assays of antibiotic resistance;
4) demonstrating the first detection of viral infections of tissue sentinels,
and 5) developing new deep-learning algorithms to classify pathogenicity and
predict therapeutic efficacy. The outreach objective is to enlist undergraduates
in the research experience, including under-represented groups in research, and
developing hands-on intracellular motility imaging experiments for grades 7-12.
