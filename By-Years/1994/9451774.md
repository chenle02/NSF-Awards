9451774 Brown Current learning theory indicates that effective student learning
in the physical sciences can be greatly enhanced through the creation of a
learning environment that enables students to focus on physical phenomena that
are directly linked to useful abstractions, to make predictions based on their
conceptual models which receive immediate interactive feedback, and to
collaborate with other students in making such predictions and discussing
unexpected results. The aim of the proposed project is to create such a learning
environment for physics laboratory instruction through the use of a number of
technological tools. Specifically, the project will combine image processing and
video capture technologies to create motion and optics lab experiments which
enable students to link visual and graphical representations of conceptual
models with real-world phenomena. Students will view and interact with live
video images which are processed in real time to enhance or measure important
features. Students will also overlay captured video images and clips with
student-drawn interpretations and predictions, image measurement tools, and
graphics generated by model simulations. This innovative project has numerous
benefits for students and the results will be widely disseminated to community
college and university physics and science instructors.
