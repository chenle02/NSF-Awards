A mass spectrometer is purchased for biochemical engineering research. The
proposed applications include measurement of influent and effluent gases and
dissolved volatile liquids for research on the biodegradation of toxic and
hazardous wastes, production of yoghurt from soy milk, modeling and analysis of
photosynthetic microbial growth, development of state estimation and data
analysis techniques, and butanol-acetone production from Jerusalem artichokes.
