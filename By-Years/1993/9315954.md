9315954 Ahrens The PIs will extend their measurements of shock wave pressure-
density measurements for molten silicates and magmas from the present range of
available data to the entire pressure and temperature range of the present and
primordial mantle. They will also conduct shock wave experiments in the same
regime on liquid, glass, and single crystals of MgSiO3, (Mg0.9Fe0.1)SiO3, and
CaMgSi2O6. These data can be used to calculate shock temperatures, and more
importantly, isentropic temperature changes in a convecting magma ocean or upon
ascent of magmas from depths in the Earth. They will systematically study the
equation of state of molten fayalite to 40 GPa in order to understand the
effects of Fe2+ on the equation of state of molten mantle silicates. In
addition, they will investigate a high pressure phase transition in serpentine
in order to further understanding of the effect of water on the high pressure
elasticity of mantle silicates. ****
