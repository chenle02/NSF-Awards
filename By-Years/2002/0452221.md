This project will create a database of over 12 categories of tort law reforms
enacted or revised in the 50 United States since the 1960s. Examples of tort law
reforms tracked in this project include damage award caps, contingent fee
limits, and heightened evidentiary standards for punitive damages. This database
will be made available to the public, enabling other researchers to perform
consistent, reliable research on the effect of the tort reforms on society.
Current research in the field relies largely on anecdotal evidence, ad-hoc data
sets, or inconsistent, and incomplete compilations of legal reforms. Research
based on the project database will help address some of the most important
issues in society today, such as medical malpractice, products liability and
other personal injury liability by measuring the impact of legal reforms on the
costs to society of insurance, injury, and injury prevention.
