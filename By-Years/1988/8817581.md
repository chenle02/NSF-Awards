A fluorescence microscope coupled to a photon counting spectrofluorometer will
be used to obtain fluorescence spectra, fluorescence-detected dichroism and
fluorescence polarization data on labeled tropomyosin, actin and troponin
incorporated into oriented muscle myofibrils and fibers. Prior work on fibers
has indicated that actin subunits slightly reorient when myosin heads bind to
ghost fibers not containing the regulatory proteins and when calcium binds to
the regulatory proteins on the thin filament in the absence of myosin. No
studies appear to have been reported of possible reorientation of actin subunits
associated with myosin head binding to actin containing the regulatory proteins.
This project will provide new information about subunit reorientation assoicated
with regulation in systems that are close to in vivo muscle and will help to
clarify the mechanism of the regulation of muscle contraction.***//
