AST-0807468&lt;br/&gt;Marchis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New observational data, which
rely greatly on very successful adaptive optics (AO) systems, have proven the
existence of satellites of asteroids. These discoveries provide powerful
constraints on theories of the origin of our solar system. This project will use
AO systems, which correct the blurring effect of atmospheric turbulence, on
several eight-to-ten-meter class telescopes to continue and extend the hunt for
asteroid satellites. The work will also characterize the orbits of both the
newly found and the already known binary systems, to infer the internal
structure of the asteroids and their formation mechanisms, such as capture,
fission, disruption, and mass shedding. This will constrain the condition and
the composition of the proto-planetary environment. This interdisciplinary study
links modern observational techniques and data processing to interior structure
studies, and will make complex orbital ephemeris calculations
possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptive optics is a recently developed field,
expected to make rapid progress through technologies such as laser guide star
systems, wavefront sensors, and deformable mirrors. This project provides a
valuable opportunity for undergraduate students to become involved with AO. The
team expects to continue past successful outreach efforts, which have made
available striking AO images and animations for both education and public
interest.
