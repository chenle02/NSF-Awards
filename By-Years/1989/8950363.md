This project will implement an interactive computer graphics laboratory. The
educational functions in the laboratory will introduce the learning
efficiencies, disciplinary insights, and data manipulations available through
interactive computer graphics techniques for molecular geometry, geographic
data, and applied mathematics in the physical sciencs. This Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill to acquire computer equipment that will be used to enhance
undergraduate laboratory instruction.
