Based on the success of the existing Travel Support for the MATH in MOSCOW
Program, the American Mathematical Society will continue the program. The funds
will be used over three years to support mathematically talented U.S.
undergraduates for a semester of study at the MATH in MOSCOW program of the
Independent University of Moscow. Funds in the amount of $50,000 per year will
be used to underwrite a substantial part of the typical cost for a semester of
study in the program for ten undergraduate students per (academic) year.
