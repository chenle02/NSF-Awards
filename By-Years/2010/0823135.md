ABSTRACT 0823135 (Atekwana)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This
workshop is a multidisciplinary gathering of scientists from fields as disparate
as engineering, biology, geophysics, sedimentology, geochemistry, and polar
programs to discuss and get exposure to a new and potentially transformative
field in the geosciences: Biogeophysics. Biogeophysics is the science of using
non-invasive, geophysical, remote sensing techniques to determine and monitor
the activity of microorganisms and their byproducts in the subsurface/deep
biosphere. Sessions will focus on cutting edge topics such as the impact of
microbes and biofilms on sediment physical properties and techniques to identify
and measure changes. It will also explore other new and/or novel applications of
the methods and generate discussions about other possible technological
innovations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Impacts of this work include
the interaction of a multidisciplinary group of scientists from disciplines that
span the gamut from engineering to biology to geophysics to sedimentology. It
also has a strong emphasis on the training of early career faculty and students
in this new area of geoscience. The work supports in institution in an EPSCoR
state (Oklahoma) and will help to cement the leadership of the PI, who is from a
gender and racial group that is under-represented in the science, in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;
