The project's objectives are: 1) development of "SignStream," a database tool
for analysis of linguistic data captured on video; 2) use of SignStream for
creation of a large database of utterances from American Sign Language,
consisting of raw video and fine-grained linguistic transcription; 3)
development of an interactive format for linking electronic documents to
SignStream databases (allowing direct access from texts to video, encoded data,
and SignStream tools). SignStream provides a single computing environment for
manipulating video and transcribing utterances by entering linguistic
information in multiple fields and linking this to specific video frame
sequences, resulting in a fine-grained, multi-level, temporally calibrated
transcription. Information from the various fields is aligned visually on screen
to reflect temporal relations. The goal is to make SignStream and the databases
and interactive document tools developed accessible to the general research
community. There is a pressing need for such tools, for linguistic research on
signed languages (which has to date been hampered by the inaccessibility of data
for inspection, and the lack of tools for scientific analysis thereof) as well
as for related disciplines relying on analysis of video data.
