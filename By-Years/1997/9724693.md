A conference will be held on the subject of quantum chromodynamics in nuclear
physics, part of the Gordon Research Conference series. The outcome of this
meeting will be the dissemination of the latest experimental results and
theoretical thinking on this subject, which is among the most important in the
field of nuclear physics. The NSF funds will support young faculty, postdocs,
and graduate students working in this high priority field, as established by the
joint NSF/DOE Nuclear Science Advisory Committee in its 1996 Long Range Plan.
Education of students and postdocs is an important component of this award.
