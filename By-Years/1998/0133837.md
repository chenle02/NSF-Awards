Abstract &lt;br/&gt;CTS-0133837&lt;br/&gt;K. Mahesh, University of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to perform large eddy
simulation (LES) of turbulent jets in cross-flow using unstructured grids. The
problem is chosen because its applicability to a number of important technical
problems such as fuel injectors, V/STOL aircraft, film cooling of turbine blades
and etc. Furthermore such a flow cannot be correctly predicted by the current
computational scheme of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS).
Unstructured grids are chosen to allow mesh points to be localized near the jet
boundary and near the wall. The method of computation will be based on a kinetic
energy conserving scheme, which was developed by the PI. The results will be
compared to existing experimental data. The LES scheme, once fully developed,
will be applied to a range of other flows. The education plan involves
development of new graduate courses, incorporate research component into both
graduate and undergraduate courses, and including undergraduate students in
research projects.&lt;br/&gt;
