This CAREER award funds a research and education program in dynamical
paleoclimatology - the study of paleoclimatic observations within the context of
modern physical climatology. The basic idea supporting the research is that the
systematic assimilation of paleo-proxy observations into a model's system
permits concise testing of competing hypotheses regarding the root causes of
paleoclimate variations. The strategy also provides unique opportunities to
investigate the fundamental biogeophysical controls on climate proxy formation
and improve the precision and accuracy of proxy-based reconstructions of
climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the research include: 1)
Development of new proxy rainfall data from replicated, high-resolution stable
isotope measurements made on tropical trees in northwest coastal Peru to improve
the precision and accuracy of tropical climate field reconstructions by
alleviating spatial and temporal gaps in coverage in the terrestrial tropics; 2)
Interpretation of new paleoclimate data using a process (i.e., forward) model of
stable isotopic composition of wood. It is proposed that the inter-comparison of
forward and inverse (i.e., statistical) models will improve the quality of
climate reconstructions; 3) Paleoclimatic model-data syntheses using multi-proxy
data networks and simple models of large-scale climate dynamics; 4) Development,
implementation, and assessment of a graduate-level survey course in
paleoclimatological techniques; and 5) Development, implementation, and
assessment of an introductory course in weather and climate, that is sensitive
to the worldview of the Tohono O'odham Nation. This specific class will be
taught at the Tohono O'odham Community College (TOCC) and will help enhance the
science curriculum at TOCC, create a mentored pathway for O'odham students to
pursue four-year degrees and research opportunities at the University of Arizona
(and beyond), and help enhance diversity in the field of paleoclimate research
and education.
