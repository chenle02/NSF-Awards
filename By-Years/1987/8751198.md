This project will support the dissemination of a model for state and regional
computer-based communications networks for science educators. The source of the
prototype and research base for these networks is CISCO-Net, the successful
information system which has been implemented statewide in New Mexico. In order
to facilitate the establishment of these information systems, the University of
New Mexico project team will develop and make available a support package for
interested system sponsors. This assistance will include: (a) on-site
preliminary consulting and planning services; (b) the required networking
software; (c) a listing of the required networking hardware and its
installation; (d) training for the host site support staff; (e) a complete
training package which the implementing site can use to prepare potential users
of the information system; (f) a plan for evaluation and continued updating of
the system.
