This proposal is concerned with the development of a computer system for
tutoring college-level biology. While tutoring systems have been built for
biology before, new capabilities: flexible instruction, model simulation, and
visualization, are proposed. Flexible instruction will permit dynamic generation
of instructional material that is appropriate for each teaching situation.
Simulations of models of biological systems will explain and predict such
systems' behavior. Visualization will dynamically illustrate these systems.
Synergistically combining these capabilities, this tutoring system will allow
students to ask questions, request clarification or elaboration, and
inquisitively experiment.
