The objectives of this research are: 1. to relate the level of soil
contamination to the change in frequency dependent electrical properties of the
soil; 2. to establish the viability of using a cone penetrometer to measure
these electrical properties; 3. to develop a model for the electrical properties
of soil; 4. to evaluate the applicability of the electronic circuit simulator
SPICE to describe the flow of electric current through soil. The research will
include numerical simulation of electric current flow through soil and
experimental evaluation of the theoretical analysis.
