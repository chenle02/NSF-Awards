This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
examine the biochemical and metabolic characteristics of a novel Centrifugal
Bioreactor (CBR) used to culture suspension mammalian cells. The CBR achieves
suspension of animal cells at densities greater than 10 8 cells/mL in a
fluidized bed where nutrient liquid flow forces counteract centrifugal forces.
The phase I overall goal is to provide a solid scientific understanding of the
CBR culture process. The specific technical objectives include measuring the
growth rate of a representative cell line in the CBR , establishing steady-state
operation of the CBR in terms of nutrient consumption and metabolite production
by the cells and manipulating the steady state by changing the dissolved oxygen
concentration at the CBR inlet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application
of this project will be in the area of animal cell culture bioreactors. The
principal impact of the proposed technology will be to reduce the scale and
capital costs of commercial animal cell culture equipment and to potentially
improve the quality and consistency of secreted protein
product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
