Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project makes a major device, the Stony
Brook Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator, accessible to students and educators
through both on-site and remote access and allows its use for a wide variety of
applications ranging from anthropology (using 14C dating techniques) through
nuclear physics. Using video-conference-based tools, students have the
opportunity to study nuclear collisions by taking virtual control of a
functioning nuclear accelerator and its associated detectors. Among other
experiments, students are able to conduct neutron threshold studies, observe
resonance states in (p,n) reactions, study heavy-ion reactions, and perform
discrete gamma ray experiments. Because the device is also able to make
accelerator mass spectrometry measurements, the long-range facility plan is to
perform 14C dating to determine the age of biological materials (currently
available), detect 26Al (possibly associated with Alzheimer's disease), and
measure 41Ca from bones, 36Cl from ice cores, ground water, and glacially-
cleaved mountain tops, and 129I from fossil fuel reserves. While the primary
focus of the current project is undergraduate education, the accelerator is also
available to the pre-college and graduate communities.
