Consistent with the mission of the JVNCnet which is to support the Academic and
Research networking communities in the Northeast and to facilitate the provision
of networking services to these institutions, Princeton is requesting partial
support for the addition of 21 predominantly undergraduate institutions to the
NSFNET family of networks through the JVNCnet midlevel network. These
institutions have separatetly included information regarding their facility and
their need to be a member of the NSFNET. The list of schools includes: Bryant
College, Connecticut College, University of Bridgeport, Drew University, William
Paterson College, College of Saint Elizabeth, Glassboro State College, Hahnemann
College, Georgian Court, Thomas Edison, Seton Hall, Rhode Island College,
Connecticut State University, St. Peters/Felcian College, Stockton State,
Monmouth College, Farleigh Dickinson University, Rider College, Ramapo College,
Adelphi College and Hofstra University. JVNCnet, now part of Princeton
University, will act as a regional or mid-level agent to identify the networking
needs and assist the academic institutions in the Northeastern United States to
meet those needs by providing connectivity, education and training. In addition,
the JVNCnet is working towards achieving financial self-sufficiency by
increasing its membership.***
