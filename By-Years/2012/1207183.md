This project aims to study problems involving surfaces and three-manifolds,
primarily from the perspective of group theory and geometry, but also drawing on
ideas and techniques from complex analysis and dynamics. This includes (1) an
ongoing project with R.P. Kent on convex cocompactness in the mapping class
group, various parts of which are also joint work with M. Bestvina, J. Brock, K.
Bromberg, and S. Dowdall; (2) ongoing work with D. Margalit on dynamics of
pseduo-Anosov homeomorphisms and their relation to three-manifolds, parts of
which are also joint work with B. Farb; (3) various projects on length functions
and geometric structures on surfaces which involves work with M. Duchin and K.
Rafi, as well as work done by the PI's graduate students, A. Bankovic, S.-W. Fu,
R. Maungchang, and C. Uyanik.

Surfaces - two-dimensional spaces like the surface of a ball or a doughnut -
have been studied for hundreds of years, and are fundamental and beautiful
objects in mathematics. The study of surfaces is intrinsically interesting, but
is also responsible for the creation of entire fields of mathematics, shaping
the way people solve problems. Three-dimensional topology - the study of three-
dimensional spaces like our physical universe - has been profoundly impacted by
developments in the study of surfaces. This may not seem surprising since a
surface is a two-dimensional space, and one might expect a three-dimensional
space to enjoy some of the same properties. While it is true that direct
analogies in the situations have produced some interesting results, it is the
use of surfaces as building blocks for understanding three-manifolds (the three-
dimensional spaces) which has most significantly shaped the field. One important
aspect of this project is the strategy of "reversing the flow of information" by
(1) applying new technology developed to study three-manifolds into the theory
of surfaces, rather than vice-versa, and (2) exploring the subtle effects the
geometry of three-manifolds imposes on the geometry of the surfaces used to
construct them.
