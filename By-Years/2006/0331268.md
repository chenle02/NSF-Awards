Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years
due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and
scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and
due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities
for performing exciting research in this area. This symposium on solid state
chemistry is entitled The Chemistry of Intermetallics and Zintl Phases. The goal
of this ACS meeting is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange
across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in advancing solid-state
chemistry areas related to the synthesis, characterization and applications of
intermetallic and Zintl phases. The NSF funds will be used to defray the
expenses of students, post-docs, and junior faculty attending the
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The Solid State Chemistry community
continues to have a direct impact on technological advances of high significance
to society by training students to design, synthesize, characterize, and
fabricate intermetallic and Zintl compounds as device materials relevant to
advancing thermoelectric, magnetic, and electronic technologies.&lt;br/&gt;***
