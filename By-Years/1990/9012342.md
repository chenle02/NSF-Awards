The initiative to map and sequence the human genome is entering a critical
period. For the next five years, the organizational structures for accomplishing
its goal of obtaining the complete sequence by the year 2005. The choices made
in the early 1990's will define the basic outline of the technological system
for mapping and sequencing the human genome. This period is thus a strategic
research opportunity of exceptional importance for understanding the evolution
of the genome project, with a more general significance for sociology and
history of science and technology. Dr. Hilgartner is undertaking a study of how
the agenda for research, for organizational design, and for policy of the
genomics community takes shape during this critical period. The system/network
approach to technology, and the concept of agenda-setting, provide a theoretical
framework. The research will use a prospective, longitudinal study of a cohort
of key informants from the community, in-depth interviewing, and participant
observation in carefully selected laboratories.
