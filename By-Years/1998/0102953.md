Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Carbons with sp2 and sp3 bonding
exhibit entirely different envelope of properties. Here, we propose to fabricate
and test (for mechanical properties) carbon nanocomposites by combining the two
bonding. Recent advances in chemical vapor deposition of nanotubes and
nanocrystalline diamond present a possible synergistic approach to synthesizing
dense nanocomposite material with aligned and uniformly spaced nanotubes. CVD
will be used to synthesize nanotubes oriented vertically to patterned substrates
and by controlling the chemistry of plasma nanocrystalline diamond will be
deposited on these. In addition, modeling of carbon nanotube-diamond hybrid
microstructures will be done to understand mechanical properties and interfacial
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
