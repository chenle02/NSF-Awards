This work will carry out theoretical studies of electron collisions with
molecular ions. A variational method based on the complex Kohn formalism will be
developed for scattering off poly-atomic molecular ions, generalizing from
successful work done for neutral molecules. It will provide accurate cross
sections calculations for processes which occur in low temperature plasmas.
