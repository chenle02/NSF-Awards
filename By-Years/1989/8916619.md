Among basic events of intracellular motility in eukaryotic cells are directed
movements of nuclei and organelles occurring in association with microtubules or
microfilaments. While unidirectional movements on microfilaments is mediated by
the ATPase myosin, bidirectional movements on microtubules are mediated by two
different motors. The protein kinesin may function as an anterograde organelle
translocator, while a protein similar to ciliary dynein may function as a
retrograde translocator. It is proposed to investigate the mechanism by which
the pronuclei of marine eggs move along microtubules. These eggs are readily
available, can be easily fertilized to initiate division, and are well suited
for studies of retrograde motility. The female pronucleus moves exclusively in a
retreograde direction along the microtubules assembled by the sperm aster, while
other organelles move predominantly, but not exclusively, in this direction. An
in vitro translocation system will be constructed to observe movements of
pronuclei. The retrograde translocator responsible for these movements will be
localized and characterized, and other cytoplasmic factors necessary for
retrograde movements will be identified. Finally, the regulation of motility and
changes that occur before and after fertilization will be investigated. The
results of these studies will increase our understanding of the mechanisms by
which cellular organelles move, and, in particular, will characterize the the
movement of the pronuclei of fertilized eggs.
