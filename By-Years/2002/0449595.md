Karl Sohlberg of Drexel University is supported by a CAREER award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within the Division of Chemistry
for research involving the development of theoretical methods for modeling
stimulus-responsive interlocked macro-molecular complexes. These studies are
providing new insights into molecular recognition, self-assembly and multi-
stability of these complexex. The work is having a broader impact in the
development of functional macromolecular complexes, i.e. nanomachines, and will
help in the development of practical and robust design principles for future
nano-devices. The work is being carried out in conjunction with an outreach
program in the Philadelphia high schools which have a significant population of
students who are members of under-represented groups in science.
