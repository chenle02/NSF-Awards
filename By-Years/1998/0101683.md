This project is building on prior efforts of the American Mathematical
Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC) in the area of teacher preparation
to:&lt;br/&gt; (a) elevate awareness among two-year college mathematics faculty
of the role two-year colleges play in teacher preparation;&lt;br/&gt; (b)
identify and promote model programs that use appropriate technology as a
foundation piece of the teacher preparation coursework in the first two years of
college;&lt;br/&gt; (c) broaden the information base by collecting data on the
nature of mathematics coursework and the appropriate use of technology at two-
year colleges for preservice teacher;&lt;br/&gt; (d) strengthen collaborative
bonds between two- and four-year colleges and feature successful
collaborations;&lt;br/&gt; (e) equip two-year college mathematics faculty to
strengthen teacher preparation initiatives at their colleges; and &lt;br/&gt;
(f) disseminate information about effective two-year college strategies in the
areas of early field experiences for preservice teachers, the appropriate use of
technology, mathematics content for preservice teachers, and recruitment of
prospective teachers, particularly minorities and underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the three-year program is holding
four regional conferences that highlight the role of two-year colleges in
teacher preparation. These conferences where best practices are being
disseminated are being attended by teams who prepare action plans for improving
preservice education at their own institutions. Two intensive summer institutes
are being offered to address issues of content, technology, and pedagogy for
prospective teachers. Capstones for the project are the creation of Traveling
Workshops in Teacher Preparation and an extensive website of resource
materials.&lt;br/&gt;
