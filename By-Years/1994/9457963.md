9457963 Singh The Principal Investigator plan to develop the area of sub-
nanosecond laser ablation related to deposition of diamond-like- carbon thin
films. The high power densities and the unique nature of laser-solid-plasma
interactions is expected to give rise to smooth diamond-like-carbon films which
possess increased diamond- like character and improved adhesion with the
substrate. Detailed simulation of the laser-target interactions, insitu analysis
of the laser generated plume and property-structure correlationships experiments
will be carried out as a part of this investigation. My teaching plan is to
develop multi=media instructional materials for a proposed materials synthesis
and processing course. %%% The Principal Investigator plan to develop the area
