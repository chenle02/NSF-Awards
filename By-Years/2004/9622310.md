Abstract Ralston/Eskin 9622310 In this proposal we present several inverse
coefficient problems which we plan to attack using the methods introduced in our
paper (Commun. Math. Phys.173 (1995)). In most cases we wish to recover the
unknown coefficients from scattering data (or equivalently the Dirichlet to
Neumann map) at a fixed energy. The coefficients are usually assumed to approach
limiting values exponentially, but are not necessarily constant outside compact
sets. The equations we plan to study are the Schroedinger equation with an
external gauge potential, the Laplace-Beltrami equation for a metric which tends
exponentially to the Euclidean metric, Maxwell's equations, and the Schroedinger
equation with magnetic and electric potentials in two space dimensions. Inverse
scattering problems arise when one wishes to recover physical properties of an
object from data obtained by remote observations. Interpreted broadly these
problems include methods of nondestructive testing and medical imaging. The
problems we propose to study include recovering the electrical properties of a
medium from signals sent through it, and the reconstruction of the forces acting
on a quantum particle from the observation of the deflection of its
trajectories.
