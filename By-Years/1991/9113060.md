The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity aims to focus macroeconomic research
on problems confronting the U.S. economy. The Panel strives to fulfill this
purpose by generating, discussing, and publishing high quality, relevant and
timely research of macroeconomic significance. Its first commitment is to
produce quality research, and the Panel's method of operation is designed with
that goal foremost in mind. Its published research undergoes a much more
intensive process of review, criticism, discussion and editing than conventional
journals can provide. In this process and in the section of topics and authors,
the directors of the Panel are aided by the Panel Advisers, a group of experts
spanning a broad range of philosophical views and methodological preferences.
The Panel does not pursue highly abstract and purely theoretical modeling of
economic relationships which cannot be treated against data and actual
experience. But subject to that constraint, its notion of relevance is broad. It
includes research to explore fundamental characteristics of the economy and how
it responds to policy, as well as more applied research aimed at clarifying and
quantifying economic relationships. It is concerned with issues affecting
economic performance broadly, including areas such as long-run growth, global
interdependence, and energy policy, as well as the range of issues associated
with business cycles and economic stabilization.
