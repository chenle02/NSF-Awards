This award funds graduate student participation in the Urbino Summer School in
Paleoclimatology (USSP). Held at the University of Urbino, in Italy, the USSP
leverages the expertise of top quality faculty from Europe (~2/3) and the US
(~1/3) to provide a three-week intensive, immersive learning experience in
paleoclimate research topic and methods for both European and American students.
These students present their own research and participate in lecture- and lab-
style classes while broadening their research networks in an international
setting. Faculty and students interact closely during the program in both formal
and informal venues. Each session of the USSP brings in a new group of students
and provides fresh opportunities for international collaboration. The experience
of previous students suggests that participation in the USSP lays a foundation
for international collaboration, both with their peers and with more senior
(i.e., faculty) researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding provides scholarships
for ten US students to participate in the USSP each summer. Scholarships will be
awarded on a competitive basis.
