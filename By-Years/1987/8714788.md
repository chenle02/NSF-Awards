They propose to study several important questions about phonons in amorphous and
crystalline solids, mainly through thermal conductivity measurements. One of
these questions is that of the heat flow in amorphous solids in the temperature
range 10 - 300 K, with the goal of understanding the transition of the phonon
picture to that of a random walk of the elastic energy. They will also continue
their work on disordered crystals displaying glass-like thermal properties, in
order to test several models that have been advanced as explanations. They will
use these models in an attempt at identifying other disordered crystals
displaying glass-like properties. Their ultimate goal is to apply their
knowledge to amorphous solids, and to understand their excitations. They will
also propose an investigation of phonon scattering at crystal surfaces, in order
to understand and identify important scattering mechanisms. Here, their goal is
to use phonons as sensitive low energy probes for surfaces.
