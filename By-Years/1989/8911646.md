Ethics and Values Studies supports research and educational projects on ethical
and value aspects of the interaction between science, technology and society.
Projects examine the social values and mutual obligations and responsibilities
that arise in these interactions. This project will produce a handbook and
supplementary materials that will provide social science faculty and students
with the practical knowledge required to plan the ethical aspects of social and
behavioral research, and to obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.
These materials will bridge the gap between what is required by federal
regulations of human research and what methods texts cover. In particular, the
results will provide education and training that new researchers and new IRB
members need in order to be effective and meet ethical requirements. The project
involves review and revision of a currently drafted handbook. A needs assessment
and indepth evaluation by IRB members, social science faculty and their students
will ensure that the final product is acceptable and useful to all three
constituencies. The project will obtain expert and peer review before the
materials are published. This study comes from a very well-qualified researcher
who plans to use appropriate undergraduate research assistance. The review and
dissemination plans are appropriate; institutional support is very good. The
project has important implications for the assurance of quality social science
research that meets ethical requirements; also, it provides assistance in future
curriculum development. Support is recommended.
