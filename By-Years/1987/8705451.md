This equipment grant is for a laser holography system. It will be used to
study: (1) ice layer buildup beneath small freezing droplets which impact on
solid surfaces, (2) coal particle restructuring during the volatilization
process, (3) droplet movement and deformation in an acoustic levitation and
positioning system, (4) natural convection heat transfer processes around
cylinders and rod bundles, and (5) separated flows for cylinders in crossflows.
