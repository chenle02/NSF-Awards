It is proposed a gas aggregation method for synthesis of useful amounts of size-
selected nanoscale clusters and to explore the assembly of such clusters into
potentially novel materials. One goal of the proposed research is to develop the
aerosol source capable of producing kilograms per hour of the nanoscale metal
and metal oxide clusters and to demonstrate practical methods for recovery and
accumulation of these particles. A second goal is to develop atomic force
microscopy methods to measure the forces exerted by nanoscale clusters on each
other and between these particles and solid substrates. Molecular dynamics
simulations will also be performed to interpret the experimental results that
will be obtained. The proposed approach may lead to new products and processes
for advanced materials.
