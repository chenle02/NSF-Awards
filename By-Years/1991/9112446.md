The Department of Electrical Engineering at Southern Methodist University will
purchase DC/low frequency device characterization equipment which will be
dedicated to support research in engineering. The equipment will be used to
support several research programs including: 1) Neural Electronics; 2)
Applications of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy; 3) High Tc Superconductors; 4)
Low Frequency Noise in HgCdTe Infrared Detectors; 5) Gallium Arsenide Devices;
and 6) An Experimental Study of the Effects of Surface Texture on Ultra-Thin Gas
Bearings.
