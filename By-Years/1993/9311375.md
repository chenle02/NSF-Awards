This research grant will support the development of a biodegradable polymeric
matrix that would support the growth of osteoblasts and osteoblast precursors.
The intent is to have simultaneous polymer degradation and cell growth and
maturation leading to the generation of bone-like tissues. The objectives are 1)
to design and develop degradable three-dimensional matrices of polymers and
polymer/ceramic materials and to fully characterize these novel matrices; 2) to
seed osteoblast cells onto the newly created three-dimensional biodegradable
polymer matrices and study osteoblast adherence and growth in vitro; and 3) to
study osteoblast-polymer matrices in an in vivo environment characterizing their
ability to be osteoinductive or osteoconductive. This research is important
since it could lead to the development of new materials for use in non-unions of
bones, surgical arthrodeses, cranio-facial defect procedures, and coating for
orthopedic implants.
