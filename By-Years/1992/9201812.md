This project is concerned with questions of safety and reliability for
controlled structures. The technical issues to be addressed in this research
include: (1) quantitative evaluation of enhanced reliability against collapse
under earthquake or wind loads of extreme as well as moderate intensity levels,
(2) strategies for improving reliability of control system, i.e., electronic and
mechanical components and computer software, and (3) cost-benefit trade off
evaluation. Both passive and active systems, as well as combinations (hybrid) of
both systems will be examined. Probability-based methods will be used in order
to include the effects of uncertainties. The potential application of the
concepts and methods in building structures, bridges, and electronic power
transmission devices will be explored.
