A critical problem for the study of the biosphere in deep marine sediments is
the pervasively low level of microbial metabolic activity that renders
conventional techniques relatively ineffective for detecting microbes. Based on
the recognition that H2 is a ubiquitous intermediate product of anaerobic
microbial processes, this research program will develop a new
hydrogenase(H2ase)-based technique to measure the activity of this enzyme in
marine sediments and will calibrate the technique for application to measuring
microbial metabolic rates in anoxic sediments like those often encountered
during deep ocean drilling. If successful, the methods devised by the
researchers will find immediate and wide-ranging application in IODP studies of
the deep biosphere and in studies of conventional cores from anoxic marine
sediments. The goals of the program directly address the biosphere component of
the IODP long-range science plan. The research also has the potential for
expanding understanding of the minimum energy required to sustain life and the
environmental limits of life in the deep biosphere. The program supports
education and human resource development through training of a postdoctoral
researcher and involvement of undergraduate research fellows.
