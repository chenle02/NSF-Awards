This award will support Professor Lee Flippin of the San Francisco State
University in collaborative research with Professor Franco Macchia of the
University of Pisa, Italy. Stereochemical control over carbon-carbon bond
forming processes remains one of the outstanding challenges in modern synthetic
organic chemistry. The addition reactions of oxiranes are especially promising
candidates for the development of new methods for carbon framework construction
because they offer the potential of establishing multiple chiral centers per
single skeletal elaboration step. The researchers intend to pursue three main
objectives: 1) to develop novel methods for the electrophile-promoted addition
of carbon-nucleophiles to oxiranes; 2) to define the scope and potential
synthetic utility of these methods; and 3) to develop a concise synthetic
approach that should be useful in the total synthesis of selected
cyclodepsipeptide antibiotics. The proposed work is mutually beneficial with the
Italian side contributing a more mechanistic viewpoint while the U.S. side
provides the synthetic approach. Recent work by the collaborators has provided
some very encouraging results. Application to a medically useful class of
compounds is one of the potential benefits from the project.
