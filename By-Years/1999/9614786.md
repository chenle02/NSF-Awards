9614786 Yao This project is composed of a 1,500 square foot permanent, and
traveling exhibit, and a schools program focused on problem- solving, targeted
primarily for children in grades 5-8. The exhibit includes a variety of
classroom-tested puzzles, interactive computer programs, and hands-on challenge
problems. These will enable participants to try and utilize different problem-
solving strategies, and gain experience in spatial relationships, communicating
mathematically, and reasoning inductively and deductively. Materials produced
include: Solve It! Trunks, a problem-solving program that teachers can use as a
single unit or integrate throughout the year; a publication which will enable
others to reproduce the exhibits; and a Guide with suggestions about how to use
the Problem-Solving Program. Other activities include Student and Family
Problem-Solving Programs, and puzzle- based workshops.
