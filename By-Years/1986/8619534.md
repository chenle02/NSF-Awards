This field-based research project will collect information on the variety of
ways in which software design decisions are associated with values of
consequence to designers, the design organization, the user organization,
employees and the public. It will document the extent to which designers
themselves give explicit consideration to values trade- offs in making design
decisions. The goal is to enhance understanding of the influences on and of
software design, and to create a set of descriptive cases, with analyses, that
educators can use to help designers become more aware of the value-related
dimensions of their work. As designers and users attend to the value
implications of their decisions, the positive effects of new technologies can be
enhanced. This project will make a unique contribution to professional and
public understanding of values issues and trade-offs associated with computer
software design. The investigative team and consultants are very well qualified
to undertake the research and develop the case studies. The team has very good
institutional support and access to the organizations in which the field studies
will be done. The research design is very appropriate for this exploratory
phase; costs are very reasonable; and results are likely to be widely
distributed and useful. Total support in the amount of $75,000 is recommended,
with $36,363 to be awarded now and $38,637 in the next fiscal year.
