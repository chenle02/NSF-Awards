The PI's objective in this project is providing detailed spectral signatures of
coronal loops from model calculations which consistently account for dynamics
and energetics from the corona through the chromosphere. He will simulate a
variety of loop lengths and heating mechanisms, and will examine thermal
stability. The PI will also perform model calculations of coronal loops
extending into the chromosphere using self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic
calculations to provide definitive spectral signatures of these loops. He will
use the ALTAIR, a highly sophisticated computational tool that integrates
hydrodynamics and frequency dependent radiative transfer code and increases the
speed in solving generalized non-LTE problems.***
