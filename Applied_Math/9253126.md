The principal investigator will investigate the propagation of singularities
for semilinear strictly hyperbolic systems with piecewise smooth initial data.
This has applications in computatonal aerodynamics. Computational fluid dynamics
can give very detailed information about complex physical phenomena. The rate of
convergence of numerical schemes is useful in determining how accurate the
information is.
