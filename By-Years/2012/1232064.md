Summary: The objective of this research is to demonstrate a new flexible form of
silicon photonics integrated on plastic substrates, using a bond-and-transfer
method. The new silicon-on-plastic photonics combines the high performance of
silicon devices and the flexibility of plastic materials. The thin film format
and its mechanical compliance will enable this unconventional form of photonic
devices to be mechanically tunable and to be applied as optomechanical sensors.
Furthermore, the plastic substrate provides a versatile platform for
heterogeneous integration of passive silicon devices with active, non-silicon
devices &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Despite extensive research in flexible
electronics, flexible form of integrated photonics has not been widely explored.
The proposed research will demonstrate highly integrated silicon photonic
devices on plastic substrates with unprecedented flexibility, tunability and
compatibility. Integration of flexible photonics with microelectronics will
yield a multifunctional optoelectronic system in a soft format, leading to
transformative advances in areas ranging from optical communication to
fundamental metrology and mechanical measurement.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
project will impact industry and the scientific community by providing a new
class of optical sensors that is flexible and conformal. The education and
outreach activities will encourage high-schools students to pursue a career in
science and engineering and recruit minority students to participate in
research. In collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota, a series of
experimental demonstrations of optical science (named ?The Light Fantastic?)
will be presented during the Nanodays events to foster public awareness,
engagement and understanding of nanoscale science, engineering and technology.
