Study, the investigators will study the seasonal and spatial distribution of
dissolved organic matter in the water column of the Ross Sea and the Antarctic
Polar Frontal zone. By measuring both the concentration and the rates of
production and consumption of dissolved organic matter, the investigators hope
to assess the quantitative importance of this pool of organic matter in the
overall carbon cycle in the austral circumpolar seas.
