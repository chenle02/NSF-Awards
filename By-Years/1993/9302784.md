The tribological behavior of multi-component polymeric composites will be
studied, with emphasis on developing optimal materials combinations for
tribological performance. Particular emphasis will be placed on the possibility
of developing beneficial tribological films from decomposing fillers and solid
lubricants added to polymeric materials for use under sliding conditions. The
study will include synthesis of materials with fillers selected on basis of
bonding strength, electronegativity, and heat of formation; with PTFE lubricant
additions; and with carbon fiber reinforcements. The nature of the transfer film
and its rate of formation will be investigated and correlated with the
tribological events during sliding and with tribological properties such as
friction and wear.
