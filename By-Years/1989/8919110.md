This award will provide support to a group from the Pennsylvania State
University to continue research in high energy physics. In experiment E760 at
Fermilab, they will measure the properties of charmonium or charmed quark-
charmed antiquark states. In experiment E706 at the Fermilab Tevatron, they will
measure the production of direct photon emitted in high energy hadron-hadron
collisions, thought to be due to quark-gluon or quark-antiquark interactions.
These investigations are very important for shaping the theory of strong
interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics). An experiment at DESY (Hamburg, Germany)
utilizing electrons scattered off quarks in proton targets at the HERA collider
will probe electron and quark substructures to distances of 10-18 cm, and search
for families of excited leptons and quarks. The PSU group is participating in
the contruction of the ZEUS detector which will be used in these experiments.
