The imaging performance of ground-based astronomical telescopes is compromised
by atmospheric turbulence. There has been increased interest in the use of
adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric distortion. One general concept for
atmospheric compensation involves the use of a so-called artificial guide star,
created by illumination of the mesospheric sodium layer, to generate the
information needed for control of the adaptive optics. It is the intent of this
proposed SBIR effort to design (in Phase I) and test (in Phase II) key elements
of a prototype solid state laser for use with a sodium-guide-star system. The
laser would employ sum- frequency generation of pulsed, 589-nm radiation from
two Nd:YAG lasers operating at 1065 and 1319 nm. In follow-on efforts, a
commercial laser would be developed for limited production, and sold to
observatories worldwide as part of a complete atmospheric- compensation system.
