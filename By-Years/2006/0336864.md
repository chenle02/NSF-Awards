This grant provides support to compile a comprehensive database of
&lt;br/&gt;information on the elastic structure of the Earth's
crust.&lt;br/&gt;Parameters that will be tabulated include depth to Moho,
average &lt;br/&gt;crustal velocities, density, thickness of the sedimentary
cover and &lt;br/&gt;Pn velocities. As the database grows, it will provide the
necessary &lt;br/&gt;resource for a detailed global crustal model that is
defined on a 1 &lt;br/&gt;degree grid, CRUST 1.0. This new model will enable the
PI to obtain &lt;br/&gt;more detailed and unbiased tomographic images of the
Earth's upper &lt;br/&gt;and lower mantle. The necessity to be able to perform
such unbiased &lt;br/&gt;studies gain increasing importance as current crustal
models fail to &lt;br/&gt;serve as reference model in the upcoming EARTHSCOPE
initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crustal model will be available to other
researchers on the &lt;br/&gt;worldwide web, together with the database it
is&lt;br/&gt;based upon. This assures the utilization of CRUST 1.0 within a wide
&lt;br/&gt;range of disciplines. For example, the model as a whole can be used
&lt;br/&gt;as a starting model in other tomographic studies and earthquake
&lt;br/&gt;location procedures or as a model to calculate predictions (such as
&lt;br/&gt;sediment loading effects, electrical conductivity or isostatic
&lt;br/&gt;compensation, regional wave propagation). The database will provide
&lt;br/&gt;tables of detailed information that is currently available for local
&lt;br/&gt;structure. This will benefit the "fine-scale research" of a
&lt;br/&gt;particular area, i.e. for applications that seek information on a
&lt;br/&gt;scale smaller than the 100 km of CRUST 1.0. The database will
&lt;br/&gt;probably be the most comprehensive global crustal database that is
&lt;br/&gt;openly available to other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
