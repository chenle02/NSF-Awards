0423566 Nurmikko The proposed research will adapt and advance compact wide
bandgap semiconductor light emitter devices (LEDs) at short wavelengths for
their application to imaging of biological materials/systems. In particular,
they will design, fabricate, and tailor blue and violet LEDs into versatile
multi-element arrays that will enable the real-time imaging of the dynamics of
neural cell networks via fluorescence-based excitation, on-chip. Further,
ultraviolet LEDs will be employed to impart photochemical excitation of such
cellular networks in a spatio-temporally selective manner for the goal of
implementing an interactive interface between neural circuits and man-made
optoelectronic circuits.
