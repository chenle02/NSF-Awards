ABSTRACT --- CTS-9308708 This proposal deals with the application of analytical
and numerical techniques to the SHS process in hybrid systems (gas-solid). Model
development will be carried out incorporating complex chemistry and melting in
those systems in which simultaneous synthesis and densification can take place.
The emphasis is on reaction mechanisms and changes in density resulting from
combustion.
