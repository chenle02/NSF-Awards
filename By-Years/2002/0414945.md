This project will extend previous work on a decision theoretic approach for
designing satisficing multiagent systems so that it is practical to apply the
approach to large-scale, real-world sensor networks. The approach is based on
distributed Bayesian networks and decentralized Markov decision processes. In
terms of intellectual merit, this research addresses a critical need for formal
techniques to support the design of multiagent systems. Approximate, satisficing
approaches can reason about the appropriate tradeoffs between information
quality and resource usage and, thus, reduce barriers to building large-scale
sensor networks, as well as other large-scale multiagent systems. In terms of
broader impact, the project could ultimately have a substantial positive
societal impact by encouraging the development of sophisticated, large-scale
sensor networks. Such large-scale sensor networks have numerous military and
civilian applications. They can be used to enhance security and safety, as well
as to make computerized systems more autonomous and
flexible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
