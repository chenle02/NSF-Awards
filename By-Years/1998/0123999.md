The project will investigate a number of fundamental processes governing the
past, present, and future climates of the Earth. The major themes are
intermediate complexity climate models applied to climate change and
paleoclimate problems, observational and theoretical work relating to water
vapor feedback, and statistical theories of scalar tracers and mixing with
applications in both the troposphere and stratosphere. A notable feature of this
effort is its emphasis on theoretical understanding. The project's focus is to
improve understanding of the coupling between tropical and extratropical
regions. The linkage between tropical moisture sources and moisture distribution
in the extratropics (where water vapor can significantly impact the radiative
cooling to space) motivates project activities in statistical mechanics of the
mixing of atmospheric constituents, and Hadley cell dynamics and transports. Dr.
Pierrehumbert will investigate the role of these processes in climate
variability and global change by conducting experiments with climate models that
are simpler and faster than general circulation models but which retain
sufficient dynamics and resolution to represent realistically heat transport,
water vapor feedback, and other physical processes. The project will advance
theoretical understanding and modeling of dynamical, thermodynamical, and
chemical interactions between the tropics and extratropics, in context of
climate variability and global change.
