This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of bioelectrochemistry. During the tenure of this six-month
standard grant, Professor Chambers and his students will employ modified
electrode and laser induced fluorescence spectroelectrochemistry techniques to
study the release into solution of organic ions such as ethidium and the ensuing
interactions of these ions with double stranded DNA molecules. The analytical
utility of the resulting fluorescent DNA complexes will also be evaluated. %%%
This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Chambers' previous NSF
grant, CHE-8718057, to provide sensitive methods for the detection of trace
amounts of polynucleotides and to study their mass transport properties in
solution.
