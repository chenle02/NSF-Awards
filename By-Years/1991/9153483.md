The goal of this project is to improve the retention rate of women at the
undergraduate and graduate levels in science and engineering. At the University
of Rochester they are undertaking a series of semester-long activities which
include: (1) workshops and discussion sessions for teaching assistants and
entering physics faculty to improve the classroom climate for women students;
(2) giving presentations and holding discussions during physics faculty meetings
on the issue of classroom climate for women; (3) having discussion sessions with
women aimed at improving the college and graduate experience; and (4) evaluating
the effectiveness of these activities on improving the retention of women in the
sciences and engineering. These activities will be repeated in another science
department at the university during the second semester.//
