ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0237422&lt;br/&gt;Cesare Tinelli&lt;br/&gt;Univ of
Iowa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unifying research and education theme of this
project is improving the reliability of software by cost-effective automated
reasoning techniques and tools. The project concentrates on
extended&lt;br/&gt;static checking (ESC), a powerful form of static checking
aimed at detecting insidious run-time errors such as null-dereferencing and out-
of-bounds errors. Because of its limited goal of just uncovering&lt;br/&gt;as
many run-time errors as possible, ESC is easier to automate effectively than
full software verification. However, its wide adoption is presently hindered by
the low speed of existing checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall research
objective of this project is to develop new automated reasoning techniques and
tools for ESC, with the expectation that they will make ESC an attractive and
cost-effective technology for software development. Routine use of ESC will help
uncover more errors during the debugging phase of the software life cycle,
leading to a more reliable final product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall
education objective of the project is to expose students to
specification/verification techniques and tools that have proved effective with
real-word problems. A new generation of professionals&lt;br/&gt;better prepared
and predisposed to the use of these tools will facilitate their adoption by the
software industry, making it possible for our society to reap the benefits of
more reliable software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
