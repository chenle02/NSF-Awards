Creation of a New Social Science Computer Laboratory This project involves a
state-of-the-art networked social science computer laboratory. The laboratory
facility is being used by social science majors, and has improved the
scientific/computer training of social science undergraduates. The project uses
a multidisciplinary approach and impacts undergraduates in political science,
geography, sociology, and psychology. It is also expected to enhance other
undergraduate courses, technology, training in data analysis and methodology
commonly used in the social sciences.
