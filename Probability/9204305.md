Research will continue on parallel programs in stochastic geometry and
stochastic Lyapunov stability theory. In the former direction research will
involve the recurrence of isotropic transport processes and a project on
eigenfunction expansions, both in the context of Riemannian manifolds. The work
on Lyapunov stability will investigate nonlinear oscillations and wave equations
with boundary conditions. Continued support is also being provided for the
Midwest Probability Colloquium, which now functions as a major annual event in
the field of probability theory. Mathematical research in probability theory is
used as a tool for modeling in both the physical and social sciences. This award
will continue the development of these tools. In addition it will provide
support for a meeting which has been very successful in bringing together
research workers from many specialty areas.
