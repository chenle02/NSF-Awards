9451871 Snyder This project is improving undergraduate chemical engineering
education by introducing the investigation of molecular dynamics for the
characterization and analysis of polymers in the polymer and materials science
laboratories. This enhancement is being accomplished by developing new
experiments using a Tetrahedron Audrey 380A Dielectric Spectrometer System.
These experiments provide students with insight into the molecular basis for
polymer properties, many of which are strongly linked to chain dynamics and
molecular mobility. Without this hands-on experience in polymer structure-
property relations, it is extremely difficult for the students to apply
classroom concepts to the design, development and fabrication of advanced
materials. Using this equipment to perform experiments, the students are able to
study important problems such as the fabrication of advanced composites and the
recycle of plastics. An outcome of these problem- solving laboratories will be
scientists and engineers with considerable experience in materials engineering.
