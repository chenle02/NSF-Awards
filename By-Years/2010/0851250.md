This award funds doctoral dissertation research. The research uses laboratory
experiments to investigate betrayal in social exchange environments.
Specifically, the experiments identify the specific effects that aversion to
betrayal has on decisions about whether to trust a trading partner. This is an
advance on previous research, where the effects of betrayal aversion could not
be separated from other factors such as altruism, risk preferences, and loss
aversion that also affect trust decisions. A separate series of experiments
examines whether the disutility caused by betrayal knowledge acts as a check on
trustees' willingness to betray and whether trust and exchange breaks down when
betrayal knowledge is absent. The final part of the project investigates the
motives for betrayal.

Trust and betrayal decisions are present in everyday economic exchanges. The
experimental design developed in this project can be used in classrooms to help
students understand how trust affects the way markets function.
