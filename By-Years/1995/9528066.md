In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Cynthia Jameson will study the dynamics of gases interacting
with zeolites using 129Xe NMR spectroscopy, ab initio calculations of chemical
shifts, and computer simulations. The project will look at elementary processes
at surfaces, such as adsorption and diffusion, in order to gain a microscopic
understanding of the sometimes complicated surface chemistry. The current effort
will extend both simulations and experiments to more complex systems. %%%
Microporous solids, such as zeolites, are widely used for a large number of
applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, separations, oil recovery, and
other industrial processes. Industrial processes which involve adsorption from
gas streams with multiple components depend on the separation of these
components through competitive adsorption on the catalytic surfaces. The results
of this research project will aid in understanding these sorts of applied
systems.
