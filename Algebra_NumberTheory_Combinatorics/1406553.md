The PI defines and studies invariants of geometric spaces and quantum analogues
thereof. This area arises from the study of symmetries of geometric or physical
systems and their linear actions (representation theory) and their quantization,
the mathematical version of passing from classical to quantum mechanics
(noncommutative geometry). There is a rich interplay between the two, which has
connections and applications to many areas of mathematics, such as
combinatorics, integrable systems, real algebraic geometry, quiver varieties,
and resolutions of symplectic singularities.

The PI defines new homology theories which generalize de Rham cohomology and
gives new interpretations of Hochschild and cyclic homology using D-module
techniques. These ideas have applications to the representation theory of Lie
groups, to the study of various algebras (Cherednik, symplectic reflection, and
W-algebras), and to symplectic and Calabi-Yau resolutions. The PI will prove
that his Poisson-de Rham homology recovers the de Rham homology of every
symplectic resolution in new cases, such as for determinantal varieties and
hypertoric varieties. He will recover from it important polynomials such as
Kostka and Tutte polynomials. The PI plans to pursue conjectures relating this
to the orders of vanishing of holomorphic fiberwise-closed forms on the
deformation of the resolution. The main technique uses D-modules which
encapsulate the Hamiltonian flow, built of canonical local systems on symplectic
leaves. He also plans to use cyclic homology to obtain representations of affine
Hecke algebras via the Gauss-Manin connection on noncommutative deformations of
the mirror of cotangent bundles to flag varieties.
