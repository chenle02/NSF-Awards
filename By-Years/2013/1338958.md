This project aims to prove the concept that a cost-effective modification can be
made to exiting dental implants with biomimetic nanofibers with the potential
for regeneration of periodontal ligaments (PDL). Researchers propose to coat
aligned biomimetic nanofibers onto the root of the dental implants for rapid
attachment, migration and proliferation of PDL fibroblasts along the fiber
alignment and promoted formation of PDL-like tissues. To address this, the
research objectives are accordingly made to (1) formulate and deposit aligned
biomimetic nanofibers (containing collagen and/or chitosan) onto the root of Ti
dental implants, and (2) verify that the fiber alignment is sufficient to guide
the desirable cellular functions of PDL fibroblasts for PDL regeneration. The
research team anticipates that an accelerated formation of PDL will take place
right onto the biomimetic nanofibers, which will potentially lead to the bonding
of dental implant with surrounding alveolar bone. The same aligned nanofibers
can be used to modify other implant surfaces involving gingival regeneration,
neuron extension, directed tissue and organ
regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With projected growing global demand for
dental implants, it is expected that the proposed cost-effective biomimetic
nanofiber coating will provide a competitive solution to current unmet problem,
i.e., the lack of PDL regeneration capacity, with an improved guidance of the
regeneration of PDL onto dental implants. Compared to current practice, directly
bonding implant onto alveolar bone, aiming to physically fix the implants, the
new biomimetic nanofiber coating can significantly promote PDL regeneration by
providing the PDL cells with a biomimetic stimulatory environment. The proposed
modification strategy may have a high potential for widespread use, as they
mainly deal with a modification of current dental implants and the materials for
nanofibers have been used in FDA-approved devices for in vivo use.
