The development of design methodologies have generally been associated with
specific aspects of engineering design -- also known as DF (X) methodologies --
where DF (X) represents Design For (x) and the X represents functions such as
assembly, manufacturing, quality, and even disassembly. This project is directed
at the development of a generalized definition of DF (X) principles and
methodologies. It will also be an investigation of the relational mapping of
generalized principles and methodologies to problem specific principles and
methodologies. The operational tool is a relational data base linking DF (X)
applications and a general definition of this concept. This effort will assist
in assessing if an effective translation exists between abstract concepts of
design and the application of design methodologies.
