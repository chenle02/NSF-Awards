This research project concerns multi-dimensional statistical analysis. The
project supports work in multivariate distributions and, in particular,
theoretical considerations, dependency properties, orderings and approximations
of multivariate distributions, extensions of univariate distributions to higher
dimensions, nonparametric families and families with marginals as parameters
This research is in the general area of statistics. Multi- dimensional
statistical analysis has many applications including Urn models which are used
to model the contagion process, and shock models used in the context of
reliability theory.
