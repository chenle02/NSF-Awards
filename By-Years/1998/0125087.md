EarthTalk Incorporated will be producing three seasons of "I Wonder," 225
ninety-second radio programs that answer listeners' questions about science.
Questions will be collected from listeners via the projects' web site, by mail,
and during special "field recording events" in which questions are solicited
from museum visitors at nine science centers across the nation. Each program
will feature a listener's science question with its answer provided by
interviews with scientists/experts. "I Wonder" will be carried on the over 700
public and commercial radio stations that currently broadcast the producers'
"Earth and Sky" radio series.

Ancillary support for the series will be provided by a special "I Wonder"
section of Earth & Sky Online and direct mailing of the nine "I Wonder" CDs to
90,000 classroom teachers. Promotion for the series will include placement of
print ads that are timed with the field recording events.
