The purpose of this work is to develop expert systems for diagnosing problems in
computer-based flexible manufacturing systems. The diagnostic information can be
used not only for increasing up-time in existing systems, but also for improving
the design of future systems. The approach is based on use of "influence
diagrams," i.e., graphical representations of the interrelationships of the
physical variables used to describe the system.
