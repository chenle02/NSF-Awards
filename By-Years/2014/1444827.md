Software vulnerabilities are a substantial problem that exists in part due to
programmer errors. A common cause is that programmers have a cognitive gap
between their understanding of what actions code will perform and the actual
actions the code performs. This work takes a first step toward rigorously
understanding how humans think about code to (eventually) help to dramatically
reduce bugs by building more human understandable programming languages and
programs. This project will perform a pilot study to determine how to understand
such security bugs, tease out the key aspects of them, and integrate this
understanding into expert tutoring systems to help programmers detect
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive science techniques will be used to derive
the core contributing issues in existing security vulnerabilities by slicing
vulnerabilities into their component parts and evaluating the resulting bugs.
This will create a generalized understanding of security issues which will
enable easy reproduction and replication of similar source code, which is ideal
input for an expert tutoring tool. The resulting expert tutoring tool will be
used to evaluate the effectiveness of tutoring in helping programmers reduce
reduce their susceptibility to similar bugs.
