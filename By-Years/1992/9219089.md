This research combines experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate
mechanisms of slip transmission across coherent interphase boundaries in
intermetallic compounds. Single crystal titanium aluminides, TiAl and Ti3Al, are
grown, mechanically tested, and the results compared to theoretical predictions
of dislocation core structures and the interaction of dislocations with
interphase boundaries. Computer modeling of the interface between the aluminide
phases is carried out in parallel with the dislocation calculations. The
microstructures of the alloys are varied by combinations of diffusion bonding
and/or diffusive infiltration. The fracture mechanisms in these intermetallic
materials are assessed. Compression testing, transmission electron microscopy,
and atomic force microscopy are employed. %%% This research advances the
frontiers of atomistic modeling for simulating interfaces and understanding of
mechanical behavior in high temperature intermetallic alloys of technological
importance.
