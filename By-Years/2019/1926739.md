The 2019 GRC/GRS on the Science of Adhesion will focus on outstanding challenges
in understanding adhesion and friction in extreme conditions. The sessions will
cover theoretical/simulation models to understand adhesion/friction on rough/wet
surfaces; experimental measurements under these extreme conditions;
understanding gained from biological systems that have to deal with challenging
environmental conditions; and novel synthetic adhesives designed for these
extreme conditions. The main objective of the meeting is to foster discussion
between theorists working on new models for adhesion/friction; experimentalist
testing relevant systems; and inspiration of new design/chemistry that comes
from biological systems that outperform synthetic adhesives in these extreme
conditions. Some presentations will be more application driven, including bio-
inspired adhesives, biomedical adhesives, and haptic sensors for robotics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2019 GRC/GRS on the Science of Adhesion aims to
provide a forum for cutting-edge presentations and vibrant discussion and debate
about new and developing problems in Adhesion Science. The conference will
primarily focus on Adhesion and Friction in Extreme Conditions and Translation
to Practical Applications. Moreover, it will bring established strengths of the
Adhesion Science community to bear on newer fields and problems. The goal is to
invite a mix of young and more experienced speakers who will present the most
recent and exciting research and to achieve this goal with balanced or diverse
representation among speakers and discussion leaders. The accompanying GRS willl
be organized to encourage and enhance active participation of graduate students
and post-doctoral associates in the main GRC. The GRS will also provide a unique
mentoring opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
