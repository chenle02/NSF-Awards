The starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the State University of New
York at Buffalo supports the research of Professor Steven T. Diver. The
objective of the research is to identify new catalysts by an in vivo screening
method. The enzyme system is transketolase with thiamin pyrophosphate cofactor
as its catalytic machinery. Through mutation of the transketolase gene in yeast,
a system is developed in which yeast grow only when catalytic function is
recovered by incorporation of a new cofactor. Various thiamin analogs are
designed, synthesized, and tested for activity as new catalytic cofactors. The
growth phenotype is used to discover a new cofactor catalyst as an in vivo
selection strategy. The research explores a new method for novel catalyst
discovery, using a living cell to communicate a reaction's worthiness. The work
enhances understanding of the relationship between structure and function in
enzyme systems.
