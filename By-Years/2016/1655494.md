Naked mole-rats are unusual because they combine a subterranean lifestyle with
living in large colonies. With many animals breathing the same stale air, oxygen
supplies become low. Consistent with this, naked mole-rats are extremely
tolerant to oxygen deprivation. Their brain is resistant to the effects of
oxygen deprivation. The goal of the project is to identify the underlying
physiological and genetic factors that give the naked mole-rat its tolerance.
This will be important for understanding the diverse ways that animals can
change to fit their environment. It will also be important for identifying new
ways of surviving oxygen deprivation, which happens in the brain of a human who
suffers a heart attack. Blood can no longer carry oxygen to the brain when the
heart fails. The project also includes training graduate and undergraduate
students to be scientists. Project staff will interact with the public at a free
city zoo to inform people about the interesting biology of the naked mole-
rat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem to be studied is, how do naked mole-rats
achieve extreme brain tolerance to oxygen deprivation? This will be studied
using physiological, biochemical, and genetic techniques. Physiological
approaches will include recording electroencephalograms (EEG) and quantifying
metabolites related to anaerobic metabolism in animals exposed to hypoxia. The
project will also use hippocampal brain slices to measure age-related changes in
basic synaptic phenomena including long-term potentiation and long-term
depression. Mass spectrometry will be used to determine the functionality
(phosphorylation dynamics) of phosphorylation sites on hypoxia-induced programed
cell death pathways. Finally, CRISPR/cas9 techniques will be used to produce
both cell lines and mutant mice that carry naked mole-rat mutations in hypoxia-
induced programed cell death pathways. The results are expected to reveal new
ways of establishing brain protection from oxygen deprivation.
