The aim of the project is to study algebras of commuting Hamiltonians for
quantum integrable models, called Bethe algebras, and their relations in
representation theory and algebraic geometry. The main points of interest are
Bethe algebras for integrable models associated with the Lie algebra gl_N, such
as the Gaudin model and the XXX-type model. Recent developments show a close
connection of those Bethe algebras to algebras of functions on the Calogero-
Moser space and intersections of Schubert cycles in Grassmannians. One of the
intended goals is to understand deeper this important connection and to expand
it to other algebras of geometric nature. Another goal is to establish direct
links of the Bethe algebras in question with Cherednik algebras and double
affine Hecke algebras. The existence of such links is very plausible because the
latter algebras are closely related to the same geometric objects as Bethe
algebras. One more direction of the project is to employ ideas of quasiclassical
quantization to obtain asymptotics of large eigenvalues and the corresponding
eigenvectors of Bethe algebras. Hopefully, those asymptotics can be formulated
in terms of solutions of classical integrable systems.

The main question in the theory of quantum integrable systems is to find joint
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of commuting integrals of motion. The Bethe ansatz
originated as a set of clever technical tricks to perform this task. Eventually,
it has developed into a variety of tools connecting this problem to many areas
such as separation of variables for PDEs, Fuchsian differential equations,
difference equations, Schubert calculus. This interaction turned out to be very
extremely fruitful and yielded many important results for all the subjects
involved. The project will contribute to further development of this area.
