962359 Abstract Self-incompatibility (SI) loci have become model systems for
studying the role of selection in maintaining genetic diversity. SI is a genetic
system which prevents inbreeding in many plant species. Research funded by this
award will advance knowledge on the genetics of self- incompatibility through
examination of how these systems are organized at molecular, phenotypic and,
populational levels. The relationship of molecular variation to the expression
of incompatibility types will be determined through controlled breeding
experiments. These relationships will provide invaluable information linking
complex phenotypes to DNA sequence variation, increasing our knowledge of how
complex biological mechanisms are coded in the DNA. Findings from several wild
populations will be integrated analytically to understand the origins and
distribution of genetic diversity within the species. This work will be
accomplished using the wild tomato species, Lycopersicon chilense. Lycopersicon
chilense represents a close relative to domesticated tomatoes and a valuable
source of potential germplasm for this important crop. Genes identified in this
research could be of direct utility in manipulating the breeding system and
pollination mechanism of domestic tomatoes.
