9417108 Miller Determining relationships among processes of deposition,
formation of unconformity-bounded units (sequences), and global sea-level on
passive continental margins requires continuous sampling and dating of
stratigraphic sections in different tectonic settings. The New Jersey Sea-Level
Transect (onshore drilling, ODP Leg 150, and future shelf drilling) has begun
the task of evaluating passive margin sequences by drilling an integrated
transect of boreholes on the NJ coastal plain, shelf, and slope. NSF-funded
drilling onshore at Island Beach, Atlantic City, and Cape May, NJ in 1993-94 was
successful in assembling a mosaic of coastal plain sequences that record
uppermost Cretaceous-Recent relative sea-level changes. Comparison with other
sea-level proxy data should establish if these sequences were controlled by
global sea-level variations. These sequences often bracket aquifer- confining
units and these hydrogeological couplets can be correlated throughout the
coastal plain. Because of their hydrogeological significance, the NJ Geological
Survey has funded drilling costs under a Water Bond Issue for a fourth borehole
to be drilled at Harrisville, NJ in 1995 (2,000 ft. proposed total depth). This
is a renewal proposal to support science involved with the drilling of the
Harrisville borehole and integrated magneto-, bio-, litho-, and isotopic
stratigraphic studies. These studies represent a collaborative effort among
Rutgers, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the NJ Geological Survey, and the
Eastern Regional Branch of the USGS. ***
