Hydroxyl (OH) is an atmospheric free radical of importance in the study of the
photochemistry of stratospheric ozone and in the understanding of the roles of
anthropogenic nitrogen and chlorine compounds which catalytically destroy ozone.
The stratospheric ozone layer shields the earth's lifeforms from the damaging
effects of solar ultraviolet radiation, and accurate predictions regarding its
integrity require detailed knowledge of relevant photochemical processes.
Measurements of OH and an understanding of its behavior are essential components
of this body of knowledge. Ongoing vertical column abundance measurements at
Fritz Peak Observatory, Colorado, and the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research Atmospheric Station in Lauder, New Zealand, will be
continued through mid-1995 under this proposal. These are high resolution
spectroscopic measurements of the absorption of sunlight by the OH molecule. The
proposed work will be a continuation of the 15 year observation series in
Colorado and of the 3 year series in New Zealand. Analytical studies and
atmospheric model comparisons will continue in an effort to understand the
mechanisms responsible for the observed behaviors of this extensive database.
