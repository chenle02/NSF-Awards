This proposal seeks funds to recruit and retain 29 students from the community
college transfer population in the Mathematics and statistics department as well
as the computer science department. It will target the financially needy student
with special attention being given to the enrollment of women and other under
represented minorities. The students will come from either community college
transfers or current junior and senior programs. In the previous CSEMS program
the university funded 10 talented freshmen to participate in the program with
the other CSEMS selected scholars. The recruiting program detailed here is
innovative, careful and well supported by the University.
