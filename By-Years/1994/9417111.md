9417111 Wooster This award will provide funding for U.S. ocean scientists,
particularly those in the academic research community, to participate in the
activities of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES). This
organization was established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific
research in order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean
and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource
usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in
the North Pacific. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual Meetings, as well
as in sessional or intercessional workshops, will be funded through this award.
In addition, U.S. scientist participating in one of four standing scientific
committees (Biological Oceanography, Fishery Science, Marine Environmental
Quality, and Physical Oceanography and Climate) will receive travel funding for
required activities.
