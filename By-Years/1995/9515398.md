"Creationist science" is continually being raised by fundamentalists who claim
that it should have standing beside Darwinian evolutionary theory in the
teaching of biology in our schools. In fact, in the recent elections in
Virginia, attempts were made to elect a school board which would support the
teaching of creationist science. Yet for scientists, the very words "creationist
science" is an oxymoron. Creationism is based on revealed religion while science
is empirically supported or justified. But what does this mean, "empirically
supported"? How can we empirically confirm any theory unless we know what
empirical confirmation is? And on pain of circularity it appears that that
theory of confirmation must itself be established independently of the empirical
evidence. Otherwise, we would be saying that we believe some theory of
confirmation simply because that theory assures us that it itself is worth
believing in the circumstances. Furthermore, even the barest empiricist doctrine
seems to presuppose something that cannot be tested empirically (or at least not
noncircularly so), namely that observation is to be trusted. The classical
answer to support of beliefs is intuition. Intuition, however, is an appeal to a
direct metaphysical insight, a non-observational grasp of independent matters of
fact. Such an answer, though, answer is appalling to anyone who takes science
seriously or, for that matter, anyone who wants to distinguish "creationism"
from science. Under this grant, Professor Richard Creath is examining the
competing answers to how science is justified which were given by two of the
foremost leaders in the field of philosophy of science over the past fifty
years: Rudolf Carnap W. V. O. Quine. These two philosophers of science have
shaped the views of succeeding generations on how we are to conceive of the
process of justifying our scientific beliefs. Using documents that have only
recently become available, Professor Creath will articulate more fully than has
been possible heretofore Carnap's and Quine's alternative philosophies of
science and the searching criticisms that each made of the other. He will then
extend and develop these criticisms in turn so as to bring the arguments of the
Carnap-Quine debate fully to bear on current issues in the philosophy of
science. This research thus promises to go a long way in clarifying the
difference between a science that is based on empirical justification from a
"science" that originates from divine or received sources.
