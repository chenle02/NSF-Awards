This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Render's sabbatical visit to
the laboratory of Dr. Chris Doe at the University of Illinois. Dr. Render
intends to learn modern molecular biology techniques, in order to apply them to
her experimental system involving cell fate specification during development of
a gastropod mollusc. The acquisition of these new techniques, and the
opportunity to apply them to the experimental system which has already been
fruitful, is anticipated to significantly enhance her career.
