This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in
the conference "Nonlinear Analysis in Rome" that will be held June 26-30, 2017,
at the University of Notre Dame's Rome (Italy) Global Gateway facility. For
additional information see the conference website:

The focus of this meeting is nonlinear partial differential equations, with
talks and minicourses emphasizing both basic theory as well as connections to
models in the physical, biological, and social sciences. The selection of
speakers is intended to be representative of recent advances in various aspects
of the field. The program features two three-lecture minicourses, one by Luigi
Ambrosio (optimal transport and Ricci curvature), the other by Tristan Riviere
(minimax methods in the calculus of variations of curves and surfaces). The
program offers ample opportunity for junior mathematicians to present their
work.
