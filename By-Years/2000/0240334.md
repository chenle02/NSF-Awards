&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
IIS-0240334&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jamie
Callan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal applies peer-to-peer
architectural approaches to the issues associated with federated search of
digital libraries. The problem of integrating large numbers of disgital
libraries into a coherent, federated system is a fundamental goal and challenge
for present day digital libraries research efforts. Large-scale integration in a
meaningful way involves overcoming the issues of heterogeneity of query
languages, resource description and service descriptons . Peer-to-peer
architectures differ from earlier approaches which attempt to enforce single
,uniform approaches by adding networking components with translation capability
between difference scchemas. Peer-to-peer architectures have the consequence of
removing control from single organizations, but at the same time result in
increased complexity and potential for congestion. This project is a coordinated
effort between researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of
Dortmund, Germany.
