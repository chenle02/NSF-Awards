This award provides funds to support student participation in the 2008
International Conference on Atomic Physics, being held during the week of July
27-August 1, 2008, at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. The
conference involves a program of central issues in atomic physics, including
discussions of advances in precision measurements, quantum information,
ultracold atoms and molecules, quantum optics, ultrafast phenomena, and the
quantum mechanics of mechanical systems. The objective of the conference is to
bring together internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers
and students active or specially interested in the field. The conference format
of invited talks with no parallel sessions and separate sessions for poster
presentations makes the meeting an excellent forum to broadly engage students in
the newest research results and still allow time for interactions among the
participants. Support is provided by both the theoretical and experimental AMO
programs.
