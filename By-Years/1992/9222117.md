Equipment for the development of a controlled and automated environment for
vision experiments shall be added to the Computer Vision Laboratory. The key
features of this environment include: controlled illumination techniques,
controlled positioning of sensors and illumination sources, precise measurement
of radiometric and spectral characteristics of a scene. The following are some
of the research projects for which the equipment will be dedicated. o Analysis
of Interreflection Effects. o Verification of Reflectance Models. o Development
of Polarization Based Algorithms. o Analysis of Shadows and Occlusions. o
Integration of Early Vision Modules. o Motion Segmentation. o Sensor and
Illumination Planning. o Automatic Generation of Object Models
