The "Escalante Math and Science Program" is an instructional program at East
Los Angeles College that involves many elements that research has shown are
characteristic of highly successful programs: a comprehensive well-developed
plan, dedicated staff, parental involvement, community support, motivation
strategies, agreed-upon objectives, coordinated support services, and a
willingness to challenge institutional policies. This program will increase the
number of students who are at and above grade level in mathematics and science
and in addition will prepare inner-city , under-represented students for the
Advanced Placement Test in calculus, computer science, chemistry, English, and
physics. The program will develop a formal process to bring together teachers,
counselors, and staff from junior high schools, high schools, community
colleges, and four year colleges to improve course articulation and to better
address the unique needs of the target population. A leadership component
assures that the project will be disseminated to other schools in the Los
Angeles area. Substantial cost-sharing from the school district, industry, and
East Los Angeles College indicates extensive support for this program.
