9406404 McClelland Northern and central Alaska consist primarily of large blocks
of continental crust that are locally overlain by oceanic crustal fragments.
Gross similarities between them has led to speculation that they are all
fragments of North America's continental margin, however data to support or
refute this hypothesis is particularly sparse int he Ruby terrane of central
Alaska. This project will provide the necessary thermal and structural history
of this area in order to reconstruct the subduction and exhumation events so
that a firm comparisons to other continental blocks can be made. Results should
lead to a rubust model of the Mesozoic paleogeography of the northern Cordillera
and answer the question of what the relative significance of strike-slip, thrust
and extensional tectonics were in the history of the Ruby terrane, and how it
arrival at its current oblique angle to the regional trends in the northern
Cordillera.
