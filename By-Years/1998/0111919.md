Abstract

Prelec, Drazen

The future is "unreal"

People often seem to pay little attention to the future. They may give future
consequences little weight when making current decisions about spending or
saving money, sticking to a diet, exercising, or giving up smoking. Although we
know people commonly undervalue the future, researchers have little
understanding of why this undervaluation occurs, particularly why the distant
rewards are so weak relative to immediate rewards. The present research tests
the idea that the distant future appears "unreal" - i.e. that people cognitively
process future events as if they were hypothetical. Therefore they typically pay
the future event little attention and assign it little value resulting in a very
high "implicit" undervaluation. When forced to pay attention to an event in the
future, as a first-pass people first focus on the event alone before
incorporating the time information in a more analytical second-pass evaluation.
The resulting "explicit" undervaluation may be much smaller than the proposed
implicit undervaluation. The present research tests these questions in four
experiments using memory, imagery and effort to investigate similarities between
distant future events and hypothetical events. These findings would have
significant implications for decisions in areas ranging from personal health and
finance to education and public policy.
