This is a study of algorithmic systems used to automatically identify suspected
victims and exploiters, which become part of the arsenal of tools deployed by
anti-trafficking networks, which include law enforcement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in a dissertation and trained
professional. Results will be disseminated to a wide range of stake-holders.
