Meteors are the visual manifestation of the penetration into the atmosphere of
tiny fragments of interplanetary material, mostly of the size of a grain of sand
or smaller with occasionally a larger one, that mostly burn up on entry, and
produce a trail of ionized and optically emitting gas. The meteor trails are
strong reflectors of high frequency radio waves, and the doppler shift of such
waves gives the bulk velocity of the air over the height range from about 75 to
110 km altitude, and reveals tides, planetary waves, and seasonal and solar
cycle variations. Thus the operation of meteor wind radars has provided a wealth
of information on the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This
award is for continuation of the operation of such a meteor radar at the
University of New Hampshire. The results will be incorporated with the results
of campaigns of observations of the region by other radars and optical
equipment, for the purpose of validating and calibrating models of middle
atmosphere dynamics.
