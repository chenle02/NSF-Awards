This award funds the research activities of Professors Pran Nath, Haim Goldberg,
Brent D Nelson and Tomasz Taylor at Northeastern University in Boston,
Massachusetts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators (PIs) plan to
carry out research in broad areas of particle physics with the aim of
deciphering the nature of physics that lies beyond the Standard Model. Their
theoretical investigations are closely linked with the current experimental
efforts such as those at the Large Hadron Collider as well as in several
underground experiments searching for dark matter and satellite experiments
which probe the early history of the universe. The efforts of the PIs are based
on supersymmetry, supergravity and string theory as these are the leading
theoretical frameworks for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The PIs also
plan to pursue neutrino cosmology and dark radiation in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
and in Cosmic Microwave Background data coming from the PLANCK satellite
experiment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project also has a strong
educational component which involves the training of graduate and undergraduate
students. Several students will work with the PIs on their Ph.D. dissertations
and additionally the research projects will be used as an educational tool for
physics majors regarding developments on particle physics frontiers. The results
of this research will be disseminated via publications in refereed journals,
through open access arXiv.org, through talks at international conferences, and
through popular journals. This research project will also involve collaborators
from many countries and thus will enhance international collaboration in
fundamental physics.
