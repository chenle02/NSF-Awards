Three projects are planned that extend the theory of electron impact ionization
developed by Briggs, Brauner and Klar; ionization plus excitation, extension of
the BBK theory to lower energies using the distorted wave method and
investigation of differential cross sections for heavier atoms with one or two
valence electrons.
