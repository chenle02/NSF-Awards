This research deals with the synthesis and properties of a new class of
polymers, i.e., polyethers that exhibit liquid- crystalline behavior. The
polyether functionality will be placed in the so-called main chain of the
polymers. Recent work by the principal investigator has shown that such polymers
are both thermotropic and lyotropic. The major effort of this research will be
directed toward the synthesis of a variety of polyethers of this type. An effort
will be made to derive a better understanding of structure-property
relationships in liquid- crystalline polymers containing flexible "spacers,"
such as aliphatic or oligooxyethylenic groups. Exploratory experiments are also
planned on the synthesis of ring-shaped and biaxial nematic liquid-crystalline
polymers.
