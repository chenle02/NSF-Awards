The Chemistry Department at the institution upgraded the Polymer Chemistry
Laboratory Course with new experiments and modern state-of-the-art scientific
instrumentation through the acquisition of a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7
Thermogravimetric Analyzer. The Thermogravimetric Analyzer has extended current
characterization and physical property methods to include studies of: 1) Static
methods associated with weight change-Isobaric and Isothermal, and 2) Dynamic
methods associated with weight change-Thermogravimetric and Derivative
Thermogravimetric. The department also acquired a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared
Fourier Transform (DRIFT) Accessory and a Horizontal Attenuated Total
Reflectance (ATR) Accessory for the Nicolet 510 FT-IR which was a prior
acquisition. These two accessories greatly expanded the capability of the
Nicolet 510 FT-IR in infrared analyses of polymer samples. These upgradings of
the department's major holdings enabled it to enhance significantly the
preparation of their students for the challenging world of work in the highly
technologically advanced twenty-first century. The institution contributed to
the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
