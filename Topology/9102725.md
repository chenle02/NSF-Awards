At a certain basic level topology merges into set theory, which makes it a part
of the foundations of mathematics. The principal investigator will continue his
research on several open questions in set-theoretic topology. One theme is
normality and countable paracompactness versus paracompactness in locally
compact spaces. Several longstanding problems in this area remain unsettled,
e.g., the Arhangel'skii-Tall problem (Are normal locally compact metacompact
spaces paracompact?) and Watson's problem (Is there a perfectly normal locally
compact non- paracompact space in ZFC?) Another problem has led to interesting
combinatorics involving ladder systems that will likely have further
applications. Other problems to be investigated include the existence of Dowker
filters, and questions of Watson and Cook involving connectedness. Possible
methods of solution include set- theoretic axioms and combinatorics, and
forcing. Solutions to the problems would deepen our understanding of fundamental
topological properties and constructions, and would likely require new
techniques applicable to a variety of other problems.
