Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Nigeria collaborative research project involving
Indiana University and the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria is in the area
of geochemical and stable isotopic studies of mid- Cretaceous black shales.
Project funding will allow a highly qualified researcher from Nigeria to spend
an extended period of time in the laboratory of Dr. Lisa M. Pratt at Indiana
University. The collaborative research will investigate mid- Cretaceous black
shales from the Benue trough in southeastern Nigeria. One of the projected
outcomes of the study will be a strategic framework for the Nigerian black
shales that can be correlated with standard North American and European stages.
This project in geochemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Nigeria to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
