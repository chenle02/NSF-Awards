Although literature exists which describes the general dearth of women faculty
in STEM&lt;br/&gt;academic programs, no specific or current data describes the
status of women at HBCUs. It is the purpose of this one-year ADVANCE Leadership
Award to propose to investigate the status of women STEM faculty at the 106
Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Specifically, this project will
seek to determine if (a) Clark Atlanta University, one of only three doctoral
granting HBCUs, is representative of other HBCUs, and if (b) HBCUs, as a group,
reflect the status of women faculty in science and engineering at majority
institutions. Additionally, this project will seek to identify through the
development and dissemination of a national database, the STEM faculty women at
HBCUs, as well as their areas of specialty and research. Finally, Clark Atlanta
University proposes to convene the first national conference of HBCU women STEM
faculty designed to focus on the best practices for advancing women in science
and engineering at HBCUs. A team of nationally recognized experts, including
representatives from the original nine ADVANCE Institutional Transformation
Awardees, will be invited to lead and facilitate these discussions.&lt;br/&gt;
