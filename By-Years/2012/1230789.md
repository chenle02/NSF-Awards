The proposal is to provide funding to the 18th biennial gathering of Arctic
scholars known as the Inuit Studies Conference (ISC) for broadening
participation of Arctic indigenous people, students and early career scientists
in the conference and to support digital media platforms to widen the public
audience for the conference.

The 18th ISC will be addressing the central theme, "Inuit/Arctic/Connections:
Learning from the Top of the World," which will be held for the first time in
the "Lower '48" at the Smithsonian Institution 24-28 October, 2012. The
conference will address the outstanding issue of the Arctic world today, it's
rapidly changing climate and the dramatic reduction of sea ice that is
transforming a "frozen" world into a seasonally ice-free environment. These
physical changes have already had a profound impact on Arctic cultures and
residents, on the natural resources that sustain northern peoples, and for the
first time directly affect the wider world as a result of new access to formerly
frozen lands and waters. The conference will focus on communicating new research
on a broad array of northern topics and will raise awareness about these issues
in a series of plenary sessions, workshops, symposia, panel discussions, media
events, and exhibitions.

An important part of the NSF support will be to expand the traditional format by
situating ISC-18 in a contemporary digital environment by developing an
extensive website and by broadcasting key sessions and events in streaming media
with interactive communication techniques. This proposal seeks funds to ensure
participation of young as well as seasoned scholars and to implement a digital
communication plan that expands the impact of the conference from attendees to
the wider world.
