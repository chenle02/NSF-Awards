Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to complete a promising
research agenda focused on the assessment of engineering education and funded
initially by the Engineering Education and Centers Action Agenda initiative (EEC
9872498). Specifically, the critical problem of how to best assure that
engineering students receive a quality education is being addressed through
outcomes assessment. With the introduction of the ABET EC2000 accreditation
criteria, engineering faculty must develop and implement systems for continuous
improvement. &lt;br/&gt;The project is involving a multidisciplinary team from
five universities: Colorado School of Mines, Columbia University, University of
Pittsburgh, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and the University of
Washington. The objectives are to identify and evaluate a variety of
methodologies for assessing engineering education and to provide engineering
educators with a comprehensive set of attributes to describe student learning
outcomes, identify existing instruments for each method to assess student
achievement outcomes, and develop instruments where none can be found. The
particular focus of this phase of the project is to use triangulation
experiments using multiple assessment methodologies to measure specific
undergraduate outcomes on student cohorts at all five institutions. The research
is intended to determine which methods are most effective for particular
outcomes as well as to better understand how engineering students progress
toward achieving stated learning outcome objectives over the course of their
undergraduate education. All findings and materials from this work will continue
to be available at http://www.engrng.pitt.edu/~ec2000/
