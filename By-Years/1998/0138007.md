This award supports an effort to develop a miniaturized and integrated two-
dimensional (2-D) protein separation platform based on non-native isoelectric
focusing and SDS gel electrophoresis in a microfluidic network. The network will
be embedded in a small plastic chip, and the device will employ laser-induced
fluorescence for the detection of resolved SDS-protein complexes in the
microchannel array using non-covalent, environment-sensitive, fluorescent
probes. The resulting instrumentation system will be capable of analyzing
complex mixtures of proteins, including crude cell lysates containing minute
quantities of protein. In addition, the device will be amenable to much greater
automation, throughput, and sensitivity than existing gel-based systems. This
microfluidics-based instrumentation technology, positioned as the next
generation of 2-D poly acrylimide gel electrophoresis, promises to have a major
impact on proteomics research, particularly in comparisons of protein expression
in organisms growing under different conditions.
