Improved communication capabilities in airplanes are a continuing goal in the
avionics field. Plastic Optical Fibers (POF) have been used extensively in
automobiles, and their characteristics in enduring harsh environments make them
particularly attractive for use in avionics. Improvements in this area could
lead to more efficient systems in airplanes, with reduced energy costs given
their light weight. This project will examine ways to optimize the
characteristics of POF for application in airplane systems, by collaborating
with researchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain, who are experts in
computer modeling of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from this
project may lead to improved communication systems in airplanes, decreased
energy costs and increased efficiency. Further, the development of applications
to avionics may provide insight for applications in other systems with similarly
wide distribution, such as telecommunications networks. In addition,
collaborating with foreign researchers at the host institution will provide the
graduate student with access to expertise not available at the home institution.
This type of experience provides US students with the capacity to participate in
a globally competitive workforce.
