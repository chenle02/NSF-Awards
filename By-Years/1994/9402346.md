9402346 Swift Hydrographic and Chlorofluorocarbon measurements will be taken
along a meridional section of the South Atlantic Ocean, with additional sections
along the equator and 10 degrees South to determine the role played by the deep
basin circulation of Antarctic Bottom Water on climate change on decadal time
scales. This work is part of the Deep Basin Experiment, a component of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
