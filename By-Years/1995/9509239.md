9509239 SCHMITT We propose to experimentally determine how plant morphology
changes in response to variation in light availability in the model plant
system, Arabidopsis thaliana. Light availability will be varied by manipulating
plant density of genetically homogenous lines of Arabidopsis. We will determine
whether morphological changes in response to low light increase the probability
of a plant surviving and producing offspring under such conditions. We will also
investigate the response of several mutants of A. thaliana to different light
conditions to determine which genes are responsible for this morphological
change. This research will provide a better understanding of the effect of
stress on plant evolution, and it has implications for breeding crops that
perform well in crowded conditions.
