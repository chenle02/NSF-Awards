This RUI project is focused on the characterization of a newly described lectin
from soybean plants that may be related to assimilate partitioning in these
plants. Among the research objectives is assessment of how plant treatments
affect source vs. sink tissues and concentrations of this lectin, to examine the
physiological significance of this lectin's interactions with a particular leaf
storage protein, and to examine the carbohydrate- binding properties of this
lectin. The distribution of the lectin and the leaf storage protein in plants
will be assessed using Western blot hybridization and immunohistochemical
localization. //
