The principal investigators will continue their research in dynamical systems.
Professor Hubbard will focus his research on dynamical systems in the complex
plane as will as higher dimensional complex spaces. Professor Earle will
continue research on Teichmuller spaces and properties of the Teichmuller
metric. Professor Fuchs will study problems in approximation theory and
geometric function theory. This award will support research in the general area
of dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to understand
locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear, and difficult to analyze
globally. Dynamical systems is the study of this local to global relationship.
Many physical systems can best be modeled using this area of mathematics
including fluid flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical
systems, and chemical reactions.
