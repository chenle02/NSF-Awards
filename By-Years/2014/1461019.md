NON-TECHNICAL PART: This REU Site (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) will
bring ten undergraduates to the University of Florida for each summer 2015-2017
to conduct research under the guidance of a faculty mentor and other research
group members. At least half of the students will come from institutions with
limited research opportunities, and students from underrepresented groups will
be actively recruited to the program. Students will also participate in
professional development activities such as seminars on current areas of
research and applying to graduate school, workshops on public speaking and
scientific writing, and laboratory tours. Participants will be housed in shared
apartments adjacent to campus to create a cohort experience. For many students
in the program this will be their first exposure to research. The program is
designed to encourage them to continue on to careers in science, technology, and
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART: The research projects cover a
broad cross-section of condensed matter and materials physics such as growth of
new materials in the search for new superconductors, fabrication of transistors
which utilize carbon nanotube films for one electrode, use of optical pumping to
enhance nuclear magnetic resonance in semiconductors, simulation of realistic
materials using molecular dynamics or density functional theory, and simulation
of model systems such as those that undergo quantum phase transitions. The REU
students will have access to many shared facilities such as the University of
Florida Nanoscale Research Facility and High Performance Computing Center, and
the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in both Gainesville and Tallahassee.
Many of the REU participants are expected to present their results at scientific
meetings and to be coauthors on papers.
