The Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS), National Research Council (NRC)
through its Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) will convene
two 1-1/2 day symposia on the topic Modern Interdisciplinary University
Statistics Education, one at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC,
and one at the Beckman Center in Irvine, CA. The topics of discussion at these
symposia will be what changes in statistics education are needed to: (1)
incorporate interdisciplinary training into upper-undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral statistics programs, (2) bring upper-undergraduate and graduate
statistics curricula up to date, and (3) improve apprenticing of statistics
graduate and postdoctoral students and appropriately reward faculty mentors.
Proceedings based upon the presentations and discussions at both symposia will
be produced and disseminated after the second symposium.
