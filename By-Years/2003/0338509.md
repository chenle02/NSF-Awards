The DIALM-POMC Joint Workshop is devoted to discrete algorithms
and&lt;br/&gt;discrete modelling in the context of mobile and wireless computing
and&lt;br/&gt;communications. It is intended to be a lively meeting, covering
many&lt;br/&gt;of the algorithmic and discrete aspects of this field going
from&lt;br/&gt;operations research to radio engineering problems. It aims,
in&lt;br/&gt;particular, at fostering the cooperation among practitioners
and&lt;br/&gt;theoreticians of the field.&lt;br/&gt;If this project is awarded,
the funds provided by NSF to support&lt;br/&gt;DIALM-POMC'2003 will be used to
provide funds for inviting two renowed&lt;br/&gt;speakers in the area of mobile
computing to present at the workshop,&lt;br/&gt;to allow for reduced
registration costs for students, and to provide&lt;br/&gt;travel support for
students attending the workshop.
