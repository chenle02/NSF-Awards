The phase I research will involve acoustic tomography and reflection imaging of
concrete conditions using stress wave energy to detect flaws such as void,
honeycomb crackling and weak concrete in concrete test wall models. Key aspects
of the research are implementation of a rapid scanning ultrasonic stress wave
energy system that will be used to generate and measure compression and shear
wave energy. A second key component of the research involves the adaptation of
tomographic velocity and reflection/diffraction imaging methods from geophysics
for evaluation of structural concrete conditions including both flaw detection
and reinforcement location.
