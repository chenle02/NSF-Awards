The Virginia Commonwealth University will initiate a 3-week commuter Young
Scholars project for 30 students in grade 7 in physics and math. The Richmond
Area Young Scholars Program emphasizes mathematics and physics and is designed
for rising 7th grade black students in the Richmond area. Honors topics
instruction will be provided by university faculty and by pre-college faculty
who are members of the active Mathematics Teacher Professional Network. Student
interest in mathematics and physics will be nurtured, students will report on
small group interactions with industry and academic researchers, and students
will conduct and report on small scale research projects. Academic year follow-
up activities include regular mentor contact and group activities through the
Richmond Area Mathematics and Science Center.
