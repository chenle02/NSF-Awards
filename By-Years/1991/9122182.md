The object of this research is the testing and evaluation of two airborne
thermometers (a radiometer and a thermistor) designed to measure temperature in
water clouds. The thermistor is mounted within an aerodynamic housing designed
to deflect water drops away from the sensor. The final design, especially for
clouds containing large quantities of liquid water, will use results from wind
tunnel tests and theoretical computations of the airflow in the vicinity of the
sensor. All devices will be tested in the field using NCAR's King Air research
aircraft.
