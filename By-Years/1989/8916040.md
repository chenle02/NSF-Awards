The primary objectives of this project are to conduct modeling of currently
used retrofit systems using cable restrainer, extensive studies of their effects
on the response of highway bridges to earthquake excitations and the
investigation of possible improvements of their design so that structural damage
to bridges will be minimized or eliminated in future earthquakes The analytical
models that will be developed will be used to study the response of retrofitted
bridges including the response of the Whitewater Overcrossing (Br. 56-57) to the
recent Palm Springs earthquake. The bridge was retrofitted but suffered some
damage during the 1986 Palm Springs earthquake. Representative cable-restrained
structures that were excited by the Loma Prieta earthquake will also be
analyzed. The primary tasks will be the inclusion of retrofit mechanisms in
recently developed models to represent the impact between the bridge deck and
the abutments during earthquakes and the modification of program NEABS so that
it can be used for the analysis of general type retrofitted bridges. This
project is coordinated with the program of the California Department of
Transportation (CALTRANS) and practically funded by the Nevada Department of
Transportation.
