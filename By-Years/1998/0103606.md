Nonparametric statistical methods are used in practice so far mainly for low
dimensional data. A major reason for this is the so-called ``curse of
dimensionality'', meaning that the statistical performance of methods get worse
with increasing dimension. On the other hand, the steep increase in complexity
when passing from dimension one to higher dimensions might not be caught
adequately by parametric models. Hence, there is a need for non- and
semiparametic methods that on the one hand do not suffer too much from the curse
of dimensionality, and on the other hand are computationally feasible. The goal
of this project is to develop such types of nonparametric statistical methods.
Central for this project is the observation that many important statistical
problems can be formulated in terms of ``mass concentration'', thereby providing
a unifying view to diverse problems with potential applications in various
scientific fields. The intuitive idea of mass concentration becomes explicitly
expressed in the statistical methods developed in this project. This makes the
proposed methods transparent and intuitively accessible which supports
interpretation of the outcomes.

Included in the project is problem of ``investigating multivariate modality''.
Different approaches will be considered. One approach is based on a local
fitting procedure, and another is based on some concavity property of a certain
concentration function. Another problem included in this project that admits a
natural formulation in terms of mass concentration is ``measuring volatility or
risk in financial time series'' which is a central problem of stochastic
finance. Regions with high volatility can be interpreted as regions where the
volatility function is highly concentrated. Investigating more than one
explanatory variable simultaneously leads to a nontrivial multivariate problem.
Surprisingly, these quite diverse problems can be treated by closely related
methods. This underlines the usefulness of our methodology whose propagation is
another inherent goal of this project.
