ABSTRACT Kropf Proposal # 0414089&lt;br/&gt;Establishing polarity in eggs and
embryos is fundamental to the development of all organisms, from plants to
animals. The funded research will investigate mechanisms by which fertilized
eggs establish developmental polarity, focusing on formation of a growth axis
and alignment of cell division. In Silvetia compressa, the organism to be
studied, a polar growth axis is established immediately after fertilization, and
this axis provides spatial information to align the first cell division
precisely perpendicular to the growth axis. The cytoskeleton, the physical
framework of a cell, is known to play a central role in cell polarization and
the work will combine cellular, molecular and biochemical approaches to study
the cytoskeleton in developing eggs. In addition, improved techniques aimed at
preserving cellular structure will be used to visualize cellular contents at all
stages of early development. The research is expected to provide deeper insights
into rearrangements of the cytoskeleton that drive cell polarization, and to
identify proteins that regulate these rearrangements. The goal is to obtain an
integrated understanding of how a fertilized egg reorganizes itself to acquire
polarity. Since Silvetia is only distantly related to other organisms in which
cell polarity has been studied in a developmental context, the results will also
provide valuable information concerning the evolution of developmental
mechanisms. Some aspects of cellular polarity are expected to be shared with
distantly related organisms and therefore ancient, while other aspects will be
unique to Silvetia and therefore more recently evolved. The funds will also be
used to provide training for undergraduates, women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
