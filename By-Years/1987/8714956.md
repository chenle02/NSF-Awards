The purpose of this research is to elucidate the relationship of male parental
care and sexual selection in two species of midwife toads (alytes obstetricians
and A. cisternasii, Anura, Discoglossidae). Evidence for partial or total sex
role reversal will be sought through the quantification of intrasexual
competition for mates and mate choice selectivity. The project will involve 1)
Monitoring of natural populations of marked individuals. 2) Laboratory analysis
of caloric content to determine the relative energetic cost of reproduction in
each sex. 3) Laboratory and field observations to determine the intensity of
intrasexual competition for mates in both sexes. 4) Laboratory and field
experiments with synthesized calls to determine selectivity based on acoustical
communication. The comparison of the two species will constitute a unique test
of the hypothesis which states that relative parental investment determines sex
roles and hence determines which sex will be more subject to sexual selection.
The results obtained will permit the discrimination between the effect of male
parental investment on sexual selection and on its outcome.
