This is a multidisciplinary research program for investigating both the
computational principles and the neural mechanisms underlying our visual
perception of three-dimensional (3D) surfaces and shapes in the natural world.
Its goal is to understand how surfaces of objects are inferred and represented
in the brain. The general approach is first to discover the statistical
regularities of patterns and structures in 3D natural scenes and to develop a
computational framework for representing and inferring these structures from
optical images; and second to test neurophysiologically the predictions
generated by the computational framework on the neural basis of surface
representation and inference. The fundamental hypothesis is that the visual
system functions as a hierarchical probabilistic inference system in which the
feedforward and feedback connections among the different visual areas in the
cortical hierarchy serve to mediate two-way Bayesian belief propagation. In this
framework, the brain is conjectured to actively construct a representation of
the visual scene based on the retinal input as well as our prior knowledge and
experience of the world. The investigator will carry out a novel statistical
study of 3D natural scenes, develop efficient probabilistic computational
algorithms for surface inference based on natural scene statistics, explore
neural models for implementing such algorithms, and test neurophysiologically
these models by recording and analyzing neuronal activity in the early visual
areas of primate cerebral cortex. It is a tightly coupled interdisciplinary
project that involves synergistic research in computer vision, computational
neuroscience and systems neuroscience to address fundamental questions in these
three fields. Understanding how the brain makes inference about the visual world
will have a significant broad impact on neuroscience, clinical medicine and
robotics. This integrated study of a hierarchical visual inference system and
its associated probabilistic inference algorithms, rooted in natural scene
statistics, will contribute to the foundation for building a new generation of
flexible and intelligent robotic vision systems. Such systems will be able to
learn and adapt to the statistical regularities of a changing environment and
make inferences based on scene contexts. The proposed research program also
provides an unique educational vehicle of interdisciplinary training to graduate
and undergraduate students that will serve as a catalyst to integrate computer
science research and biological research in the scientific community at
large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
