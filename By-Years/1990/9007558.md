Four argon ion lasers are the primary source of energy for femtosecond laser
research in our laboratories, as well as for numerous instructional graduate
experiments. Each of these lasers have an annual usage in excess of 3,000 hours,
which exceeds the lifetime of these older type laser tubes, predating the metal-
ceramic technology, and therefore, each laser requires an annual tube
replacement. This Research Equipment Grant is for a conversion of the two
spectra physics 171 argon laser to the 2030T-20 metal-ceramic laser head, and
replacement of a smaller laser by a single 2020 5W argon ion laser. These lasers
will continue to be used for pumping femtosecond dye lasers, a parametric
oscillator, and serve as primary source for 9 instructional experiments. The
main thrust of the research is nonlinear optics of thin films and interfaces.
