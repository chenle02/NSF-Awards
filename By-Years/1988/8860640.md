The long range goal of this project is to develop polymer based microcarriers
with novel surfaces which will support the growth of cells otherwise difficult
or impossible to grow in vitro. These supports will be useful in small scale
laboratory cell culture and will be easily adpatable to the large scale, highly
efficient manufacture of cells and other tissue culture products. The proposed
research will allow alteration of the microcarrier surface, independent of its
bulk properties, without the necessity of post-treatment. This will be
accomplished by modifying well- known suspension polymerization techniques to
produce microcarrier beads with the desired surface chemical functionalities. In
addition, the versatility of the supports and their manufacture will enable the
creation of optimal growth surfaces for a wide variety of cells.
