The singularity theorems tell us that singularities form in a large class of
spacetimes, including the physically relevant cases of the big bang and of the
gravitational collapse of a star to form a black hole. However, these theorems
tell us very little about the nature of the singularities. For example, we would
like to know the entire class of incomplete observers, how the curvature behaves
along their world lines and whether they can see the singularity before they hit
it. Since we do not have the general solution of Einstein's equation in closed
form, it is proposed to use all the methods available for the study of
singularities: (i) to find exact solutions and study their singularities, (ii)
to examine, in a general way the behavior of classes of singular spacetimes, or
(iii) to perform a numerical study of spacetimes with singularities to address
these issues. ½¼^¡&ú¼^¼(½
