The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists
universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly
increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority
populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska
Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete
high quality degree programs in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The North Carolina
STEM Alliance (NCSA), led by Central Piedmont Community College, with partners
Forsyth Technical Community College and Guilford Technical Community College
will advance and innovate current practices initiated under the inaugural LSAMP
Bridge to the Baccalaureate (B2B) project. The goal of the alliance, to increase
the number of traditionally underrepresented minority (URM) students who
transfer from the two-year institutions into STEM baccalaureate degree programs,
will be achieved by increasing access and opportunities for these students
through targeted engagement, career exploration, and structured academic
pathways, and by improving retention and student success through research-based
interventions, that include proactive advising, coaching and tutoring for
gateway STEM courses, curriculum alignment, faculty mentoring, academic
workshops, summer bridge programs, and, research and workforce experiences. STEM
focused academics and programs are vital to the workforce need and economic
competitiveness in&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina and maintaining the economic health
of the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data analysis and evaluation will
contribute to continuously enhancing the project activities and provide
opportunities for researching&lt;br/&gt;and evaluating the success of the
program. The project leadership team will disseminate information about the
results of the project, sharing best practices and lessons learned through
participation in national and conferences, higher education networks, website,
and other social media outlets. Finally, the regional nature of the partnership
will allow for continued collaboration and expansion of the URM STEM focused
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
