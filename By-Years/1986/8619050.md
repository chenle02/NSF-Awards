Plate reconstructions and earlier regional geologic, mapping have lead to the
concept that the Tertiary deformation of Spitsbergen's western margin was a
consequence of transcurrent motion during the opening of the Norwegian-Greenland
Sea. This investigation will test the hypothesis that the Paleocene-Eocene
subsidence of the Central Basin in Nordenskioldland is a direct result of
strike-slip tectonics, a result so far only inferred from sedimentological data,
and not yet corroborated by structural evidence. This investigation will include
detailed measurement of micro- and meso-scale geologic structures in Cretaceous
and Paleocene units in western Nordenskioldland. Using innovative
microstructure-analysis techniques which incorporate iterative numerical
computer modelling, the orientations, relative timing, and the relative
magnitudes of the principal axes of the paleostress will be determined thus
documenting paleo-stress fields coeval with the formation of the Central Basin.
