CTS-9413268 Linda P. Cornell University of Toledo ABSTRACT Research will be
performed to optimize the design of a novel Cyclic Diffusional Separation (CDS)
technology and evaluate its potential for separating proteins and other
macromolecules. The CDS process couples transient diffusion with cyclic
convection in order to obtain sharp separations even for species with similar
diffusivities. Proof-of-principle experiments have been successful and
theoretical modeling predicts that design optimization will further improve the
performance. Using a modified apparatus, the hydrodynamic and dispersion
characteristics will be examined, and separation factors measured. If
successful, the technique will be useful for separating delicate chemicals and
biochemicals from colloidal dispersions and macromolecular solutions. There is
potential for significant impact on bioprocessing and environmental technology.
