The Institute for Coastal and Marine Resources at East Carolina University will
acquire components for assembling a modern flow-injection analyzer for precision
analysis of copper and cobalt. These heavy metals have been proven to be
effective tracers for measuring the transport of sediments from rivers, across
estuaries, and into the sea. They are also useful in studying the flux of
materials between the water-sediment interface. Understanding these exchange
processes has bearing on ecological and geological investigations. Cobalt and
copper concentrations will be measured using analytical methods newly developed
for making seawater analyses. The techniques involve chemoluminescence detection
of metal-catalyzed reactions using flow injection analysis. These new methods
provide greater sensitivity and productivity than earlier methods. The
instrumentation will provide a new capability for studying the behavior of
copper and cobalt in natural waters.
