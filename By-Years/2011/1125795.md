Speech is, in many respects, a socially constructed behavior, a fact which has
important policy as well as scientific implications since a range of public
policies affect the degree of racial and economic segregation found in all
aspects of American life. Previous research in sociolinguistics has documented
substantial variation in language patterns across social class lines, and across
neighborhoods of different socio-economic and racial compositions as well.
However it is important to note that this observed variation in language
patterns across neighborhoods need not reflect the causal influences of
neighborhood environments themselves. Many families have at least some degree of
choice about where they live. Neighborhood attributes could be correlated with
speech patterns simply because certain types of families wind up selecting to
live (or being selected by housing agencies to live) in particular
neighborhoods. This study offers a rare opportunity to understand the causal
effects of neighborhood social environments on speech through the inclusion of
speech and language measures as part of the large-scale data collection carried
out for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Moving to
Opportunity (MTO) residential mobility experiment. Between 1994 and 1998, MTO
enrolled a sample of low-income African-American and Latino families living in
public housing and randomly assigned the chance to use a housing voucher to move
to lower-poverty areas, while others received no additional mobility assistance.
Speech measures were collected as part of the 10-15 year follow-up study of MTO
adults and youth. In the current project, sociolinguist John R. Rickford of
Stanford and economist Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago will explore the
linguistic correlates of HUD's large-scale social experiment. The findings could
inform our understanding of the long-term effects of geographic dislocation on
displaced populations.
