This project builds upon an existing program for research by undergraduates. It
will now provide opportunities to involve students that are now attending other
schools in the Philadelphia area. The research areas that are available for
student involvement encompass the entire range of mechanical engineering and
mechanics research programs that are underway or pending at the university, such
as heat transfer, fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and dymanic systems and
control.
