Travel assistance is provided to U.S. participants with accepted contributions
at the U.K. Symposium: "Fluid Mechanics is the spirit of G. I. Taylor." The
spirit of this symposium is to re-emphasize how simple theoretical analyses and
imaginative experiments can result in results of fundamental significance and
wide applicability, even in the current age of highly complex tools of analysis.
