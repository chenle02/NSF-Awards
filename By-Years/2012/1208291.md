This project will support NSF funded research programs by providing a safe,
efficient and economical platform for studies conducted aboard R/V Blue Heron
within the Great Lakes. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and in
CY2012, 38 days out of 70 will be used to support NSF sponsored research. For
each year of the cooperative agreement, funding is dependent upon the number of
days deployed on NSF research, and budgets are re-negotiated accordingly. The
intellectual merit of the research programs being supported on R/V Blue Heron
has been determined through review of those proposals. Although the Great Lakes
dominate the northern boundary of the United States and constitute 20% of the
world's freshwater, our understanding of these water bodies is limited.
