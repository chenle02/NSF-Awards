9312834 Roark The Chemistry Department of the University of Nebraska at Kearney
has a strong tradition of research experiences for undergraduates. Several newly
appointed faculty members have a particular commitment to enlisting their
undergraduate students as collaborators in their research programs.
Unfortunately, the Chemistry Department's building does not provide adequate
facilities for research and research training. To correct this problem, the
university administration will convert part of the general chemistry laboratory
space into facilities for faculty and student research. Expanding the chemistry
research facilities at the University of Nebraska at Kearney will make several
significant contributions: 1) providing adequate environments for research
equipment, 2) enabling research by recently hired young investigators, 3)
promoting joint student-faculty research projects, and 4) attracting
undergraduate students to careers in science. ***
