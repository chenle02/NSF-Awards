The PIs propose to: (1) determine Pb, Sr, and Nd isotopes on the geochemically
well-characterized samples from their reconnaissance study, (2) collect
additional samples on Lanai from thicker sections of lava, and collect glass
from dikes, (3) analyze these additional samples for major and trace elements,
and selected samples for isotopic compositions, and (4) analyze selected samples
from the reconnaissance study and from additional field work for mineral
chemistry. Samples from a thick stratigraphic section will allow examination of
the temporal, geochemical and isotopic evolution of Lanai.
