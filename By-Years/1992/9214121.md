9214121 Sturmfels This award will support a joint U.S.-Italian workshop on the
theoretical and computational aspects of Hilbert functions, organized by Bernd
Sturmfels, Cornell University, and Lorenzo Robbiano, University of Genoa, Italy.
The objective of this binational workshop will be to advance this subject area
through discussion and comparison of the different aspects of Hilbert functions
by a small number of selected participants. There will be 25 workshop
participants, ten of which will be Italians, as well as ten graduate students
and postdoctorate fellows from Cornell and other U.S. institutions. Important
open problems in the theory of Hilbert functions will be addressed, including
the structure of zero-dimensional schemes, algorithms for computing Hilbert
functions and finite free resolutions, Hilbert functions of algebras with
special structural properties, and combinatorial methods and polyhedral
invariants of projective varieties. The participants' papers will be published
in a well-established monograph series. ***
