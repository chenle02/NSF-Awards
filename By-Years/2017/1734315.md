The goal of this project is to explore a new method for generating high quality
electron beams. High quality electron beams are needed for many applications
such as electron microscopy, free electron lasers and high-energy colliders. One
measure of quality of an electron beam is its emittance. This is because a small
emittance beam can be focused to a very small spot size, desirable in these
applications. This project will explore generation of extremely low emittance
electron beams using three-dimensional simulations of a new electron
acceleration scheme that takes advantage of the ability to control particle
density in a Plasma-Based Accelerator.

It is now well established that Plasma-Based Accelerators (PBAs) are capable of
self-generating ultra-relativistic electron bunches that contain a significant
amount of charge, have a short duration, and a low normalized emittance. These
beam quantities are often combined into a single figure of merit called the
normalized beam brightness. Ultra-high brightness beams are needed in
accelerator-based X-ray light sources. While PBA experiments have produced
useful beams, they have not yet produced beams with the necessary brightness and
energy spread needed to drive an X-ray free-electron-laser, nor the charge and
emittance needed as an injector for a future linear collider. This project will
explore the acceleration of electrons across a sharp density downramp in a
plasma through theory and computer simulations, and through an experiment that
will be carried out at the FACET II facility at SLAC.
