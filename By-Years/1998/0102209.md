This proposal requests funding for carrying out two concurrently operating
Conferences. One Conference addresses experimental QCD and high energy
interaction topics. The topics of current interests are: Higgs boson searches,
heavy flavor physics, search for particles beyond the Standard Model, QCD
properties of W and Z production, low x physics and diffraction, heavy ion
physics, and new trends in physics.

The other Conference deals with electroweak interactions and unified theories.
The subjects are: Standard Model tests, searches for the Higgs boson, Heavy
flavor physics, CP violation, Neutrino physics and search for neutrino
oscillations, theories beyond the Standard Model.
