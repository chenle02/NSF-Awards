Recent success in preparing carbonyl complexes of palladium in the cages of
sodium zeolite-Y using a "ship-in-a-bottle" technique potentially offers new
catalytic processes exploiting both geometric and electronic properties of the
zeolite. In this work, palladium catalysts on zeolite-Y are prepared, including
some that are highly dispersed and some containing palladium clusters. These are
characterized using, among other techniques, extend X-ray absorption fine
structure, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed
reaction, and temperature-programmed desorption. The exchangeability of carbon
monoxide in gaseous, adsorbed, and ligand forms is determined using infrared
spectroscopy and temperature-programmed isotope exchange. Catalytic activity for
methanol synthesis, neopentance conversion, and related reactions are measured.
The new class of catalysts investigated in this work is potentially
revolutionary. It should offer types of selectivity not available with catalysts
presently in use for a number of industrial processes. At present, it is
difficult to predict how the activities of these new systems compare to those of
older catalysts, but this effort should go a long way toward answering that.
