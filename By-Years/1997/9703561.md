9703561 Rahaman The proposed research will investigate the toughening of
mullite, Al6Si2O13, by an in situ approach, in which the microstructure of a
monolithic material is modified by a controlled heat treatment to produce a
morphology of elongated, plate-like grains. This approach has been shown to
result in a significant enhancement of the fracture toughness of silicon nitride
and silicon carbide ceramics. However, it has not been applied in any systematic
manner to the toughening of oxide ceramics. Mullite is an ideal material for
this type of toughening, as it is a single phase oxide that is prone to the
growth of elongated grains. The controlled heat treatment will allow the
development of a microstructure of elongated, plate-like grains and control of
the grain boundary chemistry. Dense, single phase mullite, fabricated by hot
pressing below ~1600 C, will be heated above 1700 C, which is in the two phase
region (mullite and liquid), where elongated grain growth is promoted. The grain
growth kinetics will be measured at diffepent temperatures to achieve an
understanding of the microstructure evolution. Oxide additives such as yttria,
added to the mullite powder prior to densification, will be used to control the
chemistry of the grain boundary phase. The microstructure and microchemistry of
the fabricated materials will be characterized by a variety of optical,
diffraction, microscopy, and spectrographic techniques. The modulus of rupture
and fracture toughness of the mullite will be measured at room temperature by
four-point bending of beams sectioned from the hot pressed discs. The effects of
the microstructure and the grain boundary chemistry on the these mechanical
properties will be determined. The data will be used to determine the processing
conditions to produce a microstructure with optimum modulus of rupture and
fracture toughness at room temperature. %%% The ability to significantly improve
the toughness of mullite will enhance it s reliability in current applications
in the ceramics industry and its attractiveness for future applications in the
advanced structural ceramics sector. Furthermore, because of the relative
simplicity of the system (e.g., mullite is a single phase oxide with no known
phase transformations), mullite can provide a model oxide system for
understanding the microstructure evolution and property optimization by the in
situ toughening approach. In this way, it can form a model system for future
application of the in situ approach to other oxide ceramics. ***
