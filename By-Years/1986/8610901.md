This research program will investigate the behavior of friction piles when
subjected to cyclic loading in both the vertical and the lateral direction.
Specifically, the program will involve: (1) full-scale cyclic load tests in
Mexico City clay of a three-pile group and of two single piles with amplitudes
chosen to represent the loading history experienced by pile foundations during
the September 19, 1985 earthquake; (2) cyclic pressuremeter tests at the site of
these load tests to evaluate the in-situ behavior of the clay foundation
material under these conditions; and (3) cyclic vertical model pile tests in a
controlled laboratory environment, using a rod shear device developed at UCLA,
so as to evaluate the soil-pile interface behavior.
