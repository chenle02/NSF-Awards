This award supports the participation of ten US scientists in a US-South Africa
Workshop on Bacterial Wilt Disease, to be held in White River, South Africa, in
February 2002. The co-organizers are Caitilyn Allen, University of Wisconsin,
and Jody Terblance and Gerrit Prinsloo, Institute for Industrial Corps, South
African Agricultural Research Council. The workshop is being held in conjunction
with the Third International Symposium on Bacterial Wilt Disease, which is
scheduled for February 4-8, 2002. Three graduate students and one postdoctoral
fellow are among the US participants.

Bacterial wilt disease attacks many cash and subsistence crops in the tropics
and subtropics, including tomatoes, potatoes, bananas, plantains, peanuts, and
tobacco. The pathogen responsible for bacterial wilt is a soilborne bacterium,
Ralstonia solanacearum. Because of its geographic distribution, the disease has
received relatively little attention from researchers in Europe and North
America, even as it causes devastating crop losses each year in the developing
world. The goals of the workshop are to establish common areas of interest among
US and South African researchers, design collaborative projects, identify and
prioritize the most pressing issues currently confronting bacterial wilt
researchers in these regions, and develop procedures for exchanging scientific
materials necessary for effective bacterial wilt research.
