The need for faculty of all Computer Science Programs to attend an annual
conference addressing the current trends of research and education in Computer
Science is emphasized in the document on accreditation of Computer Science
Programs published by the Computer Science Accreditation Board (CSAB). In
particular minority institutions need to keep abreast of these concepts to
assist their graduates in becoming leaders in the profession. Many faculty of
these institutions do not have the opportunity to attend the Computer Science
conference and SIGCSE Symposium due to lack of funds and a lack of understanding
of the purpose of this annual event. More involvement of these faculty in this
week of Computer Science activities will provide them with background for
encouraging their students to pursue graduate studies and careers in computer
related positions. Travel support for approximately 28 computer science faculty
from minority institutions will be provide to attend CSC'90 and SIGCSE'90 in
Washington, DC, February 22 + 23, 1990.
