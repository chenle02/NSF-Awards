A new symmetrization method for the numerical solution of partial differential
equations on emerging parallel computers will be studied. The algorithmic
development of the method in the context of massive parallelization will be
emphasized. The method of symmetrization is attractive for an elliptic partial
differential operator, A=S+BT in that it transforms the problem in A to one in
an operator that is self-adjoint and that closely resembles S, the self-adjoint
part. Thus, by invoking symmetry even for nonself-adjoint problems, it allows
the use of efficient and robust versions of multilevel and conjugate gradient
algorithms for the solution of the arising linear systems of equations. The use
of multilevel and conjugate gradient algorithms in the implementation of the
method on a parallel computer will provide the opportunity to study
parallelization in a context where a multilevel algorithm itself is used as in
inner solver for an algorithm composed of inner and outer iterations. The
algorithms will be tested in a massively parallel environment offered by the
Connection Machine.
