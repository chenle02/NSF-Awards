A comprehensive redesign of the piston-cylinder apparatus has enabled the PI to
reach pressures of at least 8 GPa. The new capabilities will be exploited by
experiments in three areas: 1. An accurate phase diagram in the Mg2SiO4 -
Fe2SiO4 system 2. It has been predicted that the site environment of Si and A1
in silicate liquids changes as a function of pressure. The extended range piston
cylinder is capable of reaching the pressures at which these changes have been
predicted to occur, and run products can be analyzed by MASS NMR. This should
greatly improve our understanding of magma visosities and densities. 3.
Calibration of two well-known geobarometers will be carried out in the
appropriate pressure range. All of these studies will enhance our understanding
of the environment in the mantle and of how magma is generated in the mantle.
