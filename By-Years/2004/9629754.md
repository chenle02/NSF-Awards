This project addresses problems in the areas of object- oriented programming
languages and software security. The goals are to simplify the structure and
process of producing software systems and increase their resistance to certain
forms of insecurity. The techniques are both analytical, drawing on ideas from
type theory and mathematical logic, and experimental, involving the
implementation of language designs and experimental development of prototype
systems. One main focus of the work is the design and implementation of an
extension of Standard ML with object-oriented features. Similar language ideas
are also considered for C++ or Java variants or design or debugging tools. An
experimental evaluation of either language may involve design or redesign of
existing software in order to improve its security properties. This might
involve network servers such as ftp or http, or an interpreter for a network
scripting language. Both the science of software production and software
security are considered important areas, with increasing concern for security
likely to lead to increasing interest in relevant software analysis methods. ***
