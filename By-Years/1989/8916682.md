An unanswered ecological/paleocological question is "What is the relation
between shelled animals living in soft-sediment benthic communities and the co-
occurring (generally soft-bodied, mobile) infauna, and how this relationship
changed through the Phanerozoic?" One possible, but largely untested, mechanism
linking shelled and soft-bodied organisms is taphonomic inhibition), in which
accumulation of dead hardparts negatively affects living animals. The goals of
the project are to determine the impact of shell layers on an infaunal community
inhabiting a modern sandflat and to evaluate whether or not shell layers exerted
control over Ordovician infaunal animals. The project proposes a reasonable
hypothesis for a possible interaction between shelled and soft-bodied animals,
one that is testable in both modern and ancient communities. Shell layer
inhibition of burrowing may help explain the typically disparate distribution of
body and trace fossils, and may have been important in structuring soft-sediment
benthic communities throughout the Phanerozoic.
