This three-year project will survey and document the scarcely known fishes
inhabiting the deep, principal channels of the Brazilian Amazon. Aquatic
invertebrates and fish parasites will also be sampled. The project will also
determine the large scale and local scale distribution of fish species and
correlate these geographic patterns with environmental factors. The collection
data will become part of NEODAT, an on-line database of neotropical fish
biodiversity. This documentation of Amazonian deep channel fishes and their
distribution is essential for monitoring biotic change and for planning
fisheries management and conservation along the Amazon. The project will deposit
research and teaching collections of fishes and associated tissues in Brazilian
and US institutions for voucher records, future studies and the training of
students. Collaborating Brazilian institutions/scientists include: (1) the
Brazilian government funding agency, CNPq; (2) two ichthyologists from the Museu
de Zoologia and the Universidade de Sao Paulo, and two fish ecologist at Museu
Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belem; (3) one masters student and two doctoral
students, one of which is currently completing her PhD with the PI at Arizona;
(4) and INPA researcher with a CNPq scholarship; and (5) five postdoctoral
students who will receive research training at the University of Arizona in
addition to being part of the on-site research team. Other collaborators include
researchers in the US (University of Washington), Venezuela (Universidad Central
de Venezuela), France (ORSTROM) and Germany (Max Planck Institute). %%% This
project will document the deep water fishes the Amazon River, Brazil and the
mouths of its major tributaries. The results will become part of a national fish
biodiversity database and will be critical to planning fisheries management and
conservation for the Amazon region. The project includes training of Brazilian
and US students in the field as well as the laboratory in the most modern
methods of fish sampling and biodiversity research.
