This travel grant is to provide partial funding for a group of US engineers and
scientists attend the NICOM3 conference to be held in Prague, Czech Republic on
May 31 - June 2, 2009. This is the 3rd International Symposium on Nanotechnology
in Construction. The last of these conferences was held in Bilbao, Spain in
November, 2005. This will be the third in this series of conferences, held every
few years. For the NICOM2 conference in Bilbao, the NSF supported the attendance
of a number of US engineers and scientists to permit them to gain exposure to
the extensive applications of nanotechnology in construction materials being
performed in Europe and the rest of the world. In addition to the attendance of
numerous engineers and scientists working in the field, there are also numerous
companies in concrete-related industries that are in attendance. A diverse group
of participants has been nominated for selection that have experience in
nanotechnology and, in many cases, are relatively new to this area of research,
so that they can particularly benefit from exposure to engineers and scientists
who are strongly involved in current advances in nanotechnology.
