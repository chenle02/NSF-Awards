As a particiant in the Antarctic Artists & Writers Program, the Principal
Investigator, a poet, proposes to spend time with three separate Antarctic field
teams in the McMurdo Station region to study the symbiosis between animals and
the scientists who study them, then interpreting these relationships into poetry
that she intends to publish in nationally recognized publications.
