9450208 Miller High quality assessment and evaluation mechanisms to monitor the
outcomes of science education reform at the high school level on a continual
basis are needed for both internal and external use. Teachers, school
administrators, university and college faculty, parents and students need to
accept these assessments as valid measures of both quality and quantity of
science learning and achievement. Three Golden State Examinations in Science
(Biology, Chemistry, and Coordinated Science) have been developed and
implemented on a broad scale on California high schools. This study aims to use
these examinations, the students taking them, and the teachers teaching those
students as basis to begin to establish the parameters and methodologies that
can be most efficiently used in future large scale efforts to monitor secondary
school science reforms. The study will focus (though not exclusively) on the
schools working with the state Scope, and Sequence and Coordination (SS&amp;C)
project reforms. The Golden State Examination development and implementation has
been a collaborative effort of school science teachers and college science
faculty. This teamwork has been a valuable professional development opportunity
for several hundred science teachers, involved in various facets of the
examination, such as development committees, scoring teams, portfolio judges,
and as workshop leaders. This study will add a research component to this
evaluation design and data analysis among core groups of these teachers. The
majority of those involved will be from schools heavily involved in implementing
high quality coordinated or integrated science from all students, which is the
platform of California's SS&amp;C project. These teachers will design surveys to
monitor attitudes and pathways of learning of students, and progressive subject
matter tests, will score essays, performance tasks, and portfolios, and will
analyze results to make recommendations for future assessmen t and evaluation
implementation efforts.
