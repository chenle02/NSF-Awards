Professor Semmes' research project will cover two areas. The first deals with
harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. It is concerned with certain
quantitative notions of rectifiability and their relationship to boundedness of
singular integral operators. The second area deals with generalized Riemann
mappings in several complex variables. The goal is to find classes of mappings
defined by conditions much weaker than the requirement of being biholomorphic,
so that there is a reasonable existence theory, but in such a way that these
mappings reflect a large part of the complex structure. Professor Semmes'
research in harmonic analysis involves the study of certain kinds of functions
on infinite dimensional spaces that arise, for example, in the study of the
boundary value problems of mathematical physics. His study of generalized
Riemann mapping functions is an attempt to better understand the geometry of
functions of many complex variables, a subject infinitely more complicated than
the theory of one complex variable.
