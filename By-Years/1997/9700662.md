1 9700662 Lee This project involves a systematic exploration of the molecular
basis for wetting, adhesion and friction in fluorinated organic thin films, with
an emphasis on the development of new types of mixed hydrocarbon/fluorocarbon-
based materials. There are three research thrusts: (1) the synthesis of several
new types of alkanethiols for the purpose of assembling structurally and
chemically well defined hydrocarbon/fluorocarcon thin films; (2) structural
characterization of the newly generated thin films; (3) a thorough examination
of the properties of wetting, adhesion, and friction in these systems. %%% A
thorough understanding of the relationships between surface
structure/composition and interfacial properties, this research will pave the
way for designing new and better fluorinated interfaces for use in a wide
variety of technologies ranging from biomedical implants to information storage
and retrieval. ***
