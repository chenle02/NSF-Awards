The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the
development of a novel smartphone-based detection technology to assist in
physical analysis of the human body, with applications for the medical, retail,
or athletic sectors. Currently, fit-related problems are addressed primarily in
a manual, labor-intensive process. Our innovation provides a small, portable,
affordable, and sustainable solution in finding the optimal fit in a timely and
cost-effective manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will develop
an integrated system to estimate the human body shape for medical and retail
applications. This innovation has a unique combination of a sensor technology,
image processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms to integrate fit-
related data with merchandise information. The proposed device measures a
subject’s fit using a smartphone camera, detects the body shape from the
measurement using image processing techniques, and presents a subject with the
merchandise that fits using machine learning techniques. Moreover, the
innovation also integrates a subject’s biomedical information to personalize
fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
