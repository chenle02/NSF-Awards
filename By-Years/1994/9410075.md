ABSTRACT Jeffrey Marshall CTS-9410075 The Iowa State Institute of Hydraulic
Research at the University of Iowa will purchase a Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV) system, which will be dedicated to support research in fluid mechanics and
hydraulic engineering. The PIV system will be used for the following research
project: (1) a study of the cutting of a columnar vortex be a blade and the
subsequent response of the vortex, which includes propagation of a traveling
vortex breakdown away from the blade, (2) a study of the secondary vortex
structure which forms about the core region of a turbulent cortex, (3) a study
of the dynamics and chaotic breakup of vortices in stably stratified quasi-
geostrophic flows and (4) a study of the formation of vortices in hydraulic
intake systems. In addition to these specific research projects, the PIV system
will enhance the general research capabilities with a semi-global measurement of
fluid flows, which will provide a complement to the single-point measurement
instrumentation presently in use. ***
