Each year windthrown trees produce millions of dollars in damages to structures,
lifelines, and vehicles. In hurricanes or tornadoes this type of debris may even
cause injury and death. This work will investigate mitigation procedures by
coupling the results from research on tree loading and response to blast waves
with natural wind field model. The combined effect of tree and direct wind
damage will be studied as well as the effects of tree removal resulting in more
exposed structures versus the risk of tree- related damage. Risk reduction
techniques such as root reinforcement, tree crown reduction, and selection of
wind resistant species will be examined in the context of new and existing urban
and suburban developments. The benefits from this work could be substantive to
the population of a big portion of the United States subjected every year to
extreme wind episodes.
