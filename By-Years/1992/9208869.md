This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Charles F. Wilcox and Simon H. Bauer at Cornell University. The ability of the
"temperature drift technique" to measure the concentrations and energetics of
transition structures will be explored. Quantum and molecular mechanics
calculations will provide the information needed to identify the vibrational
bands produced by the transient species formed in the reaction. Fluxional
interconversions involving degenerate sigmatropic rearrangements, for which a
range of activation energies have been determined, will be examined. %%% Studies
designed to directly observed molecules which are high in energy and
structurally intermediate between starting materials and products will be
conducted. Molecules which react thermally to form products will be subjected to
very short duration high temperature pulses. The ability of the resultant
activated material to absorb radiation as it drifts down in temperature will be
monitored. This new previously unavailable data will greatly increase our
ability to understand how molecules interconvert.
