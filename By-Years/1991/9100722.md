Professor James N. Demas and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Virginia are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. During the summer of 1991, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Some of the projects involve environmental weathering,
membrane proteins, organic synthesis and molecular modeling. Students will
participate in weekly research group meetings, seminars and field trips, prepare
a final written report, and make an oral presentation at a minisymposium at the
end of the program. Faculty members from each student's home institution will be
invited to the symposium.
