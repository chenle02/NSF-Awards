abstract 9554135 Weissglass This is a 4-year Local Systemic Change project at
$2,249,778 to enhance 750 K-8 teachers in 35 schools from Oxnard and Ventura,
California school districts. The enhancement is focused on California Framework-
based mathematics and instruction. Districts will adopt comprehensive Framework-
focused instructional materials based on pilot use of materials prior to the
adoption. Elementary school teachers will receive 22 days (132 hours) of
enhancement over the 4 years of the project. Middle school teachers' 12 days of
enhancement will build on current work in the Mathematics Renaissance project
(California SSI). School/family partnerships will be a thrust of this effort
with teachers conducting programs with parents in their own schools. Helping
teachers improve the understanding of and interest in mathematics of students
from underrepresented groups will be an important component. District-based
cost-sharing of $859,188.
