This award supports the Eastern Illinois Integrated Conference in Geometry,
Dynamics, and Topology, which will occur the weekend of April 15-17, 2016, at
Eastern Illinois University. This conference is integrated in the sense that it
draws participants at every stage of their mathematical careers, with particular
focus on both early-career graduate students and undergraduates. A meeting of
this type brings together researchers from the academically young to the well-
established, yet offers a more narrow research focus than is typically found at
undergraduate-inclusive conferences. This narrow focus serves to promote more
meaningful contact in the context of mathematical research. The conference is
intended to fuel young mathematicians' interest in research mathematics, promote
inter- and intra-generational research ties, and demonstrate how undergraduates
can be incorporated into research programs in these fields.

Three established speakers and three early-career speakers are invited by the
organizing committee; these speakers are chosen both for their eminence in their
respective fields and their ability to provide meaningful introductions to
complex topics for audiences with a wide range of mathematical backgrounds.
Invitations for submissions by graduate students and undergraduate students will
be issued in mid-February. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-
specific committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6
graduate students and between 12 and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make
presentations, either as talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks
and poster sessions, the conference provides opportunities for less formal
interaction, including social events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our
increased focus on incorporating undergraduates into professional life includes
panel discussions from funded graduate students and early-career mathematicians
covering important but seldom-discussed aspects of attending graduate school and
pursuing an academic career in mathematics.
