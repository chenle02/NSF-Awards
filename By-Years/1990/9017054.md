This grant funds the development of electrical models of the interconnections in
Multichip Modules (MCMs) that are useful at Gigahertz frequencies. At these
frequencies the interconnections have a significant if not dominant effect. MCMs
are the next generation packaging technique. Better MCM models are needed to
exploit the opportunities that MCMs offer for essential enhancements in the
performance of both analog and digital electronics. The models will be obtained
from experimental, analytical, and simulation studies. The outcome will be
tables with routines for interpolation that can be imbedded in MCM design rules
and invoked by separate MCM CAD tools.
