The Department of Life Sciences at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, a
Hispanic serving institution, established the Scholarships To Enhance Life
Sciences (STELS) program to assist academically talented, but financially needy
life science majors, to successfully complete their baccalaureate degrees. The
program offers 15 new and/or continuing scholarships annually to second semester
freshmen and first semester sophomores. STELS goals are to: &lt;br/&gt; -
increase the quantity, quality, diversity and retention of undergraduate
students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in life sciences; &lt;br/&gt; - increase
matriculation into graduate school; and &lt;br/&gt; - increase the quality of
students entering the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve these
goals for life sciences majors, STELS provides scholarships to fulfill the
scholarship recipients' unmet financial needs; integrates student support
services into STELS activities; presents professional development opportunities
to STELS students; encourages interactions between STELS students and students
in other scholarship programs; and builds a community for the cohorts of STELS
scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment strategies include brochures,
announcements at freshman orientation, and advising sessions and class visits.
In addition, targeted recruitment occurs through (a) a First Year Learning
Community (FYLC) program which helps students make successful academic and
social transitions from high school to the University, and (b) the Honors
Program which offers enriched plans of study to highly motivated students who
have the ability to excel academically and the desire to develop global
perspectives.
