This award supports a study to develop the numerical modeling techniques
necessary to infer past surface temperatures from temperature profiles measured
in ice core boreholes. Control theory, a branch of applied mathematics will be
used to recover this information. Once the techniques are developed and
adequately tested on data from the Dye 3 borehole, these methods will be applied
to the temperature data to be obtained from the GISP2 borehole at Summit,
Greenland. This work will help to provide an independent check on
interpretations of isotopic signals measured in ice cores.
