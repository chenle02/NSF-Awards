Deino With National Science Foundation support the Berkeley Geochronology Center
(BGC) will continue to develop the technique of 40Ar/39Ar dating and apply this
technique to a series of significant paleoanthropological sites. The facilities
include two fully automated laser-mass spectrometer systems with single- crystal
40Ar/39Ar dating capability which enables the analytically precise and
geologically accurate dating of sub- milligram single volcanic crystals from
multi-age component samples such as tuffaceous sediments. The laboratory has
also added a system which can be tailored to date young or altered volcanic
materials. Argon dating is extremely important to paleoanthropologists because
it can be used over almost the entire last 6 million years; this is the period
when hominids emerged and developed. Many significant archaeological and
paleontological sites are located in volcanic regions such as Eastern Africa and
contain sediments which can be dated by this technique. The BGC has collaborated
with researchers at a number of sites in Africa, Europe and Asia, and with NSF
support such projects will be continued and expanded.
