9422208 Hallock This proposal has four major points of emphasis: (1) To continue
nuclear magnetic resonance and third sound studies of the helium3- helium4
mixture film system, specifically to study the strong effect on the helium3 of
the helium4 film thickness with analogy with metal insulator transitions in 2D
electron systems, and to search for transitions to new superfluid helium3
behavior which have been predicted. (2) To continue experiments with helium
films on alkali metal surfaces in order to study wetting phenomena. (3) To study
in more detail capillary condensation and avalanche phenomena with helium in
porous materials. (4) To continue to study helium films patterned substrates in
one and two dimensions. (5) To study linear and nonlinear behavior of third
sound pulses in collision. The techniques used will include nuclear magnetic
resonance, bolometric and quartz resonance and capacitance measurements. These
experiments will develop our understanding of the helium film system and have
impact more widely in Condensed Matter Physics. %%% This program will undertake
a fundamental investigations of thin films of liquid helium which form on
surfaces at extremely low temperatures. These films, which can be a few atoms
thick, have remarkable properties and allow the study of physics in two
dimensions which have implications for physics in other areas of Condensed
Matter Physics. The emphasis will be on studies of mixtures of the two types of
helium in which new types of superfluid behavior will be searched for. Analogies
with metal insulator transitions will be explored. Peculiar wetting behavior
between helium and certain unusual surfaces will be investigated. Capillary
condensation and other phenomena in porous materials flooded with helium will be
studied. The program will also investigate the interaction between microscopic
waves on helium films and between such waves and th e surface on which they
reside. ***
