This award provides partial support for an International Symposium on the 4th
Family of Quarks and Leptons (Santa Monica, California on February 23-25, 1989).
This is the second symposium in a series dedicated to this subject. The
symposium will provide a forum for discussion of the theoretical arguments for
the possibility that a 4th generation of quarks and leptons exist. It will
consider the implication of this 4th generation of particles for CP violation in
K decays, for B physics, for rare B decays and for rare B searches at CESR, the
Tevatron, the SLC and also at the SSC.
