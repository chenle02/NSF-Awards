This US-Polish Joint Fund project between Dr. Zbigniew Jedlinski of the
Institute of Polymer Chemistry and Dr. Robert Lenz of the University of
Massachusetts will focus on the synthesis of polymers which are both
biodegradable and bioresorbable. The researchers' primary objective is to
investigate and develop new polymers. The type of polymeric materials that they
will study are important for biomedical materials in traumatology, surgery and
pharmacology. Biodegradable plastics are expected to become increasingly
important as one solution to the growing problem of the waste disposal of
plastics. This project in polymer chemistry fulfills the program objectives of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and
Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
