THE FOUNDATIONS OF ASSESSMENT: RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING Good
teachers and good learners may be born, but they cannot reach their potential,
or anything close to it, without a deep understanding of the learning processes
and how they can be enhanced. Herbert Simon "The Sciences of Science Learning, "
NRC Conference, September 6, 1996 Classroom pedagogy takes place in a complex
ecology of beliefs and values, held differently and in different ways by pupils,
parents, teachers, and administrators. The systemic approach to refortn is
becoming common because it recognizes and responds to this complexity ... Paul
Black and Myron Atkin, Changing the Subject: Innovations in Science. Mathemancs
and Technolog Education 1996. OVERVIEW Proposed Study Objectives This revised
proposal outlines a project designed to (i) synthesize and advance the
scientific foundations of assessment, (ii) monitor trends in science and
mathematics assessment in the U.S., and (i ii) improve public understanding of
the purposes and meanings of assessment and test scores. These three connected
activities reflect a particular vision: of an applied science of assessment that
derives principles from basic science and builds on systematic analysis of human
learning processes in specific content areas. At the core of this study is the
recognition that advances in the science of human learning over the last two or
three decades provide a powerful scientific foundation for 97-CBASSE-266-01
