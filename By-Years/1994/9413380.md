In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. H.S. Gutowsky of the Chemistry Department of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign will engage in a series of continuing investigations on the
structure and dynamics of weakly bound, van der Waals and hydrogen bonded,
molecular complexes. The technique employs a gas mixture cooled to near zero
kelvins by a supersonic expansion into a high vacuum and studied by pulsed
Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. Specifically, complexes containing
benzene dimers, complexes formed by rare gas atoms with hydrogen cyanide, and
those formed by argon with water will be investigated. In addition, ongoing work
on alkali halide dimer complexes will be continued. Weakly bound clusters are an
intermediate form of matter that form when gaseous molecules condense to form
liquids or solids. The structure and dynamics of such clusters is of interest
for obtaing an understanding of intermolecular forces on a molecular level, for
understanding of protein folding, the orientation and mobility of molecules on
catalytic surfaces, and other phenomena. The research conducted by the PI
provides critical data and models for the bonding of molecules by weak
intermolecular forces.
