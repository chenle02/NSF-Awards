We PI proposes a symposium over the course of one year, to be held at the
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, that brings together a select group of
seminal thinkers in symbolic cognition in undergraduate and high school
mathematics, for the purpose of establishing a research agenda in this new line
of inquiry in Algebra. Symbolic cognition in mathematics is concerned with the
evolution and use of mathematical symbols, especially their practical side - the
specific cognitive and communicative roles that symbols play in helping people
to do mathematics and learners to learn undergraduate mathematics. The major
impact of these meetings will affect university teachers of introductory
mathematics, high school mathematics teachers and researchers in mathematics
education.
