This research covers the following five areas: a) Cold rolling of polymers and
their blends: In this area the main research is concentrated in understanding
the deformation fields in rolling and characterization of structures developed
in compatible and incompatible polymer blends. b) Forging of polymer powders and
their mixtures with other polymers and/or low melting metals: Forging process
allows the production of composite parts out of materials with widely varying
thermal-deformation characteristics which is normally not possible in standard
melt processing operations. c) Optical properties of polymer films: The main
area of interest is to investigate the optical properties (i.e. refractive
indices) as a function of film processing conditions. d) Effect of polymeric
substrate surface characteristics on the growth behavior of vacuum deposited
metals: The effect of surface roughness, crystallographic orientation and
crystallinity in polymer substrate on the growth behavior of silver metal is
currently being investigated. e) Welding of Plastics: The goal of this area is
to investigate the processing-structure-property relationships in spin,
vibration and ultrasonic welding of plastics.
