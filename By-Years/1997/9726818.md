This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research on the
phylogenetic relationships of ichnoviruses and a new family of insect pathogenic
viruses known as ascoviruses. The similarities between these two viruses suggest
these groups may share a common ancestor. The studies involve the research
groups of Brian Federici of the University of California, Riverside, and the
group of G. Periquet and Y. Bigot at the University of Tours, France. Both
research groups are the discoverers of two subfamilies of ascoviruses. They
propose to determine (1) the genomic organization and structure of genomes
through genomic sequencing; (2) the gene sequences of key viral proteins; and
(3) the relationship of ascoviruses with other large double-stranded DNA viruses
such as entompoxviruses and baculoviruses. The US investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in the fields of insect pathology and molecular
virology. This is complemented by French expertise in insect genetics and
molecular biology. This joint project will advance understanding of these two
groups of insect viruses and their origins.
