Abstract DBI-9729600 An isotope-ratio mass spectrometer for research in the
fields of Ecology and Environmental Biology at Northern Arizona University will
be purchased. This instrument will be used by 15 faculty members in 5 different
departments to address questions such as tracing energy flow through food webs,
determing the fate of environmental contaminants (e.g., runoff of fertilizer
from agriculture into aquatic ecosystems), measuring the efficiency with which
plants use water, identifying the sources of water to riparian vegetation, and
measuring turnover of nitrogen and carbon in terrestrial ecosystems,
particularly changes in these processes in response to environmental
perturbation. Use will also include applications in Archaeology, determining,
for example, when human societies have relied on certain plant species such as
corn, which has a distinctive carbon isotope "signature" that is reflected in
the bones of consumers.
