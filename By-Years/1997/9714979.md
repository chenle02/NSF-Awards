ABSTRACT CTS-9714979 John O'Connell Thermodynamic properties are a principal
basis for innovative and improved chemical process synthesis, design and
optimization. With the advent of high-speed computers, many of the trial and
error steps of bench scale and pilot plant development can be eliminated if
reliable and accurate methods are available for 1) volumes to size units, 2)
energies to obtain heat and work effects, and 3) chemical potentials/fugacities
to calculate phase and reaction equilibria for separation and reaction limits.
Since thermodynamics show how all of these properties can be obtained from
rigorous mathematical operations on models such as the equation of state, when
accurate expressions have been derived and parameter values fitted to the data.
Large amounts of quantitative results can be directly obtained. Thus, the goal
of considerable current research is to find models that can describe many
classes of substances, mixtures and conditions. The Project for Standardized
Validation of Physical Properties Models (SVPPM) has been initiated to provide
basic information to model generators and users about the consistency, behavior,
accuracy, and reliability for quantitative property descriptions of chemical
systems. Interactions with various industrial experts have stimulated enthusiasm
and guidance for the project; financial support has been provided from NIST. An
organizational structure has been proposed and will be implemented in stages.
Current goals are 1) to establish a computer program for a range of tests on
equations of that will be accessible via the internet and 2) to demonstrate it
at the 8th International Conference on Properties and Phase Equilibria for
Product and Process Design in April, 1998. ***
