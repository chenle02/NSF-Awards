An international workshop on Head Driven Phase Structure Grammar (HPSG) will be
held in conjunction with the 1993 Linguistic Institute, to be hosted by The
Linguistics Department of the Ohio State University, sponsored by the Linguistic
Society of America, and cosponsored by the Association for Computational
Linguistics and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. The dates
of the workshop, July 19 August 6, 1993, coincide with the last three weeks of
the Linguistic Institute. The objectives of the workshop are: (1) To exchange
scientific results attained by researchers using HPSG and closely related
frameworks to develop precise and comprehensive descriptions of diverse human
languages. (2) To share ideas, techniques, and tools relevant to the development
of large scale computer implementation of HPSG. (3) To lay the groundwork for
better dissemination of relevant future research ideas. ***
