Small and isolated populations are of interest to biologists because they have
the potential to become new species. In the absence of human intervention their
evolutionary and ecological fates are determined by their genetic variation, and
this in turn is governed by their breeding structure. The proposed research will
examine the breeding structure of two small populations of Darwin's Finches on
one of the Galapagos Islands. Darwin's Finches are unusually suitable for this
investigation because they live in undisturbed environments, and their evolution
has been well studied. The two chosen populations are Geospiza fortis and G.
scandens. Their residency on the island of Daphne Major and their tameness has
allowed the establishment of pedigrees; and by extending these pedigrees and
following the fates of known individuals by observation, the PI's will establish
the circumstances and frequencies of inbreeding and of hybridization, and the
fitness consequences of both. Small populations like these Darwin's Finches are
of interest to conservation biologists because they are liable to become
extinct. Results of this study will have potential applications to the
conservation and management of small and endangered populations of animals
elsewhere. Demographic and genetic consequences of small population sizes are
increasingly being incorporated into the modeling of extinction-prone
populations in order to identify vulnerable components of life histories on the
one hand, and long-term, minimum, viable population sizes on the other. The
study populations are small and fluctuate in numbers. With this study their
genetic structure will be understood. Understanding the dynamics of such
populations under natural conditions is essential if we are to reliably assess
the future course of other populations which are subjected to disturbances.
