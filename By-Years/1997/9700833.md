Michael Tubergen of Kent State University is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program in his studies to determine the conformational
structures of amide derivatives of amino acids using Fourier-transform microwave
spectroscopy. Isotopic substitution (deuterium, nitrogen-15 or carbon-13 in
natural abundance) will be used to identify the hydrogen atoms participating in
intramolecular hydrogen bonds as well as to characterize the conformation. The
structures of solvent van der Waals complexes with these same molecules will
also be examined, especially complexes involving water and model dipeptides. The
results of this research should lead to improved modeling of larger biological
molecules. The education plan of this CAREER award involves extensive revisions
of the undergraduate physical chemistry program. Modifications, such as
incorporation of laser-based experiments and multidimensional nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy in the laboratory sequence will introduce students to
modern spectroscopic techniques. An aggressive community outreach effort and a
focus on research projects accessible to undergraduates will be emphasized.
