This proposal is an extension of analysis of data from the Second International
Science Study (SISS). SISS is an international survey of 24 countries conducted
in 1983. THe survey was repeated in the U.S. in 1986 because of poor
participation rates of schools in the 1983 effort. Later analysis of the SISS
data resulted in the report "Science Achievement in Seventeen Countries", which
has received a great deal of attention, mainly because of the relatively poor
performance of U.S. students in science achievement. Under this grant, in-depth
analyses will be conducted on the factors that explain science achievement in
the various countries. Some of these factors involve the science curriculum, its
structure (integrated vs. layer-cake approach), and the opportunity to learn and
an estimate of how much can be learned by certain age levels, even by the bottom
25 percent of students. Some of the effect that this and the amount of homework
has on achievement and in-service training, involvement in science projects, the
planning of lessons and the relative salaries of teachers will be examined. An
the effect of yet other variables to do with school organization such as school
and class size will be examined. The report from this project/scheduled for
June, 1989 should result in important international analyses of student
achievement in science that will be useful to science educators and others in
advocating changes designed to improve science instruction and teaching. This
project is being supported jointly by the National Science Foundation and the
U.S. Department of Education.
