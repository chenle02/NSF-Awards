This research is to develop a scheme that eliminates internal resonances in wave
scattering problems. In particular waves in fluids impinging on fluid objects
will emphasized. The wave scattering problem will be reformulated in order to
accomplish these objectives. The internal resonances are troublesome in
numerical solutions.
