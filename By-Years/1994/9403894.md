9403894 Tanner Technical abstract: The optical properties-in both normal and
superconducting states-of high temperature superconductors will be studied at
far infrared-ultraviolet frequencies. In the normal state, the research will
focus on the nature of the non-Drude mid infrared absorption, on the lifetime
and interaction of the charge carriers, and on the anisotropy of the quasi-two-
dimensional copper oxide layers. In the superconducting state, the research will
focus on issues of the superconducting energy gap, on possible anisotropy of the
gap, and on the lifetime of quasiparticle excitations. Non-technical abstract:
Detailed investigation of the optical properties of the high temperature
superconductors is essential for a complete understanding of these very novel
materials. By varying the wavelength of the light from the long-wavelength
infrared to the ultraviolet, information about the motion of the charge
carriers-in both the normal and the superconducting state of theses materials-
will be learned. This information may contribute to understanding the
superconductivity in these materials and will help to characterize their
usefulness for potential applications such as in microwave circuits and infrared
sensors. ***
