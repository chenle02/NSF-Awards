This travel grant supports participation, particularly of young mathematicians,
in the special conference Connections in Discrete Mathematics, held June 15-19,
2015 at the Burnaby Campus of Simon Fraser University (located in British
Columbia, Canada). This conference will bring together many leaders in several
areas of discrete mathematics to share their research, and also will present an
opportunity for young researchers to interact with senior personnel and form new
research collaborations. As a result, the meeting will have a positive influence
on the careers of young researchers in discrete mathematics. More about the
conference and its organization is at the conference website:

The conference topic of discrete mathematics includes many fields of
mathematics, including number theory, graph theory, Ramsey theory,
combinatorics, algorithmic analysis, discrete geometry, and more. While each of
these fields is important in its own right, they also share important ideas and
techniques that unite them. This conference brings together a diverse group of
researchers in discrete mathematics to share their work, and to look for
connections (both in terms of the research and in collaborations).
