This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Washington State
University (WSU) entitled, "Summer at WSU-Engineering Experiences for Teachers,"
under the direction of Dr. Richard Zollars.

This program is a renewal of a successful RET Site. A total of 36 in-service and
pre-service middle and high school teachers (12 per year for three years) will
participate in a six-week long summer institute during which they will work in
the research laboratories of engineering faculty at WSU. The site activities
will be focused in the area of bioengineering and will help integrate research
in one of the most rapidly increasing areas of activity in engineering into the
K-12 educational system.

This site program will have a broader impact on groups currently
underrepresented in engineering. Long term relationships developed during this
program via the teams of teachers, mentor's visits to schools, and/or the use of
the materials developed during this program will insure that the RET program
will have a lasting impact in the participating school districts.
