9302219 Hamkalo Two major approaches will be taken to begin an investigation of
the molecular basis of differential chromosome condensation in higher
eukaryotes. The first explores the putative role of the linker histone, H1,
which exists in multiple amino acid sequence variants, in differential
condensation. Antibodies generated in the laboratory against human subtypes will
be used to determine subtype distribution in situ by immunofluoresence and to
select by immunofaffinity methods chromatin fragments containing individual
subtypes. Selected fragments will be analyzed for the distribution of specific
DNA sequences in order to determine whether or not subtypes are functionally
distinguishable. The second approach is designed to evaluate a novel method for
the fractionation of specific DNA sequences as chromatin (nucleoprotein
hybridization) in order to select primate centromeric satellite enriched
chromatin fragments. %%% The experiments proposed are directed towards the
identification of proteins that underly differential chromosome condensation in
vertebrates. Differentially condensed chromatin is a diagnostic feature of
chromosomal centromeres, telomeres and inactive genes. Thus, proteins involved
in differential condensation may play a structural role as well as a functional
role in the repression of genes. ***
