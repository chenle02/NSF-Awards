This proposal is a request for support for a five-year program for the Policy
Research Initiative in Science Education to Improve Teaching and Learning in
High School Science (PRISE) at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) to use a systems
approach to link educational research with policy development. The overarching
goal is to provide the State of Texas and the nation with results that will lead
to the development of an articulated and coherent system of continuous
professional career development that improves the quality of science teaching
and makes significant contributions to reducing the current national shortage of
qualified high school science teachers. Basically PRISE proposes to answer the
essential policy research questions for the high school science teacher
professional continuum in Texas: (1) Where are we? (2) Where do we want to go?
and (3) how can we get there?
