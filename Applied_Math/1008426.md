Abstract

The study of viscoelastic flows leaves many unresolved mathematical issues. The
project will resolve a number of open questions. The development of a rigorous
foundation for analyzing the stability of viscoelastic flows has long presented
an unresolved challenge. Unlike the case of Newtonian flows, there are no
applicable theorems of a general nature that link stability to spectral
properties or allow deducing nonlinear stability from linearized stability. The
project will build on recent developments concerning "advective" systems that
promise the possibility of a rigorous study of the stability of creeping flows
of viscoelastic fluids. Another part of the project involves formulation and
analysis of models for complex yield stress behavior. Phenomena such as yield
stress hysteresis, time dependence of yield stress and thixotropy will be
explained by a combination of fast and slow dynamics which arises in a singular
limit of certain models of viscoelastic flows. The infinite Weissenberg number
limit provides another class of problems rife with unresolved mathematical and
numerical issues. Work under the project will address the well-posedness of
equations which describe the infinite Weissenberg number limit, and singular
perturbation problems associated with this limit. The PI will also continue his
research on the controllability of viscoelastic flows. Such flows are not fully
controllable. The stress tensor in a viscoelastic fluid is subject to certain
positive definiteness restrictions which, physically, result from the fact that
polymer molecules can be stretched by a flow, but cannot be forced to retract. A
precise quantification of this positivity requirement, however, is in general
quite difficult.

Complex fluids, such as polymers, pastes, and emulsions, arise in numerous
applications in the plastics and food industries, as well as biological systems.
The equations modeling such fluids are only partly understood. The project will
address several important issues arising in the study of these equations,
leading to a better understanding of phenomena as well as better methods of
their numerical simulation. Flow instabilities, yield behavior of some fluids
(which start to flow only when loaded above a certain threshold), problems of
the highly elastic limit, and control of flow are among the problems addressed
in this work. Several graduate students are already participating in this
research.
