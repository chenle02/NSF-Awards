Project A.S.T.R.O. is a program to bring both amateur and professional
astronomers into the schools to assist fourth through ninth grade teachers in
the classroom, with day and evening observing activities, with individual
student projects, and with inspiration to provide a greater appreciation of
science and lead students to science and engineering careers. Amateurs are a
largely untapped resource for science education and this project will explore
the impact their enthusiasm and experience can have in providing significant
assistance to teachers and students in grades where crucial science attitudes
are formed. The California-based pilot program will -- after the development of
appropriate protocols and materials -- use 40 astronomers and 40 teachers to
test the effectiveness of astronomers (especially amateur astronomers) as school
resource agents. The project has four related components: 1) the assessment of
existing programs of this type and of materials to help both the visiting
scientists and the teachers; 2) workshops to train the astronomers, prepare the
teachers, and continue developing activities and resources; 3) school visits and
other activities by astronomers for a full school year; and 4) the production of
a loose-leaf Teachers' Resource Notebook and a How-to-Manual for bringing
astronomy to the schools. Formative and summative evaluation by those involved
and a professional evaluator will be a key component of each phase. A set of
guidelines for the national dissemination of the project will also be developed.
