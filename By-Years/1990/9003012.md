The structure and function of the components of the binding protein mediated
membrane transport system for ribose in E. coli will be probed by two main
approaches. First, site-directed mutagenesis studies on the ribose binding
protein will be continued in order to define the surfaces on the ribose binding
protein which interact with the chemotaxis (trg) and the ribose transport
receptors on the cytoplasmic membrane. Our recant studies of this type located
one site near the "hinge" of the binding protein which eliminated chemotaxis
when an Ile residue was changed to Arg. Further probing of this site and
residues near it are planned as well as sites near the cleft of the binding
protein which appear to affect transport. Second, overexpression, isolation, and
characterization of the components of the membrane transport complex for ribose
will be continued. Two of the three proteins in the complex have been purified,
one of which has been shown to be homologous to a family of ATP-binding proteins
including the eukaryotic multiple drug resistance proteins and the newly
identified cystic fibrosis-related protein. Physical and biochemical studies
will be performed on the purified transport protein, and attempts to overexpress
the third will be continued. Once all three are produced, reconstitution of the
transporter in vitro will be pursued. A reconstituted system, along with the
information related to the surface of the binding protein which interacts with
the transported, will allow future biochemical studies of the mechanism of
transport, A related objective is to overexpress the repressor for the rbs
operon, a molecule which was shown to be homologous both to a family of
repressors and also to the family of binding proteins to which ribose binding
protein belongs. This led to a model for the repressor mechanism which will be
testable biochemically and structurally once significant amounts of the pure
repressor are obtained.
