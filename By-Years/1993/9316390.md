9316390 Richter A detailed study of diffusion in molten SiO2 and GeO2 is
proposed. Combined Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and laboratory
experiments for the magnitude, activation energy, and activation volume for the
self-diffusion of Si, O, and Ge will be carried out. The laboratory experiments
will provide important benchmarks with which to test the validity of MD
simulations carried out using a variety of representations of the pair-
potentials. Presently used potentials are reasonably successful at reproducing
various static properties of liquid SiO2, but they have not been tested in terms
of their ability to reproduce kinetic quantities such as the diffusivity of
atomic species. Validating the MD simulations for a simple oxides is a necessary
first step towards the realistic representation of silicate melts, and will
provide a basis for understanding diffusion at an atomistic level. A question of
particular interest is why do all recent MD simulations of liquid SiO2 find that
the self-diffusion of Si and O are virtually the same while laboratory
experiments on mixed oxide systems always find them to be significantly
different?
