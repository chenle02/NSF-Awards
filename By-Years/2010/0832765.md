This Phase II Noyce project seeks to: 1) recruit more highly qualified
individuals into careers in mathematics and science teaching; 2) prepare these
individuals to teach mathematics and science in standards-based ways; 3) support
mathematics and science teachers in their induction years through online social
networking; and 4) evaluate program success in terms of recruitment,
preparation, and retention of mathematics and science teachers. In each year of
the 3-year project, 14 stipends of $10,000 are offered to qualified STEM
professionals who hold a baccalaureate, masters, or doctoral degree in
mathematics, science, or related field who enroll in MU's alternative
certification program in mathematics and science education, resulting in 42 new
science and math teachers. The students are obligated to teach mathematics or
science for two years in a high need school district (preferably in Missouri),
within 6 years after program completion. The project is developing and
implementing the Noyce Scholar Support Network (NSSN), an on-line collaboration
and learning environment, where past, current, and future Noyce Scholars, along
with MU mathematics and science educators, form a community of learners.
Participation in the NSSN has the potential of increasing teacher retention in
the field. The evaluation work includes the development and dissemination of new
instruments for judging the success of alternative certification.
