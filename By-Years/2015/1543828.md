Digital language archives worldwide now host thousands of hours of audio and
video digital recordings and linguistically analyzed data samples. The
processing and storing of this material has happened so quickly that adequate
attention has not been paid to whether deposited materials can be appropriately
searched, analyzed, understood, and interpreted by various research and speaker
communities. Design anthropologist Christina Wasson from the University of North
Texas and linguist and language archivist Gary Holton from the University of
Alaska will investigate how digital language deposits at major language archives
are structured. Bringing together language archivists, field linguists, and
endangered language community members in a workshop setting, Wasson and Holton
will use principles of User Center Design to evaluate the usability of archives
from several perspectives including access, navigation, and database structure.
The interdisciplinary dialogue at this workshop could initiate a paradigm shift
for language archive designers and managers and ultimately have positive
repercussions for computationally-based research methods in linguistics.
