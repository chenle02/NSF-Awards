This project addresses some fundamental problems that lie at the interface of
complex geometry, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics. The
unifying theme is complex structures and moduli defined by solutions of partial
differential equations, their geometric obstructions, and their singularities.
The methods build on the theory of partial differential equations, but the
central component will be the development of new techniques and ideas from
complex analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex structures and moduli first
appeared in pure mathematics, but they have since revealed themselves to be at
the center of a wide range of phenomena, from applied mathematics to both
statistical and high-energy physics. In fact, some of the problems in the
present project arise directly from questions about critical phenomena and
supersymmetry. Progress in any part of the project should have wide
repercussions, both in mathematics and in related fields. The principal
investigator has trained a steady stream of undergraduates, graduate students,
and postdoctoral researchers in the past, and the project will be crucial in
allowing him to continue his efforts in this direction.
