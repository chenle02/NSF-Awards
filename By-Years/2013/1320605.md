Software plagiarism is an act of reusing someone else's code, in whole or in
part, into one own program in a way violating the terms of original license.
Along with the rapid developing software industry and the burst of open source
projects, software plagiarism has become a very serious threat to Intellectual
Property Protection and the "healthiness" of the open-source-embracing software
industry. Meanwhile, software plagiarism (and what is called app repackaging)
has become an even more common phenomenon in the mobile app markets for monetary
profit or propagation of malware by inserting malicious payloads into the
original apps. To address this threat, computer-aided, automated plagiarism
detection tools should play a major role. However, existing plagiarism detection
schemes are not resilient to code obfuscation, and often they can be defeated by
(in most cases rather simple) code-obfuscation-based counter-detection tools
which are freely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the software
plagiarism detection problem is studied in a systematic way. The proposed
plagiarism detection methods for PC applications leverage program logic and
longest semantically-equivalent-basic-block subsequences. They are capable of
detecting partial program plagiarism and also provide formal guarantee on
obfuscation resilience. The proposed method for mobile apps exploits user
interface for plagiarism detection, and this unique design angle empowers it to
defeat various code obfuscation techniques. Our proposed research will
significantly deter the intention or practice of software plagiarism. It will
not only serve as a useful tool in collecting strong plagiarism evidences for
lawsuits related to intellectual property, but also promote a more healthy and
trustworthy sharing environment for the open source community and for the mobile
app markets. Broader impact will also result from the education and
dissemination initiatives.
