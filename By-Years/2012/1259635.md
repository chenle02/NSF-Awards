The Odyssey III Scholarship Program is designed to strengthen the infrastructure
of the computer science and mathematics programs at Mississippi Valley State
University. Program activities are designed to capitalize on the academic gains
made by computer science and mathematics majors during the last decade and to
transform these gains into increased academic aspirations, particularly graduate
school attendance. The program assists the University in creating an environment
which equips and prepares students with skills that contribute to their success
in graduate school and increases the pipeline of underrepresented minority
students entering the workforce with graduate STEM degrees.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the program goal of providing stronger support
for student aspirations to pursue graduate studies, program activities include
a) active recruitment of students to participate in research internships; b)
engagement in student development activities which facilitate graduate school
admission such as GRE preparation and preparation of graduate school
applications and statements of interest; c) early engagement in professional
development activities such as freshman conference attendance, d) active
engagement in conference research presentations by sophomores, juniors and
seniors; and e) faculty-led initiatives that increase the awareness of graduate
school requirements. The desired outcome of program activities is an increase in
the pursuit and completion of graduate degrees by the programs' primarily
African American student population, who are underrepresented in STEM
