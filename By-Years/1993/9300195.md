The proposed research program is expected to enhance the fundamental
understanding of loading effects on the engineering behavior of composite soil-
nailed systems. It will yield preliminary model scale data for the experimental
evaluation of the design assumptions, and for the engineering assessment of the
soil-nailed system performance. It is expected to significantly contribute to
improve design practice and, thereby, to increase the confidence of engineers in
the potential application of soil nailing as a cost effective engineering
solution for rehabilitation and/or construction of bridge abutments, as well as
for remediation and geotechnical construction projects in built congested urban
environments.
