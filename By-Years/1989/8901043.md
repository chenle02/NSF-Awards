Dung beetles are ecologically important in recycling nutrients present in
various types of animal feces. Dung not only makes up the bulk of the diet of
the adults but is also the resource adults use to provision their young in
underground burrows. Dung removal decreases resources available to pest species
such as dung-breeding flies, thus lowering population densities of these
species. Burial of dung also increases growth of grasses and other forage for
livestock and wild animals. In this project, the PI's will study the
reproductive biology of a native North American dung beetle, Phanaeus difformis,
which utilizes feces of cattle and other large mammals. This research will
contribute to our understanding of the role that dung beetles play in rangeland
ecology. The goals of this research include documenting how morphological and
behavioral variables influence the reproductive biology of P. difformis under a
range of ecological conditions. Investgations will involve observations of
naturally breeding adults and controlled field experiments. Field experiments
will consider how adult population density and sex ratio influence the
reproductive potential of different individuals in the population.
