Objective: The objective of this research is to address a fundamental issue that
pervades modern optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices: power conversion
efficiency. The efficiency of highperformance photonic devices is typically
limited by a combination of electrical resistance and optical absorption. The
approach of this research is to combine photonics with nanotechnology to
dramatically enhance the performance of lasers that emit in the mid-infrared
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such laser sources will find manifold
applications in medicine, emissions monitoring, communications,
etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Recent advances in mid-infrared
diode lasers are hampered by the optical absorption of free holes, which
increases power consumption and degrades performance. This interdisciplinary
approach couples nanostructured materials science with semiconductor physics to
surmount this intrinsic limitation. Semimetallic nanostructures offer the
capability to dramatically reduce the number of free holes that are required in
edge emitting diode lasers, substantially reducing the optical loss, and
enhancing power conversion efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This
research will produce a transformative photonic device paradigm that is
applicable to a broad range of other problems in solid state lighting, solar
power generation, and green computing/communications. The effort will integrate
the proposed research with courses and outreach activities, exposing hundreds of
talented students at the elementary, high school, undergraduate, and graduate
levels to cutting edge photonics and nanoscience research to inspire them to
pursue science and engineering careers. This work will also develop an
undergraduate research program in photonicsfor women and underrepresented
minorities.
