This project will be host a Biodiversity Conference in New York City from
November 6-9, 2010 for the purpose of creating a blueprint for a coordinated
mission of species exploration, inspiring public participation, and assessing
impacts on science and society. This conference will assemble leaders from such
diverse fields as taxonomy, ecology, evolutionary biology, biomimicry, computer
engineering and grid computing, sustainability, climate change, history, and
sociology. National and international perspectives will be represented as well
as views of scientists involved in several related biodiversity initiatives,
including the CollectionsWeb RCN, BHL, Encyclopedia of Life, CBoL, and PBI
projects. The workshop will explore needs with regard to collections
infrastructure, cyberinfrastructure, digitization, and the workforce; strategic
goals to rapidly accelerate rate of species discovery by an order of magnitude;
and strategic guidelines for assessing community needs over the decade ahead.
