9451396 Buschert We propose to create a new introductory physics laboratory,
which is investigatory in nature, provides a closer link with more advanced
studies, and introduces students to research techniques. Students will carry out
one main experiment of their own design. Computer-based data collection and
spreadsheet analysis will be used, affording students experience using the tools
and methods common to modern research. The main experiment would be limited to
the general area of resonance of a damped and driven oscillator or system of
oscillators. The oscillator was chosen because of its centrality in physics, its
connection with subsequent upper-level courses, and the fact that it provides
the students a wide variety of effects to investigate, including the currently
active topic of chaotic motion. To provide flexibility, the oscillatory systems
will be built in house. Each oscillator system will require a driver, a
mechanical transducer, a range finder, and a data acquisition/analysis and
modelling system consisting of a 486 level computer and software.
