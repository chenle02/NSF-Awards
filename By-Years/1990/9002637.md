Dr. David Leitner has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr.
Leitner's doctoral degree was from the University of Chicago under the
supervision of Professor R. Stephen Berry. Dr. Leitner intends to continue
research at the University of Heidelberg under the sponsorship of Professor
Lorenz Cederbaum. Dr. Leitner's area of postdoctoral research and training will
be theoretical studies dealing with the calculation of vibronically-coupled
spectra. Longer term, he plans to apply these studies to the calculation of
spectra of non-Born-Oppenheimer systems such as the methane cation. The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.Ds and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research
and teaching.
