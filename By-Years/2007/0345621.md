The primary objective of this project is to advance existing capabilities in
providing security for critical transportation infrastructures against CBR
(Chemical, Biological and Radiological) threats. The project will bring experts
from the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), the Port Authority of
NY/NJ in partnership with the Center for Advanced Infrastructure &amp;
Transportation (CAIT) at Rutgers University to develop an advanced &amp;
integrated CBRN monitoring and response management system for critical
infrastructures such as transit hubs, airports and marine
terminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase of the project, which is
covered in this proposal, the team will plan and design the concept model for
the use of a novel Anthrax detection technology in a selected critical facility.
The project will designate the appropriate site, design the proper packaging and
ruggedization for the device, and most importantly develop the protocols for
integration of data into the facility's existing Incident Management Systems
(IMS) for providing the appropriate emergency response. In the second and the
final phase of the project, the physical implementation and testing of the
system will be conducted in facilities designated and designed for in phase one.
Furthermore, efforts will be made to extend the integration protocol to other
CBR threats. A complete package including monitoring hardware, IMS protocols and
software, and results of evaluation programs will constitute the final outcome
of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
