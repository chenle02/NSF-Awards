3D in vitro cell culture systems have evolved from simple 3D collagen gel
matrices to complex, multi-cell models with controlled mechanical, chemical, and
biological cues. High throughput methods such as bioplotting, and bioprinting
can build large samples but lack resolution. On the other end, high precision
approaches such as optical tweezers, electrokinetic patterning, acoustic
patterning, and microcontact printing are available, but limited to patterning
in small length scales. Currently, there is no effective method for multiscale
manipulation of biological objects of sizes from single cells, cell colonies,
and cell aggregates. This proposal aims to investigate and develop an efficient
platform capable of overcoming this technical barrier for precision manipulation
and patterning of fragile biological objects of sizes across multiple scales.
The new cell and colony patterning ability will allow constructing tissues with
higher detail and cellular organization to mimic the true composition and
microenvironment between human physiologies. Besides obvious applications in
tissue regeneration and drug screening, the new patterning capability can
provide new insights into intriguing scientific questions. Results and expertise
developed during the course of this project will also be incorporated into PI's
teaching activities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Undergraduate
students will participate in these projects through independent research
courses. The PIs will also collaborate with the High School Summer Research
Program at UCLA to recruit local K12 students for summer internship in PIs' lab.
Acoustic manipulation has shown its potential for patterning and manipulating
single cells and large-sized objects. However, dynamic patterning and control of
acoustic field is more difficult than other approaches using electric fields and
optical fields. Currently, dynamic acoustic trapping and manipulation of cells
are accomplished by using pairs of interdigitated transducers (IDT) electrodes
coupled with broadband excitation signals. However, this approach has limited
degree-of-freedom (DOF) and cannot construct complex acoustic field landscape.
This proposal aims to investigate and develop a novel light reconfigured
acoustic patterning mechanism that can provide precision manipulation and
patterning of fragile biological objects of sizes spanning over 2 orders of
magnitude from 10 Ã¬m to 1 mm. Research projects include the investigation of the
fundamentals of defects induced trapping behaviors and their limitations; the
development of light reconfigured structure defects for dynamic manipulation and
patterning, and the platform's application for high throughput construction of
multiscale biological tissues of complex patterns.
