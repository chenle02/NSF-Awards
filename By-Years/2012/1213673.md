In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of
Chemistry, Dr. Peter Qin, from the University of Southern California, will
investigate intrinsic dynamics in the nano- to microsecond regime of a large
ribozyme using site-directed spin labeling. By monitoring nitroxide spin labels
covalently attached to specific RNA sites with electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy, information on RNA dynamics will be obtained at various
equilibrium states of wild type and mutant ribozymes. The studies aim to: (i)
reveal sequence and structure elements that dictate intrinsic RNA dynamics, and
(ii) correlate intrinsic dynamics to RNA folding and catalysis. The goal of the
project is to advance fundamental understanding of the structure-dynamics-
function relationship in RNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the
proposed work stems from advancing experimental methods for probing biological
systems, enhancing research infrastructure and resources, and providing
knowledge that benefits the broader scientific community. The proposed work will
contribute to student training at all levels, with emphasis on using a
multidisciplinary approach and on promoting participation of members from under-
represented groups (e.g. minority undergraduates from local primarily
undergraduate institutions) in research. Examples from the Dr. Qin's research
are incorporated into courses and education programs to propel the growth of the
Chemistry Department and the University.
