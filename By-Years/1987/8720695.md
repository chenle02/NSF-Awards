Fossils will be collected from middle Miocene deposits in the Mojave Desert of
southern California. This work is undertaken to develop a secure
biostratigraphic framework for Hemingfordian mammal assemblages, which when
combined with the existing Barstovian mammal assemblages will permit reliable
identification of the boundary between Hemingfordian and Barstovian land mammal
ages. Preliminary study has indicated the Mojave Desert is the best area to
develop a dependable Hemingfordian/Barstovian boundary. The Cenozoic history of
mammals is punctuated with brief but significant intervals of intercontinental
dispersal by land mammals. Middle Miocene is one of these intervals, with the
Hemingfordian/Barstovian boundary possibly the high point in appearance of
immigrants. Secure chronologic resolution of that boundary is necessary to test
hypotheses about the timing of global climatic-eustatic sea level events as a
trigger mechanism for intercontinental dispersal of land mammals. This project
will provide primary data for testing these hypotheses and should clarify the
interaction of dynamic global processes in the evolution of terrestrial biota.
