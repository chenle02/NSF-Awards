This systematic research project of classroom teaching and learning of
mathematics in grades 3 through 6 is intended to : (1) describe teachers'
beliefs about small-group mathematics instruction with a particular interest in
specifying mathematical content that is especially appropriate for small-group
instruction; (2) identify instructional strategies teachers use during small-
group instruction; (3) replicate those instructional strategies in different
educational contexts; (4) examine small-group instruction in the areas of
problem solving, estimation, and measurement (making videotapes of these lessons
as well as coding classroom behavior); (5) examine the correlation between
different small-group instructional strategies and students' mathematics
performance; (6) with the assistance of the National Advisory Board, develop at
least two innovative treatments for improving the effectiveness of small-group
mathematics instruction; and (7) disseminate the results of the project in a
monograph discussing research findings and concepts and in a videotape(s) that
will illustrate effective practices.
