An International Symposium on Strangeness in Hadronic Matter is planned for
June 1-5, 1987 in Bad Honnef, West Germany. The theoretical problem of how
normal hadronic matter, made up of neutrons and protons, is changed when strange
hadronic matter is added, is a very interesting and important one. (Strange
hadronic matter consists of particles which contain strange quarks, such as
lambda and sigma particles.) This Symposium would bring together the world's
experts in this field to discuss the latest developments and theories. The
discussions and interactions at the proposed Symposium should lead to
significant progress in the understanding of strange hadronic matter. Fruitful
collaborations will also be established at the Symposium, which will produce new
investigations in this exciting field of research. Support for U.S. speakers to
participate in this important Symposium is highly recommended.
