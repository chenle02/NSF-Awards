This award supports a continuation of the research program of the Principal
Investigator on the accurate and efficient numerical modeling of wave-scattering
problems in various applications settings. In this project, the Principal
Investigator will develop and analyze high-performance, efficient, accurate, and
rapidly-convergent algorithms for evaluation of the interaction between waves
and structures that involve multiple scatterers as well as multiple layers with
different material properties. The solvers to be developed are relevant to
diverse applications, such as radar and remote sensing, communication devices,
geophysics, and photonics.

The Principal Investigator will develop a family of algorithms that will focus
mainly on (1) efficient boundary integral solutions of electromagnetic and
elastic scattering problems in layered media that bypass the need for
cripplingly expensive evaluations of layered Green's functions and (2) Schur
complement Domain Decomposition methods for efficient solutions of multiple
scattering problems. The computational methodology underlying the proposed work
is based on a class of numerical solvers and surface-representation and meshing
methodologies developed in recent years by the Principal Investigator and his
collaborators. These are boundary integral solvers that can produce solutions
with high-order accuracy, and no numerical dispersion, for realistic engineering
geometries including features such as full aircraft, complex photonic or
electronic devices, etc. In practice, and whenever applicable, these types of
solvers have demonstrated order-of-magnitude faster numerics, for a given
accuracy, than some of the most competitive solvers otherwise available: the new
methods can enable solution of previously intractable problems.
