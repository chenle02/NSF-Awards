Ordway 9514485 As the organ system responsible for controlling movements,
sensing surroundings, and consciousness, the nervous system must be capable of
rapid information processing and rapid transmission of that information
throughout the organism. To meet these demands, the nervous system is composed
of complex networks of cells which, like electrical networks in computers, use
electricity for information processing and transmission. In order for the
nervous system to function, individual nerve cells must convey electrical
signals to other nerve cells in the network. This transmission occurs at
specialized sites of contact between two nerve cells, called synapses and is
generally mediated by a complex process where electrical information is
converted into chemical information. The chemical signals are responsible for
information transfer across the synapse. Understanding chemical synaptic
transmission, and thus the mechanisms by which nerve cells can send and receive
electrical signals, is essential to understanding the fundamental mechanisms of
nervous system function. Using a simplified model system which functions
similarly to more complex nervous systems, a better understanding of information
processing can be gained. This simple model system is also amenable to a wide
variety of molecular genetic approaches allowing even more powerful
understanding of nervous system function. Dr. Ordway is using a simplified model
system to investigate the function of a specific synaptic protein called NSF.
Using the molecular approaches alluded to above, Dr. Ordway is investigating the
function of NSF in chemical synaptic transmission when the function of NSF has
been perturbed. The basic mechanisms of nervous tissues have been conserved
during evolution and information from simpler systems will lead directly to a
better understanding of the function of our own brain and nervous system.
