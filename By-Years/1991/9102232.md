The NMDA receptor, a subclass of the neurotransmitter glutamate receptors, is
widely present at synapses in the vertebrate central nervous system. NMDA
receptors have been implicated in the process of long term potentiation, a model
of learning and memory, and synapse formation and stabilization. The long term
objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of operation of
synaptic ion channels, particulary, the processes of ligand binding and channel
gating. The immediate goal of the research is to examine the activation
mechanisms of synaptic receptors stimulated by glutamate. By applying kinetic
analyses, Dr. Auerbach will be able to investigate how agonists, glutamate- like
molecules, activate NMDA ion channels, regulate the gating of channel pores and
the desensitization of NMDA receptors. In addition, the developmental changes in
NMDA activated channels will be studied. The Principal investigator has
developed a method of applying agonist by diffusion through the back of a
pipette, a powerful technique which will enable the PI to obtained data from a
single channel over a range of concentrations. Experimentally, this approach
will allow for the study of ligand activated channels in their native cellular
environment. Results of this investigation will contribute to the understanding
of the mechanisms of how the glutamate neurotransmitter operates and will
provide a microscopic description of synaptic transmission.
