Kominz 9506572 The projected research will establish a sequence stratigraphic
backstripping procedure. Sequence stratigraphic and genetic stratigraphic data
coupled with well logs and crustal thicknesses will be the input for a two-
dimensional, flexural, backstripping effects of sediment loading. Separation of
the eustatic and tectonic components of accommodation space will then be
possible, based on the unique temporal and spatial properties of each. Thermally
driven subsidence has an exponential form with depth, that will be a function
crustal and mantle stretching. In-plane stress has a well-defined form with
respect to margin distance, but no predictable form in time. Eustacy also has no
predictable form in time. Eustacy, however, is constant in space. The model will
be designed to be applied to a thermally subsiding region. The model will be
tested on an extensive data set from the Cenozoic of the northern North Sea
Basin. Five traverses, including strike and dip sections, will be interpreted in
detail, using both systems tract sequence stratigraphic and genetic sequence
stratigraphic concepts. Recent biostratigraphic data, well logs and deep seismic
data will also be included in the data base. Application of sequence
stratigraphic backstripping will produce a range of possible stretching factors,
eustatic curves and stress histories for the northern North Sea Basin. Cross
sections showing the decompacted sediment thicknesses as well as underlying
bathymetry will add insight to interpretations of sediment sources and basement
controls on deposition.
