The group of researchers will be working at the interface of stochastic
processes and polymer chemistry. The group will be continuing prior interactions
between these two areas. In particular the group will continue its work on
random graphs as models for polymerization. A second topic to be studied by the
group is in the area of mesoscopic theories of surface transport including
adsorption-desorption processes.
