IIP 1134843 &lt;br/&gt;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT)
&lt;br/&gt;Clancy &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech proposes to join the
Security and Software Engineering Center (S2ERC), an NSF Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) which currently is a multi-university
Center comprised of Ball State (lead institution), and the Iowa State
University. The center focuses on improving the management of the software
engineering process, the productivity of software engineers, and the security,
quality and timeliness of software engineering products.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech (VT) requests funding for becoming a third
site of the NSF Center for Security and Software Engineering Center (S2ERC)
under the leadership of Professor T. Charles Clancy. The addition of Virginia
Tech faculty and from the National Capital Region will promote S2ERC reputation
as the premier I/UCRC in two research areas critical to the country, namely
software engineering and security. The seventeen VT faculty who are planning to
participate in the S2ERC will increase the Center's research capabilities in
areas such as software/system security, hardware and embedded system security,
wireless network and spectrum security, enterprise and internet security,
modeling and simulation of dynamic cyber systems, and cyber law, policy and
business. While some of these research areas represent new capabilities in the
S2ERC, others will strengthen current expertise in the Center.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of Virginia Tech to S2ERC will enable the
existing center to access the broad array of Northern Virginia companies focused
in this area. The combination of location and current federal research strategy
will allow this center to be at the nexus of an extremely important research
topic and one that industry is highly interested in cutting edge research
results. Additionally, Virginia Tech has an international footprint, operating
in five countries. VT plans to have an extremely diverse pool of students and
faculty involved in the center. Students will benefit from laboratory work and
interaction with NSA and other agencies in Northern Virginia along with
coursework in cyber security.
