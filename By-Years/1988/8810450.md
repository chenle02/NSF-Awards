The aim of this research is to investigate the molecules that mediate adhesion
of growth cones to basal processes. The procedures used will involve first
raising monoclonal antibodies against wing epithelial cells at the appropriate
stage of development. Next these antibodies will be screened for their ability
to bind to antigens showing a graded distribution along the PD axis on exposed
basal surfaces of epithelial cells. These antigens will represent candidates
that could provide directional cues for axonal guidance. Finally, functional
assays for the role of antigenic candidates in axonal pathfinding will be
carried out in vitro with Fab fragments of antibodies. The study of
morphogenetic processes in Manduca can eventually be extended to the molecular
genetic level by using Manduca in tandem with its fellow holometabolous insect,
Drosophila. This research allies well with the Principal Investigator's long
range goals of defining morphogenesis, as it occurs in situ, at all levels of
biological organization, ultimately leading to a description in molecular terms
of cell-substratum and cell-cell interactions associated with morphogenesis.
