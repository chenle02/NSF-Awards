Smooth ergodic theory studies the long-time asymptotics of those autonomous
systems which can be described by a finite number of parameters. Both analytic
and numerical results suggest that most of systems fall in one of the following
classes: elliptic (quasiperiodic) and hyperbolic (exhibiting sensitive
dependence on initial conditions). Systems close to elliptic systems are
described by the famous Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser theory. By contrast small
perturbations of hyperbolic systems have been analyzed only in a few special
cases. This proposal aims at the general perturbation theory for hyperbolic
systems. This includes both the description of the perturbed dynamics up to the
certain specific times as well as computing equilibrium characteristics of the
perturbed system. Because there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions,
it is hopeless to deal with perturbations of individual orbits. Rather, using
the fact that hyperbolic systems usually have strong stochastic properties, I
will study parameter dependence of frequencies of visits to a given domain in
the phase space. My previous work on statistical properties of hyperbolic
systems is essential to this project.

During the recent years it has been understood that many systems we encounter
have chaotic behavior. On the other hand there are several models of chaotic
systems which can be exactly solved, which can be analyzed mathematically.
However it can be asked how much one could trust predictions made on the basis
of these models since the specific features which allow us to precisely solve
these models might make them in some sense exceptional. In particular since
chaotic systems are very sensitive to initial conditions it is conceivable that
a slight change in the parameters of the system could drastically change their
behavior. The goal of the current project is to describe the conditions when
this drastic change does not happen. The main idea is that most chaotic systems
are so complicated that changing parameters does not lead to an appearance of a
new pattern of behavior but rather to changing slightly probabilities of already
existing patterns.
