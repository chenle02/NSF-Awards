9501917 Skjellum This works seeks to elaborate the two main areas of long-term
commitment by the Principle Investigator (PI): parallel scientific
algorithm/library design, and message-passing mechanisms for high performance
distributed computing. As applications drive requirements for high-performance
libraries, and services (like message passing, parallel I/O), so a strong
vertical integration of application, libraries, and services presents itself.
This research will be unique and of importance because it works to manage the
complexity and integration of applications, libraries, and services while
considering portability and performance.
