9400833 Larsen This award funds the investigations of Prof. Michael Larsen into
monodromy representations of fundamental groups especially as they arise in
number theory. Prof. Larsen will attempt to compute monodromy groups in
particular cases and study variations caused by changes in the base data. He
would like to be able to construct examples where the monodromy group is
prescribed beforehand, an inverse problem based on the invariants of the induced
representation. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry,
a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory.
In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be
defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number
theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one
whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in
fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter
century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The result has been an
increased understanding of both areas of mathematics.
