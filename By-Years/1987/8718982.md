This research conference will be held at the University of Missouri March
17-19, 1988. It will deal with topics from Reliability and Quality Control.
Featured participants include R. Barlow from UC Berkeley, N. Mann from UCLA, N.
Singpurwalla from George Washington, J. Musa from AT&amp;T, and R. Kowalski from
SIAM. Reliability Theory aids in the development of technology to ensure
consistent performance, quality, and reliability of manufactured products, and
has applications in the health sciences as well.
