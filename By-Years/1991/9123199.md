Dimension scaling is used to study correlation effects in few electron systems.
The molecular collective motions appear in a natural way at low order
perturbation theory and quantitative energies at higher orders. The work extends
the approach to excited and autoionizing states of two electron systems and
begins the exploration of higher symmetries, interdimensional degeneracies and
geometries in these systems.
