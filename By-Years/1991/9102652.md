Professor Grant will work on various aspects of the arithmetic of curves of
genus two. He will study integer points on these curves, certain units arising
from curves of genus two, and new methods for calculating the Mordell-Weil rank
of such curves. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry
-a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
