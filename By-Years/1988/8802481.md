The principal investigator intends to focus on classifying certain kinds of
differentiable manifolds or group actions on manifolds using a combination of
methods from surgery and stable homotopy theory. In particular, he would like to
study the diffeomorphism classification of certain homogeneous spaces and
complete intersections, give a stable classification of four- manifolds by
spectral invariants, and determine the relationship between spherical
involutions and Mahowald root invariants. These classification questions all
involve extracting geometric information from algebraic information about the
manifolds or group actions in question.
