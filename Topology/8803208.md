The investigators will pursue research in various areas of differential
topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. More specifically: 1)
John Wood will study the topological, differential, and complex structure of
algebraic manifolds, especially questions on deformations and analytic
embedding. 2) James Heitsch will continue his study of the geometry of
foliations and the extension of the theory of analytic invariants to foliated
manifolds. 3) Anatoly Libgober will study the topology of algebraic varieties,
especially questions on the structure of the complement of branching loci and
its relation to problems of classification up to deformation.
