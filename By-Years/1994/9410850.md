9410850 Starace Short pulse laser detachment of negative ions in both parallel
and crossed static electric and magnetic fields are examined using a variety of
theoretical and computational techniques. The effects of the fields on the
detachment cross section resulting from two coherent laser pulse excitations
will be carried out. The results of the theoretical calculations will enable an
understanding of the coherent control of atomic continuum processes. ***
