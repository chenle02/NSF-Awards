A high level of process automation is a key to the safe, efficient, and
competitive manufacture of high quality materials. A common focus of control
research is the development of new technologies to build highly autonomous
chemical processes; autonomous in the sense that they can function with a
reduced level of operator intervention. The main issues to be dealt with in this
research project are the integration of control and fault diagnosis to realize
fault tolerant control systems, making effective use of process information, and
developing a coherent theoretical approach to discrete process operations. The
work will consist of three specific studies on new, fundamental approaches to
process monitoring: (1) the integration of multivariable control and fault
detection in L1/l using a four parameter controller; (2) a study of the
application of multiresolution techniques for signal processing (wavelets) to
process monitoring and control; and (3) the development of a novel hybrid
continuous/discrete-event model for process fault detection and diagnosis. The
study goals include the development of new theoretical approaches to these
problems. Significant effort will be devoted to the development of effective
computational procedures. Cooperation with active industrial research groups
will foster the transfer of the technology to industrial practice.
