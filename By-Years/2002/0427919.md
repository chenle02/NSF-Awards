0427919&lt;br/&gt;Fauchet&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal 1-D. 2-D, and 3-D photonic
bandgap structures will be designed, built, and tested as optical biosensors.
Model organisms will be tested in collaboration with researchers at the Center
for Future Health, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella minnesota, and
adenovirus.
