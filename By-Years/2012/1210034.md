This action funds Andrew A. Campbell of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville
to conduct a research project, entitled "Impact of electric bicycle sharing on
transportation choices in Beijing," during the summer of 2012 at Tsinghua
University in Beijing, People's Republic of China. The host scientist is
Professor Xinmiao Yang, Institute of Transportation Engineering, Department of
Civil Engineering.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is a well-timed contribution to
the body of knowledge addressing how bicycle sharing affects transportation
choices. The city of Beijing has announced plans to install a 50,000 bicycle
fleet by 2015. Previous studies have found that systems using standard bicycles
can both complement and compete with public transit. However, no known research
has explored the idea of including motorized electric bicycles in a bike sharing
system.T This research is relevant to cycling-friendly American communities. By
reducing the effort required to propel a bicycle, electric bikes have the
potential to open cycling to new demographics.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
