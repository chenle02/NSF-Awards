This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the
process necessary to bring nano-diamond coating technology to the cutting tool
market. The technical objective of producing a commercial size lot of nano-
diamond coated cutting tools will be accomplished through application of the
hot-filament Chemical Vapor Deposition process, which is the only economical
process that produces a uniform diamond coating over several hundred square
inches in a single batch operation. The technical approach will consist of
migrating the current microwave-plasma CVD process to the hot-filament CVD
process.

Commercially, the immediate application for diamond-coated tools is machining
aluminum-based metals and composites for the automotive industry. The 2001
automotive cutting-tool market for machining these materials was $780M. The
potential market for applying the diamond coating to these tools is $53M in 2002
with a forecasted market growth rate of 4percent so that it is an important
development.
