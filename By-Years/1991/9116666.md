One of the most important applications of queueing networks is the performance
modelling of pedestrian and vehicular traffic within and around facilities.
State dependent queues and finite queueing network models are important tools
for the topological design of facilities, routing of occupants, and the
capacitated allocation and design of resources to accommodate occupant traffic.
It is proposed to capture the nonlinear effects of customer traffic flow within
these networks. In addition, applications of state dependent queueing network
models for the topological design of facilities, routing of occupants, and the
capacitated allocation of resources to accommodate occupant traffic within
facilities are described.
