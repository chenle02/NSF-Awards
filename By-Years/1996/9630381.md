9630381 PI: Crews Appropriate neural control of muscle function requires that
nerve cells form specific synaptic connections with muscles during
embryogenesis. The reproducibility of these connections in both vertebrates and
invertebrates implies the existence of precise recognition events between nerve
cell and muscle. The Drosophila abrupt gene encodes a regulatory protein that
directs nerve-muscle recognition during embryonic development, and this proposal
represents a concerted effort to define a molecular pathway, centered around
Abrupt, that controls this process. Genetic and molecular approaches will be
utilized to define the cell type (nervous system or muscle) in which Abrupt
functions, the identity and function of the genes that Abrupt regulates, and
additional factors that interact with Abrupt to control nerve-muscle
recognition.
