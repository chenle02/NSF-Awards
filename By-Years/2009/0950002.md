The success of genome-sequencing projects highlights how little we know about
how the whole organism is put together. Deciphering the relationship between the
genome and the organism requires study of the effects of subtle genetic changes
on the whole organism. This project will develop and apply one such approach by
manipulating the expression of hundreds of genes and observing the effects on
body shape, then using modeling to test understanding of how these effects
occur. The project will focus on the genetic basis of shape of the wing of fruit
flies, one of the few multi-cellular organisms where the necessary genetic
manipulations are easy to accomplish and detailed data can be obtained in large
quantities. &lt;br/&gt;This project has broad significance for biology, because
health and disease in humans, improvement of domesticated plants and animals,
and the ability of organisms to adapt, all derive from the relationship between
the genome and the organism. This project will provide more detailed data on the
genetic basis of variation in the whole organism than has previously been
available. The research will provide a procedural model and analytical software
which can be used by others to extend such studies to other organisms and that
ultimately is applicable to humans and the species we interact with. Many
undergraduates and a post-doctoral research will receive training through
participation in this project. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
