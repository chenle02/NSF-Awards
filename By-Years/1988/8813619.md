This proposal is in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in
the subfield of chemistry studied by mass spectrometry. The focus of the
proposed research is to study the mechanisms of Chemical Ionization (CI)
reactions through detection of the neutral products of the ion/molecule
reactions using the variation of ratios of sample ions in CI mass spectra as
functions of electron current and source pressure. Such studies should prove
useful for examining structural features for certain classes of compounds.
Sample ion/sample molecule reactions will also be studied.In addition, the
proton affinities of complex molecules will be determined since they are
difficult to determine by other techniques, are not readily available, and
should prove useful in choosing selective CI reagents for quantitative analyses.
Comparisons will be made between experimental and calculated relative
sensitivities of complex molecules in CI mass spectrometry. This research will
investigate chemical methods of generating ions for improved analysis using mass
spectrometry. The fundamental chemistry involved in generating such ions will be
examined in detail. These studies may provide reaction prediction capabilities
for certain classes of compounds. The propensity of complex molecules to
associate with the hydrogen ion will be examined. The results of these
experiments will be compared to theory.
