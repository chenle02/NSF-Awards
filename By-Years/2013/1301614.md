The aim of this project is to further the study of random geometric graphs. This
subject has grown out of applied problems, with the first questions about the
way fluids seep through porous media. More recently, many questions about random
geometric graphs have been prompted by the study of large scale electronic and
communication networks. The basic model of random geometric graphs was proposed
by Gilbert over fifty years ago: take points randomly in the plane according to
a Poisson point process of intensity 1, and join two whenever they are within a
distance r of each other. The main question Gilbert asked is the following: for
what values of r do we obtain an infinite connected component? Surprisingly,
even after fifty years, only rather poor upper and lower bounds are known for
the critical value of r. Some properties of this Gilbert model are known, but
many other questions still remain unanswered. The proposed project considers
some of these questions, and many other questions about related models of random
graph inspired by both percolation theory and large scale communication
networks.

Random geometric graphs can be used to model many large scale networks that
exist in real life, such as the internet, social networks, and are particularly
suited to the modeling of large scale sensor and transceiver networks. As
electronic devices become smaller and cheaper, it is now not uncommon to have
very large networks of interconnected devices. Modeling the behavior of these
networks is becoming more and more important, and the analysis of the behavior
of these networks when they become extremely large is becoming increasingly
relevant in real world applications. The research proposed will aid the
understanding of the properties of these large scale networks.
