PROJECT ABSTRACT The main project in this proposal explores the organization
and functioning of firms whose employees have sufficient power to negotiate
their individual employment terms. Employment relations of this type are
obviously widespread. In many or even most firms, the terms of employment of
certain key employees are determined in direct bargaining between the employee
and the firm. But, more importantly, there are many firms in which relations of
this form encompass a substantial subset of a firm's workforce. The latter
category includes firms that employ highly skilled labor such as high-technology
firms, law firms, universities, professional sports teams, and perhaps even
small firms that employ less-skilled labor. This situation is clearly distinct
from those addressed by the standard textbook models, in which workers are
assumed to possess no bargaining power, on the one hand, and the fully unionized
firm's model, on the other hand. Yet despite the obvious relevance of this
situation, there is only one theoretical analysis that considers it. The purpose
of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of how such employment
relations work and how their presence affects economically interesting
magnitudes. Specifically, it explores whether and under what circumstances
employment relations of this type have a systematic effect on the level of
employment (and hence production), and how they affect the hiring practices and
the organization of the work within the firm. A central step in the research
entails the development of a new model of the firm that combines the dynamic
evolution of the firm's work-force with the process of contracting and
recontracting between the firm and its employees. The dynamic nature of the
model is necessitated by the recognition that the firm's opportunities of
replacing employees play a major role in shaping the outcomes of such employment
relations. Preliminary analysis establishes that, despite the inherent
complexity of the scenarios under consideration, it is possible to obtain
relatively transparent models that capture some of the main ingredients of the
situation and can serve as the basic framework for empirical investigation. More
importantly, the preliminary analysis also shows that the predictions regarding
wage and employment outcomes are indeed systematically and significantly
different from the predictions of existing theories.
