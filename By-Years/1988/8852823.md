This project allows students in this institution's microelectronics program to
apply thermal imaging to the design of integrated circuits. The laboratory that
supports this project includes a Mikron Thermal Tracer which students use to
measure and display thermal performance of integrated circuits which have been
design and fabricated in the microelectronics laboratory. This activity permits
students to gain practical insight into the design and fabrication problems
associated with integrated circuits. In addition to its primary use in the
microelectronics lab, the thermal tracer system is used by mechanical
engineering students in analyzing fluid and heat transfer systems. This award is
being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
