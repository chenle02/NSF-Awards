9315341 Heiney Discotic liquid crystals are generally composed of organic
molecules with a rigid disk-shaped core and 6-8 alkyl tails. Depending on the
temperature and molecular geometry, these molecules can form either nematic
phases or columnar structures with long-range intercolumnar order and only
short- range intracolumnar order. Such columnar structures represent a new
ordering of dimensionalities for a condenssd state of matter: they are ordered
in two dimensions and disordered in one. Further, discotic donor-acceptor
complexes formed by doping with an electron acceptor such as iodine may combine
the electrical properties of semiconductors or conductors with the anisotropic
mechanical, optical, and structural properties of liquid crystals. Discogenic
molecules can aggregate at the air-water interface to form Langmuir films, and
thence be transferred to solid substrates to form Langmuir-Blodgett films. The
columnar structure of these materials is reflected in transport anisotropy. Such
thin films are of interest as model low-dimensional systems and for display
applications and the development of pressure sensors. In this research, studies
on discotic liquid crystals are conducted to correlate the structure of bulk
phases, the structure of thin films, and the conductivity of both three-
dimensional and two- dimensional materials. The primary tools employed will be
x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and voltammetry, in conjunction with
standard characterization by optical microscopy and calorimetry. The materials
studied will include triphenylene and truxene derivatives, hexacyclens, and
phthalocyanine derivatives; the latter are synthetic analogs of porphyrins that
are of interest because of their electrical, optical, and catalytic properties.
Additionally, the properties of newly conceived heptameric "supradisks" and
tubular compounds will be characterized and explored. ***
