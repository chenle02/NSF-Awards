In atmospheric science, many remote sensing instruments make indirect
measurements by observing readily-accessible phenomena and using mathematical
models to infer the quantities of interest. A common example is the use of
satellites to measure the spectrum of reflected sunlight and subsequent use of a
procedure called optimal estimation to invert a physical model that relates
radiances and atmospheric properties. This project focuses on developing
statistical methods that more accurately capture the uncertainty in this
inference. This research has the potential to greatly improve accuracy of
current and future remote sensing efforts, particularly those that utilize
spectrometers.

Inferring the atmospheric state from spectra is called a retrieval. In
statistical parlance, this is an estimation of parameters in a statistical model
where a physical forward model defines the mean structure. Since the parameters
have a particular physical meaning, it is essential that model error is properly
accounted for. This project aims to extend the current framework through
statistical advances that include efficient low-rank representation of model-
discrepancy and targeted use of independent ground measurements for prior
distributions. Developments will be performed within a test-bed created by an
uncertainty quantification group. There a surrogate forward model has been
developed that includes the essential physics but is simpler and computationally
faster than the forward models currently used. The results of the project are
anticipated to increase the accuracy of atmospheric measurements and enable
advances in several areas of science.
