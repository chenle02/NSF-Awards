The goal of this research is to combine classical and quantum mechanical
modeling to investigate the spectral characteristics of human visual pigments
and light harvesting complexes in purple bacteria, cyanobacteria, green algae,
and higher plants, as well as study processes in these systems subsequent to
light absorption. For this purpose, the newly available atomic structures of
some of these protein-pigment complexes will be used to construct physical
models, which will then be studied through molecular dynamics and quantum
chemistry, employing concepts of condensed matter and statistical physics.

Many organisms have evolved a visual and photosynthetic apparatus to efficiently
detect and harvest light. Interaction of light with matter, in particular living
matter, is governed by fundamental physics, especially quantum theory. As such,
vision and photosynthesis both pose conceptual challenges to biologists and
physicists alike. This provides genuine opportunities for interdisciplinary
activities between physics, chemistry, and biology, making also use of the
computational resources at the NSF centers. Accordingly, there exist exceptional
research training opportunities for participating graduate and undergraduate
students as well as postdoctoral associates arriving from any of these diverse
backgrounds. These activities will extend strong outreach activities that
already exist in our group. Quantum chemistry visualization tools will be added
to the freely available leading molecular graphics software VMD distributed by
our group to over 20,000 users and experiments related to the theme "Physics in
People, Physics in Plants" will be developed in collaboration with the UIUC
Physics Department's traveling science show for children, the Physics Van. This
project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences
and the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate.
