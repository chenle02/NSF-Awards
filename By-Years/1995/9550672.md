A four-week summer science camp for minority students will be offered over the
course of three years which will meet these objectives: a) teaches participants
natural science and mathematics topics through data collection and analysis; b)
instructs students about Alaskan Native traditional knowledge and use of the
environment; and c) introduces resource management and other science and
mathematics careers as an option for Juneau's Alaska Native youth. The camp is
the result of a working partnership of state and federal resource management
agency personnel, the science and mathematics faculty at the Juneau School
District and the University of Alaska Southeast, the Discovery Foundation, the
Chilkoot Culture Camp, and Earthwatch. Innovative follow-up activities will
create a network of learners (both teachers and students) who share the above
stated goals. The lessons we learn from developing integrated science and
mathematics curriculum and assessment tools that are relevant for minority
students and that are based in the recently adopted Alaska Student Performance
Standards, will be applied to District curriculum throughout the following
school year for use by reeular classroom teachers. The camp will provide a model
from which other school districts in Alaska may benefit. The project will
address equity issues by raising standards for mathematics and science education
for all students.
