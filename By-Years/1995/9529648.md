9529648 Gordon In this project, the PI will carry out phase 2 of ARLINDO
(Indonesian acronym for Indonesian Throughflow), called ARLINDO Circulation
(AC). The objective is to study the circulation and water mass stratification
within the Indonesian Seas in order to formulate a thorough description of the
source, spreading patterns, inter-ocean transport and dominant mixing processes.
AC is specifically aimed at resolving the throughflow transport and velocity
field across the central passages of the Indonesian Seas, and extending
hydrography to the eastern Banda Sea. Moorings are designed to measure the mean
and variable current and thermohaline stratification. The lead PI in this award
will provide overall guidance for the entire project, and carry out water mass
analysis from the CTD hydrography. The Co-PI will oversee the deployment,
recovery, and analysis of data from temperature pods, particularly to determine
the role and importance of internal waves in both mixing and transport of the
throughflow water.
