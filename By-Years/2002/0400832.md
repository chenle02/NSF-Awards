DMS-0400832 Shokurov

This award supports a project of Professor Shokurov. The proposed research deals
with certain singularities of algebraic varieties and log pairs, including ones
that appear in the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP). Their most fundamental
characteristics, such as discrepancies, thresholds, and complements, are
investigated with an aim to apply them to the LMMP in dimensions 4 and higher.
This process is set forth by some new and old conjectures. PI Shokurov intends
to finish the log termination for 4-folds, which completes the LMMP in dimension
4, and to obtain new results in dimensions 5 and higher. It is expected that
some fundamental results on singularities must precede the LMMP, but other
results, more advanced, could be interwoven. It is proposed to clarify this
situation and the relations between known and new concepts, methods, and
conjectures in the field of algebraic geometry toward better understanding of
the LMMP within its environment. The focus will be on discrepancies, thresholds,
lengths of extremal rays, the Alexeev-Borisovs and acc type conjectures, and on
confinement of saturated linear systems.

This is research in the field of algebra with methods and applications in
algebraic geometry. A termination for flips or flops, an important class of
standard transformation of geometrical objects, means finiteness of any sequence
of those transformations, and effectiveness of corresponding geometrical
algorithm from the computational point of view. Algebra and algebraic geometry
are very old, traditional areas of modern mathematics, but which have had a
revolutionary flowering in the past decades. In its origin, algebraic geometry
treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
namely polynomials, or be given in the 3-space by the simplest geometric
constructions, e.g., conic sections. Algebra is about these equations. Both
fields interacts with most of branches of mathematics, e.g., analysis, topology
and mathematical physics, with applications in those fields as well as in number
theory, physics, discrete and computational mathematics, and robotics.
