The project explores the geometry and topology of moduli spaces of hyperbolic
manifolds, the algebra of their fundamental groups, and applications to adjacent
areas. The central focus is the geometry and algebra of the mapping class group
of a closed surface, specifically the geometric and algebraic behavior of
subgroups and profinite completions of this group, and spaces upon which they
act. Much of the project is viewed through the lens of hyperbolic geometry,
whose theorems and techniques cast a seductive profile upon the mapping class
group. The core of the project falls into three parts: (1) continuation of an
ongoing project with C. Leininger, relevant to Gromov's Coarse Hyperbolization
Problem, to understand convex cocompact subgroups of mapping class groups of
surfaces; (2) continuation of a program of the PI, J. Brock, and C. Leininger to
produce purely pseudo-Anosov surface subgroups of mapping class groups and
surface bundles over surfaces with hyperbolic fundamental group; (3) work
devoted to completion of M. Boggi's program to establish the congruence subgroup
property for mapping class groups of surfaces, building upon prior work of the
PI.

A moduli space is a collection of geometric objects that is itself a geometric
object. A practical example is the collection of all possible arrangements of
cell phone towers on the surface of the Earth. One may use the distances between
individual towers to define a distance between two arrangements of towers, and
the collection of arrangements of towers becomes a geometric object itself, a
"space" of arrangements. Geographical constraints limit the feasible
configurations of towers, and understanding the geometry of the space of
feasible configurations can have direct bearing on which configurations provide
the best network coverage. The project is concerned with moduli spaces of
hyperbolic manifolds, of which the space of configurations of cell phone towers
on the Earth is a special example. There is an intriguing analogy between moduli
spaces of hyperbolic manifolds and the hyperbolic manifolds themselves. In other
words, there is a sense in which a collection of hyperbolic manifolds may be
roughly considered a hyperbolic manifold itself, creating a sort of information
feedback loop reciprocally informing the study of both the hyperbolic manifolds
and their moduli spaces. It is this analogy that lies at the heart of the
project.
