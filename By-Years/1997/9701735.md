9701735 Shelton This experimental research program focuses on distinct classes
of materials that display competing collective spin states. There is an emphasis
on materials that have an inter-relationship among their crystallographic
properties and their collective behaviors that are manifested at room
temperature and below. To determine the intrinsic physical properties, the
research stresses experiments on high-quality single crystals. Two families form
the core of these studies; namely, spin Peierls and spin gap compounds such as
CuGeO3, CaV4O9 and derivative compounds and colossal magneto-resistive compounds
such as (La,Ca,Bi)MnO3, Eu14MnSb11 and related materials. To ensure consistency
and uniformity in interpreting the experimental results, a great variety of
complementary experiments will be performed on the same single crystals. %%%
This experimental research program focuses on two families of materials that
show great promise for technological applications and are associated with
distinctive magnetic properties; namely, spin gap and colossal magneto-resistive
(CMR) compounds. Some examples are CuGeO3, CaV4O9, (La,Bi)MnO3, and Eu14MnSb14.
These materials are attracting great attention from the magnetic recording
industry. Due to the intrinsic complexity of these multi-component materials,
great emphasis is placed on using the highest quality crystals in this study.
Goals with practical aspects include: elemental substitutions to optimize the
performance characteristics; discovery of new materials to raise the critical
operating temperatures of the CMR compounds. ***
