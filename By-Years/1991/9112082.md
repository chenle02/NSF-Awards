The equipment in this grant is used for research in several projects, including
in particular: 1) SOx Removal and Concentration from Flue Gas Through and
Electrochemical Membrane, 2) Electrochemical Membrane H2S Removal from Fuel Gas
Streams, and 3) High Temperature H2S Fuel Cells. The equipment consists of a
controlled atmosphere furnace system for temperature to 1700>C. This system
consists first of a box furnace capable of researching temperature up to 1200>C
(Lindberg Model 51542-HR), an inert atmosphere retort which fits insides the
furnace chamber and is capable of withstanding temperatures up to 1090>C
(Lindberg Model 59154- H), and a programmable temperature control console which
is capable of controlling the heating and cooling rates, maintaining a set point
temperature, and preventing temperature overshoots (Lindberg Model 58114-P-B).
This equipment allows the processing of hygroscopic materials or reactive
materials over a wide temperature range. An additional higher-temperature
enclosure allows the processing of ceramic materials used in the experiments
outlined in the subsequent sections of this request (Lindberg Model 51644). The
results are important in chemical reactor technology and in environmental
applications.
