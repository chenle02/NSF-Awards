With the advent of large scale distributed storage systems, cloud computing and
commercial data storage applications, there is a renewed interest in the coding
and information theory in reliabile issues data storage. In large networked
databases, faster updates and quick repair requirements must be integrated with
reliable data storage protocols. These requirements bring new dimensions and
parameters to the traditional optimization problem of information theory.

In this project we propose, for the first time, a model of large-scale storage
that accounts for the topology of storage networks. Previously, storage topology
was never a concern of the code designers. Further, we study the update
efficiency and local repair (fast recovery) properties of error-correcting codes
suitable for storage. For all of these, we will analyze the fundamental limits
of systems, as well as propose explicit (fast algorithmic) constructions of
codes. Several tools from graph and network theory, combinatorics and
optimization theory will be leveraged to find performance limits and devise
coding algorithms.

By cutting redundancy and allowing faster processing, the codes developed from
this project will directly save energy consumption in data centers. Existing and
new collaborations of the principal investigator will facilitate industry
cooperation and increase the transition to practice of results generated from
this project. Elements of this endeavor will be integrated with the courses
taught by the principal investigator. The findings will be disseminated through
publications in peer-reviewed venues and made available in the form of technical
reports for public access on the investigator's webpage. Finally, motivated by
practical applications and extending across various disciplines, this project is
representative of an intriguing area of engineering science, and will attract a
diverse student base including undergraduate students.
