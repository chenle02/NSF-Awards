This award will support collaborative research in atomic physics between Dr. J.
R. Mowat, North Carolina State University at Raleigh and Dr. Reinhold Schuch,
Research Institute of Physics, Stockholm, Sweden. Dr. Mowat will carry out a
series of experiments on the simulation of electron cooling in the ion storage
ring, which is a completely new technology for atomic physics research. Dr.
Mowat's research is directed at experiments to be carried out on future ion
storage rings in the US, but, for the time being, it is necessary to keep in
close contact with the European projects which are already under construction.
Full realization of the potential of these storage rings requires that electron
cooling, a technique for enhancing the quality of stored beams, works for ions.
Realistic simulations of electron cooling are needed by ion storage ring
designers, and certain atomic physics effects must be carefully included in the
simulations. The work in Raleigh will concentrate on the improvement of computer
simulations which model electron cooling of stored ions and electron-ion
collisions experiments. The first summer in Sweden (1989) will be spent testing
the actual electron cooling device, while the second summer (1990) will be spent
carrying out atomic physics experiments with the newly completed storage ring.
