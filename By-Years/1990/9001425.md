Experimental studies at the organ and single vessel level suggest that
hemodynamic factors play a role in angiogenesis; however, the proposed factors
have not been proven to work in microvascular networks. This proposal focuses on
the hypothesis that the development of mature microvascular network from the
primitive neonatal vascular plexus (the process of network remodeling) is the
result of gradual adaptation of vessels to local mechanical forces, such as,
shear stress exerted by blood flow on the vessel wall and intravascular
pressure. To test the hypothesis in cerebral tissue, experiments will be
performed to study changes in intracortical and pial microvascular architecture
and vascular dimensions in two to five week old rats, and to correlate some of
these changes with wall shear stress, intravascular pressure and other
hemodynamic variables. Subsequently, a mathematical model will be developed to
test whether the architecture of intracortical microvascular networks can be
predicted from the microvascular architecture of the neonate and certain
properties of vascular adaptation learned from the experiments. These studies
will provide important new information on the role of hemodynamic factors in the
development of the cerebral microvascular bed which may influence growth and
repair of cerebral tissue.
