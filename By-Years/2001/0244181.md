Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0244181 Date:
1-15-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Levinger Institution: Colorado State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division
award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Colorado
State University for the summers of 2003-2005. Nancy E. Levinger is the program
director and Ellen Fisher is the co-PI. Eight students will carry out research
with faculty and research groups in the chemistry department over a ten-week
period. Recruitment will be targeted at students with limited or no research
opportunities at their own baccalaureate institutions. Collaborative research
opportunities will be undertaken with three minority serving partner
institutions: Colorado State University, Fort Lewis College and New Mexico
Highlands University. Students will work on their choice of projects available
from 23 potential faculty mentors in all areas of chemistry. Many of the
projects are interdisciplinary in nature. The students will also participate in
career skills activities: library resources, resume preparation, ethics, oral
and poster presentations. A capstone poster session will conclude the program.
