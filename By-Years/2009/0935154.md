This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University will
employ researchers to develop four new environmental laboratory modules that use
problem-based learning and case studies to teach new environmental
sustainability concepts. This method diverges from the traditional "step-by-
step" method currently used in laboratory courses and provides the opportunity
for students to use the concepts they learn to develop new ideas for engineering
systems. The student learning gains for this proposal will be assessed using
both qualitative and quantitative measures. The modules developed can be used
for a complete environmental laboratory course or individual modules can be used
for other STEM fields or modified for summer K-12 outreach programs. The project
team will develop hands-on activities for a local school and provide outreach
through programs that benefit multiple constituents in the engineering pipeline.
This work will help prepare more engineering graduates with a better
understanding of environmental sustainability needed to fill engineering jobs.
