The malarial parasites (>Plasmodium>) exploit a wide range of vertebrate hosts,
but the majority attack lizards. The population biology of lizard malaria has
only recently been investigated but even so information on the invertebrate
hosts are longely wanting. Of the two known cases, one is the Western fence
lizard (>Sceloporus> >occidentalis>) of Northern California,where the
invertebrate host has been identified as a phlebotominefly, >Lutomyzia>
>vexatrix>. This project will study in both field and laboratory thebehavior,
life history and distribution of the fly host.
