9508459 Seidel This Career Advancement Award supports a study of effects of
radiation damage on the performance of silicon semiconductor prototype pixel
detectors. These devices are candidates for tracking components in detectors to
be put into operation at future high-energy, high-luminosity accelerators. These
devices, with superior resolution, signal-to-noise and radiation hardness are
much preferred to earlier strip-configuration detectors now in use in many
experiments. Being rather a new technology, much R&amp;D needs to be done to
understand their operating characteristics. The P.I. will contribute to that
R&amp;D instrumentation effort. The P.I. will enhance her competence in
microelectronics techniques to improve her ability to make important
contributions in future experiments. ***
