This project provides funds to purchase equipment to fully implement the
introduction of the study of immunology. The equipment is basic, but allows
undergraduate biology and biochemistry students to master an understanding and
the techniques of cell culture. The first item, the CO2 incubator, is being used
to grow cell lines purchased for student study of B and T lymphocytes, cell
response to mitogens, and cellular communication. This incubator is of great
assistance in cell biology and microbiology courses, providing the opportunity
for advanced cell culture studies and the inclusion of animal virology
(components of these courses that are not currently possible). The second item,
the clean bench, improves the students' rate of success in their experimentation
by reducing possible contamination. The clean bench is also being used in other
undergraduate courses (cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, neurobiology,
microbiology). This equipment is also available for student independent
research, which is encouraged following completion of the immunology course.
