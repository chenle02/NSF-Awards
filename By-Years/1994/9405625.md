9405625 Bebout The proposed research will extend existing research to test the
utility of the N-isotopic system as a tracer of high temperature fluid-rock
interactions, both in metamorphic and magmatic systems. The project will (1)
constrain sources of fractionation in the N isotopic system (through melting,
devolatilization, etc.; primarily among N2, NH3, and NH4+), (2) identify
N-isotopic signatures characteristic of various magmatic, metamorphic, and
meteoric fluid sources, and (3) improve techniques for the more routine
extraction of N from silicate materials for isotopic analysis. The first two
goals will be achieved through study of N isotopic systematics for three field
areas: the Skiddaw Granite and Aureole, England, the Birch Creek Granite and
Aureole, California; and the Peninsula Ranges Batholith, California. The third
goal will involve continuation of experimentation with high-temperature
combustion and fusion techniques, further lowering of analytical blanks, and
improvement of techniques for mass spectrometry of extremely small N2 samples.
