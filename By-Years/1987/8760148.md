Rechargeable power sources which provide high energy densities at high rates
have been under active investigation for the past twenty-five years. While many
effective rechargeable positive electrode materials (the cathode) have evolved
over the past 10 years, progress in developing a practical secondary Li negative
(the anode) has been slow. The principal reason for the slow evolution of this
technology resides in the inability to cycle the Li electrode at high capacities
with high efficiency over a long period of time. This is because aprotic organic
solvents and supporting electrolyte salts are intrinsically reactive with Li.
Thus, the relative rates of a host of competing reactions ultimately determine
cell cycle life. The goal of this research is two-fold: to ascertain which
chemical degradation products ultimately influence cell safety and cycle life;
and to develop a commercial in situ electroanalytical sensor which specifies the
state of a cell at any point along its cycle life. In battery configurations, a
single cycle-life or voltage limited cell will unbalance the system causing
premature failure. A state of cell sensor would enable the end user to simply
replace a single bad cell rather than the entire battery unit. The PIs plan to
use computer-controlled square wave voltammetry (SWV) at two or more
microelectrodes to obtain information regarding homogeneous and heterogeneous
cell chemistries. Ni microelectrodes, embedded in the cell package, will be used
to directly sense the nature and degree of Li/electrolyte reactivity as a
function of cycling history. They are well qualified to complete this work and
their facilities are adequate. A Phase I SBIR grant is recommended.
