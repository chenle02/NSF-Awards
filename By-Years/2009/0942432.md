Interdisciplinary (99) Revision, implementation, and research of three
environmentally-focused, pedagogically innovative undergraduate courses are
being undertaken by a team of faculty from departments in the sciences,
engineering, and education. These courses - one in biology, one in engineering,
and one in geography - are part of a new Minor in Science and Mathematics
Education and central to CalTeach, a University of California-wide initiative to
recruit and better prepare STEM undergraduates for careers as secondary science
and mathematics teachers. The transformed courses highlight four core themes:
sustainability and the environment; connections across science, technology,
society, and education; evidence-based argumentation in science; and innovative
pedagogical strategies effective in K-12 schooling. The courses' collective
purpose is to shape the scientific ideas and pedagogical practices of
prospective science teachers - to help create a cadre of undergraduate science
students who bring both holistic and critical thinking to their teacher
education programs.
