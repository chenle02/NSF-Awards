9404336 Hardt The research is in the general area of geometric variational
problems and in particular focuses on the study of energy- minimizing maps of
Riemannian manifolds. The singularities of these maps and generalizations to
higher order energy densities will be considered. The research has applications
to liquid crystals and crystalline structures in materials science. ***
