Professors Curtis and Bade will continue their research into the underlying
structural relationship between the radical in a non-semisimple Banach algebra
and the algebra which contains it. This problem will be pursued in the context
of amenable or weakly amenable Banach algebras. Particular attention will be
paid to non-semisimple algebras arising from sets of non spectral synthesis for
group algebras of locally compact abelian groups and for the associated Beurling
algebras. Banach algebras are composed of abstract objects which can be added or
multiplied, but the exact form of the multiplication rule is purposely not
specified so that the results obtained apply to very many situations. Concrete
examples of Banach algebras are plentiful, and this research will help elucidate
their structure.
