The proposed research entails the development and evaluation of techniques for
analyzing time series generated by nonlinear systems. The algorithms which
result will be compared to existing filtering techniques using test data
generated by numerically integrating systems of well-characterized, chaotic,
nonlinear, first order, ordinary differential equations. Rissanen's information-
theoretic technique will be used to compare models generated by a variety of
techniques. As new techniques are developed, they will be applied to real data
derived from speech recognition experiments, hydrodynamic experiments, and
coherent solid state laser arrays.
