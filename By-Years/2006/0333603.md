This project will provide enhanced connectivity for Central State University,
Cedarville University, and Wilburforce University in Ohio by purchasing a twenty
year lease on fiber to interconnect them to the Ohio Supercomputer Center and
then to the Abilene/Internet2 advanced network. Central State University,
Cedarville University, and Wilberforce University are located within five miles
of one another in Southwestern, Ohio. The high bandwidth network will be used to
implement a cluster/grid computing test bed among the universities and OSC (Ohio
Supercomputer Center). Two of the three colleges are minority-serving. The
connection will support a number of new education initiatives both in computer
science and in other disciplines. There is excellent technical support from
OARnet and financial support from the Ohio Board of Regents.
