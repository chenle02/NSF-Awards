This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This three-year award will fund the continued research of
the CSUDH group at the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) neutrino observatory and
nucleon decay experiment including efforts involving the T2K long-baseline
neutrino oscillation project. They will continue their studies on neutron-
antineutron oscillations, will work on new nucleon decay analyses and will
participate in Super-K low energy, atmospheric neutrino, and particle
astrophysics research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the program
includes involving several CSUDH undergraduate students. This project will also
expand research options to students to include the accelerator-based particle
beam studies with T2K. This project will have broader impacts by allowing the
continued involvement of a student body that draws a majority of its members
from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences in ground breaking
fundamental research.
