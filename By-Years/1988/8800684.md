This study addresses the trophic position and productivity role of chlorophyll
retaining ciliates in the ocean. In order to understand the trophic position of
planktonic oligotrichous ciliates, factors that determine the ciliates'
dependence on both photosynthetic and phagotrophic modes of nutrition will be
studied in a limited number of laboratory experiments. The major focus will be
on documenting the incidence of chloroplast retention among ciliates in shelf,
slope, and oceanic waters, and compare it to existing data on its incidence in
neritic waters. Productivity studies based on radiolabeled carbon will be used
to estimate the contribution of planktonic ciliates to primary production.
Ciliates are a type of protozoan that are common in aquatic habitats. They are
considered to be part of the surface water fauna and to derive their food
requirements from consuming other planktonic organisms. However, previous work
by Stoecker has shown that about 40% of the oligotrichous ciliates in coastal
waters retain chloroplasts derived from ingested algae. Many of these ciliates
therefore, derive their nutrition from both photosynthesis (from the retained
algal chloroplasts), as well as from particle ingestion, and blur the usual
distinction between plant and animal nutrition. This work will investigate the
factors that control the relative contributions of these two feeding modes to
the nutrition of the ciliate, and determine how extensive this unconventional
feeding mode is in other parts of the ocean.
