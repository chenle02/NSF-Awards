This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at North Carolina State
University to purchase equipment which will provide intense, hands-on experience
for students in advanced cell and molecular biology laboratories. Funds will be
used to purchase an advanced light microscope, with accessories for phase
contrast, Hoffman modulation contrast, and fluorescence microscopy, and the
capabilities for recording the images using these techniques. Students will
probe the cytology of selected cell types and basic principles of cell biology
by employing current microscopical methods for the characterization and analysis
of cellular structure and function. This equipment will be a resource to be
shared by students from several courses and undergraduate research projects and
will enhance their training in modern optical techniques. The grantee is
matching this award with non-Federal sources.
