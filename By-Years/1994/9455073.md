This 16-day course offers 40 instructors of undergraduate marine sciences in
two-year and four-year institutions the opportunity to update their knowledge
and skills in a technologically impacted discipline. Participants will engage in
hands-on field exercises designed to familiarize them with current oceanographic
research techniques, many of which are adaptable to laboratory or classroom
demonstration at their home institutions. Participants will work with research
scientists, college and university professors, and experts in the private sector
engaged in state-of-the-art oceanographic investigations, technologies, or
teaching. Specific aims of the project are to provide at-sea experience in
oceanographic data collection and analysis; to conduct field exercises in local
marine habitats; to gain exposure to advanced technologies such as satellite
imaging; to interact with experts in marine science disciplines; and to develop
new instructional materials and teaching techniques. Hands-on field experience
in the areas of biological, physical, and geological oceanography will allow
participants to add breadth or depth as necessary to their marine science
training. This project is a joint effort of the University of San Diego, a
private four-year university, and the Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College
District, a public two-year institution.
