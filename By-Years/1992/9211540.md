Fuzzy Linguistic Control is fast emerging as an alternative to conventional
control techniques in situations where an explicit mathematical model of the
plant is unavailable or difficult to formulate, and/or when performance
objectives are not readily translated into standard control theoretic design
objectives and constraints. These control algorithms are, however, developed in
a rather ad hoc and unsystematic manner. This project will develop a set of
application selection criteria, stating the characteristics of the plant and the
class of performance objectives and constraints that warrant the application of
Fuzzy Linguistic Control, a set of design guidelines and implementation
standards, and finally a set of performance evaluation criteria, enabling an
methodical approach to evaluate the performance of Fuzzy Linguistic Control
algorithms.
