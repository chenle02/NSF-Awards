Attitudes are thought to serve many functions. They influence perception and
information processing. This proposal seeks to identify a function that to this
point has only ben suggested, namely, the facilitative effects of attitudes on
decision making in stressful contexts. We know from prior psychophysiological
work that tasks involving active coping with threat or challenging evoke greater
increments in heart rate, cardiac output, systolic blood pressure, and
myocardial contractility. The issue of this research is whether an individual
coping with a threat in a situation involving well-established attitudes will
show less reactivity than an individual in a novel (attitudinal) setting. The
strength of the proposal is that it melds psychophysiological measurement with
expertise in attitudinal measurement and induction to provide an answer to this
important question. The combination of these two approaches is novel and
important, and promises much information on the interaction of social cognition
(attitudes) and physiology. This research could add appreciably to out
understanding of the effects of stress on human functioning and performance.
