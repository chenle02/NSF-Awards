The Williams College Department of Physics and Astronomy will purchase
equipment to receive and study time and frequency signals from Global
Positioning Satellite transmitters. An existing atomic hydrogen maser frequency
standard will provide a stable frequency reference for comparing signals from
different satellites and for comparing via computer link the satellite signals
received at Williamstown, MA, and at the National Bureau of Standards in
Boulder, CO. Applications to navigation and solar system ranging and to time and
frequency transfer between remote sites will illustrate the power of this new
technology and its value to science. The telemetry technology will itself be
studied using the receiver's own diagnostic displays. Special teaching lab
modules using this equipment will illustrate the fundamental properties of space
and time that students in introductory physics courses have been learning in
class and will introduce them to state-of-the-art technology. The equipment will
provide a basis for a new course designed to introduce students not intending a
science major to modern notions of space and time and their relationship to
modern technology. The equipment will also be used by Senior Honors and other
students doing research projects with our experimental low temperature atomic
hydrogen maser. In addition to NSF support, participants will contribute
approximately an additional 15% toward the costs of the program.
