This project focuses on the issue of integrated versus segregated primary and
secondary schools and their effects on academic achievement. The first objective
of the study is to thoroughly document previous studies modeling academic
achievement as a function of the school's racial composition. Preliminary
investigation suggests that while there has been substantial research on
academic achievement of the general population and on the white male population,
little has focused on determinants of academic achievement of black students,
and on the effects of racial composition on academic
achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second objective of this study is to use
data from the National Survey of Black Americans (NSBA) to empirically
investigate the issue of the impact of school and neighborhood racial
composition on educational achievement. This allows an indirect test of the
effectiveness of actions stemming from the Brown v. Board of Education decision
to integrate schools. The NSBA data, however, lack one critical variable -
school quality. Therefore, the third and final objective of this study is to
determine a feasible method of collecting these data, to improve estimates of
the impact of racial composition &lt;br/&gt;
