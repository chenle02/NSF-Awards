0209935&lt;br/&gt;Cook&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is provided for the 2002
biannual Gordon Research Conference on Thin Film Mechanical Behavior. The
conference will be held July 14-19 at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.
Session topics include global and local film behavior, stress effects, time
dependent behavior, adhesion, contact mechanics, electromigration, and magnetic
and electrical effects. The Gordon Conference format will assure that cutting
edge research is discussed extensively in an informal atmosphere. NSF support
will be used primarily to support the attendance of graduate students and junior
researchers. The outcomes of the conference will be advances in basic science
and follow-on impact on industrial applications in this critical area as results
transfer to industry.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
