The long-range objective of this research program is to develop methods for the
correlation and prediction of the equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of pure
polymers and polymer-solvent solutions. This is to include effects of pressure
and temperature on density, vapor-liquid and liquid equilibria, and systems
containing multiple solvents and/or polymers. In order to achieve this goal,
extensive and reliable data are needed for the model developments. Data bases
are being assembled containing evaluated literature data for the various types
of systems. In order to pursue the development of a dependable group
contribution model, more accurate data will be collected. The laboratory
established under a previous NSF equipment grant is used for this purpose. A new
group contribution model is being developed based on a lattice-fluid model of
the polymer-solvent systems. The program is being coordinated with a
complementary effort at the Technical University of Denmark.
