This SGER proposal requests support for an experimental campaign to perform
correlative studies of lightning and lightning-induced ionospheric effects using
the Arecibo Observatory (AO) UHF and co-axial VHF radars, a VHF radio
interferometer, and a VLF receiver. The campaign will be performed during a
three-week period in August-September 2001 in Puerto Rico.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The radar data taking modes necessary for the proposed
effort exist as do the basic analysis and display routines. The proposed program
will employ combination of instruments which has never been used before and
uniquely qualifies for SGER program as small-scale, exploratory research, which
can potentially lead to major discoveries in the fields of lightning physics and
lightning induced lower ionospheric effects. &lt;br/&gt;
