An experimental program is proposed aimed at discovering methods to achieve good
translational and orientational order in 2D arrays of block copolymer domains,
methods that could ultimately lead to nanopatterns that could be transferred to
underlying substrates. An assisted self-assembly scheme is proposed whereby the
edges of regions defined by optical lithography serve to register and template
the order. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the ordering and disordering
processes in melts of both single layer and multilayer films of spherical domain
block copolymers and their belends with homopolymers in such regions. While most
experiments will use locally flat substrates with sharp edge structures, the
equilibrium order on surfaces with Gaussian curvature (positive and negative)
will be explored as well. Assisted self-assembly is also expected to work for
cylindrical domain block copolymer films with cylinders normal to the film
surface. Here controlling they cylinder orientation (with electric fields or
surface interactions) while maintaining lateral templating by edge structures is
the major challenge. These experiments will be supplemented with field theoretic
numerical simulations of 2D block copolymer ordering in collaboration with Glenn
Fredrickson at UCSB. Strong efforts will be made to involve undergraduates in
the research in several ways. A partnership is proposed with faculty at Harvey
Mudd College, an undergraduate institution in Claremont, CA, that will allow
their undergraduates to pursue senior research projects that contribute to this
research. These students will have access to the outstanding experimental
facilities at UCSB as well as regular Web conferences with the team at UCSB. At
least one undergraduate chemical engineer at UCSB will be involved during the
academic year and at least one summer participant will be sought from the
various REU programs on the UCSB campus. A web site will be developed as a
learning resource for college and high school teachers, allowing them to teach
the principles of crystals and defects using the real 2D block copolymer array
structures as model systems. Strong emphasis will be placed on developing
graduate student communication and presentation skills, especially in the
context of national and even international meetings. Interactions are expected
to develop with nanotechnology groups at various industrial concerns interested
in utilizing the results of this research.
