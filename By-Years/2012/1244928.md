This project is developing online (video) learning materials for engineering
design to enable an instructor to "flip" the traditional classroom processes and
practices. Engineering design is critically important for all engineering
programs. The process of classroom flipping requires finding, or creating,
sufficiently rich online learning materials that students access outside the
classroom. After studying the online materials, students enter an active
classroom where the information is discussed and activities occur. Because there
are inadequate design materials available online, this project holds promise of
advancing engineering education through the creation of quality materials for
this purpose.

The online video materials under development can be adopted by virtually any
university that is teaching engineering design principles. A further outcome is
a set of online quizzes to help monitor student understanding of the online
materials. Finally there are thirty in-class exercises to support active
learning in the classroom.

The project also includes an assessment and evaluation plan that can inform the
education community about the efficacy of these online modules for engineering
design.
