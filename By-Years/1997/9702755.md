The current information revolution is stimulating the emergence of new computing
devices, here called network appliances, that connect to the information
infrastructure, interact with the real world, and can be programmed to perform
custom functions. The limited resources available on most appliances will create
a need for in-network servers supplying CPU cycles and storage. These servers
will host proxy services as well as application specific gateways. This project
will research the design and implementation of computer systems for network
appliances and the related in- network servers. This includes developments at
the level of the operating system, programming languages, and the run- time
system. More concretely, the research will develop around the Secure Language
Kernel (SLK) operating system being developed. SLK relies on the type safety
properties of the language system in order to enforce protection boundaries
between applications and the OS itself, which means that all code can run in a
single address space, and at a single hardware privilege level. The expected
benefits of this approach are higher resource efficiency, seamless system
extensibility, and flexibility in the form of fine grain sharing across
protection domains.***
