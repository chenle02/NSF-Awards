This research focuses on two main themes: (i) the unification of image
segmentation methods in a framework based on scale space an differential
equations, and (ii) the texture segmentation using Gabor filters and energy
functions with discontinuities. It is intended that the resulting techniques
will utimately be suitable for VLSI implementation. The goal of (i) is to
provide a mathematical framework within which many current approaches to image
segmenttion can be compared. The goal of (ii) is to devslop a model for texture
segmentation using the energy function approach with Gabor filters. Interactions
between filters will allow the system to deal with slowly varying changes in the
orientation of textures, such as ocur in foreshortening.
