This award provides partial funding for a one-day conference on Expectancy
Effects, Nonverbal Communication, and Research Methodology held at Harvard
University on May 10, 1997. Conference participants will discuss the emergence
of new perspectives on issues that owe their origin, direction, or inspiration
to the work of Robert Rosenthal. The conference will be divided into three sets
of brief talks focusing on the three identified conference themes. In addition,
two longer public talks will be widely advertised both within the professional
organizations serving social psychology and to scholars in the Boston area.
