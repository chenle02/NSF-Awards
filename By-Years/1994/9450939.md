Students will be introduced via laboratory course work to textile testing and
product analysis. Testing is extremely important in the textile industry from
fibers through to finished garments to ensure that quality and performance is
maintained. Because students could possibly be employed in a number of different
areas of the retail or textile industries, knowledge of how a particular product
eventually becomes available to consumers is highly desirable. Throught the use
of a tensile tester, students will be introduced to the myriad of different
types of tensile testing that fibers, yarns, fabrics, components, and garments
may undergo. In addition, students will be able to evaluate the effects of
routine finishes normally applied to textile substrates (i.e. dyeing, scouring,
bleaching, shrink proofing, mercerizing, etc.). Also students can be introduced
to the phenomena of photo degradation and the deleterious effects it has on
certain textile substrates through chemical and physical analysis of the
substrates' properties.
