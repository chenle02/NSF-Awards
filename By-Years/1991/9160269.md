Compared to current technology, the required refrigerators must be more compact
and reliable, require no maintenance or skill to operate, achieve much longer
operating lifetimes, and pump up to several watts of heat, yet cost only a
fraction of the rest of the electronic system. These objectives are not achieved
in practice due to mechanical, thermal, and fluid flow irreversibilities which
are inherent in conventional design, materials, and manufacturing processes.
Through silicon micromachining, fundamentally lossy mechanical components can be
eliminated and special materials properties can be exploited, while thermal and
fluid flow contributions to entropy generation can be controlled. Under current
NSF SGER funding the P.I. designed an experimental apparatus. The construction
of this apparatus is the goal for Phase I. Successful results will provide a
foundation for the engineering of Stirling microrefrigerators, that will expand
its range of applications for cold electronics. Stirling microfrigerators would
increase the speed of computer processors and memories; and reduce noise in
radio and microwave detectors, amplifiers, and filters; reduce the bulk of
infra-red detection and imaging systems; and facilitate the commercialization of
high Tc superconducting electronics.
