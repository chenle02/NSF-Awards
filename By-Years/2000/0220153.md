TITLE: Development of an integrated computational and experimental approach to
predict biological networks in Halobacterium sp.

The extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, whose sequenced
genome contains 2,630 genes, is being used as a model for predicting biological
networks in microbial systems. The genes are compared across species to identify
putative protein interactions by integrating identified protein/protein
interactions from orthologous proteins, domain gene fusions, gene localization,
and mRNA and protein expression data using both existing and new algorithms. The
functional biomodules are being determined by integrating this information with
additional information from biochemical pathways, shared promoter motifs, and a
new protein distance algorithm. These approaches are then integrated into a
visualization and integration platform, Cytoscape, being developed at the
Institute for Systems Biology (ISB).
