This research examines the influence of temperature on the speed and force of
muscle contraction. Most biological rate processes are strongly influenced by
temperature and are inhibited at low body temperatures. This research will
examine the extent to which locomotor and feeding ability can proceed and be
effective over a wide range of temperatures. The extend to which these functions
are directly limited by muscle contractile kinetics will be determined. "Cold-
blooded" vertebrates (those which vary temperature with environments) are used
as model systems because of the ease with which their body temperatures can be
manipulated.
