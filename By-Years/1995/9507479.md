9507479 Coordinated movement requires both a neural plan and information about
the biomechanics of muscles and skeleton. The implementation of the plan is a
pattern of activation of motor neurons and muscles that produces the movement.
The goal of this research is to understand the construction of implementation
patterns that control complex movement, and the biomechanical constraints under
which they work. The model system is prey capture by frogs. Prey capture is easy
to stimulate in the laboratory, and is a complex movement that requires rapid
coordination of several pairs of antagonistic muscles. The research uses a
multidisciplinary approach combining biomechanics and neurobiology to determine
how the design of the musculoskeletal system interacts with muscle activity to
produce movement. Comparisons within and between species that differ in size
will show how muscle activity and movement patterns are related to body size
among animals of similar shape. The morphology of the feeding apparatus, the
movements associated with feeding behavior, and the pattern of muscle activation
will be analyzed simultaneously. These studies will provide insight into how
muscle activation strategies change with body size. A second approach will
compare musculoskeletal design, muscle activity, movement patterns and feeding
performance among species that differ in shape. This will show how
musculoskeletal design and muscle activity patterns have evolved to produce
particular movement patterns and performance characteristics like speed,
accuracy, and efficiency. The results of this research will have broad
implications for understanding the neural control of movement and its evolution.
