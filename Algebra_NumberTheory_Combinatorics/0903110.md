In recent years, it has become clear that many interesting problems, in
particular problems in arithmetic, quantum chaos and the theory of L-functions,
may be profitably reduced to questions concerning equidistribution of points or
measures on homogeneous spaces. These questions regarding equidistribution can
be approached from many angles. Two theories which have proved to be
particularly well-suited to study such questions are the spectral theory of
automorphic forms, which is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and
the theory of dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more
general flows on these homogeneous spaces. Recently there has been considerable
progress involving tools such as special value formulae for L-functions, and
(partial) classification results for measures invariant under higher rank torus
actions. Particularly exciting is the possibility, already realized in some
instances, of combining these techniques. The purpose of the proposed FRG is to
investigate further this circle of ideas, which we believe has the potential to
impact many other problems related to the above. The result of these
investigations will be a deeper understanding of the dynamics of group actions
on homogeneous spaces, of the analytic theory of automorphic forms, and the
(sometimes unexpected) applications to problems of arithmetic nature.

The present project is concerned with a surprising link between two classical
fields of mathematics of quite disparate origin: number theory and dynamics. The
study of number theory began thousands of years ago, motivated, in significant
part, by questions about prime numbers. On the other hand, ergodic theory and
dynamics are mathematical fields of more recent provenance, which arose from
studying the long-term evolution of complicated deterministic processes -- such
as planetary motion. It is a striking fact (which has only recently begun to be
heavily exploited) that, in certain contexts, ideas from ergodic theory interact
very deeply with classical problems in number theory. This project will enhance
our understanding of this inter-relation and how we can combine knowledge from
both of these fruitful disciplines effectively.
