This research will investigate how marsh plant communities with different
dominant species might function to structure microbial communities in marsh
sediments, thereby altering biogeochemical patterns, CO2 uptake (or release) and
processing of atmospheric N inputs resulting from human activities. The role of
estuarine marshes, such as those studied here, in regulating C and N cycles is
of global importance. Moreover, determining whether marshes dominated by
different plant species (Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis) process
CO2 and N inputs differently via their effects on sediment microbial communities
addresses an important scientific question. t mechanisms, root porosity, and in
sediment microbial community composition and functional ability. This study
represents a novel approach to improving understanding of wetland plant-microbe
interactions. It could contribute information useful designing coastal wetland
restoration projects and management efforts.
