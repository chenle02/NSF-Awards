The goal of this research is to expand our knowledge of communication theory,
information theory, and signal processing, and to make an immediate impact in
practical wireless communication systems and networks. The research builds upon
the general theory and code design strategy for space-time coding. The
mathematical methods, algorithms, and concepts developed in this research is
applicable and initiates new activities in many different areas of
communications and applied mathematics. These areas include modem design,
equalization, beam-forming, linear algebra, and so&lt;br/&gt;on. Of course, the
immediate impacts are in increasing the data rates of wireless communication
systems as well as advancing our understanding of the behavior of multiple-input
multiple-output&lt;br/&gt;channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, there is a
fundamental theoretical limit which prohibits us from designing full-rate
orthogonal space-time block codes for more than two transmit antennas. Also, the
available codes have not achieved the best performance claimed by information
theory, so there exists a gap between what is possible, and the state of codes
today. We seek to eliminate this gap by designing new classes of codes that
provide full diversity, high rate, small complexity, high performance and
mathematically interesting structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
