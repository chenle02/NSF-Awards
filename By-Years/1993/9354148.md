9354148 Diaz The Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) will produce a comprehensive
institutional development program that will provide a major thrust in its
science and mathematics (S&M) programs over the next five to eight years. This
program will produce significant, long-term quantitative and qualitative
advances in S&M education that sill significantly increase the number and
quality of minority students who complete BS degrees and advance to S&M graduate
studies. This process, and the program that will follow, will be developed with
the full support of the Ana G. Mendez University System (AGMUS) of which UMET is
part, and in collaboration with several Department of Energy (DOE) National
Laboratories, Puerto Rico colleges and universities, and the support and
collaboration of local industry. The plan will involve: strengthening and
expanding existing BS degree programs; the creation of at least three new BS
degree programs; further increasing the number and quality of S&M faculty;
further enhancing student support and enrichment programs, including a major
effort to expand and enhance undergraduate research; and completing the
development of S&M instructional and undergraduate research facilities. The UMET
S&M development model is intended, and will be designed, to create a secure
pathway for mathematics and science students from pre- college through the
undergraduate-to-graduate transition, focusing specifically on key transition
points in the S&M pipeline. Once implemented, this program is intended to create
and validate a model for institutional development in S&M for other four-year
institutions in Puerto Rico and for minority institutions throughout the
mainland. UMET projects that it will be able to increase the number of BS majors
from 400 to over 800, and BS graduates from 30 to 224 per year, with at least
100 going on to graduate school in S&M either in Puerto Rico or on the mainland.
