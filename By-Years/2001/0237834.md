Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are an important&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic
device in a variety of fields. This project studies&lt;br/&gt;techniques for
rigorous analysis of the convergence properties of&lt;br/&gt;Markov chains. The
emphasis is on refining probabilistic,&lt;br/&gt;analytic and combinatorial
tools (such as coupling, log-Sobolev,&lt;br/&gt;and canonical paths) to improve
existing algorithms and develop&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for important
open problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems arising in computer science,
discrete mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;and physics are of particular interest, e.g.,
generating random&lt;br/&gt;colorings and independent sets of bounded-degree
graphs,&lt;br/&gt;approximating the permanent, estimating the volume of
a&lt;br/&gt;convex body, and sampling contingency tables. The
project&lt;br/&gt;also studies inherent connections between
phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions in statistical physics models and
convergence&lt;br/&gt;properties of associated Markov
chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is developing a new graduate
course on MCMC methods.&lt;br/&gt;
