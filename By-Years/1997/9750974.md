The Principal Investigator will redesign the undergraduate Physics laboratory
curriculum at Cuyamaca College to increase the retention of underrepresented
students (Native Americans, Blacks, Hispanics and women) in its Engineering
Program. The Principal Investigator will institute a combination of the
nationally recognized microcomputer-based laboratory curriculum and incorporate
modern instrumentation and laboratory equipment. Specific curricular changes
will be made in the areas of kinematics, dynamics and thermodynamics. In
conjunction with the redesigned curriculum, the Principal Investigator will
implement learning communities into the Physics laboratory experience. Advanced
Engineering students will work with at-risk, underrepresented students to
develop collaborative learning, teamwork and group problem-solving skills.
