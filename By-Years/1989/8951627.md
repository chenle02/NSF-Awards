Villanova will purchase a thin film fabrication facility consisting of three
electron guns and a computer controlled shutter housed in an ultrahigh vacuum
chamber. This facility will enable the Physics Department to offer students a
chance to learn the art of thin film fabrication and application. The facility
will be used in five laboratory courses and three research project-related
courses. The presence of such a facility will provide the capability of making
film samples, superlattices, quantum wells, semiconductor devices and tunneling
junctions, as well as designing integrated circuits and electronic components
needed for laboratory courses. This facility will upgrade these courses and
allow students to learn applications of thin films, useful in research and in
applications in industry. The university will provide funds equal to 106% of the
award toward the operation of the project.
