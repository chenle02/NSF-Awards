The ETHOS (Engineers for Technical Opportunities for Service-Learning) Scholars
project awards scholarships to primarily underrepresented minorities and women
undergraduate engineering students in all disciplines. Through its emphasis on
Sustainable Innovation Learning Communities, this scholars program seeks to: i)
provide both the necessary mission, community, and support needed to increase
enrollment of underrepresented minorities and women into engineering; ii)
increase retention of this population through graduation; iii) pilot integrated
sustainable engineering curriculum which can serve as a national model for
similar practice elsewhere; and iv) enhance relationships with employers seeking
graduates prepared&lt;br/&gt;to meet the most critical national and
international need for engineering in a resource constrained world with global
environmental consequences of technology development and usage.
