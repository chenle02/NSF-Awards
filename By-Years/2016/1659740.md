This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at
the Rochester Institute of Technology. The first observations of gravitational
waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) have
opened up the dawn of the gravitational wave astronomy age. Soon, we will see
the birth of multimessenger astronomy, as gravitational wave and electromagnetic
observations are combined with theoretical models to give us new insights into
astrophysical phenomena that were previously unavailable to science. A key step
in moving this project forward will be the training of students that will form
the next generation of scientific leaders. This REU site, dedicated to the study
of multimessenger astrophysics, will help groom the next generation of
scientists in the many and diverse skills that will allow them to pursue careers
in this growing field as well as many others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in
the REU program will learn about and perform research on topics spanning
gravitational wave detection and data analysis, observational astronomy and
astrophysics, visualization of scientific data, and theoretical and numerical
modeling. Working in pairs, each supervised by a committed research mentor,
students will spend ten weeks performing research and participating in a wide
array of professional and scientific enrichment activities that include
developing presentation skills, acquiring familiarity with academic literature,
and learning to access and use workstations and supercomputers to perform
numerical simulations. In addition, the site will have a particular focus on
deaf and hard of hearing students, and will offer all of the REU students the
chance to learn American Sign Language through a specialized "bootcamp",
building community between hearing and deaf students in the program.
