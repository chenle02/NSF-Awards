The purpose of this workshop is to address concerns regarding security in mobile
and wireless networks. These concerns are due to the increase in potential
damage that can be done to these networks, from both traditional security
threats that have not been adequately addressed by the very large-scale
distributed networks now in place, and new security threats inadvertently
created from the new services available in these networks. Although solutions to
the traditional link-layer wireless communication security issues seem to be
more or less available, modern network-focused security threats demand
additional research efforts. In view of this, the workshop objective is to
identify the critical issues in the discipline and to develop a consensus-based
document that will provide a foundation for implementation and standardization
as well as further research. This International Workshop on Research Challenges
in Mobile and Wireless Networks Security and Privacy will be held in conjunction
with the INFOCOM 2005 in Miami, Florida, 13 March 2005, so that top researchers
and practitioners from various areas will present to discuss and analyze the
pertinent issues.
