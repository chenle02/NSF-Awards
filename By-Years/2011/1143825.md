The Software Design and Productivity (SDP) Cross Agency and National Needs
Summit will be held at the NASA Ames Conference Center, September 20-23, 2011.
The summit is organized and sponsored by SDP Coordinating Group within the
National Coordination Office (NCO) for Networking and Information Technology
Research and Development (NITRD). The purpose of this summit is to inform a
crosscutting SDP research and technology agenda. It will provide a forum for
bringing together policy makers, stakeholders, visionaries, and R&amp;D leaders
for software design and productivity research. The summit will focus on the key
issues of the SDP mission: to advance software engineering concepts, methods,
techniques and tools that result in more usable, dependable, cost-effective, and
sustainable software-intensive systems. This grant will reimburse academic
participants for travel and accommodations.
