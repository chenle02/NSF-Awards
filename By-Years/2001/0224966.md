This project focuses on the study of the eigenvalue problem in geometry,
combinatorial optimization, and information organization. As part of this
research, efficient algorithms will be developed for computing and approximating
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large class of matrices that arise in graph
theory, computational geometry, scientific computing, and Internet applications.
The following topics will be investiagated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eigenvalues/eigenvectors for graph partitioning: The main
theoretical and algorithmic questions are: how to properly use
eigenvalues/eigenvectors to find the best possible partition in a graph, and
what is a tight &lt;br/&gt;upper bound on the eigenvalue for graphs such as
meshes, planar graphs, bounded genus graphs and &lt;br/&gt;N-body graphs.
Constructive answers to these questions can be used to design efficient
algorithms and software for graph partitioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric
methods for eigenvector approximation: The primary goal is to understand whether
geometry methods can be developed and used to speed up the approximation of
eigenvectors. Many graphs such as planar graphs, finite element meshes, and
nearest neighborhood graphs come with a geometric characterization. One can use
their geometric structures in the solution and approximation of the eigenvalue
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of the eigenvalue problem to data
clustering and information organization: The objective is to relate the work on
spectral graph partitioning to the singular value decomposition based method for
data clustering, such as the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). These spectral
techniques for term-document matrices has enjoyed empirical success, but had
heretofore been without rigorous mathematical explanation. The project is
expected, by extending our techniques for spectral partitioning, to provide
&lt;br/&gt;a mathematically sound framework and efficient software for these
important problems in information retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;
