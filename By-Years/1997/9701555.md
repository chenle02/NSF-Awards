Suchan, Trudy Pennsylvania State University Categories are necessary for making
sense of the everyday world of the individual for purposes of spatial analysis
and mapping. This doctoral dissertation research will focus on the internal
nature of a category for which data are often aggregated, analyzed and mapped-
rural. The case study explores, through data collected by in-depth interviews,
common mental categorizations of rural, and compares these to the formalized
conceptions that underlie maps about rural issues. Informal and formal
definitions are examined in terms of prototype category theory. Implications of
identified differences are discussed, particularly when the formal categories
are the basis of information presented to the public.
