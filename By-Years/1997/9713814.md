This study proposes to conduct scientific research and educational outreach to
native peoples and residents of Bering Island, Commander Islands, Russia. The PI
will travel there in summer 1997 for several closely related activities,
including preservation of existing exhibits and development of a new exhibits
focused on the extinct, formerly endemic species, Steller's Sea Cow
(Hydrodamalis gigas) and Spectacled Cormorant (Phalacrocorax perspicillatus).
These exhibits will serve as a centerpiece of a public education program
designed to inform local inhabitants about the ecology and natural history of
their island. The PI also plans to excavate sites where bones of the Sea Cow and
Spectacled Cormorant are found, document for the first time the locations and
stratigraphy of the sites, and recover osteological material of both species
which are extremely rare in collections. The sites on the Commander Islands are
particularly valuable to science for several reasons: access has been extremely
limited and the sites are nearly intact, the extinctions are historically
documented by eyewitness accounts and more information on the biology of these
species will be valuable in understanding how sensitive island species are to
impacts. The PI will take advantage of a unique opportunity to visit these
formerly closed islands, and because these opportunities are time sensitive, the
PI have chosen to submit a proposal of limited scope under the guidelines of the
Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program.
