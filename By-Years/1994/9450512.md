9450512 Brunkhorst The American Geological Institute (AGI) proposes to
coordinate the development of earth science curriculum and student learning
materials for grades 7-12. In Planning Earth Science Education in the Community
-- Understanding Our Environment, AGI will build on the strength of very
successful earth science education projects, the AGI Earth Science Curriculum
Project materials and Earth Science Content Guidelines Grades K-12, as well as
major science education curriculum and reform programs such as AAAS' Project
2061. EarthComm will provide a complete educational program in the earth
sciences that includes learning materials, teacher resources (both materials and
teacher networks), and assessment tools for a hands- on, student inquiry-based,
instructional program that is interdisciplinary and allows implementation in a
modular format. The proposed project will also target the development of a
strong mentor program to enhance the science teaching capabilities and
leadership skills of teachers.
