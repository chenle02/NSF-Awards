This award will provide continuing support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site at The University of Minnesota. The ten-week program will
emphasize student participation in the research activities of faculty affiliated
with the Center for Research in Learning, Perception, and Cognition in the
College of Liberal Arts. Twelve undergraduates will participate, half from
private liberal arts colleges in the state of Minnesota and half from the
University; they will be expected to have completed their sophomore or juniors
years. Students will: (1) assist with faculty member's research including
opportunities to work as a member of a research team, (2) complete an
independent research project, the final products of which will be a written
report and a presentation to peers and participating faculty, and (3)
participate in a multi- disciplinary seminar. Seminar activities include
presentations by program faculty and faculty in related areas campus wide,
laboratory tours, and lectures on research tools and design. The program will
therefore include opportunities for the students to learn specific research
methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own research, and to
examine broad conceptual and methodological issues relating to psychology and
the cognitive sciences. Participation in social/cultural events as well as
common housing in a University dorm will help foster a strong community of
students.
