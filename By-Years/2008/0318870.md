This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design and
build a reloadable printhead for ink-jet deposition of biological fluids into
microarrays. Production of mid range microarrays (hundreds of different fluids)
is not best addressed by the existing tools. Photolithography is expensive and
with long turnaround time and existing single jet devices have large volumes.
The reloadable printhead will fill this market segment. The first step in this
project will be to optimize the geometrical dimensions of the printhead using
numerical simulations and models for a low loading volume and for best
operation. Special printheads will be built for evaluation and simulation
verification. The second step would consist of the actual fabrication of the
devices. Functionality of the fabricated printheads will be verified using a set
of oligonucleotide probes designed to detect polymorphism in the Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) genes. Current research indicates a correlation between the class
II HLA polymorphism and the occurrence of cervical cancer. Microarrays produced
with a reduced set of probes will be fabricated and hybridized with
prefabricated target DNA. A design of a full probe set will be made considering
the use of the reloadable printhead to fabricate microarrays for investigating
genetic susceptibility of cervical cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
application of this project is in the area of microarrays. On completion of the
work through Phase I and Phase II, revenues are expected to be obtained through
sales of the printhead and printing systems for microarray production, and
through actual production .
