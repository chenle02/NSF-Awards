This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support studies at the interface of
engineering and molecular physiology. The research will combine stochastic
process analysis with molecular experimentation to understand the mechanisms of
calcium channel opening. The award also will support the teaching activities of
the investigator. The activities include writing a textbook that systematizes
the application of engineering techniques to the understanding of molecular
electrophysiology problems and the development of computer simulations of
channel behavior.
