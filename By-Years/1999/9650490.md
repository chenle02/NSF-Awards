This project addresses a need for graduates with an ecosystem/landscape
perspective who can integrate data from a variety of sources when addressing
environmental issues that cut across the boundaries of traditional disciplines.
Many such problems can be best defined hierarchically within the context of
watersheds. The project incorporates a watershed theme into selected courses in
biology, geology, environmental chemistry, and environmental science. Field and
laboratory activities in these courses are directed at local drainages and may
provide a basis for subsequent independent undergraduate research. The target
audience is the growing number of majors in environmental science and
environmental policy, but students in biology, chemistry, and geology also
benefit. The department anticipates increased production of undergraduate
publications and conference presentations, but it also expects that more of the
student research may address real needs defined by local resource management
agencies.
