9713985 Yang This award is aimed to develop an iso-phote based methodology for
tool path generation. Based on this methodology, interference-free tool path
generation algorithms will be developed utilizing part geometric features. These
algorithms will be evaluated and experimentally tested in the generation of tool
paths for 3axis machining of composite surfaces and 5-axis flank machining of
free-form surfaces. Comparisons will be made with existing tool-path generation
algorithms including those based on iso-parametric machining, iso-planner
machining, and constant scallop-height machining. The iso-phote based tool-path
generation methodology is a new approach that is worth exploring. It could
potentially offer significant advantages over other approaches used by the
existing CAD/CAM systems for machining of complex parts with free-form and
composite surfaces.
