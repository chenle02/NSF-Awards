This project will use a recently developed Non-Linear Fore- Free (NLFF) model
(Wu et tal. 1990) to study the magnetic configuration and structure of sunspots
and active regions. The PI will use magnetogram observations obtained with the
MSFC vector magnetograph (photosphere) together with correlated observations in
UV and X-rays (transition region and corona) from SMM. Supporting observations
in H> and in radio wavelength also will be used. The main objectives are: (i) to
derive the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and physical structure
in well-observed sunspots and active regions, based on multi-level observations
using the NLFF model. (ii) to compare the calculated magnetic field
configurations, i.e. 3-D current system and loop structures with those observed
in UV and X-rays in order to identify local regions of high current density and
field gradient in various atmospheric levels that are associated with flare
energy build up and release processes. By comparing the model calculations with
observations, the project will test the capability and accuracy of the newly
developed NLFF model, and (iii) further develop regularization technique for
NLFF calculations. #
