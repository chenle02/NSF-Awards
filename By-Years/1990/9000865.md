Professor Gilbert E. Pacey and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Miami University (Ohio) are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend twelve (12) weeks each summer actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. Projects range from analysis of plant
phenolics to fabrication of PVC-membrane ion selective electrodes. All projects
will be designed such that students may continue the work back at their home
institutions under the guidance of a faculty member at that institution. Career
information will be provided by industrial, academic, and government chemists
during organized seminars. All students will have an opportunity to participate
in a Chemical Abstracts Literature Search Workshop.
