The purchase of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument will enable
undergraduate students to become familiar with state of the art electrophoresis
methodology and with computerized data acquisition and instrument control.
Experiments using the instrument will replace or greatly enhance experiments
presently performed in two upper level chemistry courses, Instrumental Analysis
and General Biochemistry. The instrument will also be used in undergraduate
research. In Instrumental Analysis, commercial products will be analyzed for
organic acid composition, demonstrating the usefulness of CE in the analysis of
small molecules. This experiment will replace one in which ion chromatography is
used to determine the inorganic ion composition of tapwater. In General
Biochemistry, CE will initially be used to add two new experiments to the
laboratory course: 1) enzymatic and chemical digestion of a protein followed by
separation and quantitation by free zone CE and 2) a protein-substrate binding
analysis by affinity CE techniques followed by mathematical treatment of the
data by the method of Scatchard. These experiments will allow the students
exposure to both additional conventional and computational biotechniques. It is
likely that CE will assume increasing importance in the undergraduate teaching
laboratory. We intend to share the results of our experiences both through
journal publication and presentations at regional and national scientific
meetings.
