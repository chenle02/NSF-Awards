Buss 9315082 This Accomplishment-Based Award will allow Dr. Buss to continue
work on colony integration in the clonal marine benthos. The primary objective
in recent years has been an attempt to understand the causal basis of the
correlation between growth morphology and life history in clonal organisms. Dr.
Buss has (1) demonstrated that hydroid gastrovascular circulation is controlled
by the spatial distribution of polyps, which act as pumps, and stolons, which
conduct gastrovascular fluid between polyps, (2) developed techniques that
permit automated collection of data on gastrovascular dynamics and (3)
demonstrated that perturbation of gastrovascular circulation generates
predictable alterations in growth morphology and life history. Dr. Buss will
develop a computer model that will predict the growth morphology and life
history characteristics of model colonies and will validate this model
experimentally. Together with work on establishing that expression of pattern-
forming genes is elicited by transduction of hydrodynamic signals, he will
expect to unambiguously establish the causal basis of the relationship between
growth morphology and life history. ****
