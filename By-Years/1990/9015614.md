This project is a study of organic bromine chemistry in the lower arctic
atmosphere, particularly in relation to tropospheric destruction of ozone. It
has been observed that shortly after the arctic sunrise, surface ozone
concentrations decline from a late winter maximum to near zero before recovering
to moderately high summer values. There is also strong evidence which implies
that the primary cause for the minimum is the photolytic production of bromine
radicals from organic bromine gases, which then combine with ozone. The chemical
pathways are conjectural and little is known about the origins of the organic
bromine, but it is believed that a marine source is the most probable. This
study addresses the former question through a field program at Resolute, N.W.T.,
Canada, to collect and analyze atmospheric particulate bromine and both
inorganic and organic gaseous bromine, as well as other halogens (chlorine and
iodine) to assess their possible contributions to tropospheric chemistry during
the arctic spring. Supporting ozone and meteorological variables are measured
routinely at the Barrow Observatory of the Geophysical Monitoring for Climatic
Change Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The
complementary effort to collect and analyze headspace gases from incubated
arctic macrophyte, phytoplankton, ice algae, and other samples is included in a
separately funded action.
