9411191 Suthers Vocal behaviors represent complex outputs of the nervous system
with great behavioral and social significance. These behaviors, whether in
primates or birds, demonstrate (a) a strong dependence on learning, and (b)
complexities of neural control such as lateralization -- unequal control by the
two sides of the nervous system. In the past, investigation of these phenomena
in animal systems has relied very heavily on surgical disruption of the pathways
controlling vocalization. In this proposal, a research team headed by Dr. R.
Suthers will study the development of avian vocal behavior using new techniques
that allow many fine details of vocal control to be analyzed without surgical
disruption. These studies will enable Dr. Suther's team to uncover the normal
controls on the development of coordination between the two sides of the song
production organ, the syrinx. They will also allow new understanding of how the
patterns of coordination are acquired by juveniles, and how complex aspects of
tonality are produced. These studies will enhance our knowledge of the biology
of communication systems, and are directly relevant to speech communication and
linguistics. ***
