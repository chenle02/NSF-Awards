This mathematics research project centers on the area of graph theory, an active
area of combinatorics that has made great strides in recent years because of its
connection to other areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. Many
tools developed in modern combinatorics, such as the regularity methods, the
probabilistic method, and algebraic methods, turn out to be also useful in
understanding questions in other areas of mathematics such as number theory and
information theory. This project considers several fundamental questions in
combinatorics related to graph theory. It is expected that progress on these
questions will lead to new methods that will have impact not only in mathematics
but also in computer science, with important practical applications.

The topics explored in this project are among the central questions in
combinatorics. One goal is to improve understanding of the power and limitation
of the regularity method through understanding the bounds in several important
applications. Another goal is to determine when random constructions using the
probabilistic method give optimal or nearly optimal bounds. Several classical
topics include Sidorenko's conjecture, Ramsey theory, and Turan numbers of
bipartite graphs. The investigator will use and further develop multiple
techniques to tackle these problems, including regularity methods such as
Szemeredi's regularity lemma and weak regularity lemmas, and analytic tools such
as graph limits and random processes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
