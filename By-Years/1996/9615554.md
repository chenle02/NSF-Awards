This award is for support for two years to develop the technology and
methodology for digitizing the photographs and analyzing the thin sections from
ice cores. In addition, the application of digital technology for whole-core
stratigraphy, using digital photography, image enhancement and image processing
will be investigated. The thin section analysis will be piloted with samples
already in hand from the Taylor Dome ice core. If successful, these techniques
will be applied to samples from the Siple Dome ice core, in cooperation with
Principal Investigators already funded to retrieve and examine these sections.
The original digital images with all original data annotation files will be
distributed to Siple Dome principal investigators for their use in the
interpretation of their own data. All software and hardware acquired for this
project will become part of the permanent equipment inventory at the U.S.
National Ice Core Laboratory and will be available for use by clients at the
facility.
