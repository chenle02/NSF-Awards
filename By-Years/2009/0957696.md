In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, R. L. Penn of the University of Minnesota
will seek to understand the fundamental chemical principles underlying
nanoparticle crystal growth by the oriented aggregation mechanism. The approach
is to utilize an array of scattering and microscopy techniques to study
nanocrystal growth as a function of reaction conditions and time. In particular,
four key hypotheses will be tested regarding the effects of surface charge,
passivating agents, poor crystal faceting, and sequential reaction solution
changes upon the structures and compositions of the resulting nanocrystals. The
broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students, and
postdoctoral researchers, disseminating research results, enhancing
infrastructure for research and education through remote viewing of live
microscopy in the classroom, and developing a laboratory module on nanocrystals
for high school and middle school classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will
expand our understanding about how to grow particles with dimensions on the
order of one billionth of a meter with a high degree of control over structure
and composition. The results of these studies could have many important long
term impacts on nanotechnology fields in which nanoparticles are used, including
medical imaging, display materials, and photovoltaics.
