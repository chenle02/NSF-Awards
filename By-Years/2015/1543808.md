The goal of the workshop is to map out a roadmap of the evolution and potential
breakthroughs in the area of quantum information on a chip for the coming years.
It will identify the most promising area of technology where quantum phenomena
are expected to play an important role for various applications. An important
portion of the workshop will be centered on breakaway sessions to discuss
anticipated progress in the areas of quantum communication, sensing, imaging,
and computing. Also, breakaway sessions will be focused on required technology
advances in single photon sources, integration, atoms/ions-on-a-chip, quantum-
dot on-a-chip, and color-centers on-a-chip. A final joint session will summarize
the results from the different breakout teams and summarize recommendations for
future research. This Workshop will gather some of the leading US and European
experts in quantum photonics and facilitate cross-pollination of ideas that will
impact future science and technology. This conference will cover a wide range of
multidisciplinary topics related to quantum information on a chip. It will open
up new directions for research that will leverage out the infrastructure in the
area of nanophotonic integration.
