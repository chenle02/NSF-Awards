Optical intensity fluctuations of the solar disc have been investigated in the
frequency range from 20 Hz to 15 kHz over a number of years with a detection
system capable of detecting fluctuations on the order of 10-9 times the solar
constant. One important transient which may be recorded in this frequency band
are high flying insects crossing the angular diameter of the solar disc as seen
by the small detector. Tests have shown that this detector is capable of
detecting individual insects from the meter range to beyond the kilometer range.
The purpose of the planned research will be to determine if this method, of
optical remote sensing, may be used to identify the species of individual air
borne insects. The cross correlation of the power spectra of insect species will
be used to determine the accuracy and potential of this method.
