ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to produce a dictionary of Rama, a Chibchan
language of Nicaragua, which will augment the grammar of the language prepared
under a previous NSF grant. The dictionary entries will include illustrative
sentence examples in addition to grammatical, semantic, and cultural information
about the lexical items. The dictionary will also include a grammatical sketch
of the language. The dictionary is intended as a model for future dictionaries
of the other indigenous languages of Nicaragua, as a reference work for general
linguists, as a tool for Chibchan comparative studies, and as a "users"
dictionary for the Rama people.
