This research encompasses two projects. The first will analyze the simultaneous
increase in inequality and in the segregation of high skill workers into
separate firms. It appears that workers have been moving from firms like General
Motors, which combine workers of different skills, to firms like Microsoft or
McDonalds which hire workers of similar skills. A model will be developed to
explore this phenomenon. An implication of the model is that either skill-based
technological progress or increased skill dispersion can cause high skill
workers to segregate into separate firms and reduce wages of low skill workers.
The second part of the project will develop and test a model of the spread of
AIDS based on matching of sexual partners under various assumptions about the
information concerning the risk of infection. In addition, an epidemiological
analysis of how behavior affects HIV prevalence will be integrated with an
economic analysis of how HIV prevalence affects incentives for individuals
behavior.
