The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enablement of new and improved
therapeutic drug development. One hurdle in the development of new drugs, is
their relatively low effectiveness due to poor water solubility limiting
formulation choices and/or limiting cellular uptake. Forming drug nano
particles, by way of controlling the drug crystal formation process, is one tool
to overcome this low solubility hurdle. Acoustical energy has been shown to aid
in the formation of drug crystallization however, current acoustical
technologies are not able to reliably achieve the crystal size and distribution
needed for many new drug candidates. A reliable method for nanoparticle drug
production will allow better and more effective drugs to make it to market.

The proposed project will develop equipment and processes that enable the
continuous manufacture of drug nanoparticles by controlling the crystallization
using a novel focused acoustical field. Focused acoustics has the advantage of
delivering a highly efficient, controllable, scalable energy field to the
crystallization zone. The project will demonstrate a focused acoustics
nanocrystallization process capable of being developed into commercial grade
equipment suitable for use in a continuous flow production pharmaceutical
manufacturing environment.
