This is a program to study atomic noise sources in simple radiating systems.
Such noise is the limiting factor in the accuracy with which the most advanced
high-precision optical measurements can be made and plays a significant role in
the experimental limitations imposed on efforts such as the production of
squeezed states and the study of ultra-cold atoms in traps. Using atomic-beam
techniques, the research concentrates on three areas: isolating and separately
identifying different sources of noise; development of "internal atomic beam
splitters" for measurements of atomic correlation functions; and exploration of
direction noise of continuous spatial photon echoes. In addition to having
immediate application in other areas of atomic and optical physics, this work
also probes the fundamental quantum mechanical definition of measurement.
