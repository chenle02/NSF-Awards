Abstract Proposal: DMS-9803192 Principal Investigator: Simon Donaldson The main
topic of this project involves the application of methods from complex geometry
to symplectic topology. The investigator will develop a general procedure for
translating problems in this area into combinatorial questions involving the
monodromy of a family of codimension 2 submanifolds. It is expected that this
will apply, in principle, both to the classification problem for symplectic
manifolds and also to Lagrangian submanifolds and symplectomorphisms. Once the
general foundations are in place applications will be considered: the question
here will be to see if the combinatorial problems can be cast into a tractable
form. Particular attention will be paid to the role of the Floer homology groups
obtained from the monodromy. One subsidiary topic in the project involves
research into the geometry of Kahler metrics: the specific goals here are to
prove the existence of certain geodesics in the space of Kahler metrics, and
apply these to Calabi's extremal metric program. This existence question is a
version of the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous Monge-Ampere equation, a
topic of independent interest. The other subsidiary topic involves research into
manifolds with exceptional holonomy groups, and particularly the search for new
examples, obtained using complex 3-folds as building blocks. Complex numbers,
made up of real and imaginary components, are fundamental throughout
mathematics. In geometry, it has been realised since the middle of the last
century that properties of the complex number system are intimately bound up
with the geometry and topology of 2-dimensional spaces. The elaboration of this
theme, and its extension to higher dimensions, has been one of the main
achievements of twentieth century mathematics. The ideas have many contacts with
numerous branches of Mathematical Physics, including the theory of potentials
and fields, quantum theory and relativity. Mat hematically, many of the
questions come down to the detailed analysis of nonlinear partial differential
equations. The proposed research will contribute to this brood development,
focusing on a number of specific and topical questions, in all of which complex
variables play a key role.
