This SBIR Phase I project will develop beneficial insect attractants for the
organic farming industry. The semiochemical attractant system being developed
will include a powerful synergistic attractant mixture for key predacious
insects and a controlled release device to deliver the attractants efficiently.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to enhance the efficacy of
beneficial insects either naturally or artificially applied especially in
organic agriculture. Development of this semiochemical attractant for the
husbandry of major beneficial insects will be useful for the conservation and
augmentation of key wild natural enemies with minimal adverse environmental
impact. A significant reduction of pest damage and an increase in organic food
production will result.
