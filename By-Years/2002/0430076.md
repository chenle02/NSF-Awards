Collaborative Research: High-Fidelity Methods for Security Protocols
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Mitchell, Andre Scedrov, Vitaly Shmatikov,
Daniele Micciancio&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and security analysis of
protocols that use cryptographic primitives is one of the most fundamental and
challenging areas of computer security research. This project focuses on three
topics: foundations of protocol analysis, automated tools, and application of
tools and methods to selected protocols. Foundational work centers on relating
and combining two previously separate approaches: logical methods based on
symbolic execution of protocols, and computational methods involving probability
and polynomial-time. The symbolic approach uses a highly idealized
representation of cryptographic primitives and has been a successful basis for
automated tools. Conversely, the computational approach yields more insight into
the strength and vulnerabilities of protocols, but is difficult to apply and
only accessible to a small number of true experts in the field. Building on past
success using several automated tools, the project will devise tool-based
methods that leverage new scientific foundations. Three likely application areas
are secure group communication and key agreement protocols, schemes for privacy-
preserving computations, and wireless networking and applications. In each of
these areas, there is current demand for new secure protocols from user
communities, there is ongoing activity in the research and standardization
communities, and the value of combining symbolic and computational analysis
concepts is evident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
