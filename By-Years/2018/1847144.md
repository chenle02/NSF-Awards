Dynamical systems have long been studied both within mathematics and as models
in many other disciplines, such as weather forecasting, geophysical modeling,
molecular biology, financial mathematics, and ecology. The mathematical
description of these systems has revealed a remarkable variety of possible
behavior, and it is known that in applied settings the complex behavior of these
systems can significantly impact modeling outcomes. The educational focus of
this project involves training and educating students from middle school to
graduate school in probability, statistics, and dynamics. In particular, the PI
will develop engaging educational activities in probability and statistics and
deliver them to middle and high school students in UNC Charlotte's Pre-College
Program. These activities will be disseminated widely, and teachers will receive
training in their delivery. Additionally, the PI will establish a summer
research program in probability for undergraduate students, and graduate
students will be involved in all aspects of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the analysis of dynamical
systems from both probabilistic and statistical points of view. From the
probabilistic point of view, the project seeks to address the ``forward
problem," in which a dynamical system is chosen at random from a collection of
systems and one would like to characterize its behavior. This line of research
will shed light on what type of behavior one can expect to see in a typical
system. From the statistical perspective, the project focuses on the ``inverse
problem," in which one would like to learn or draw inferences from observations
of a (possibly unknown) dynamical system. More specifically, the project
involves analyzing the performance of statistical inference methods when applied
to observations of a dynamical system or group action. Results in this direction
will provide theoretical guidance on when statistical procedures may be
successfully applied in the context of dynamical
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
