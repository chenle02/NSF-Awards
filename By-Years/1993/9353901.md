9353901 Friedman A three week workshop Mathematical Modeling for 32 college and
university instructors will be held in the summer of 1994. The general goal of
the workshop is to provide mathematicians the opportunity to use mathematical
modeling to solve problems which come from industry and engineering sciences.
The participants will experience the excitement of solving real-world problems
(using a team approach), and be provided background to offer undergraduate
courses with modeling components at their home institutions. ***
