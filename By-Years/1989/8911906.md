This award, in the Organic Dynamics Program, is made to support the research of
Dr. J. Kerry Thomas at Notre Dame University. The research will focus on photo-
induced electron transfer in organized assemblies and the subsequent reactions
of the photo-produced cations. The techniques used will be laser flash
photolysis, where the ionic events are initiated by short, intense flashes of
light, and the short-lived radicals and cations produced are monitored by fast
absorption and emission spectroscopy and conduction methods. Long-lived products
will be monitored by conventional analytical methods such as NMR, IR and
electronic spectroscopy and HPLC and gas chromatography. The research will
explore methods of generation of cations, solvent effects on the reactions of
the cations, methods of increasing charge separation or decreasing back
reaction, photoinduced electron transfer in onium salts, use of conducting
polymers in the charge separation process, new host systems, and photodynamics
in polymer films.
