This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
proprietary technology to enhance the crushing strength of industrial diamonds
by 30-40%. If successful, the project will result in a new process which will
allow the treatment of large numbers of industrial diamonds at once. The
intellectual merit includes a better understanding of diamond crystal lattice
structure, formation of diamond residual stresses, and crystal imperfection
caused by extrinsic, intrinsic, and crystal symmetry defects inside diamonds.
This project will also enhance our understanding of material embrittlement
caused by nanoscale structural change. Last but not least, this research could
develop more knowledge on diamond crushing strength and technologies for
improving diamond strength.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be significant in
the diamond production industry. In 2011, the world production of industrial
diamonds exceeded five billion carats. This technology will allow the
enhancement of properties of low- and medium-strength diamonds, with a potential
added value of over $5 billion. The proposed technology will also have a strong
impact on cutting and grinding tools, which are critical to the semiconductor,
automotive, aerospace, surgical instrument, machinery, oil and gas, and
construction industries. Within these sectors, stone cutting and highway
building/repair account for the largest sources of demand for industrial
diamond. Additionally, every automobile manufactured in the United States
contains an average of 1.5 carats of diamond.
