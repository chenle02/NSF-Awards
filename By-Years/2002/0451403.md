This University of South Carolina REU site focuses on providing undergraduates
with a research experience in integrative evolutionary biology. The Program's
objective is to provide training opportunities for students interested in the
intersection between molecular genetics and organismal level processes. Students
participate in 9-week independent research projects under the direction of one
or more faculty mentors who span the range of areas in evolutionary biology.
Students learn about hypothesis generation and testing as well as the techniques
and experimental designs used in their mentors' laboratories. In addition, a
series of discussions presents information about how to get into and be
successful in graduate school. At the end of the summer, each student writes a
summary of his/her work and presents an oral version in a departmental mini-
symposium. Previous participants were from diverse and under-represented groups
and many have gone on to graduate school after completing their undergraduate
degree. More information is available at
