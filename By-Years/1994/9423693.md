9423693 Shen This award supports a joint U.S.-China workshop, with the Research
Center for Applied Mathematics of Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, on
Inertial Manifolds, Approximate Inertial Manifolds and Related Numerical
Algorithms at Xi'an Jiaotong University during the period of June 6-9, 1995. In
recent years, the concept of Inertial Manifold has emerged as an important tool
for the study of the long-term behavior of dynamical systems. In parallel to the
study of Inertial Manifolds, extensive research has also been conducted on
Approximate Inertial Manifolds and related numerical algorithms. These multi-
resolution algorithms, taking into account the interaction law between small-
scale and large-scale components of the underlying flow, are especially
attractive for long-term integrations of dissipative evolution equations. The
aim of this workshop is to bring together active researchers with different
backgrounds to discuss recent and prospective advances in this area. Funds are
granted for travel expenses of ten participants from the United States and for
partial support of the publication cost for the workshop proceedings.
