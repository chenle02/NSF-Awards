This research is concerned with finite group theory,particularly the study of
fixed point problems and Hall-Higman theory. The principal investigator will
study problems concerning the length of the longest chain of subgroups in finite
simple groups and the permutation structure of finite modules. Further, the
character theory of finite groups with many normal subgroups will be examined,
studying properties of character factorization. In addition, other problems in
the area of finite groups theory will be considered, including problems
involving the Mobius function on the poset of subgroups of a finite group and
problems of Galois theory.
