In January 2009, the United States National Science and Technology Council
issued a report entitled A Federal Vision for Quantum Information Science. The
report proposes that The United States "... create a scientific foundation for
controlling, manipulating, and exploiting the behavior of quantum matter, and
for identifying the physical, mathematical, and computational capabilities and
limitations of quantum information processing systems in order to build a
knowledge base for this 21st century technology." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
Workshop on Quantum Information Science has been organized in response to the
NSTC report. The workshop, held 23-25 April 2009 at the Tysons Corner Marriott
in Vienna, VA, brings together leading theorists and experimenters drawn from
physical science, computer science, mathematics, and engineering, in order to
assess recent progress in QIS and identify major goals and challenges for future
research. The workshop includes open evening sessions so that all participants
can express their views concerning the priorities for a national QIS initiative.
The workshop will be followed by a report that will be submitted to the Federal
agencies that sponsor or perform QIS research. This award, using resources
provided by these same agencies, provides funding to cover the cost of holding
the workshop and preparing the report. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of this proposal stems from the workshops potential to identify the
central challenges facing QIS research and to formulate a plan for facing these
challenges. Its broader impact will be achieved if the workshop and report help
to launch a national QIS initiative.
