The Robert Noyce Urban Mathematics Educator Program (UMEP) Phase II is designed
to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the UMEP that began as a Phase I
Noyce Teachers Scholarship program for career changers seeking teaching
positions in secondary mathematics. Partnering school districts, the Atlanta
Public Schools and the DeKalb County School System are actively engaged in all
aspects of the program from selection of UMEP Scholars to the degree program to
the placement of UMEP Scholars in teaching positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From
2005 through 2010, thirty-six UMEP Noyce Scholars completed the Master's Degree
with initial certification and began teaching in high need schools. Thirty-three
UMEP Noyce Scholars have remained in teaching and are becoming exemplars as
professional educators. The UMEP operates as an active online Professional
Learning Community composed of the UMEP Scholars, the UMEP Leadership team, and
UMEP Noyce Scholars who have evolved as teacher leaders. In Phase II, the
project extends and expands on-going research on the online learning community
as well as continues research and evaluation on the effectiveness of the degree
program, selection process, preparation, placement and retention of the UMEP
Scholars. The UMEP is becoming prominent for the retention of exemplary teachers
in high-need schools. Plans for dissemination of the findings from the research
and evaluation are to contribute to the knowledge of preparation, placement, and
retention of effective secondary mathematics in high-need schools.
