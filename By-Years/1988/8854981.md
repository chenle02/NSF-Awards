The College of Engineering at the University of Hartford is proposing to offer
an academically sound and a "practically" enriching experience. During the
course of six weeks, a non-credit program will increase the math, science, and
problem-solving skills of 30 per-college students through computer literacy and
project design experience. Engineering role models chosen from local energy,
aerospace, and automation industries will supervise participants during the
project design phase, and provide a supportive atmosphere by instilling
confidence and a sense of accomplishment in the participants. The University of
Hartford is specifically targeting women and minorities for the program due to
its proximity to school populations with large minority enrollments, and its
continued support of local engineering activities of the Society of Women
Engineers. This project will significantly increase the probability of women and
minorities entering and remaining in an undergraduate engineering program and
will involve active follow-up in the form of peer conferences, and continued
contact through telecommunication facilities, to assure career counseling the
stimulation of pre-engineering preparation.
