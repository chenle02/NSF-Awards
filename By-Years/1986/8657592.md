Dr. Felker plans to carry out a program of research which falls into three
areas, all involving time-integrated and picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy
on jet-cooled species. In the first, picosecond spectroscopy will be applied to
the study of vibrational energy flow in the electronic ground-state manifolds of
molecules. His second major area of interest is the application of the (recently
observed) rotational coherence phenomenon to high-resolution molecular
spectroscopy and to studies of the rotational state-changing collisions of large
species. In the spectroscopic studies, rotational coherence effects will be used
to obtain sub-Doppler, megahertz resolution measurements of the rotational
constants of molecular complexes and clusters, with the aim of elucidating the
structures of the species. His third area of interest is the spectroscopy and
dynamics of jet-cooled, isolated transition-metal coordination complex ions.
This work is important because it involves looking at energy flow within
molecules. Questions such as how rapidly vibrational energy once deposited in a
specific mode is redistributed in a molecule and just where it ends up are of
fundamental importance to understanding chemical reactivity.
