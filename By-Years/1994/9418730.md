9418730 Kidd This project is part of a multidisciplinary study of the Nanga
Parbat-Haramosh Massif of the northwestern Himalaya, Pakistan. The Principal
Investigators wish to assess the recent and still-active processes responsible
for an extraordinary episode of very young high-grade metamorphism, partial
melting, high strain, and rapid denudation focused around the center of Nanga
Parbat. Their ultimate goal is to exploit the excellent exposures and access to
active tectonic processes offered by Nanga Parbat to understand the mesoscale
interaction between petrological and mechanical processes during collisional
orogenesis. To accomplish these goals they propose to integrate a wide variety
of measurements made using techniques of geochronology, petrology, stable-
isotope geochemistry, radiogenic tracer-isotope geochemistry, seismology,
magnetotelluric sounding, structural geology, and geomorphology, and then place
their results into a geodynamic context. ***
