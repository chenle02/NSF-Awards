Technical Narrative: This US-Egypt planning visit to organize a workshop on
environmental problems involves the Hazardous Substance Management Center of the
New Jersey Institute of Technology and Suez Canal University in Ismailia, Egypt
as well as the Egyptian industrial sector. The main objective of the workshop is
to design an operational program for implementation of international
university/industry cooperative research projects. To achieve this objective,
pre-workshop site visits to locations of critical research activities in Egypt
will be scheduled for the principal investigators. Drs. Magee and Abdel-Rahman
will travel to Egypt in the fall of 1992 to visit Suez Canal University, which
will host the workshop, and several industrial sites. This cooperative science
activity in environmental engineering fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Egypt to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas
of strong mutual interest and competence.
