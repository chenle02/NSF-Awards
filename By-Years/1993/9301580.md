9301580 Arora In this project, a research program is outlined to develop
computational methods for design sensitivity analysis and optimization of
complex nonlinear structural problems. In the first line of the investigation,
computational methods for design sensitivity analysis of response-dependent
functionals will be developed. Transient dynamic problems will be treated. A
second line of investigation involving instability of structural systems is also
planned. Some work has been recently done on this problem; however substantial
more effort is needed to fully develop the numerical methods for this problem.
Theory of design sensitivity analysis of the buckling load needs to be developed
with different types of material models. Simultaneous occurring of multiple
buckling modes needs to be investigated.
