With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
John I. Brauman, of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University, carries
out studies of gas-phase ionic chemistry and spectroscopy. Through studies of
thermodynamics, reaction dynamics, electron photodetachment spectroscopy,
infrared multiple photon induced reactions, and optical photochemistry, using
ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy combined with conventional and laser light
sources, Professor Brauman examines the spectroscopic, chemical, and physical
aspects of the properties and reactions of ions in the gas phase. Through these
studies is gained an understanding of the relationship between structure and
reactivity for ions and highly reactive intermediates, permitting an assessment
of the separate contributions of intrinsic and solvent effects to the chemistry
of these species. A central need in chemistry is the ability to understand and
predict the properties and chemistry of reactive intermediates formed in the
course of chemical reactions. While molecular groupings bearing charges (`ions`)
play an important role as critical intermediates in numerous reactions, their
properties are dramatically affected by their interaction with the media in
which they are usually generated, complicating experimental attempts to probe
their chemistry. Professor John I. Brauman, of the Department of Chemistry at
Stanford University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program for his studies of the structures and reactivity of ions in the gas
phase, allowing him to assess the separate contributions to their chemistry of
the reaction medium and their intrinsic properties.
