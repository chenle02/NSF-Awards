9451538 Aghajanian This project is establishing an Undergraduate Social Science
Teaching Laboratory to improve social science curriculum by: (1) developing a
math-science orientation, (2) exposing students to social science data in
critical and quantitative context, (3) and using computer technology effectively
in teaching social science research. Undergraduate majors mainly from criminal
Justice, psychology, and sociology will benefit from this project. The project
will enhance learning opportunities for undergraduates. Students will be
expected to develop analytical models, and to test their models using objective
methods and statistical techniques. The improvement of laboratory facilities
will also enhance teaching effectiveness, especially in such courses as social
science research methods, social statistics, demographics, and survey
measurement and analysis.
