OPP 9615011 Crowley Abstract The geologic record indicates that the earth has
been subject to four main phases of glaciation in the last one billion years:
the late Cenozoic, Carboniferous, Ordovician, and Late Precambrian. In order to
develop a uniform theory for glacial periods it is necessary to identify the
factors responsible for both general conditions of glacial inception and growth
and retreat of the ice sheets. Over the last several years our modeling group
has succeeded in identifying plausible boundary conditions for glacial inception
for the pre-Cenozoic glacial ages. Separately W. R. Peltier and colleagues have
succeeded in simulating the evolution of ice volume during the last glacial
cycle with an ice sheet model coupled to a two-dimensional energy balance model
(EBM). This award supports a project to combine these separate lines of research
in order to test whether an ice sheet model developed for Pleistocene studies
can, without any additional tuning, yield changes in ice volume consistent with
evidence from the Carboniferous and Ordovician glacial periods. This research
will entail conducting a suite of experiments with the Peltier model that
involve forcing the model with temperature and (parameterized) moisture fields
from EBMs with the model run through a series of orbital insolation changes. The
objective is to determine whether the paleo ice sheet grows to dimensions
commensurate with geological data and also whether "hot" summer orbits melt the
ice sheet. To test for robustness of results, some of the experiments will be
repeated using temperature and precipitation fields generated by a general
circulation model. If this work is successful in simulating the Carboniferous
and Ordovician glaciations, confidence will be enhanced in the ice sheet model
and a significant step will have been taken in developing a uniform explanation
for glacial periods in earth history.
