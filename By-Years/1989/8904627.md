More than 30 years ago, the subclass Loculoascomycetes (of the Class
Ascomycetes, among the true fungi) was defined on the basis of the morphology of
two reproductive characters: the ascostroma and bitunicate ascus. The implied
phylogeny has been derived for over 9500 species using a combination of multiple
traits from the ascostroma and a single ascus type. Current disagreement over
classification of the group (especially higher taxa) demonstrates the lack of a
clear understanding of underlying monophyletic groups. A robust phylogeny from
which a nested set of monophyletic groups can serve as the source of
classification is needed. Dr. Don R. Reynolds, of the Natural History Museum of
Los Angeles County, will address this issue with molecular data. Research will
focus on 32 Loculoascomycete species and will entail sequencing the relatively
large, evolutionally conservative and tandem repeated nuclear ribosomal DNA.
Such analyses promise to yield useful data for study of ancestral sequence
divergence. The genus Neuropora will be used in outgroup analysis. The
Polymerase Chain Reaction coupled with rapid DNA sequencing methods will be used
to analyze the small mitochnodrial subunit rDNA and the nuclear rDNA, including
the genes for 18s rRNA, 28s rRNA, 5.8s rRNA, and the intergenic spacer region.
The work will be carried out over a 12-month period beginning in September 1989
at the University of California, Berkeley, in the laboratory of Dr. John W.
Taylor.
