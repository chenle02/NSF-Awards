The scale of data storage and analysis for the high energy physics experiments
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland, provides new challenges
and necessitates research into new concepts of CPU utilization. The quantity of
data produced is too large to store at any single university. Rather, the data
will be archived in a central location. This project will develop techniques and
software packages to enable the efficient distributed analysis of these data by
researchers at remote sites. This proposal would support the investigation into
how to send a user's request for a particular analysis and some code to the
locations where the data are stored and run the code there. The system would
then collect and assemble the results and present them to the user. The
framework would be the BlueOx system and Java will be the implementation
language for the BlueOx framework so as to take advantage of its cross-platform
compatibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important challenge facing the
framework is that of scalability. This project plans to study and improve the
scalability by testing it with large dummy datasets of simulated data on a
moderate-sized computing cluster. The aim is to keep the generality that can
make it useful to many large scientific projects.&lt;br/&gt;
