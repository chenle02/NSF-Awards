*** 9411202 Stein This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
design and develop a two-wavelength active pyrometer. Many production and
research applications require accurate, non-contact surface temperature
measurements on various materials under a variety of conditions. All such
surfaces emit radiation, which may be used to measure their surface
temperatures, providing the surface's emissivity is known. Unfortunately,
emissivity values are frequently uncertain, which can lead to large errors in
conventional radiation pyrometry. This research concerns a new active pyrometer
method, wherein the ratio of target reflectances at two separate wavelengths is
measured together with the target radiances at these same wavelengths. From
these values the surface emissivity may be determined and the target temperature
accurately measured for materials having arbitrary surface textures. Research
completed under a Phase I program has determined that it is feasible to
construct such an instrument to cover a target temperature range of 100-1750( C
with an accuracy of + 0.5% of the absolute temperature. This is perhaps an
order-of-magnitude better than can be realized with conventional radiation
pyrometry when the target emissivity is not known, or is changing. The new
pyrometer would help producers and manufacturers in many industries to improve
the quality and reduce the cost of their research, factory processes and
products. Commercial applications include: production of ferrous and non-ferrous
metals, semiconductors, plastics, foods, textiles, etc., where non-contacting
temperature measurements are needed and conventional pyrometry is often
inadequate. ***
