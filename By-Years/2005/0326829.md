Meiotic eukaryotic sex is thought to have originated at least 600 million years
ago. Its most familiar manifestations occur in the germ-line tissues of
multicellular plants and animals, but most modern single-celled eukaryotes,
including yeasts, ciliates, and algae, also engage in meiotic sex, and it is
assumed that meiotic sex first arose in unicells and provided the basis for the
evolution of multicellularity. Since sex and speciation are intimately
intertwined, an understanding of biodiversity is critically dependent on an
understanding of how sexual strategies operate and evolve. This project is
focused on two closely related species of unicellular green algae, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and Chlamydomonas incerta, that have very similar "housekeeping
genes" but whose sex-related genes are highly divergent. Previous support from
the NSF has enabled this laboratory to identify and clone genes that govern
sexual differentiation and zygote maturation in these organisms, including genes
resident in the key mating-type locus. The current project will continue the
analysis of their function and their evolution. The project focuses on three
genes. 1) The Mid gene product induces cells to differentiate as mating-type
minus and suppresses the plus differentiation pathway; experiments are designed
to identify proteins that participate with the Mid protein in effecting this
transcriptional regulation. 2) The Iso1 gene encodes a chromatin-remodeling
factor in the ISWI family that is up-regulated in response to nitrogen
starvation -- the environmental signal that initiates sexual differentiation --
and is necessary for expression of gamete-related genes; experiments are
designed to understand its mode of regulation, its target genes, and its
relationship to Mid expression. 3) The Gsp1 gene product is involved in the
expression of zygote-specific genes following gametic cell fusion; experiments
are designed to understand how this transcriptional regulation is effected.
