college biotechnology curricula. Supporting activities include teacher and
faculty training, industry mentor education, program materials development, job
shadowing, and the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups of
students. Principal collaborators are a two-year college, high schools, 4-year
colleges and universities, biotechnological industry, government, and public
schools. Biotechnology programs are being articulated for different educational
levels, and major developments include classroom and multimedia materials. Also,
developed materials are being disseminated through various media, such as
publications, videos, electronic linkages, workshops, and conferences.
