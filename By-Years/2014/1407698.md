Recent advances in computing and measurement technologies have led to an
explosion in the amounts of data that are being collected in all areas of
application. Much of these data have complex structure, in the form of text,
images, video, audio, streaming data, and so on. This project focuses on one
important class of problems, viz, data with network structure. Such data are
common in diverse engineering and scientific areas, such as biology, computer
science, electrical engineering, economics, and sociology. While there has been
extensive research on networks (primarily outside the field of Statistics), much
of it deals with characterizing and modeling network structures using link
information only. The goal of the current research program is to exploit the
node features as additional information and develop statistical methods that
take into account both link and node information. The research program will make
significant contributions in several areas, including Statistics, Biology,
Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Physics, Psychology, and Sociology.
The educational program also includes substantial initiatives that will involve
undergraduate and graduate students and expose them to state-of-the-art research
in the topics related to the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to
develop new statistical methodologies and associated theory that exploit the
network structure in the data. Such data are becoming increasingly common in
various fields. Specifically, the investigator aims to study three different but
related problems: a) link prediction for partially observed networks, which
deals with the situation where the network we observe is the true network with
observation errors; b) community detection in networks with node features, which
combines network link information and additional information on the nodes to
improve community detection; c) learning network structures, which deals with
the situation where one is interested in identifying the underlying network
structure from the data.
