Serotonin is a brain transmitter substance that functions in a variety of
different behaviors, two of which are sleep and movement. Measurement of
serotonin in specific brain regions during behavior is made possible by a new
technique called microdialysis. Dr. Auerbach will utilize this technique to
study the relationship between serotonin levels and the onset of sleep. If
serotonin release causes sleep, increases in this transmitter should be seen at
the time of sleep onset. The relationship between serotonin levels and rhythmic
movements of the jaw and tongue will be studied to test the hypothesis that
serotonin activates the neural structures which control these movements. This
work will contribute to knowledge about the role of brain transmitters in
regulation of behavioral events.
