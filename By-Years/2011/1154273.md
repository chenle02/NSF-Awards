The Scholars-on-Track program at the College of Mount Saint Vincent (CMSV) is
providing financial, social and academic support to promote achievement of
students in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. The program's primary goals
include an improvement of academic performance, retention, degree completion and
post-baccalaureate opportunities in these areas. To help realize these goals,
the program builds on a "Freshman Seminar in Science" during the first semester
of study that challenges these scholars to develop the knowledge base,
discipline, and critical thinking skills essential to success in the sciences.
The program also provides peer mentorship and tutoring throughout the first two
years of baccalaureate study and encourages student participation in enrichment
activities such as scientific conferences, career panels, field excursions to
museums and academic centers. During the final two years of baccalaureate study,
participating students complete an original research project and are encouraged
to consider the option of an internship in one of the areas of focus. The
activities offered through the Scholars-on-Track program have been shaped by
scholarship and student support models that have proven to be particularly
effective for students hailing from minority and underserved populations, both
of whom comprise a significant portion of the CMSV student population.
