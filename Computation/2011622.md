This research has been inspired by numerous challenges in studying the
transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. The investigator will focus on
estimating parameters of data-enabled mathematical models of infectious disease
aiming to generate forecasts of future incidence cases. The project will develop
regularized computational algorithms for this data estimation which presents
many challenges and includes uncertainties. The models and optimization methods
to be used are important in anticipating the resources needed for disease
management. Data on past and present infectious diseases will be studied, and
the investigator will collaborate with the university's School of Public Health.
Apart from applications in epidemiology, this project will have a broad impact
on scientific disciplines including signal and image processing, biomedical
imaging, gravitational sounding, chaos theory, ocean acoustics, and others. The
project includes graduate student training through involvement in the research.

The project aims to develop computational algorithms for estimating parameters
using optimization. From an optimization standpoint, parameter estimation and
forecasting from data comes down to solving an ill-posed minimization problem
constrained by a system of ordinary or partial differential equations. For
uncertainty quantification, multiple runs of the inversion algorithm must be
carried out, preferably in real time. To address this challenge, the project
will construct a family of trust-region optimization algorithms with low-rank
updates for the Jacobian operator that will reduce the computational cost of a
quasi-Newton step and, at the same time, incorporate an extra layer of stability
in the iterative process. In case of nonlinear least squares with non-zero
residuals, low-rank updates for stable Hessian evaluation will be investigated.
Theoretical and numerical analysis of the new methods will be first carried out
for normally solvable ill-posed operator equations and then extended to
essentially ill-posed problems. The successful completion of this project will
advance the understanding of ill-posed inverse problems and facilitate more
stable and efficient simulations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
