Abstract Miller

This proposal requests support for 10-15 US participants, particularly graduate
students and postdocs, in the NATO Advanced Study Institute "Symmetries and
Integrability of Difference Equations" to be hosted by the University of
Montreal, July 26 - August 6, 1999. The purpose of the Institute is to review
the principle developments that have occurred in this area in recent years,
particularly in the quantum domain. Integrable systems have long played a
crucial role in mathematical physics. Standard examples include central force
motion, harmonic oscillators, and systems with a high degree of symmetry, have
been greatly enhanced in the past thirty years, and now include interacting many
body systems, coupled spin chains, and integrable systems with an infinity of
degrees of freedom. The main results leading to current work in the subject will
be presented in a coherent form that will be accessible to graduate students and
young investigators.
