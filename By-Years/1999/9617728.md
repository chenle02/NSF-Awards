Dewar OCE-9617728 The influence of bottom topography on the general circulation
of the oceans will be studied using numerical and analytical techniques. It is
suggested that ridges and plateaus of moderate scale may be sites where the
unsteady wind-driven circulation can penetrate into the deep ocean and may be
associated with strong local recirculation via eddy driving. The study will
focus on three topics: (1) the effects of large-scale topography on the mean
circulation; (2) the time scales introduced by both large and small-scale
topography in a steadily forced circulation; and (3) primitive equation model
inversion to assess the importance of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Azores Plateau
on the circulation in the North Atlantic sub-tropical gyre.
