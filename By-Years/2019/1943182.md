Algae covering the bed of stream ecosystems provide key food resources for
invertebrates and fishes and can intercept pollutants. Algae grow rapidly when
provided with light and a balanced supply of nutrients, and a lack of resources
causes slow growth and inefficient filtering of pollutants. Algae require dozens
of nutrients, but only two major nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) have been
extensively studied in streams. Recent work in the ocean and large lakes has
shown that trace metals are important for the growth of algae. This project will
provide fundamental understanding of the role of trace metals in the growth of
stream algae and explore the consequences of trace metal deficiencies on
pollution filtering. This work will also provide experiences for high school and
undergraduate students that promote key skills required of modern biology.
Modern biology incorporates knowledge from many other scientific fields and this
workâ€™s study of trace metals provides an interdisciplinary approach that can be
a model for developing scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use
experiments from the patch to stream scale to study the extent, cause, and
consequences of trace metal deficiency for stream ecosystem structure and
function. The project will answer three fundamental questions: (1) How often do
trace metals influence algae growth in Great Lakes streams?, (2) How does
changing the nutrient balance alter algal communities?, and (3) How does
changing trace metal availability alter pollution filtering by algae? The study
will use nutrient diffusing substrates (NDS) in 98 Great Lakes streams to
identify locations and conditions where trace metals are influencing algae.
Ensuing studies will measure algal communities and pollutant uptake rates under
different trace metal conditions. Results at the patch scale will be confirmed
at the whole stream scale with experiments in artificial channels and divided
streams. The project will use NDS experiments in classrooms and laboratories to
give high school and undergraduate students authentic research experiences. The
researchers will work with the Kent State Upward Bound Math Science program to
introduce high school students to interdisciplinary science and provide them
with authentic, place-based research experiences in their local
streams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
