Tang 9704031 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to
improve the process uniformity of the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP)
planarization process. The proposed work centers on real-time process
optimizations based on real-time in-situ thickness mapping during CMP
planarization. The ability to improve the process uniformity is crucial to
semiconductor manufacturers. CMP is a key semiconductor planarization process,
and is utilized to address microlithography depth of focus problems and
multilevel metallization problems. The CMP process is presently utilized by most
state-of-the-art semiconductor production lines for interlevel dielectric (ILD)
and shallow trench isolation (STI) planarization. The ability to improve CMP
process uniformity will directly benefit semiconductor production yields.
