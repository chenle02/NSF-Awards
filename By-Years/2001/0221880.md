0221880 Silverstein The effects of acid mine drainage on natural biogeochemical
nitrogen cycling will be studied with respect to the interaction of microbial
nitrogen and iron transformations at the lowered pH found in receiving waters.
Competition between ferric iron and nitrate as electron acceptors, use of
ferrous iron as electron donor in denitrification, and mobilization of iron and
other heavy metals from bacterial reduction will be investigated in acid main
drainage impacted streams. Species identification in impacted and unimpacted
streams will be made utilizing DNA probes and the FISH technique and microscopic
counts will be used to produce quantitative estimates of chemolithotrophic iron
oxidizers and heterotrophic acidophiles.
