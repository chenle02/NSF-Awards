ITR: Multi-scale Analysis, Modeling, and Simulation&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will
operate in the context of the Caltech Center for Integrative Multi-scale
Modeling and Simulation (CIMMS) whose purpose is to develop, and foster multi-
scale innovations in a wide range of areas spanning the physical, mathematical,
information, and computational sciences. It provides the infrastructure that
allows for the mix of domain experts from fluids, materials and geophysics with
specialists in mathematical and computational analysis. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal
aims to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop fundamental insights into multi-scale
interactions, especially the coarse graining of dynamics and how they affect the
accuracy of naive coarse-scale simulations; &lt;br/&gt;2. Assemble existing
ideas about multi-scale interactions scattered across a wide range of
disciplines into a coherent whole, ready for broad dissemination;&lt;br/&gt;3.
Codify and develop systematic techniques to accurately model and simulate across
space and time scales;&lt;br/&gt;4. To test them systematically in a wide range
of important scientific settings;&lt;br/&gt;5. Develop and distribute software
and associated infrastructure supporting the rapid and thorough diffusion of
these techniques;&lt;br/&gt;6. Raise consciousness among scientists, engineers,
educators, and society in general about the importance of accurate physical
modeling, the fundamental role of the multi-scale hierarchy as an obstacle to
naive modeling and the existence of powerful ideas and convenient tools
available to scale the hierarchy.&lt;br/&gt;Overarching Research Themes. Two key
themes cut across and unifying the scientific research: modeling across scales,
and multi-scale algorithms. They reflect two groups of researchers: those
developing modeling techniques to get the physics and computations right across
scales and those who develop the computational and information technology
infrastructure, including algorithms and other mathematical tools, such as
ridgelets and curvelets. The first years will concentrate on macromolecules and
crystalline materials, and imaging and data analysis. In future years, other
areas may be included, such as geophysics, space sciences and additional topics
in biology, all of which present challenging multi-scale
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
