This is a project for mathematical research in ergodic theory and dynamical
systems. The general theme of these areas is to study the average behavior, over
the long run, of transformations of a space under stepwise iteration or
continuous flow. The three principal investigators expect their work to benefit
from collaborative interactions. Corresponding to what sort of underlying space
one has, the subject matter divides roughly into three categories: symbolic,
smooth, and measurable dynamics. Research topics in symbolic dynamics are
automorphisms of the shift, regular isomorphism of Markov shifts, and
nonnegative integral matrices. In smooth dynamics, topics include dynamical
methods in the study of the Navier - Stokes equation, random diffeomorphisms and
the propagation of roundoff error, and geodesic flows and Riemannian geometry.
In the area of measurable dynamics, research topics include restricted orbit
equivalence and tiling representations of higher dimensional real actions.
