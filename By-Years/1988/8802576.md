New generations of flexible manufacturing/assembly/disassembly systems feature a
complex interaction of many entities. There are several machines, some flexible,
and several part-types which require attention at many machines, in a
prespecified order. Set up times are involved in switching from a production run
of one part-type to another at a machine. Parts also incur transportation delays
when moving from machine to machine. Desired production levels are set for the
various part-types, and the system is governed by parameters such as the
processing time for a part at a machine. There are also the vagaries of
uncertainty due to yield, quality control and machine failures. How do we
schedule the operation of such systems, so as to efficiently carry out the
desired production? In the proposed research, the PI shows the beginnings of a
theoretical foundation for developing scheduling algorithms which perform
efficiently in real time. These algorithms can be implemented in a distributed
fashion, and are stable in the sense that backlogs of parts at the machine are
kept under control. The ingredients of his approach are to study the dynamics of
such systems and use feedback and closed-loop regulation to control scheduling.
