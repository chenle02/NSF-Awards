The creation, management, and access of data is key to the advancement of the
state-of-the-art in computer science. Currently many research and educational
activities in social network, web mining, multimedia retrieval, and high
performance computing, just to name a few, need to involve big data. However,
existing infrastructure of the Computer Science Department at Texas State
University falls far behind its increasing research and educational
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds a shared high-performance data
center, providing the fundamental facilities to collect, process, and manage
large volumes of data. The new data center supplies the necessary computational
power and storage to support the exploration and development of new research and
technologies within and beyond the department in the fields of computer vision,
wireless network, information retrieval, data mining, human computer
interaction, software engineering, high performance computing, and security. The
data center also supports quality undergraduate and graduate student research
experience, enables the integration of research and education, encourages inter-
departmental and cross-university collaborations, and promotes the Ph.D. program
development in the Computer Science Department. The developed infrastructure
will significantly enhance the current research and educational capabilities of
the department, university, and community.&lt;br/&gt;
