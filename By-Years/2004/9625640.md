The temporal dynamics of information processing in the brain can be studied
using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalpgrahpy (MEG), but the
spatial resolution of these techniques is often poor due to crude mathematical
models. Accuracy and resolution can be improved by using finite elements to
model the realistic geometry and electrical conductivity of the head and grain.
A 2D EEG source localization code based on a finite element method has been
developed, but extending this to the 3D realistic-shaped head model will require
a huge increase in computational speed. Source localization in a 3D finite
element model requires the solution of a large system of equations (more than
100,000) for hundreds of iterations for each time point in a brainwave that may
last for seconds. Therefore, to make this computations practicable the 3D EEG
code will be optimized and parallelized to run on one of the CRAY supercomputers
at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center or on a cluster of 80 Hewlett-Packard
workstations at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. During the second
year, a 3D MEG source localization code will be developed and parallelized. This
is a straightforward and relatively simple task once the 3D EEG code is
parallelized, because the solution of the same system of equations is needed for
both EEG and MEG. The fellowship will help broaden the research Associate's
knowledge in code optimization, code parallelization and the neurosciences
through participation in formal courses, workshops, seminars and consultation
with a group of multi-disciplinary advisops in computer science, mathematics,
neurophysiology and engineering. The code developed from this project will be
made available through the domain to help other researchers utilize accurate and
efficient source localization models.
