This project provides the Environmental Engineering Technology undergraduate
curriculum at this institution with the laboratory capability to sample and
analyze low concentrations of volatile organic compounds in air, water and soil.
The state-of-the-art pollutant monitoring equipment which students use includes:
a flame ionization detector gas chromatograph, a thermal desorber unit, a
photoionization detector, a volatile and semivolatile organic sampling train and
personal and ambiant air sampling devices. This equipment broadly enhances the
spectrum of instruments students can use in their Air Pollution, Water Chemistry
and Hazardous Waste laboratory courses and allows them hands-on experiences in
the methods and equipment they are most likely to use early in their
professional careers. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
