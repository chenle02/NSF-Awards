The project "Math, Science and Technology Education for Riverbend in the 90's"
aims to enhance math and science education for non-baccalaureate bound students
in community college preparatory programs and career programs in grades 6-12.
The project will involve directly 35 teachers and 740 students. It will help to
prepare students for technological careers. Current applications of science and
mathematics will be integrated into the curricula. Underrepresented populations
will be served. Independent mail reviews of the proposal were followed by a
panel discussion. Each reviewer then provided detailed written comments
identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal and giving his or her
individual rating. The panelists viewed this as a comprehensive program with
several strengths. There is a clear need for programs that will educate the non-
baccalaureate and that will reach underrepresented populations. The project is
well planned and well thought out. It is cost effective. The panel worried that
25% involvement of the project director may be too low. elementary teachers
should be involved. The expectations of computer literacy may be too high. The
hourly rate of $415 needs clarification. Two of the panelists rated the proposal
excellent and four rated it very good. I concur with this meritorious
assessment. If negotiations can remove the weaknesses, I recommend funding.
