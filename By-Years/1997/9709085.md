This grant supports an REU site for undergraduates majoring in physics at the
University of Alaska Geophysical Institute. Research topics concentrate on space
physics and aeronomy within the University, also extending to atmospheric
science, solid state physics and laser physics. The PI aims to encourage the
undergraduates to continue their education in graduate school and become
scientists. Through relationships with mentors, contacts with graduates,
attendance at seminars, lectures, and field trips, interns gain a firsthand
perspective on research scientists.
