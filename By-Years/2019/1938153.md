The University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, California State University
Stanislaus, University of the District of Columbia and Northern Michigan
University will address the dearth of Ancestral Computing for Sustainability in
computer science education. The primary goal of this project is to research the
incorporation of ancestral knowledge systems and computer science education as
disciplines that co-create positive learning ecologies for marginalized
communities, especially women of color, towards sustainable computing. This
project aligns with the and can fill a void in the current broadening
participation body of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite aggressive broadening
participation efforts from a wide range of initiatives, those focused on women
of color continues to lag. There is a need for women of color to see themselves
as intellectual contributors to society within the curricula. Expanding on
culturally responsive curriculum and ethnomathematics, this project intends to
research students' multiple identities as these relate to ancestral knowledge
systems and sustainable computing. This is done to create computer science
education curricula that ensures women of color lived world experiences are
endogenous. In addition, Ancestral Computing for Sustainability has the vision
to create new epistemologies and axiologies to reconfigure the bodies of
knowledge that are mediated by computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
