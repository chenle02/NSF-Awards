This project is a study of the rate of production and dissolution of biogenic
silica in the uppermost 150 meters of the Ross Sea, and is part of a coordinated
study of the biogenic silica and organic carbon cycling in the water column and
the sediments of the Ross Sea. The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf
environment is the major repository for silica accumulation in the global ocean,
and dominates the global silica budget, The Ross Sea is a particularly anomalous
area in which large amounts of biogenic silica are accumulating in modern
sediments, while the surface production rates are generally below the global
average. Moreover the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon
cycle does not appear to hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles are
decoupled in that the rate of particulate carbon deposition in the modern
sediment is very low. The project is an integrated study of the production,
vertical transport, dissolution, and deposition processes, using moored
instrumentation and direct observations in a series of transects in the Ross Sea
by R/V POLAR DUKE. The objectives of the project are to measure the seasonal
variability of silica production and dissolution rates in areas of silica-rich
and silica-poor surface sediments, and to produce the surface silica budget that
will be combined with vertical flux and sediment accumulation data to be
obtained by the cooperating investigators.//
