Several aspects of theories with extra spatial dimensions will be studied. The
main focus will be understanding what the resulting observable consequences for
particle and gravitational physics of such models could be, that is
understanding the phenomenology of such models. Secondly, the cosmological
evolution and the fundamental theory of these models will also be investigated.

Models with extra dimensions have shown new avenues to resolve some of the most
fundamental problems in particle physics. These include possible explanations
for why gravitational interactions are so much weaker than other particle
interactions (like electromagnetism), and perhaps even new directions toward
understanding the cosmological constant problem pointed out by Einstein. Due to
the potential applications of these models it is very important to study them
and to find out which of these could describe our Universe. This is the main
goal of this project.
