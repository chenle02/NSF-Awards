This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
novel laser pumped helium 4 magnetometer for observation of geomagnetic fields
and magnetic geophysical exploration. The magnetometer employs a dual mode of
operation to measure both the magnitude and direction of the geomagnetic field.
The key technical component is a patented tunable diode laser (TDL) pumping
process developed by Polatomic for NASA. TDL pumping permits use of a single
helium cell to measure scalar fields with a projected resolution of 0.1 pT/Â¬Hz,
an order of magnitude greater than conventional resonance magnetometers. The
small sensor and large resonance signals allows extraction of three-axis vector
information. In Phase I Polatomic, Inc., proposes to define a concept for a
portable Geomagnetic Vector Scalar (GVS) magnetometer including the sensor and
electronics modules for high resolution scalar mode and three-axis vector mode.
They will establish the feasibility of the selected GVS design concept and
prepare a plan for designing, fabricating and demonstrating a breadboard GVS
instrument in Phase II.
