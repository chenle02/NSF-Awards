This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Development of a two-species biofilm
to study bacteria-bacteria interactions." This project applies the power of
bacterial genetics to an environmental biofilm to determine the intricate
associations between 2 different species of bacteria. Shewanella and
Desulfovibrio species are ubiquitous environmental bacteria that form natural
biofilms and promote steel corrosion. This ecological system is genetically and
chemically tractable and is being used to develop a model for a 2-species
biofilm to examine the structural impact of each species on the biofilm,
identify and characterize genes that are induced or expressed during biofilm
development, and identify parameters essential for maintaining the 2-species
biofilm.
