9400077 Huque A two year experimental project has been proposed to generate a
data bank for thermal conductivity of material which can effectively be used for
modelling Self-Propagating High Temperature-Synthesis. Specific attention will
be paid to the grain size effects in the compacts in green state. Special
materials of interest would be the family of carbides, borides, silicides,
sulphides etc. %%% The Principal Investigator has proposed to generate a data
bank for thermal conductivity of materials which can effectively be used for
modelling the Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis. ***
