This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
low-temperature, atmospheric-pressure deposition process for metal chalcogenide
nanomaterials in electronics. This process will use a hybrid ink containing CdSe
nanoparticles mixed with a reactive dispersant in a non-aqueous solvent. The
reactive dispersant, a metal-organic molecule, will strongly coordinate to CdSe
nanoparticles to form a suspension at ambient temperatures. During spray
deposition, this reactive dispersant will thermally transform into CdSe and
byproducts at relatively low-temperature. As a consequence, this approach will
allow printed CdSe thin film materials on temperature-sensitive substrates such
as those of interest in flexible displays. The commercial applications of this
project include large area flat panel displays, thin film transistor
fabrication, jet deposition ink formulations and printed electronic materials.
