9312585 Gonzalez Cruz This planning grant is to conduct a preliminary
investigation of the heat transfer process of spray cooling used for high heat
flux applications. Specific tasks to be accomplished during a preliminary study,
which will be included in a full Minority Research Initiation Proposal, are as
follows: 1) expand upon an existing literature review in spray cooling research
and applications, 2) establish contacts with the manufacturing industry, 3)
develop a detailed description of the experimental tasks to study the thermal
behavior of the spray and its surroundings, 4) present results from a current
investigation, 5) develop a general thermal model. ***
