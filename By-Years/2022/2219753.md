Deep generative artificial intelligence (AI) models can learn to reproduce their
inputs or the variational versions of their inputs. However, a critical
challenge that needs to be addressed is their energy and computational cost.
Foundational research in the design, verification, operation, and evaluation of
deep generative AI hardware and software through novel approaches in emerging
devices, circuits, and architectures is desirable. The energy and computational
cost of AI has become a bottleneck for its applications in the real world.
Research and education will be integrated through course and lab development.
Under-represented and women students will be recruited for this project through
the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, National Society of Black
Engineers, and Society of Woman Engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
targets the development of new generative AI models with simpler designs and
architecture than are currently available. A novel path is explored for
designing deep-learning hardware accelerators via efforts that span from devices
and circuits to architectures and algorithms. The Cellular Neural Network-based
realizations for key operations in convolution-based networks is studied,
because it allows the bulk of the computation associated with a deep generative
AI model to be performed in the analog domain. The development of mixed-signal
circuits and architectures that lead to the best deep generative network designs
by exploiting unique physics of emerging device technologies is investigated.
The project is expected to generate orders of magnitude improvements in energy
and delay for deep generative AI models, which will promote their applications
and benefit the AI industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
