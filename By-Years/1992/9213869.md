A focal plane polarimeter will be constructed for use at CEBAF by the Rutgers
and W&amp;M groups. In conjunction with a magnetic spectrometer, this device
will determine the polarization state of protons and other hadrons produced in
electron scattering and photon induced knockout reactions. The detector consists
of a second scattering target (analyzer) plus tracking chambers before and after
the analyzer. Measurement of the polarization, extracted from the second scatter
angular distribution, will be used to measure the proton form factor, perform
critical tests of models of the nucleon, of nuclear structure, and of reaction
mechanisms involved in electron scattering. Wire chamber arrays, analyzer,
support structure, and associated fast electronic signal processors will be
developed.
