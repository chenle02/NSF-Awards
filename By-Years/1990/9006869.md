This project supports the acquisition of equipment to enhance research in the
vibration analysis of linear and nonlinear systems. The two relevant research
projects address the development and verification of methods for predicting the
vibration of nonlinear structures with random excitations, and the investigation
and verification of computer modeling techniques for the design of electronic
equipment subjected to shock and vibration. The equipment requested comprises
two computer workstations, software, and related peripherals.
