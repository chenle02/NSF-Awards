The two priority goals of this project are (1) to extend magnetic domain
calculations with emphasis on incorporating effects from micro- and macrostress
and (2) to develop micromagnetic theory at a level that will allow proper
testing of models with the use of experimental data such as bulk coercivity and
isothermal remanent magnetization.
