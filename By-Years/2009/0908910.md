Dr. Madau and his team will combine observations of the gas from which the
galaxies were formed with theoretical and numerical studies of the state of that
gas. The intergalactic gas is ionized by the ultraviolet light from short-lived
massive stars and from the active nuclei of galaxies, so the amount of neutral
gas tells us about past star formation, and about the black holes that lie at
the centers of galaxies and power their active nuclei. To set limits on this
ionizing light at times when the cosmos had expanded only to a quarter of its
present size, the team will examine the spectra of quasars dating from this
period, and make a census of the deep absorption lines of neutral hydrogen in
their light. They will take infrared spectra of even more distant quasars to
measure the absorption lines of heavier elements that are produced in stellar
interiors, to examine how rapidly these were produced from stars and flung into
the intergalactic gas. By looking at spectra of pairs of quasars that are nearby
on the sky, the team will study gas around the nearer quasar by its absorption
of the light of the more distant object.

The team will improve CUBA, a one-dimensional radiative transfer code, and
release it to the public. This code will be used to trace ionizing photons as
they propagate through models of the cosmos that follow both the invisible dark
matter and the gas, as gas condenses into star-forming galaxies. These
calculations will also consider the effect of galactic winds in blowing the
metals formed in the stars out into the intergalactic gas.

A graduate student and a postdoc will be trained by participating in the
research. Team members expect to mentor undergraduate researchers, and to take
part in a summer program for talented undergraduates from low-income families.
The upgraded CUBA code will be released to the astronomical community, and
visualizations from the simulation runs will be available for public outreach.
