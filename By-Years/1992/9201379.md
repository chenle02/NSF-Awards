This workshop will help identify the future needs for controlled environment
facilities across a spectrum of disciplines in biology, ecology and
environmental sciences, from physiological ecology, to global climate change to
human support systems. The workshop will involve approximately 40 participants
from federal agencies (40%) academia (46%) and the private sector (16%),
cumulatively representing the spectrum of disciplines for which controlled
environments are critical research facilities. A major focus of the workshop
will be new areas of investigation in which the plant and ecological sciences
play a significant role, i.e., landscape ecology, and biogeochemistry at
atmosphere/geosphere/ biosphere interface.
