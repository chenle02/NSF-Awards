This National Science Foundation award will fund up to 15 United States-based
students attending the 22nd International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2023),
held in Athens, Greece from November 6 to 10, 2023. ISWC is the premier
international forum for state-of-the-art research on all aspects of the Semantic
Web, knowledge graphs, and their intersection with other domains. Student
Fellowships will help cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible
for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. They
will also provide an opportunity for them to interact with future national and
international scientific collaborators.

The International Semantic Web Conference, which is now in its 22nd year, is an
interdisciplinary conference that includes work on Data Management, Natural
Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, and Reasoning, Ontologies and
Ontology Languages, Semantic Web Engineering, Linked Data, User Interfaces, and
Applications. It regularly has several hundred attendees. In addition to the
main technical tracks, the conference includes a variety of events that provide
opportunities for more in-depth interaction amongst researchers at different
institutions who are at various stages of their research careers, and
researchers who are interested in many different aspects of Semantic Web
Research. Students benefit from the Doctoral Consortium - a full day event where
students can get critical, but encouraging, feedback on their work from senior
members of the community. They also benefit from the career mentoring lunch,
where experienced members of the community from both academia and industry
answer questions in an informal setting. For further information see the
conference web site at: https://iswc2023.semanticweb.org/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
