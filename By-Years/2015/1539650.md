This award supports a conference on algebraic combinatorics and applications, to
be held at Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, during August
26-30, 2015. Various structures studied in algebraic combinatorics, such as
combinatorial designs, finite geometries, and graphs, have found applications in
designing error-correcting codes that provide for reliable transmission of
digital data, and for maintaining the integrity of data recorded on CDs, DVDs,
hard drives, and flash memory devices.

The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers and graduate
students interested in algebraic combinatorics and its applications to
communications, error-correcting codes, cryptography, and information security,
in order to promote new linkages and collaborations. The conference will provide
opportunities for research faculty and graduate students to learn about the
latest developments in these areas, and explore different visions for future
work. The list of speakers will include representatives from both the
theoretical and applied communities; the interactions with experts from the
applied communities will prove particularly beneficial for faculty and graduate
students specializing in the area of discrete mathematics, who wish to learn
more about the contemporary applications of algebraic combinatorics.
