Smale The investigator studies algorithms based on Newton's method for finding
zeros of a system of polynomials. The focus of the analysis is to obtain bounds
on the number of Newton steps required. Such bounds will depend on the number of
variables, the degrees of the polynomials, and the desired accuracy. The goal of
the project is a complexity theory of nonlinear equation solving. Equation
solving is at the heart of much of mathematics and the main theoretical problem
associated to its modern theory of computation is its complexity theory.
Equation solving, together with its computational aspects, is a main way that
mathematics is used by engineering, physics, economics, and many other
disciplines.
