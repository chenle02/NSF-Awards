DMR-9419257 Marchetti This project addresses several theoretical aspects of
nonequilibrium superconductivity and nonlinear collective transport. Vortex
arrays pinned by extended defects, such as twin boundaries, are studied. The
hydrodynamics of flux- line liquids will be derived and applied. Specific models
for flux lattices are studied to understand the general features of collective
nonlinear dynamics and transport in driven disordered systems. Also, the
dynamics of topological defects produced when a systems is quenched from a
disordered to an ordered phase across a symmetry breaking transition is also
included as a new direction of research. %%% This project concerns, in part, a
theoretical analysis of arrays of linear defects found in high temperature
superconductors. This understanding should contribute to the goal of controlling
the energy loss present in a variety of applications of these materials. The
study of these defects and how they move should also have applications to other
classes of materials which are currently of interest in the laboratory. A close
collaboration with experimentalists and theorists at Argonne National laboratory
is planned as part of this work.
