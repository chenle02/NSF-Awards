This project's goal is the study of approximations for Steiner minimum trees
(SMTs) and related problems. This study extends the PI's research, supported
under CCR-92- 08913, on the analysis and the designs of polynomial-time
approximations for SMTs. The project includes finding new techniques to solve or
make significant progress in both the analysis and construction/implementation
of the following problems in the area of SMTs: (1) Open problems on the Steiner
ratio (such as, Chung-Gilbert's conjecture, Graham- Hwang's conjecture, and
Smith's sausage conjecture); (2) Determination of the performance ratios for
various approximations (such as, Chang's approximations, Smith-Lee- Liebman's
approximation, and Kahng-Robin's approximation); (3) New approximation
algorithms using the variable metric method; (4) Investigation of a conjecture
about SMTs approximations and hardness of finding approximate SMTs; (5)
Establishment of significant lower bounds for the performance ratio of
polynomial-time approximations; (6) Improvement of the analysis of
approximations of Zelikovsk's; and (7) Construction of good approximation
algorithms for related problems.***
