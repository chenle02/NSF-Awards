With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Baylor University will acquire a 500 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
the preparation of new ligands for asymmetric transition metal catalysts; b)
redox reactions of transition metal organometallic compounds; c) synthetic
bioorganic chemistry; d) formation of coordination polymers; e) stereospecific
preparation of conjugated dienes; f) the chemistry of half-sandwich
monocarbollide complexes of transition metals; and g) investigations of enzymes
involved in the metabolism of the N-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine protein crosslink .

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
