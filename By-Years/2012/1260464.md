Methylmercury (MeHg) causes a variety of adverse health effects in exposed
humans and wildlife but its formation and cycling in oceanic waters have not
been fully characterized or quantified. This research program seeks to better
understand factors controlling the production, fate, phytoplankton uptake, and
transfer of MeHg in the marine environment

A combination of laboratory, field studies and modeling efforts will investigate
the bioaccumulation, trophic transfer in aquatic food webs, and implications
that this may have on the global transport of this potent neurotoxin. Laboratory
and coastal field studies of MeHg interactions with different types of
phytoplankton, interaction with specific organic compounds, effects of light and
temperature are all expected to influence MeHg binding and or uptake into
phytoplankton.

Broader impacts of the work include: 1) provision of policy relevant information
in support of monitoring and evaluation efforts for control of anthropogenic
mercury releases; 2) informing education on marine conservation and
sustainability by developing a case study on mercury in the marine environment;
and 3) training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists
