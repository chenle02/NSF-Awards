Algebraic geometry has a strong and broad representation at the research
institutions of the Northeastern states. AGNES will be a new series of biannual
workshops that intends to further the interaction and collaborations between the
algebraic geometers in the area. Each workshop will be held over a weekend at
one of the participating institutions. The workshops will include research talks
by renowned experts and junior researchers, both from outside the area and
within. Professional development sessions and introductory pre-talks will be
aimed particularly at graduate students. Every workshop will culminate with an
open problem session. It will thus give an opportunity to disseminate recent
results and developments, and exchange ideas and views about future directions
of algebraic geometry.

Algebraic geometry is the study of spaces defined by polynomial equations. Many
of the spaces occurring in nature are of this type, and for this reason
algebraic geometry has found diverse applications in the sciences. In
particular, there are strong connections with recent work in theoretical physics
(string theory). This grant will support a series of algebraic geometry
conferences in the Northeastern states. The key aims of the series are to expose
graduate students to a broad spectrum of research in the field and to improve
communication between the many algebraic geometers in the northeast.
