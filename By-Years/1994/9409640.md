The purpose of this research is to gain a better understanding of the
interrelated dynamics of human capital formation and changes in the wage
structure. Wage inequality in the U.S. has been rising for the past twenty
years. This project asks whether inequality will continue to rise or whether
increased education and job training will reduce the returns to a more long-run
levels. The project consists of three empirical tasks: (1) Detecting and
estimating responses of investments in post-secondary education, measured by
enrollments, and in job training to changes in rates of return to human capital
as measured by skill differentials in wages. (2) Estimating the effects of the
accumulation human capital measured by educational attainment on skill wage
differentials. (3) Enrollment responses and attainment effects are separated by
a lag to be estimated statistically. The econometric analysis will utilize
micro-data from the Current Population Survey, the National Longitudinal Survey,
and the National Center for Education Statistics, as well as special surveys of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Educational Testing Service.
