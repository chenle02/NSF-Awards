This award provides partial support for the thirteenth ?AIMS Conference on
Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations, and Applications.? The event will
take place at Peachtree Westin Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia, June 4-9, 2020. This
series of biennial conferences has a 26-year history; it is organized under the
American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS). The conference has focus in
the growing field of analysis and applied analysis with emphasis on dynamical
systems, differential equations, and applications. The conference will foster
international collaborations between researchers in these fields. It features a
large number of presentations by graduate students and female mathematicians and
scientists.

While modern mathematics now encompasses a vast range of topics, dynamical
systems and differential equations have retained their central role because of
the wide variety of applications ranging from the traditional areas of physics
and engineering to the more recently developed and growing applications in
biology, chemistry, ecology, physiology, economics and finance. Thus, the study
of differential equations and dynamical systems has been a core component in our
understanding of many natural phenomena. The program includes over 90 special
sessions, that cover a variety of topics such as: data science, Navier-Stokes
equations and fluid mechanics, topological and variational methods, mathematics
of chemotaxis, biological systems analysis, progress on the n-body problem, and
stochastic partial differential equations, among others. More information on the
conference can be found at the conference website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
