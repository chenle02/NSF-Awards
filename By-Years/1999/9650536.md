This project enhances the training of upper-division undergraduate students in
the broad field of comparative animal physiology. The goal is to develop a
comprehensive comparative physiology curriculum where students employ modern
equipment and techniques to study all levels of physiological organization. The
new equipment being used to introduce students to cellular and whole animal
physiology makes it possible to offer more rigorous and up-to-date exercises for
students taking the animal physiology course and to increase the sophistication
of, and possibilities for, senior thesis research projects. At the cellular
level, the new amplifiers enable students to perform intracellular recordings
and study basic principles of cellular and membrane physiology. At the
organismal level, the oxygen analyzer enables students to determine the
metabolic costs of small terrestrial animals during activity. The program design
can be adapted to any biology program that emphasizes laboratory training, and
the department is prepared to communicate the results of the laboratory
innovations through presentations, publications, and the Internet. In summary,
this project can improve the education of upper-level students in the core
curriculum, provide a model physiology laboratory program for upper-division
undergraduates, and enrich the possibilities for substantive collaborative
student/faculty research. Finally, it is likely that this project can ultimately
result in research publications that influence the field of comparative animal
physiology.
