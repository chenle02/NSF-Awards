Coherent optical detection offers the potential to substantially increase the
capabilities of existing long-haul and local area fiber optic networks. However,
random drift of the signal polarization presents the major obstacle to this
method of detection. The objective of this program is to develop a polarization
controller that will compensate for this polarization drift enabling the use of
coherent detection. We will research the use of liquid crystals to accomplish
this means. This approach will be comparatively much less expensive and easier
to implement than other methods that are currently under research.
