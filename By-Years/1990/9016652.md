Morphological data have not provided a clear picture of the relationships among
species of the Desmognathinae a monophyletic subfamily of lungless salamanders,
family Plethodontidae. Preliminary data on rDNA restriction site variation and
published data from other vertebrate groups indicate that rDNA restriction site
mapping can generate valuable new phylogenetic information for desmognathines.
Use of the sister group relationship between the Desmognathinae and the
Plethodontinae will allow application of the outgroup criterion for ascertaining
primitive versus derived restriction sites, and a phylogenetic hypothesis will
be formulated based ont he most parsimonious explanation of restriction site
evolution. Phylogenetic information from rDNA can provide the basis for the
testing of pervious hypotheses of life history evolution in desmognathines and
can be used to determine the ancestral life history for desmognathines, an
important consideration in testing competing hypotheses on the origin of
lunglessness in the Plethodontidae. This study is the first investigation of the
entire rDNA array in a monophyletic group of salamanders and will increase
knowledge of rDNA evolution in vertebrates.
