Polytechnic Institute Title: Culturally Situated Tools

This award provides support for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to
develop culturally-situated design tools to motivate ethnic minority students to
learn mathematics and to pursue careers in Information Technology. The tools
will be integrated into standard curricula for use by approximately one thousand
middle school students in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's local GEAR-UP
program (the U.S. Department of Education's Gaining Early Awareness and
Readiness for Undergraduate Program). The use of the design tools will be
evaluated over a 3-year period and the results will be disseminated widely.
