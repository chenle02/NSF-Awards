The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
work of Professor Christopher A. Reed of the University of California -
Riverside on reactivity and mechanistic studies of the carborane anions.
Carborane acids, such as H(CHB11Cl11), are the strongest known pure protic
acids, yet they are also the gentlest - because their conjugate base anions have
low nucleophilicity and are inert towards redox processes. This work focuses on
two questions related to carborane activity: What processes require the extreme
inertness of carborane anions above all others? and What mechanisms can be
uniquely studied because of the special properties of carborane anions? The
knowledge gained from this project has ramifications for commercially important
areas such as petroleum refining, polymerization catalysis, batteries and fuel
cell technologies. Postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students working on
the project regularly collaborate with scientists from Russia, Germany and the
United Kingdom.
