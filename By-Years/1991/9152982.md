The goal of this project is to use tissue culture techniques to introduce upper-
level biology students to current concepts in molecular cell biology. A sterile
hood CO2 incubator, inverted and epifluoresence microscopes, a cryo-storage
thermos, and a vertical slab gel electrophoresis system were purchased to
implement these experiments. Students isolate membrane fractions from cultured
cells using ultracentrifugation techniques. Membranes and whole cells are
stained using primary antibodies to specific proteins and organelles and
peroxidase-labelled and fluorescent-labelled secondary antibodies. Viral
transformation is demonstrated using primary chick fibroblasts and Rous sarcoma
virus, and students observe and quantitate the transformation utilizing the
inverted microscope and pulse-labelling techniques. Chemical signaling is
demonstrated through the addition of defined hormones to a BC3H1 cell line that
cause differentiation of these cells into the muscle phenotype. Western and
Northern blotting are also demonstrated with tissue-cultured cells.
