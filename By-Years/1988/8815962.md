This project is mathematical research in function theory and operator theory.
Three lines of investigation will be pursued. The first involves polynomial
approximation relative to certain kinds of measures supported in the closed unit
disc. The second area involves problems concerning composition operators on
various spaces of analytic functions in the disc and in the unit ball in complex
n-space; this includes questions of boundedness and norm estimates, compactness,
and spectral properties of composition operators. Finally, a study of commuting
holomorphic self-maps of the n-ball will be initiated.
