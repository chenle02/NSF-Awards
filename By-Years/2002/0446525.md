Cornell University is hosting a series of activities to improve the mentoring of
junior faculty across the College of Engineering's 11 departments or schools.
The goal of the proposed activity is to establish a framework by which the
mentoring process is made m ore unified and effective across the College. The
overall effort includes several elements (peer mentoring breakfasts, women
faculty lunches, an effective teaching workshop series, a workshop on effective
mentoring for department chairs and senior faculty). The program should work to
increase the retention and tenure of STEM faculty, including (and perhaps
especially) those who are underrepresented.
