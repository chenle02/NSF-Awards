9634537 Bose This proposal requests a travel grant from NSF for scholars at US
universities to attend the Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC) in
Dresden, Germany, to be held from August 19-23, 1996. Since its inception in
1963, PSCC has evolved to become the leading international conference outside
the US in the area of power systems computer applications. This 12th conference
will be an excellent opportunity to exchange views and ideas with some of the
key people in the field from around the world. The conference will have over 150
technical papers, three survey papers, four tutorials, and one panel session on
very timely topics. ***
