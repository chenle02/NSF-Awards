Compace blue-green lasers are required for applications in optical data storage,
reprographics and biomedical diagnostics. IR-pumped visible upconversion lasers
are a particularly promising class of blue-green lasers. In order for the
development of IR pumped visible lasers to progress beyond its currentl level of
development, a reliable source of barium yttrium fluroide material is required.
This particular host, doped with ytterbium and thulium was used in the first IR
pumped visible laser to operate at room temperature. The PI proposes to
investigate the growth of rare-earth-doped barium yttrium fluoride by the
Czochralski technique. We believe that our proprietary fluoride growth
technology, which has been used to grow large boules of YLF and LiSAF can be
adapted to the growth of barium yttrium fluoride. The development of growth
techniques for high quality rare-earth-doped barium yttrium fluoride is expected
to accelerate the development of IR-pumped upconversion lasers, leading to their
ultimate introduction into the commerical marketplace.
