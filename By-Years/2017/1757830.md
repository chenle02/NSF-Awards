This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) and Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site in physics at the
University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. The site will support twelve
undergraduates and two teachers per year in research projects in gravitational
wave detection, lasers and optics, radio and optical astronomy, blue energy, or
materials science. The projects can be theoretical, computational, experimental,
observational and/or oriented towards applied physics. As the students' research
experience grows they will come closer to being independent, self-reliant
scientists. The site will incorporate two high school teachers from the Rio
Grande Valley area who will develop smaller subprojects to be carried on with
their students during the school year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
projects in this REU and RET site will focus on research in frontier areas of
phenomenological, experimental and applied physics at state-of-the-art
facilities. In gravitational wave detection students will be given a unified
view of the field, and learn the scientific value of the potential wealth of
astrophysical information to be obtained from this new astronomical window -
along with the challenge of developing the technological expertise necessary to
open it. In laser and optics science they will learn of challenges and promises
for new communication technologies. The Radio and Optical Astronomy topics will
expose participants to state-of-the-art techniques to see and listen to the
farthest reaches of the universe and the entanglement with astrophysics. The
program will have a close mentoring and guidance system from the faculty in
place during the entire duration, fostering interaction and active participation
by students and teachers through seminars, lunch meetings, colloquia and
presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
