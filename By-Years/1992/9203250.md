The export of organic matter from the ocean's surface is an important
biological and chemical process. Biologically, this export feeds most deeper
dwelling organisms, and chemically it influences the exchange of gases like
carbon dioxide and oxygen with the atmosphere. Export usually is defined in
terms of carbon. A common approach is to estimate carbon export from a limiting
nutrient such as the new (nitrate) component of total plankton production by
assuming that 6.6 atoms of carbon are exported for each atom of new production.
However, this gear ratio (one of the Redfield ratios) between the surface water
carbon and nitrogen cycles has never been rigorously examined. Recent
measurements in diverse ocean areas indicate that the net change in inorganic
carbon associated with new production exceeds that predicted from the Redfield
conversion by more than 50%. Thus, current concepts or nutrient cycling in the
ocean may be seriously flawed and the role or the ocean as a carbon sink and as
an O2 source may be significantly underestimated. This research represents the
first quantitative study of the relationship between new production and net
production in terms of both dissolved inorganic carbon and O2 with incubation
experiments that can isolate the biological processes from the confounding
effects of mixing and gas exchange. These experiments will provide critical
relationships that are needed for more accurate estimates of oceanic carbon and
oxygen fluxes. The differential recycling of carbon and nitrogen as a reason why
the Redfield C:N conversion fails in surface water will also be evaluated.
