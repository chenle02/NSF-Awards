The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and computationally efficient
analytical implicit solvation model for membranes. An initial version of such a
model (IMM1) has been recently proposed by extension of an implicit solvation
model for aqueous proteins (EEF1). IMM1 predicts reasonable membrane insertion
free energies, discriminates transmembrane from interfacially binding peptides,
and gives stable molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins. This
project aims to enhance the reliability and extend the applicability of IMM1 by
testing some of its key assumptions and by incorporating several physical
elements that are now missing. Specifically, this project involves: a. testing
of the electrostatic screening model by comparison to continuum electrostatics
calculations, b. extension to membrane proteins with an aqueous pore, such as
porins or ion channels , c. addition of a separate lipid headgroup region with
distinct solvent properties, d. incorporation of electrostatic effects arising
from the dipole, surface, and transmembrane potentials, and e. calibration to
available experimental data for quantitative prediction of binding free energies
of peptides to membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this work will be
useful for understanding the energetic determinants of membrane protein
structure, prediction of membrane protein structure from sequence, and studies
of how conformational changes in membrane proteins are linked to their function.
The models will be made available to the research community in both academia and
the pharmaceutical industry. This research will be carried out at an institution
where 60% of the students belong to underrepresented groups and undergraduates
are heavily involved in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
