A basic question in geochemistry is whether or not there is chemical
&lt;br/&gt;exchange accompanying the transfer of heat from the core to the
&lt;br/&gt;mantle in the cooling cycle of the Earth. It has been previously
&lt;br/&gt;proposed that minor mass transfer from the outer core to a mantle
&lt;br/&gt;plume rising from the core-mantle boundary would be indicated if
&lt;br/&gt;certain, coupled variations in 186Os/188Os and 187Os/188Os ratios are
&lt;br/&gt;detected in lavas derived from the plume. To examine this issue,
&lt;br/&gt;186Os/188Os and 187Os/188Os ratios of rocks from two plume-derived,
&lt;br/&gt;ocean island basalt systems will be precisely measured. There is also
&lt;br/&gt;strong mass balance evidence that the core has a 182W/184W ratio that
&lt;br/&gt;is approximately 2 parts in 10,000 lower than the ambient mantle. A
&lt;br/&gt;portion of this signal could be transferred to a plume, as with the
&lt;br/&gt;Os isotopes. Consequently, techniques will be developed to examine
&lt;br/&gt;the same plume-derived rocks for W isotopes at the 5-15 parts per
&lt;br/&gt;million level that will likely be necessary to detect a core
&lt;br/&gt;component. The ability of Os and W isotopes to serve as tracers of
&lt;br/&gt;core input to mantle plumes require a good understanding of
&lt;br/&gt;metal/silicate partitioning behavior of these and allied elements,
&lt;br/&gt;under high-pressure conditions. Consequently, high-pressure
&lt;br/&gt;partitioning will be examined experimentally. Finally, a variety of
&lt;br/&gt;physical mechanisms of the transfer of core metal into the mantle
&lt;br/&gt;will be considered and evaluated.
