The focus of this research is the development of improved methods for the
synthesis of optically pure organic compounds, using alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl
diiron carbonyl complexes incorporating a chiral thiol. Reactions of these
reagents with nitrones results in the formation of asymmetric isoxazolidines.
Structural studies will be carried out to determine the origin of the observed
product selectivities, and the isoxazolidines will be used as intermediates in
the synthesis of optically active beta-amino acids and beta-lactams. The acyl
diiron complexes will also be used in asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions in the
regioselective addition of nitrile oxides, and as organometallic components for
the asymmetric Michael addition. With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides continuing support for the research of
Dr. Scott R. Gilbertson of the Department of Chemistry at Washington University.
Professor Gilbertson's research is focused on developing new and improved
synthetic methods for the preparation of organic compounds. The methodology,
based on organometallic reagents, has potential for use in the preparation of
organic compounds having interesting biological properties. In this work,
students will receive training useful in developing synthetic skills of great
interest to the pharmaceutical industry.
