This action is to renew support for a multi-institutional research project
involving Professor Philip L.-F. Liu of Cornell University, Professor Costas E.
Synolakis of the University of Southern California, Professor Harry H. Yeh of
the University of Washington, and Professor Emeritus George F. Carrier of
Harvard University. Professor Liu serves as the coordinator for this project.
The program is a coordinated effort to investigate the relationship between the
ground movement in the source region of the earthquake, and the resulting runup
distribution for a nearshore tsunami. Professor Yeh is responsible for a major
laboratory experiment to measure the tsunami runup heights caused by an offshore
seafloor displacement. The laboratory results provide essential data to verify
the inverse algorithms which determine seafloor displacement from the runup
information Professors Liu and Synolakis are responsible for the development of
the inverse algorithms and the improvement of the simulation models. Professors
Carrier and Liu are collaborating on improving the effectiveness of numerical
models by using some of the strengths of analytical approaches. The
investigators and participating researchers will meet twice a year to discuss
research results and research directions.
