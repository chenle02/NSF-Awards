Funding is requested for the purchase of a dedicated capillary gas
chromatograph-mass spectrometry (CGC-MS) instrument to facilitate research in
biological chemistry conducted by five primary and five secondary user groups.
Complex mixtures of volatiles would be separated by capillary GC, ionized by
chemical ionization or electron impact, and analyzed by a computer-driven
acquisition system. No current instrumentation is available on or off campus
which could provide this hands-on analytical capability. The instrument will be
used in several major projects. 1. analysis of pheromone metabolism in moths,
for identification of juvenile hormones, for isolation of novel juvenoids and
antijuvenoids from insect tissues, and for analysis of metabolites of fluorine-
and silicon-containing squalene analogs. 2. separation of isotopically-labeled
compounds from catalytic reactions with P-450 models. 3. to examine changes in
membrane steroid composition which occur in antibiotic-resistant mutants of
Dictyostelium discoideum. 4. in the identification of lupine alkaloids in
stressed plants. Projects proposed by five minor users include 1. analysis of
phenolic metabolites obtained from peroxidase action; 2. flash vacuum pyrolysis
for analysis of nonvolatile molecules; 3. analysis of complex heterocycles in
molecular recognition experiments; 4. development of new synthetic methods in
asymmetric synthesis; and 5. analysis of facial stereochemistry in adamantyl
derivatives.
