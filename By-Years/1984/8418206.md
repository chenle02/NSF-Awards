In this project, an experimental laboratory will be upgraded during the
construction period to enhance and improve the capability of the facility to
conduct research projects on full- or large-scale five-story buildings of
masonry, steel or reinforced concrete. The long strong floor will provide a
capability to perform research on multi-span continuous bridges, not now
available in the United States. The laboratory will be the only one of its type
in the United States capable of full- or large-scale experiments on buildings
and small- or large-scale projects on bridges. It will provide the United States
with a unique experimental laboratory. Experiments on buildings and bridges will
be performed using sophisticated loading devices and instrumentation.
