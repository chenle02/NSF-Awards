This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of learning science
researchers, game designers, game theory researchers, and environmental
scientists to engage diverse audiences in the science of sustainability and
sustainable development. Taking its inspiration from Buckminster Fuller's "World
Game" - conceived nearly fifty years ago as a tool to facilitate a
comprehensive, participatory approach to addressing the problems of the world -
the team is developing, testing, and delivering a real-time, collaborative
environment using a distributed, technology-enhanced, game-based architecture to
enable groups of individuals to explore the interconnected nature of the
economic, social and environmental factors that influence sustainability. The
intellectual merit of the project has two key dimensions. First, by making
visualizations of scientific data available in public spaces for groups of
informal learners, the investigators seek to understand the nature of the
resulting participatory engagement with data, giving particular attention to
discovering design principles that influence the effectiveness of the
visualizations. Second, the investigators are creating innovative interfaces
that make computers "invisible" and provide alternative tactile, social, and
spatially distributed ways to interact with the underlying data, and then
studying how such interfaces promote generative and cooperative thinking about
sustainability issues. The project is exercising its broader impacts through its
contribution to the field's general understanding of the ways in which social,
highly participatory environments support deeper and more reflective learning
about complex multivariate data. Moreover, the research team is advancing the
public understanding of science in general, and sustainability and environmental
science in particular.
