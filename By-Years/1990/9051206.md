This project enhances the junior and senior-level Mechanical Engineering
laboratory facilities to better prepare students as mechanical engineers in
industry, government, and academia. The goal of this project is the development
of a computer-networked automated data acquisition and analysis system for
undergraduate students. Personal computers are linked to measurement, data
acquisition and data reduction instruments via an IEEE-488 bus as well as the
University of Texas Center for High Performance Computing. This networked
system's capabilities allows expanded coverage of traditional topics and permits
the introduction of appropriate advanced measurement and signal processing
techniques. The efficiencies inherent in the integrated computer system enable
students to more productively combine analysis with design. This facilitates the
traditional, iterative design process thereby allowing incorporation of
optimization techniques. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
