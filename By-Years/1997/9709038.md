Horia Metiu of the Chemistry Department of U of California-Santa Barbara is
funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study the
dynamics of complex systems by computer simulation of the migration of ions and
neutral molecules in zeolites. Zeolites are crystalline, porous solids which
have the ability to absorb inside a variety of molecules of industrial interest,
and to promote reactions of technological interest. However the mechanism of
such reactions is little known. This research is destined to unravel detailed
features about how molecules and ions move inside the zeolite channels. This
research has a potential to aid the rational design of zeolites with special
catalytic properties of interest in chemical industry.
