This proposal requests funds to purchase a preparative ultracentrifuge. The
instrument will facilitate research on protein involved in neuronal growth, to
understand the molecular basis of the spatial and temporal control of actin
filament assembly and to determine the role of actin assembly in nonmuscle cell
motility, on the structure, function, and regulation of Na,KATPase, on the
mechanism of endocytosis and receptor- recycling and the cell biology of the
macrophage mannose receptor, and the molecular basis of intracellular motility.
The senior investigators have good track records and are engaged in high-quality
research. Support is recommended.
