IRI-9612357 This award, in the SGER mode, funds a 24 month exploration of the
potential uses of an electronic "bridle" mounted on an insect to control its
locomotion. The investigation combines research in robotic control and sensing,
neurobiology, and microelectromechanical systems engineering, to instrument
large insects in such a fashion that signals analogous to those of a laboratory
robot may be sensed and commanded at will. The research in this exploration
period involves a study of the control strategies used in regulating locomotion,
including neural correlates to the locomotion control. Using a combination of
empirically and theoretically derived models, the investigators will attempt to
"reverse engineer" the working behavior of the insect, a Madagascar cockroach,
to the point of proposing automatic control strategies that can be implemented
on the animal via external stimulus, so that the animal's path and gait can be
guided and controlled by human or machine command.
