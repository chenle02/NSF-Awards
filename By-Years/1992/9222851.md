This proposal is for block travel grant to make a strong U.S. attendance at the
Fourth Symposium on Expert Systems Applications to Power Systems (ESAPS)
possible. This international meeting is a excellent vehicle for the
dissemination and exchange of information on this emerging and important area.
Participation by key researchers from around the world is expected. An effort
will be made to augment NSF funds with industry funds as well.
