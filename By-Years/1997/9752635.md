The purpose of this project is to develop and test a model for revitalizing
introductory geoscience courses. The approach is two-pronged: (1) to use
appropriate computer-based technology to engage students in constructivist,
inquiry-based activities in large introductory science courses, and (2) to help
enrolled pre-service teachers critically analyze the teaching and learning
strategies used in these courses. The goals for this project are to restructure
and revitalize two introductory science courses and to develop companion science
methods courses to be taken concurrently by pre-service teachers. Java
simulations will be developed to provide natural learning environments for
students and to allow instructors and students to analyze student efforts and
thought processes. These methods will be tested in similar science courses at
the University of Northern Iowa. This project will: 1) produce a collaborative
model to improve learning in large introductory science classes by restructuring
the classes to integrate constructivist, inquiry-based activities, 2) enhance
pre-service teacher science education by encouraging student teachers to focus
on their own metacognition while learning science, 3) provide learner-centered,
inquiry-driven simulations and management software which will be widely
available on the Internet for use in K-12 and college science courses 4) model
exemplary uses of instructional technology for pre-service teachers 5)
demonstrate the transferability of the model to other scientific disciplines by
revising an introductory course in a second geoscience area, and 6) provide an
instructional software design framework for use in the development of future
inquiry-based simulations.
