Abstract EEC-9615468 White The 19-minute video "Catalysts for Change",
describing the operation of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research
Centers Program, was completed, at the University of California, Berkeley, in
January, 1993. Although the video still describes the program well, some editing
of the video is called for since there have been changes in the Centers in the
program, funding levels, more recent technology transfer successes, and so on.
In addition, the impact of the video could be increased if some rearrangements
were made in the order of presentation of the topics. The University of
California, Berkeley proposes to make these changes by the Fall of 1996 with the
video being more up-to-date, somewhat shorter, and more modular video. The work
will be done by the same people who created the original video. This award
provides funding to modify the Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers
Program video "Catalysts for Change." The Principal Investigator and his
colleagues are experts in their fields and have the original master prints to
use for the necessary modifications.
