In this project funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research,
Koel will perform multidisciplinary studies to synthesize new fulleride and
superfulleride compounds using a molecular approach and to determine the
physical and chemical properties of these materials. The conditions of vapor
deposition of the precursors will be controlled on an atomic level, and the
compounds formed will be studied using photoelectron and electron-loss
spectroscopies. Thin films of metal-containing superfullerides will be
synthesized to search for systematic trends in electronic and possibly
superconducting properties of metal-doped C60. %%% This work will provide a
scientific basis for designing new synthetic procedures and structure-property
relationships for this intriguing class of materials. Fullerene thin films have
applications in areas such as diamond growth, superconductivity, and the
catalysis of hydrogen-transfer reactions.
