The goal of this research is to elucidate the hydrogen microstructure
surrounding passivated defects on crystalline semiconductors employing nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Quantitative NMR measurements
characterizing hydrogen surrounding passivated defects in silicon and also bulk
molecular hydrogen in bulk silicon will be made. Studies will be initiated with
the boron-hydrogen complex in heavily doped silicon and then extended to other
dopants such as aluminum, gallium and indium, and could eventually lead to
studies of dopants in germanium. Proton and other nuclei's NMR parameters such
as quadrupolar couplings, chemical shifts, dipolar oscillations, and relaxation
times will be determined and related to site symmetries, electric field
gradients, bond lengths, and atomic mobilities at low and elevated temperatures.
These results will be important in understanding the role of hydrogen in
semiconductor processing and in confirming theoretical models and calculations
of passivation phenomena.
