This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new joining technology that will provide substantial technical and cost
advantages for multiple industrial applications, including metal-to-metal and
metal-to-ceramic joining. The technology for joining metallic and ceramic
components is a reactive joining process that uses reactive multilayer foils as
local heat sources for melting solders or brazes. The foils are a new class of
nano-engineered materials, in which self-propagating exothermic reactions can be
ignited at room temperature with a spark. By inserting a multilayer foil between
two solder (or braze) layers and two components, heat generated by the reaction
in the foil melts the solder and consequently bonds the components. This new
method of soldering eliminates the need for a furnace and, with very localized
heating, avoids thermal damage to the components.

The commercial potential of this reactive bonding process is more rapid than
most competing technologies, and results in strong and cost-effective joints.
