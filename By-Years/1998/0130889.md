This action is to support a study to complete the post-earthquake reconnaissance
effort begun the day after the February 28, 2001 Nisqually Earthquake, and to
further document observations of important cases of ground failure and building
damage from this event.

Well-documented case histories of building performance at sites undergoing
severe and minor ground failure will be developed through selected field and
laboratory testing. These case histories will be documented at the website
developed during the post-earthquake reconnaissance of the Nisqually earthquake,
and in a paper to be published in the Journal "Spectra" of the Earthquake
Engineering Research Institute (EERI). Timely reporting of these results will
enable researchers to incorporate these data into ongoing studies and identify
additional work resulting from this important Pacific Northwest earthquake.

Professor Bray and some of his colleagues and graduate student researchers
traveled immediately to the affected area of the Nisqually earthquake, and as
part of a larger reconnaissance team completed documentation of some of the more
important geotechnical aspects of this event. This included conducting detailed
surveys of ground deformation from a significant lateral spread involving the
Deschutes Parkway, mapping of ground deformation at the Martin Way embankment
failure, documentation and sampling of sediment ejecta in several building
foundations in South Seattle, and surveying of the Highway 101 embankment
failure.

The goals of this follow-up study will be met in part by completing
documentation of these important case records, with emphasis on the Deschutes
Parkway in Olympia and the building foundations performance in South Seattle.
