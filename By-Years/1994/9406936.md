9406936 Saam Theoretical research will be done on systems in which the
properties of interfaces play a dominant role. Included are studies of fluid
dynamics in restricted geometries, directional solidification, droplet
spreading, lubrication, polymer adsorption, micelle formation and structure,
wetting phenomena in both mixtures of helium-three and -four and of hydrogen and
deuterium, wetting in metallic films, the properties of helium-three and -four
mixtures in aerogel, and the dynamics of prewetting. Techniques to be employed
include Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of both continuum and
lattice models, density-functionals and mean- field theory. %%% A broad research
program using analytical and computational techniques will investigate a variety
of physical phenomena in which the interfaces between two different phases play
an important role. For instance, under what conditions does a fluid wet a
surface? The properties of the interface between the solid surface and the fluid
largely determines whether the fluid will wet the surface. This can have
profound fundamental and technological implications. ***
