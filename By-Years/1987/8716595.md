This project will study the problem of determining the shape and physical
properties of an object, including internal structure, from the scattering
pattern of a known incident field. Numerical techniques based on the theory of
nonlinear optimization complement the analytical development of this line of
enquiry. Thus the mathematical treatment of problems ranging from the location
of natural resources to the location and identification of tumors will be
refined and implemented.
