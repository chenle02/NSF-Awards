The search for new fundamental interactions of nature is at the heart of
experimental particle physics. The current Standard Model of particle physics
has been enormously successful at describing current measurements, but it is an
incomplete theory. All of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
operating at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland are focused on discoveries beyond the
Standard Model. This project and the LHCb experiment as a whole seek new
discoveries through precision measurements of particle decays produced at the
LHC. These measurements aim to answer questions stretching back to the Big Bang,
such as, why is our universe dominated by matter and not antimatter?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves two main components. To improve the
quality of data taken by LHCb and ensure it continues to produce excellent
results throughout the next decade, construction of new detector upgrades is
underway. This project will lead the characterization and production of the
silicon microstrip sensors that form the heart of the Upstream Tracker
subdetector upgrade. Using data collected by LHCb, a novel method will be
employed to study decays containing particles that are difficult or impossible
to measure directly. As a result, new measurements will be performed of the
mixing of quark flavors and the direct search for new interactions that violate
conservation laws of the Standard Model.
