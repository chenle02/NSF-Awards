With support from Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic Serving
Institutions (HSI program), this Track 1 project aims to increase diversity,
inclusion, and retention in STEM. It will do so by transforming teaching and
learning in introductory undergraduate science courses. Underrepresented
students enter higher education and STEM fields with a wealth of cultural
capital and resilience that supports their success in demanding and innovative
disciplines. This project aims to leverage those assets through inclusive and
affirming STEM learning opportunities that enhance undergraduate students' STEM
identities. To this end, the project will implement teaching innovations within
introductory science courses and create a faculty learning community committed
to instructional transformation. The proposed course improvements have the
potential to increase retention and graduation rates in STEM majors and to serve
as a model for replication across the California State University system and
other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to support
undergraduate students, particularly Hispanic and other underrepresented
minority students, during the first two years of college when attrition rates
from STEM are highest. Project objectives include implementing teaching and
learning experiences that cultivate community development, sense of belonging,
and academic inclusivity in introductory science courses. The projectâ€™s research
plan is designed to examine student experiences in introductory STEM courses and
assess the pedagogical approaches that support STEM learning and STEM identity
construction. This research can contribute new knowledge about the adaptability
and sustainability of curricular reforms. Methodological approaches include both
qualitative (e.g., student interviews) and quantitative (e.g., surveys; course
statistics) data sources to holistically capture student experiences, learning,
and identity trajectories along their undergraduate pathways. The project uses a
novel approach to undergraduate course transformation that draws from both
evidence-based and active learning approaches to STEM instruction, as well as
culturally sustaining and asset-based pedagogy. Findings from this project have
the potential to advance knowledge about and promote sustainable institutional
improvements of undergraduate STEM education. The HSI Program aims to enhance
undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by
the HSI Program will also generate knowledge on how to achieve these
aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
