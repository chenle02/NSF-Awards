The goal of this research is the development of enhanced service options for
low bit rate video applications to improve their transmission over packet based
wireless channels. The encoding process will be studied in detail to better
understand the underlying characteristics of the service. This research will
draw on expertise gained from previous work in the area of variable bit rate
video transmission over ATM based BISDN networks. Current work will focus on the
H.263 standard which encompasses a very complex encoding process that
incorporates several different options. The impact of these options on the
transmission of video data over a packet based wireless channel has not yet been
studied extensively. The research plan involves studying the different encoding
options and then investigating network access and error recovery schemes for the
transmission of packetized video data. The orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing and multicarrier modulation (OFDM and MCM) wireless transmission
schemes and antenna diversity strategy studied are interesting for video
applications because of the flexibility with which channel resources may be
dynamically allocated for layered video coding transmission. Nonlinear receiver
structures and nonlinear processing for image quality enhancement to combat the
effects of interference on video quality will also be studied. The research
project includes the set-up of a wireless testbed that will be housed in both
the Signal Processing Research Laboratory and the Video Processing and
Telecommunications Laboratory. The testbed will be used to conduct experiments
on indoor wireless video transmission.
