9352265 Reed The aim of this project is to incorporate an experimental component
in a new elective course on the fundamentals of wind engineering. It is an
interdisciplinary senior-level course that combines the wind engineering aspects
of environmental and structural engineering, and engineering meteorology.
Specifically, a sonic anemometer is utilized for teaching basic measurement and
analysis skills that are essential for wind-related analyses in environmental
and structural engineering. Interpretation and evaluation of wind speeds,
intensities and integral scales of turbulence for different exposures and
averaging times are a part of the course. Because the sonic anemometer can be
attached to a lap-top computer and easily transported to various locations,
students can take the anemometer and computer to nearby urban areas for
evaluating air quality and pedestrian level wind effects.
