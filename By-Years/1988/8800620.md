This proposal requests renewed funding to complete studies of the behavior of
natural decay-series radionuclides and their applications to problems of
chemical scavenging and particle dynamics in the oceanic water column. Tasks
that will be carried out during the one-year grant period are: 1) completion of
a one-year record of dissolved and particu- late radionuclide distributions at a
station in the Sargasso Sea off Bermuda; 2) in the North Pacific; and 3)
interpreta- tion and publication of an accumulated set of data on radio- nuclide
distributions and fluxes in the oceanic water column. These studies will
contribute to our understanding of how the oceans process chemical substances
added to them and to a better understanding of particle fluxes and dynamics in
the oceans, issues that are of broad concern to marine chemistry, biology, and
geology.
