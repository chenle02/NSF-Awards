The PI proposes to purchase a Omnisorp 100 CX sorptometer (an adsorption)
porosimeter) from Coulter. The instrument measures the surfaces area, pore
volume, and micropore (20 A) and mesopore (20-500 A) size distribution of a
porous solid sample based on the physical adsorption of N2. A volumetric method
is used to measure the adsorption and desorption isotherms over a large pressure
range, and from these the pore characteristics of the material can be
calculated. The PI, together with collaborators, will use this instrument in
several related studies, including: (i) Experiments to obtain date in well-
characterized porous materials, and comparisons of this data with theoretical
results using modern statistical mechanical Monte-Carlo and molecular dynamic
simulations and (ii) characterizations of the porosity of intercalated composite
silicate materials, and high surface area aluminas, silicas and alumino-
silicates. The molecular dynamics simulations of the PI are of the highest
quality, and the purchase of this instrument will facilitate the comparison of
the simulations with experiments. The instrument will further the research of
collaborators working on new layered and catalyst porous materials.
