Abstract:

The main goal of the project is to find the conditions on an algebraic variety
that guarantee good estimates for analytic functions on the variety in terms of
their values at real points. Particularly, it is concerned with estimates
analogous to those of the Phragmen-Lindelof theorem which gives uniform upper
bounds for pluri-subharmonic functions that are bounded above at the real points
of the complex Euclidean space and satisfy an asymptotic linear growth rate. A
new geometric condition, that the variety is nearly hyperbolic, is proposed to
characterize such properties. The new condition gives a precise sense in which
the variety has many real points, and is intermediate in strength between having
a full dimensional set of real points and admitting a projection map with real
fibers over real points.

The project aims to determine the geometric properties of algebraic and
analytic varieties in Euclidean space that determine when the analytic functions
on the variety have properties similar to those of entire functions on Euclidean
space. It is motivated by connections with the properties of solution operators
for systems of constant coefficient partial differential operators and
convolution operators on global smooth functions. The goal is to give algorithms
for deciding whether or not specific operators admit solutions and solution
operators on spaces of infinitely differentiable functions and distributions.
The study uses methods from and contributes new results to pluri-potential
theory, the area whose relationship to analytic functions of several complex
variables is the analogue of the relationship of classical potential theory to
the theory of analytic functions of one complex variable.
