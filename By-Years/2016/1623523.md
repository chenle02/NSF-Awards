The purpose of this project is to transition fundamental research results
developed during a current NSF project into commercial products. A low-cost heat
flux sensor system was developed that can be applied to a number of innovative
applications. Heat flux sensors that are currently on the market are expensive
and sold in small quantities for research and standards testing. The new design
uses a semi-automated process that has the capability to provide a market
breakthrough in terms of cost and availability of sensors. Potential
applications are in the fields of medical technology, building energy analysis
and control, wearable technology, education, manufacturing processes, and heated
products. The broadest impact of the proposed sensor commercialization would be
for biomedical applications, including burn diagnosis and treatment, prevention
of bedsores in bedridden patients, and early stage diagnosis of skin cancer.
When applied to such real medical problems, this engineering technology could
benefit millions of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new heat flux sensor
technology was developed using a novel method of manufacturing for semi-
automated production. This technique allows creation of large arrays of
thermocouple junctions connected in series from one side of a thermally
resistive sheet to the other to form a differential thermopile. The resulting
voltage output is directly proportional to the heat flux through the sheet. The
sensitivity factor is found from calibration relative to a heat flux standard.
The sensors will be designed to be user friendly with built-in circuits to
convert the raw voltages into digital heat flux signals that can be loaded
directly into a laptop computer. The sensors are thin and flexible for simple
mounting onto a wide variety of surfaces. A range of resulting possible
applications will be explored to take advantage of the low price of the sensors
to build many types of useful systems.
