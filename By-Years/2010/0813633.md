Title: Knowledge Regimes and Comparative Political Economy

Project Abstract

This project explores the process by which policy ideas are generated and
contested. How are the policy research organizations (e.g., think tanks) that
generate various policy ideas organized in different countries? How do they
operate and try to influence public policy? How have they changed since the late
1980s? Have they become more or less similar over time? Answers to these
questions will be developed through the analysis of in-depth interviews and
documents collected from a sample of these organizations in four countries:
Denmark, France, Germany, and the United States. In doing so, the research will
also test two important theories of organizational and institutional change that
have preoccupied social scientists for years. One suggests that groups of
organizations in a field tend to converge over time on a common set of
practices; the other suggests that they do not and that organizations tend to
retain their uniqueness even as they change. Rarely have these theories been
tested with qualitative data. Hence, this project offers a unique opportunity
not only to determine the degree to which convergence in an organizational field
has occurred, but also to identify the mechanisms that are involved. As a
result, this research will have several broad impacts. First, it will help us
better understand how organizational and institutional change occurs. Second, it
will help policy research organizations better understand how their operations
compare to their counterparts at home and abroad. Finally, it will offer new
insights into an important but much neglected part of democratic policy-
making?the process by which new policy ideas are generated in the first place.
