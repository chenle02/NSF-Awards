This is a minority research initiation (MRI) planning grant. The research will
investigate three issues in the usability of hypertext related to skill level.
The approach to be taken will address the learning issue by long durations to
assess performance during browsing activities as a function of skill
development. Improvement in hypertext usage via new control mechanisms will be
studied by embedding an expert-tutor/advisor within the hypertext system to
monitor student progress. The proper amount of control will be studied as a
function of user skill and subgroups (high-control seekers versus low-control
seekers). The final aspect is to study how different users navigate a hypertext
document. Specifically, are there identifiable paths or strategies taken for
users with different strategies, styles, skills or motivations.
