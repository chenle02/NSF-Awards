9729834 Pachavis Polymers in confined spaces are of increasing relevance in a
variety of contexts, ranging from coatings applications (paints, lubricants,
adhesives) to nanocomposite materials. This symposium will focus on |addressing
recent advances in this field, especially fundamental research that directly
impacts practical applications. Excellent examples include the recent interest
in clay-based polymer composite materials, thin-film display devices, the role
of interfacial bonding on defects in extruded polymer parts, and on optical
devices constructed from polymer-inorganic composite materials. The fundamental
basis of these applications, including wetting, surface segregation and phase
transitions in thin polymer films are also of interest. Both static and dynamic
aspects will be stressed. A focused session on smart materials is also planned.
Contributed papers will be presented in the following areas: Phase transitions
and pattern formation in thin films Nanocomposite materials (including thin-film
devices) Dynamics in confined spaces (including dynamics/tribology) Adhesion and
compatibilization Wetting and surface segregation Brushes and block copolymers
Self-assembled systems ***
