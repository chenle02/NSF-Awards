The recent explosive growth in parallel and distributed systems has brought new
importance to the field of scheduling theory. In order for this technology to
fulfill its potential of providing tremendous computing power, it is crucial to
understand how to best schedule the components of a computation on the resources
of the parallel or distributed system, so that the most efficient use possible
of these resources is achieved. In this research algorithms will be designed for
the basic problems of scheduling a set of machines. Although this work is
motivated by the application of these problems to parallel and distributed
computing, many of the problems are of great importance in operations research
as well. The focus is on two fundamental models of scheduling more than one
machine: the shop model, in which each job has a number of operations, each of
which must be processed by a particular machine, and the parallel machine model,
in which each job has one operation which can be processed by any of the
machines. Most of these problems are NP-hard, and much remains to be understood
about how well they can be approximated in polynomial time. Further, work will
be done on scheduling models that more completely capture realistic parallel and
distributed scheduling questions. Traditional models have largely ignored any
underlying parallel and distributed network; they have also most often assumed
that the entire specification of a problem is given in advance of the beginning
of the construction of a schedule. Problems of scheduling and load balancing on
specific networks and architectures and on-line algorithms for both the
traditional and more realistic scheduling models will be studied.
