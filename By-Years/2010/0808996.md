This project will continue the development of new stereoselective alkylations of
metalated nitriles. New methods of generating nitrile anions will be pursued
with particular attention on environmentally benign alkylations. Detailed
mechanistic analysis of alkene alkylations will be undertaken as a prelude to
developing a general synthesis of densely substituted bicyclic ketones.
Fundamental insight from these reactions will be used to develop a chiral
alkylation strategy for assembling contiguous tertiary-quaternary stereocenters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Professor Fraser F. Fleming of the
Department of Chemistry at Duquesne University. Professor Fleming's research
focuses on new reactions of metalated nitriles that are unable to be achieved
through alkylation of the corresponding carbonyl derivatives. The chemistry will
contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis, address the
long-standing difficulty of synthesizing hindered chiral centers, and provide
fundamental insight into the nature of metalated nitriles. Achieving these goals
will impact the synthesis of small organic molecules of particular interest to
pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
