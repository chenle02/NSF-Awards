The subject of functional analysis provides a powerful mathematical language for
the investigation of infinite-dimensional structures. The abstract nature of
this language allows for a wide spectrum of applications, whose various settings
include quantum mechanics, the theory of probability, and the study of systems,
physical or otherwise, as they evolve in time. The project will concentrate on
several aspects and generalized forms of the last of these three settings, and
it will largely revolve around phenomena related to entropy.

Finite or finite-dimensional approximation has long played a fundamental role in
both dynamics and operator algebras and is manifest in its most basic and
influential forms through the notions of amenability and soficity and their
algebraic analogues. In the domain of C*-algebras, amenability has been subject
to various refinements like finite decomposition rank and finite nuclear
dimension that express the kind of topological regularity necessary for
K-theoretic classification theorems within the Elliott program. This project
aims to broaden our understanding of the relationships between these regularity
properties and phenomena in topological dynamics, in particular mean dimension
and Rokhlin-type dimensional invariants, and to test this understanding on a
variety of examples that have so far remained beyond the scope of
classification, such as actions of branch groups. Combinatorial independence
will be brought into this picture as a tool for analyzing mixing and
paradoxicality in dynamics and their relation to quasidiagonality and
dimensional behavior, and it will be also applied to actions of sofic groups in
the study of entropy and orbit equivalence.
