&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a three-year Combined
Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "Intermetallic
Compounds and Composites," at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under the
direction of Dr. Peter K. Liaw. The overall objective of this project is to
integrate the long-standing research advances on the manufacture,
characterization, modeling, and design of intermetallics and composites,
achieved by UT and the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), into a
multidisciplinary undergraduate and graduate curriculum at UT.
