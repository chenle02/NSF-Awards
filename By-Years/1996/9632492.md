Abstract Fontijn 9632492 The proposed work represents an extension of the PIs
current program to provide rate coefficient and mechanistic data for individual
reactions of toxic metal species up to high temperatures which are of importance
in incineration processes. In the previous work the reactions of Cu, Cr, Sn and
Cd with oxidants such as N2O, O2 , Cl2, and HCl were investigated as a function
of temperature using three unique types of apparatus. A semi- empirical
configuration interaction (SECI) theory was also developed to help correlate the
experimental results. The proposed program will extend the experimental effort
to include reactions of Ni, Pb, Sb, and As in elemental, oxide and chloride
forms with HCl, O2, CO2, and H2O, as a function of temperature, using the High
Temperature Flow Reactor (HTFF), Metals High Temperature Photochemistry (MHTP)
apparatus and a mass spectrometer HTFF combination. These studies will be
complimented by further development of the semi-predictive theories SECI and
MTST (metals transition state theory) in order to extend and compare with the
experimental data.
