This study will examine the relationship of gender to the structural
characteristics and consequences of paid and unpaid work. The study will compare
the characteristics women's and men's work (paid and unpaid) and study the
effects of housework and job conditions on the psychological well-being of women
and men. Data from a national survey about gender, work, and well- being will be
employed. The study will contribute to our understanding of how gender
differences in psychological well-being may derive from the interaction of paid
and unpaid work conditions.
