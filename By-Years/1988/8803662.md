This award will suport cooperative research between Prof. Thomas Devlin of
Hahnemann University School of Medicine and Prof. Salvador Uribe of the National
Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City. The investigators intend
to study the effect of prostaglandin polymers on calcium ATPase in 2 systems:
the human red blood cell plasma membrane and the sarcolemma of the rabbit heart.
They will also study the effect of PG polymers on the metabolism of rat
hepatocytes. The work on enzymes from human erithrocytes is to be performed at
Hahnemann University while the work on rabbit heart sarcolemma and muscle
sarcoplasmic reticulum will be carried out at UNAM. The investigators are
capable and the collaboration continues an ongoing effort. These studies should
add to our understanding of the mechanisms of action of the PGB oligomers and
calcium ATPase and their role in maintaining intracellular calcium levels.
