The PI has discovered a major electric conductivity anomaly related to a buried
half spreading center at the south edge of the subducted Gorda Plate. The
geometry of this anomaly shows that the motion of the Gorda Plate has been
controlled by the orientation of the Blanco Fracture Zone and not the Mendocino
Fracture Zone for at least several My. More mapping of the anomaly will provide
further constraints on the plate motions. Understanding the detailed structure
of the anomaly will provide insight into how the buried spreading center has
produced the enormously important geothermal resources of the area and how the
mechanical system must work. The anomaly, however, appears to be fundamentally
3-D. It probably involves conduction of currents through the otherwise resistive
Coast Range, which are induced in nearby highly conductive surface structures
such as the ocean. A 3-dimensional modeling effort to understand various
features of the anomaly such as its lack of frequency- dependence will be
carried out, as will a limited field effort to a really extend our array and to
provide MT constraints for the modeling effort. These are both a necessary
prelude to a major field effort designed to image the sturcture in detail using
an innovative technique such as EMAP (Electro Magnetic Array Profiling).
