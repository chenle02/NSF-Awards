NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0103849 Mathematical Sciences: The Whitham Equations
and Their Solutions

Abstract

DMS-0103849 Tian

The Principal Investigator will consider a variety of problems concerning the
Whitham equations, which describe the macrostructure of nonlinear dispersive
oscillations. In particular, the Principal Investigator will study (1)
multiphase Whitham equations in one spatial dimension, and (2) Whitham equations
in several spatial dimensions. The primary interest of the first project is in
the interaction of single-phase oscillations and generation and propagation of
double and higher phase oscillations. The basic goal of the second project is to
understand how the zero phase Whitham solution develops singularities in several
dimensional space. The proposed methods will be both analytical and
computational.

Results of this project will have broad impact in interdisciplinary work. The
multiphase Whitham equations in one spatial variable play an essential role in
both zero dispersion limit and modulation theories of nonlinear dispersive
oscillations. They also have applications in the transmission of pulses in
optical fibers. The Whitham equations in several spatial dimensions are
intrinsically connected to Landau-Ginzburg models in topological field theory
and the Seiberg-Witten solution in supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory.
