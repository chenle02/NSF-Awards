This proposal is from the Temple University, Wayne State University and Lincoln
University groups and requests funding to investigate one of the most important
questions of the 21st century: What is Dark Matter? A natural explanation is a
population of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from
the Big Bang. To directly detect WIMPs by their interaction inside a detector
yielding a ~keV/amu recoil nucleus, the PIs have invented the Negative Ion Time
Projection Chamber (NITPC) and have built a first generation device, the
Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks detector (DRIFT-I) with an active
volume of 1 m3 and an active mass of 167 g. DRIFT-I is currently taking data at
the Boulby mine in Northeast England. The plan now is to build a scaled-up, much
improved NITPC called DRIFT-II as a fully modular detector which could be
scaled-up to ~100 kg active mass. The technique uses a low pressure,
electronegative gas (CS2) target and is direction sensitive to neutron
recoils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the education/outreach area, the DRIFT detector
technology has promising applications to Homeland Security and for tracking at
the Next Linear Collider. The project has already brought people from
underrepresented groups into cutting edge research. The tradition is enhanced by
collaboration with Lincoln University, an HBC.
