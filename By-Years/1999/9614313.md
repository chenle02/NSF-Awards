96-14313 Brown, Slutsky, Abramson The PIs propose to experimentally determine
the elastic anisotropy of e-iron at high pressures using Impulsive Stimulated
Scattering, a technique they are currently developing for high pressure studies
of opaque materials in the diamond anvil cell. The data are crucial for
understanding the physical mechanisms of the seismically determined elastic
anisotropy of the earth's inner core. ***
