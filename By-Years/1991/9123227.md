The principal investigator together with the co-principal investigators will
carry out research on the development of scientific computing, asymptotics and
their application to fluid mechanics and wave propagation. The analysis of
nonlinear fluid dynamics is of significant scientific interest in view of the
wide spread occurrence of such phenomena in real world situations.
