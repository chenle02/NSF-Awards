This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Florida. The project studies the reasons why elderly Black
Americans suffering from hypertension follow or ignore the dietary suggestions
of their medical care givers. The student will interview 40 informants using a
standardized model of "Health Beliefs" as well as other standardized measures of
medical knowledge and personality. The purpose will be to explain variations in
people's culturally- determined diet patterns. This research is important
because the elderly Black population is an expanding portion of the nation, and
is disproportionally susceptible to hypertension. This study will help medical
care givers understand why some people follow a medically approved diet while
others do not deviate from their childhood diets rich in fat, calories and salt.
The knowledge can be useful to those designing programs of public education
about how to treat hypertension.
