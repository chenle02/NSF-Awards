Robert Bryant (the PI) plans to apply the theory of exterior differential
systems, the method of equivalence, and methods from the calculus of variations
to study a variety of problems in differential geometry, mathematical physics,
and econometrics. Among the specific problems and areas that he intends to
investigate are these: In affine geometry, he will investigate the new
integrable systems that he has discovered while working on the affine Bonnet
problem. In Riemannian geometry, he will continue his work on classifying
Riemannian submersions from space forms and other symmetric spaces, work on
classifying special metrics (such as solitons and metrics with restrictions on
the algebraic type of the curvature tensor), and on understanding the integrable
systems associated with special holonomy metrics of higher cohomogeneity. In
Finsler geometry, Bryant will continue to develop the theory of Finsler
manifolds with constant flag curvature, both in constructing new examples and in
understanding the properties of their geodesic flows; the relations with twistor
theory and exotic holonomy structures will be especially examined. In complex
geometry, Bryant will continue his work on characterizing the rational normal
structures induced on the moduli space of rational contact curves in holomorphic
contact $3$-folds, with the goal of understanding how these are connected to
integrable systems and their curvature properties. All these (and other related
projects) will produce results that are useful in themselves, but they will also
motivate the development of new techniques in exterior differential systems and
the method of equivalence and will facilitate the training of graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows in these techniques.

Many of the important advances in our ability to use mathematics in physics and
other sciences have depended on developing a geometric understanding of those
problems, i.e., an understanding that focuses only on the aspects of those
problems that are not tied to specific (often, arbitrarily chosen) coordinate
systems. For example, Einstein's formulation of General Relativity came only
after he was able to employ the coordinate-free concepts of Riemannian geometry
effectively to isolate and describe the essential nature of gravity as the
curvature of space-time. However, coordinate-free formulations of a problem
often reveal degeneracies that need to be approached by nonstandard tools, such
as the theory of differential systems. Bryant's plan of research, which applies
the coordinate-free theories of differential systems and the method of
equivalence, will lead to a more fundamental, geometric understanding of a
number of problems that arise in the study of surfaces in space, the special
structures that arise because of extra or hidden symmetries, and the nature of
curvature itself in a number of geometric contexts.
