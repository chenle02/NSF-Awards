The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a high resolution tomography
facility for obtaining information on defects and internal structures of
materials. Tomography is a diagnostic technique using x-ray photographs in which
the shadows of structures before and behind the section under scrutiny do not
interfere with the observation. The proposed research will have a great impact
on both the science and the knowledge base in materials characterization.
Successful completion of the proposed research could also provide a potentially
useful nondestructive evaluation method which could be used for diagnostic
purposes on a variety of advanced materials.
