This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project entails development of a
novel on-chip electronic encoding bead-array detection system for simultaneous
multiplexed detection of pathogenic agents. This technology will offer a quick
and highly sensitive identification method for pathogens or toxins. Most current
systems for the fast detection of pathogens are based on fluorescent dye
labeling and optical detection of the signal, which are prone to photobleaching
and are likely to fall short when multiplex detection is required. This new
electronic encoding and chip-based system is highly flexible and can be used for
direct detection and identification of whole pathogens, toxins or DNA/RNA.

The method will have a broad impact on a number of bioanalytical fields because
it will be capable of rapid, highly sensitive and multiplexed identification of
pathogens or their toxins. The proposed research will have broad impact and
applications in molecular diagnostics, and detection of infectious disease and
biological agents. The applications will range from the detection of pathogens
and biological warfare agents in environmental, agricultural and medical samples
to infectious disease in clinical, molecular diagnostic and forensic
applications.
