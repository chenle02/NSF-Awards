Purdue University continues operating a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site affiliated with its School of Materials Engineering. The REU Site
research focuses on the processing and characterization of materials. Ten
undergraduate students are recruited every year for a nine-week summer research
experience. The REU site has a recruitment focus on students from institutions
where there is little exposure to materials science and engineering as a
discipline. Students are involved in materials research that emphasizes
processing of polymers, metals and ceramics, and their composites. Students also
attend departmental graduate research seminars, organized social activities and
an end-of-summer research mini conference.
