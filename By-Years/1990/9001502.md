The research will be in three area: 1) density functional theory, 2) surface
physics, 3) quantum diffusion. The main emphasis in the first area will be
density functional theory for high-temperature superconductors. Work in surface
physics includes atom-surface scattering, recoilless scattering for very heavy
atoms, inelastic scattering involving soft phonon production, and plasmons in
small structures. The research in quantum diffusion includes studying hydrogen
in or on vibrating solids and the analysis of quantum diffusion in a static
disordered potential.
