This project will examine neural circuits that make up a unique region of the
insect brain, called the central complex, and will study its role in guiding the
insect as it turns to move around barriers. This large midline brain region
appears to be involved in processing large amounts of sensory information, then
using it to influence movement. The Ritzmann laboratory will employ a range of
electrophysiological and behavioral techniques to examine how central complex
circuits process mechanical and visual information from antennae and eyes and to
identify the neurons that perform these functions. Regions of the central
complex will then be reversibly inactivated with local anesthetics to examine
their effects on behavior. The results are critical to our understanding of how
brain systems influence complex movements. They will complement recent advances
in motor control stemming from neurogenetic techniques from several other
laboratories. Indeed, because similar interactions between higher brain systems
and local reflexes exist in virtually all legged animals, including vertebrates,
the results will have wide ranging neurobiological impact. Moreover, the PI has
a long-term commitment to bringing knowledge of biological systems to the design
of legged robots. As such, the project should also lead to more advanced robots
that can move autonomously through tortuous terrain with less direction from a
driver. The project will continue the PI?s successful record of training both
graduate and undergraduate students and extend this opportunity to pre-college
students. Undergraduate and pre-college students will have the opportunity to
work directly with graduate students and other senior laboratory personnel on
the project under the direct guidance of Dr. Ritzmann. This arrangement
generates a unique opportunity for novices to experience research while
providing mentorship experience for the senior personnel.
