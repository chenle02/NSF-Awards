The focus of this research is on natural product synthesis and relies on the
development of the use of dialkylvinylsulfonium salts as reagents for the
preparation of intermediates for the construction of mytomycin C and FR900482.
The focus of the educational plan involves the development of a novel graduate
course in drug design and mechanism as well as involving undergraduates in an
active laboratory experience. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research and educational plan of Dr. Leslie Jimenez of
the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University. Professor Jimenez will focus
her research efforts on the development of short efficient syntheses of the
natural products mitomycin C and FR900482. The focus of Dr. Jimenez' educational
plan involves the development of a novel graduate course in drug design and
mechanism as well as involving undergraduates in an active laboratory
experience.
