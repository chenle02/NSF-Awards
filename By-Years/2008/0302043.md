DMS-0302043&lt;br/&gt;Lorenzini, Dino
J.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Abelian
varieties and Neron models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main problems in
arithmetic geometry is the determination&lt;br/&gt;of the set of rational
solutions of a system of polynomial &lt;br/&gt;equations with rational
coefficients. &lt;br/&gt;One of the most successful techniques&lt;br/&gt;in the
study of such a set of solutions is to reduce the equations modulo&lt;br/&gt;a
prime p and to study the set of solutions of &lt;br/&gt;the latter system of
equations. It turns out that,&lt;br/&gt;in many situations, it is possible to
describe a canonical way&lt;br/&gt;of reducing the equations modulo p. When
A/K&lt;br/&gt;is an abelian variety, this canonical reduction is called the
N\'eron model&lt;br/&gt;of A/K. This reduction is the object of study in
&lt;br/&gt;Lorenzini's first three research projects in this proposal.
&lt;br/&gt;For instance, attached to any Neron model&lt;br/&gt;is a finite group
called the group of components. When the reduction is purely&lt;br/&gt;additive,
it is conjectured that there are only &lt;br/&gt;finitely many possibilities for
this group once the dimension g is fixed.&lt;br/&gt;Lorenzini's proposed
research will&lt;br/&gt;shed more light on this conjecture and on other
special&lt;br/&gt;phenomena that arise when the reduction modulo a small prime
p&lt;br/&gt;is not `good.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, human beings have
been fascinated with &lt;br/&gt;solving Diophantine equations, named after the
Greek &lt;br/&gt;mathematician Diophantus who lived&lt;br/&gt;in the third
century AD. The field of Diophantine equations&lt;br/&gt;has taken added
significance in the modern world as &lt;br/&gt;it finds applications in a
variety of areas, including &lt;br/&gt;encryption. Since the time of the Greeks,
mathematicians have developed&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated tools to aid in solving
equations. This investigator &lt;br/&gt;has developed some such tools, and is
currently working on &lt;br/&gt;further contributions to this field.&lt;br/&gt;
