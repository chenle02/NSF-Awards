Dr. Garland will apply experimental methods, refined in his laboratory, to study
in formation and behavior of structural glasses and the commensurate phases,
important research areas in low temperature physics and chemistry. Ultrasonic
measurements provide an excellent method to enhance the basic understanding of
these challenging problems by providing an important tool for characterizing the
glass "freezing" temperature and for monitoring prefreezing dynamics in the
megahertz frequency range. In addition, these experimental measurements provide
the data essential to testing modern theories of critical dynamics in pure
fluids and to point the directions for the development of new theory. Ultrasonic
studies are also advantageous since both the static and dynamic response of a
system can be determined from simultaneous measurements of velocity and
attenuation of acoustic waves as a function of frequency. Such measurements will
be made as a function of temperature and composition in 1) alkali cyanide
structural glasses, 2) dipolar ferro/antiferroelectric structural glasses, and
3) crystals exhibiting incommensurate phases.
