The Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs) are climatological features in the
earth's atmosphere that are intimately tied to both the tropical large-scale
meridional (Hadley) circulation and the low-latitude surface circulation. The
ITCZs drive the meridional circulation cells which transport momentum and excess
heat from the tropics to midlatitudes, thereby affecting the baroclinity of the
midlatitudes and hence climate. In addition, the eastern Pacific ITCZ appears to
play a role in the large El Nino/Southern Oscillation climate fluctuations. Yet
the dynamics and energetics of the processes maintaining the Intertropical
Convergence Zones are poorly understood. This study examines the maintenance of
the ITCZ phenomenon and the associated large-scale circulation, using a General
Circulation Model and a simplified 3-layer model of the tropical atmosphere. The
PI will explore how the surface boundary heating (sea surface temperature) and
orography effect the location, strength, energetics and dynamics of the ITCZ
through a carefully designed set of GCM experiments with increasingly
complicated forcing. A 3-layer model of the tropical atmosphere will be
constructed and employed to facilitate in the interpretation of the GCM
experiments (this model will explicitly resolve the boundary layer and the free
baroclinic tropical tropospheric circulations). The results will help to better
define the relationship between the ITCZ and large-scale meridional and surface
circulations, and hence contribute to our knowledge of the global climate.
