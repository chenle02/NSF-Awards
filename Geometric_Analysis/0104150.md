Abstract for DMS - 0104150 PI: Wei-Dong Ruan

Dr. Ruan proposes to study the Lagrangian fibration structure of Calabi-Yau
manifolds and of more general Kaehler manifolds, and their applications in
mirror symmetry and other Kahler geometry problems as well. The objective of the
proposed research is to further inderstand the Lagrangian torus fibration
structures for more general Calabi-Yau manifolds, exploring the interplay of
sympletic geometry and complex geometry in Kaehler manifolds, as indicated by
Kontsevich's categorical mirror symmetry program.

Mirror symmetry has its origin in string theory and says that we have two
theories, which appear to be completely distinct, describing the same physics.
If we have two different models of the same universe, one can expect that one of
the models can fill in the gaps in understanding the other model. This project
is towards understanding this symmetry principle. Results from this proposal
should be of interest to mathematicians from various disciplines as well as
physicists in string theory.
