AST 0453437 Pilachowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a collaborative
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site program headed by Dr.
Catherine Pilachowski, at Indiana University, Bloomington (IUB), and Dr. Orville
Bignall at Tennessee State University (TSU). The program is entitled REACHing
Minorities and Women: a TSU/IUB REU Site Partnership, with the acronym REACH
meaning "Researchers Enhancing Activities and Curricula by Helping". The goal of
this program is to educate future leaders in astronomy and physics, and in
particular underrepresented minorities and women. The proposed REU site has
academic year and summer programs for math and physics undergraduate students at
TSU, and summer internships at IUB. The IUB/TSU partnership is intended to
engage TSU majors in a year-round program to enhance their academic training and
to provide them with the essential non-academic skill sets to ensure they are
competitive, successful and desirous of continuing their education beyond the
baccalaureate level. &lt;br/&gt;***
