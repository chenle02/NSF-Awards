The purpose of this research is to empirically analyze the effects of incomplete
information concerning people's HIV status on their sexual behavior and the
spread of the AIDS. The study will utilize data from the San Francisco Home
Health Study and will obtain three sets of estimates to address three different
objectives. First, the fraction of individuals engaging in potentially disease
transmitting circumstances will be assessed. Second, estimates will be obtained
of both the extent to which incomplete information is present during the
transmissive activity and the effect it has on such activity. Third, the study
will be determined how the prevalence of AIDS might stabilize itself over time.
This research is important because public health interventions aimed at
controlling the epidemic are almost exclusively information based and because
this project has important implications for the effects of such measures.
