This dissertation project extends and tests theories of moder- nization. From
four decades of Mexican censuses, measures of underemployment, poverty, and
living conditions are predicted to vary systematically with urbanization and
industrial development. Hypotheses include the idea that average physical and
human capital tend to diverge with modernization, and that, under certain
conditions, expanding industrial infrastructure can cause declining economic
performance per capita.
