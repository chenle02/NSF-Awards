The principal investigator will study the detection of outliers in structured
data. Outliers are observations which appear different from the bulk of
observations. It is known that many parameter estimation procedures fail to
produce good results when outliers are present. In light of this, one method of
handling outliers is to initially detect their presence. The investigator will
continue to study this detection problem based on the elemental sets procedure,
which involves fitting to the data many models, each an exact fit to a
minimally-sized subset of the original data. Combining the information from
these elemental sets in suitable ways, one may identify the multiple outliers
reliably, and in a single pass.
