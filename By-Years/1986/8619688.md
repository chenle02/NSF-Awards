This research utilizes the Perturbed Angular Correlation(PAC) technique to
determine the structure of defects in metals. In particular the work will treat:
(1) studies in cold-worked metals to test whether vacancies are produced
primarily in highly correlated strings on in relatively random locations; (2)
studies of defects created during resolidification of laser surface melted
metals; (3) studies to identify specific defect complexes and to characterize
the dynamic behavior of the complexes; (4) studies of hydrogen and helium
trapping in vacancy complexes; and (5) studies of defects in intermetallic
compounds.
