NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GEOGRAPHY SPATIAL SCIENCES (GSS) PROGRAM

ABSTRACT

This research project will provide a better understanding of the spatial
patterns of natural resources by analyzing the potential effects of spatial
autocorrelation on the modeling and analyses of geospatial data. The
investigators will provide new insights for improving geospatial modeling
procedures by quantifying the influences of spatial autocorrelation on a wide
range of environmental predictor-response variables. By analyzing and modeling
multiple natural resources as they relate to a range of environmental factors
across different ecosystems, the investigators will identify the interdependent
relationships among soil, water, biodiversity, and environmental factors at
multiple scales. Project findings will inform government agencies and policy
makers by providing new information and approaches for improved prediction and
management for high-demand but scarce natural resources. Outcomes from this
spatial methodological framework will be useful in examining other ecological
systems globally and potentially will serve as a springboard for establishing
platforms for comprehensive management recommendations across diverse
ecosystems.

In order to model and predict spatial phenomena, spatial scientists rely on
multiple geocoded data sets that contain information about physical and
biological resources. Because of the interdependency among biophysical variables
however, it is challenging to determine the relationships among the various the
spatial processes and the predictor-response variables associated such
phenomena. The investigators will focus their analyses on the potential effects
of spatial autocorrelation on the modeling and interpretation of the
distribution of natural resources across landscapes. They will analyze multiple
global spatial data sets representing a variety of geographic and biophysical
gradients, and they will develop a framework to better understand the different
yet related geographic phenomena at multiple scales. Spatial eigenvector mapping
and environmental modeling will be used to analyze the complex relationships
among predictor and response variables. The quantification of the influences of
spatial autocorrelation will be catalytic for the understanding of potential
networks and spatial processes across a broad spectrum of natural resources and
geographic phenomena.
