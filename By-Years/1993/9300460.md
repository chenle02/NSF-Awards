Dr. Maria Clelia Milletti and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Eastern Michigan University are being supported for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of
this program is the aim that the students will develop in maturity and
capability for independent research, along with learning new laboratory
techniques and analytical skills.
