The objective of this exploratory research project is to develop a new
structural health monitoring scheme which will exploit the presence of
nonlinearity in the system for damage identification. The multiple sensor
responses collected on structures will be analyzed by higher order spectral
approach and reverse dynamics method for damage identification. Most global
structural health monitoring methods assume that the structure under
investigation remains linear, and they thus ignore the presence of nonlinearity
caused by damage such as those caused by opening and closing of a crack. The
novelty of this investigation is that it will exploit the presence of
nonlinearities in damage identification. The application of this approach on
realistic civil engineering structures will be explored.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to provide a new structural
health monitoring approach which is more sensitive to the presence of damage
such as a crack. The research results of the investigation will be widely
disseminated for use by other researchers and practicing engineers. The project
will involve graduate and undergraduate students and thus help in creating a
pool of highly trained technical people to join the nation?s work force.
