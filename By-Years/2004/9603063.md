9603063 Speed This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Dr. Robert C. Speed, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois
and Dr. L. H. Barber, Chief Geologist, Barbados Ministry of Finance. They will
study the tectonics of the emergence of Barbados island, the subsidence of the
adjacent Eastern Barbados Basin, and the development of the steep, high scarp
between them. Through field work, isotopic dating and other analyses, the
researchers aim to expand and test new observations on the late Pleistocene
emergence history of Barbados; study the relation of such emergence to basement
deformation; and demonstrate major differences in late Pleistocene of the
southwestern Barbados and those of the eastern and northern region. The outcomes
of this study are anticipated to improve the global understanding of inner
forearcs and the wide-ranging effects of sea-level oscillations on islands, and
to provide the Barbadian community with a more informed base for planning for
hazards conservation. ***
