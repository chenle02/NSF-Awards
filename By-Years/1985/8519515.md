This project is a 1-day workshop on The Role of Surfactants in New and Emerging
Technology to be held at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York in
June, 1986. The objectives of this conference are: to effect an interchange of
information between scientists and engineers working in high technology areas
and those conducting surfactant research and to elucidate the role of
surfactants in emerging and future high technology areas to permit assessment of
current and future research needs. Discussion areas for this conference include:
microelectronics, magnetic recording, non-conventional energy production, novel
pollution control methods, biotechnology, high technology electronic ceramics,
electronic printing, novel separation technology, and new surfactant
applications.
