Cell shape is a critical component of cell function. Cross-linked bundles of
polarized actin filaments are common in eukaryotic cells and provide the
scaffolding for creating and maintaining cell shape. Drosophila bristle cells
are an excellent model system to investigate actin bundle assembly and cell
shape control because they contain extraordinary large actin bundles and
represent an extremely tractable system for genetic manipulation and live cell
imaging. These bundles are an engineering marvel. They can grow to over 400
microns in length and taper 20-fold from 500 to 25 filaments - from base to tip.
Amazingly, these structures are built by grafting together hundreds of 2-micron
modules that first elongate and then thicken by filament addition. Bundle
assembly is an unexpectedly dynamic process, and this project is aimed at
determining how actin filament synthesis and turnover contributes to bundle
assembly. Molecular and genetic tools will be employed to modify actin bundle
assembly and confocal and electron microscopic techniques used to evaluate the
biological consequences temporally and at high resolution. Results from this
research should inform us about the construction of specialized membrane
protrusions in many cells such as the microvilli on the adsorptive epithelial
cells in the gut and the kidney and the stereocilia on the hair cells in the
inner ear. This project will also incorporate undergraduates in a research-
oriented team approach.
