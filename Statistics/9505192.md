Title: WORKSHOP ON MODEL UNCERTAINTY AND MODEL ROBUSTNESS PROJECT ABSTRACT In
recent years, advances in statistical methodology and computing have made
available powerful modeling tools in a variety of areas. Along with the added
modeling flexibility, increasing attention is being directed to assessing the
consequences of modeling assumptions on results. Debates on the effect of
modeling assumptions on crucial scientific and pmlicy prediction, such as global
warming and the health impact of toxic waste, have reached the mass media. This
award supports travel to a workshop in Bath, UK, that will discuss these issues.
Travel to a workshop on model uncertainty and model robustness---the
quantitative exploration of the mapping from assumptions to conclusions will be
supported. The workshop will blend methodology and case studies. The workshop
has the potential to significantly advance this field of statistical research
and encourage dissemination of an important class of modeling techniques to
practitioners. The goals of the workshop are: a) to help eliciting current
issues and methods from a host of different application areas and disciplines;
b) to favor wider utilization of worthy practical approaches and solutions
developed in specific fields; c) to advance understanding of relative merits of
existing tools ad approaches, and d) to point to directions for future
methodological developments. The workshop is international, which is a
reflection on the composition of the research community in this area.
Participants supported with the award represents a balance between senior and
junior researchers as well as women and minorities.
