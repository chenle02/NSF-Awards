Abstract

Award: DMS-0505603 Principal Investigator: Michael Wolf

These projects concentrate on problems concerning complete minimal surfaces in
Euclidean three-space, harmonic maps onto the hyperbolic plane, and projective
structures on Riemann surfaces. The principal investigator, working with D.
Hoffman and M. Weber, hopes to prove the existence of embedded helicoids of
arbitrary genus, following up on their existence result in genus one but
pursuing a different approach that is already known to simplify the genus-one
argument. A basic uniqueness question on minimal surfaces is also going to be
studied: In how many ways can one desingularize the intersection of two planes?
The principal investigator has studied harmonic maps onto the hyperbolic plane
for several years, leading to a natural conjecture on extensions of quasi-
symmetries of the circle to the hyperbolic disk. The planned work on projective
structures on Riemann surfaces will be pursued jointly with a postdoctoral
fellow, David Dumas, and aims to develop fine asymptotics for such structures.

A minimal surface is the mathematical idealization of a soap bubble spanning a
wire. A stable soap bubble ordinarily assumes the least area of all possible
surfaces spanning that wire, and the mathematical statement of the fact that
varying the surface must increase its area translates into a partial
differential equation. Versions of these problems have been studied intensely
since the 19th century and before, for both physical and geometric reasons. The
helicoid referred to above is a surface shaped like a corkscrew or parking ramp,
and the genus-one version of the helicoid could be described as a parking ramp
with an airshaft -- some interesting and appealing pictures of these and other
minimal surfaces are available on M. Weber's Web pages,
