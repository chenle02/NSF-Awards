Hydrogen is a key intermediary product during microbial degradation of organic
matter in anaerobic ecosystems. The recent development of highly sensitive
methods for detecting hydrogen in anaerobic systems has raised several new
questions concerning the control of microbial hydrogen metabolism. It is
suggested that competition among anaerobic bacteria hydrogen may involve the
maintenance of partial pressures that are so low that those organisms performing
the less energetically favorable reactions are excluded. This research examines
physiological mechanisms whereby hydrogen-consuming microorganisms may control
the steady-state, hydrogen partial pressures in anaerobic ecosystems. The
hydrogen to be tested is that hydrogen partial pressures are determined by the
physiological properties of the hydrogen-consuming microorganisms and that this
directly determines the results of competition among hydrogen consumers. This
hypothesis has been derived from the more general hypothesis that the steady-
state concentration of any intermediary product is controlled by the physiology
of the consuming organisms and independent of the producing organisms. The
specific objectives are to 1) isolate hydrogen-consuming organisms at hydrogen
partial pressures representative of those found in natural environments and
compare their hydrogen uptake kinetics, 2) measures concentrations of products
and reactants in natural environments to determine the energetics of hydrogen a
production and consumption under in situ conditions, 3) monitor hydrogen
metabolism in defined mixed cultures to determine the mechanisms controlling
hydrogen. The research is designed to elucidate connections between
thermodynamic, physiological hydrogen uptake properties of consuming organisms,
and the hydrogen partial pressures in natural environments. The results will
further test a model for competition between sulfate reducers and methanogens
for hydrogen that is based on the concept of minimum substrate thresholds.
