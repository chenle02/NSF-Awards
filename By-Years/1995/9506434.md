SBR-9506434 Thomas J. Bassett Leslie Gray University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign The Social and Physical Dynamics of Environmental Change in Western
Burkina Faso A multi-scale investigation of the social and physical dimensions
of land degradation in western Burkina Faso is the goal of this research
project. The perceptions and decisions of villagers that constitute the crucial
links in the causal chain connecting social processes to land degradation will
be evaluated. The effects of changing cropping practices on soil quality and
social organization will be analyzed for one village. Hypotheses generated from
the single village analysis will be tested using surveys from several villages.
Mapping how various processes like new agricultural technologies;
transformations in land, labor, and wealth; and shifts in government
agricultural and conservation policy, have interacted and influenced the
actions, perceptions, and decisions of small-scale farmers, is crucial in
understanding and explaining place-specific degradation. Such understanding will
improve society's ability to minimize such land degradation.
