The project consists of a basic research component and a significant system/tool
building component such that our research and development can be fully utilized
and extensively evaluated by the application scientists with which we will
closely collaborate. Such efforts can only be made possible with a four-year ITR
project at the proposed scale. In addition to the large number of applications
that we will have access to, the proposed research is particularly unique and
important in the following ways: (i) Developing simulation-time data reduction
(i.e., encoding and feature extraction) techniques. Addressing the visualization
challenges early in the visualization pipeline is a largely ignored direction in
the past. (ii) Investigating flexible modeling of the extracted temporal and
spatial features to facilitate efficient rendering and manipulation at different
levels of abstraction. (iii) Designing highly optimized rendering methods,
coupled with novel interaction techniques, to facilitate interactive browsing
and exploration of the encoded data or extracted features directly. (iv) Seeking
affordable solutions based on commodity-hardware accelerated, progressive
visualization to allow scientists to conduct as much of the iterative part of
the visualization and data understanding task as possible on their desktop PC.
(v) Placing a strong emphasis on realizing software tools and delivering them to
our application scientist collaborators as well as to the broader scientific
community. These tools will be usable for the scientist's routine work, not just
for proof of concept.

Complementing the research and development components of this project is an
educational component, directed at both graduate and undergraduate students,
aimed at inspiring interest and fostering creativity through hands-on
experiences. We hope to foster greater interaction and cross-fertilization of
ideas between the inter-related disciplines of visualization, scientific
computing, and data analysis.
