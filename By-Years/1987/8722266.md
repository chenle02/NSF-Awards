This project develops the theoretical framework for the study of feedback
stabilization and control problems associated with constrained mechanical
systems. A controller which achieves certain performance objectives for an
unconstrained mechanical system may be unsuited if external constraints are
imposed. The work is strongly motivated by important engineering problems
associated with robots and space systems. The constraint arises when contact is
made between bodies. In robotics, this occurs when there is contact between end
effectors and payload objects. For example, such operations as contour
following, deburring, fastening, and pick and place fall within this class. For
space systems, constraints arise in satellite docking maneuvers. Constrained
robot problems have been the motivation for much recent research in compliance
and impedance control, but always without explicit consideration of contact
forces required to maintain satisfaction of the constraints. The research makes
substantial use of mathematical methods for nonlinear analysis of dynamic
systems. Computer simulation experiments will be performed to verify the theory
developed and to suggest new theoretical issues for study. The example to be
simulated and investigated comprises a particle constrained to move on a smooth
elliptic wire. The theory may also be tested experimentally on an instrumented
x-y table.
