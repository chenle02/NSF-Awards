It is proposed to study the Hydrogen-Molybdinum-Disulfide and HxWS2 systems. The
variation of x with P will be determined at various temperatures and conditions
sought where equilibrium can be achieved in reasonable periods of time.
Thermodynamic quantities will be deduced for these favorable circumstances.
Advantage will also be taken of conditions where desorption is severely
kinetically limited to study structural characteristics of these phases by
neutron and/or x-ray diffraction, vibrational and NMR-spectroscopies, ESCA,
electrical conductivities and electrode potentials, all as a function of x. If
warranted, means will be found to supplement these data with EPR measurements.
Both single crystals and amorphous high surface area preparations will be used
and relationships sought between these systems with the well documented behavior
of known hydrogen-bronzes. The effect of variation in x on catalytic properties
will be explored and comparison will be made with presently not understood
effects of a similar "activated adsorption" (characterized as HR) found with
reduced molybdena- alumina catalysts. Other transition metal sufides may be
tested for similar behavior.
