This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant Biology Program.
The theme of the interdisciplinary research training group is global change. The
group involves 10 laboratories whose expertise ranges from molecular biology to
cell and whole plant physiology to ecosystems studies. Graduate students and
postdoctoral participants will be trained to perform interdisciplinary work with
the techniques from PCR to satellite data reading. Course work, seminars,
invited speakers, and a series of "hands on" instrumentation tutorials will
constitute the training program. The program will emphasize innovative
experimental strategies combined with in-depth studies of selected topics in
plant-environment interaction.
