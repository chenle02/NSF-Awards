This project continues the investigation of effective algorithms for some major
problems of polynomial and matrix computations. One of the main subjects of the
current project is the study of approximating polynomial zeros, which has
recently resulted in the design of new solution algorithms running in optimal
time (up to polylog factors). The optimality has been reached under both Boolean
and arithmetic and both sequential and parallel models of computing. The project
includes the work on extension of the latter results to other major problems of
algebraic and numerical computing, such as computing approximate common divisors
of pairs of univariate polynomials, approximation of matrix eigenvalues, solving
systems of polynomial equations, and algebraic optimization problems. Another
major direction of the project is to continue and extend the work on
computations with structured matrices, which have applications to numerous major
practical and theoretical computational problems, including the areas of speech
and signal processing, Markovs chains, fundamental algebraic computations with
general matrices, and the solution of partial differential and integral
equations. ***
