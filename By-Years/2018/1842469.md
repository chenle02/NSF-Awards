This award provides partial support for the OceanObs' 19 Conference in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on September 16 - 20, 2019. OceanObs' 19 is the next in the series that
started in 1999 and is held every 10 years. The OceanObs' 99 conference in St.
Raphael, France resulted in an internationally coordinated system for physical
climate and ocean carbon observations. The OceanObs' 09 conference held in
Venice, Italy expanded the range of communities working together to undertake
more comprehensive and sustain ocean observations and led to the Framework for
Ocean Observing. The OceanObs' 19 conference encompasses the potential to build
on the success generated by the Framework for Ocean Observing and will seek to
better connect observers with end user communities. The Framework for Ocean
Observing is meant to guide the ocean observing community as a whole to
establish an integrated and sustained global observing system. The conference
program highlights seven vital societal benefit themes: Discovery, Ecosystem
Health and Biodiversity, Climate Variability and Change, Water Food and Energy
Security, Pollution and Human Health, Hazards and Maritime Safety, and Blue
Economy.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
