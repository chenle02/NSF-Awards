This award continues funding the long-term research program in aridland ecology.
The research is to understand how the physical environment and climate
variability together affect common species, community dynamics and ecosystem
processes in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. The Sevilleta LTER Program
addresses ecological concepts and theory emphasizing pulse driven processes in
space and time through comprehensive and interdisciplinary research in desert
grassland, shrubland, forest and riparian habitats in central New Mexico.
Through a combination of long-term measurements, experiments, and modeling, the
research considers how climate and the physical environment interact to effect
change in aridland ecosystems. The focal sites are the Sevilleta National
Wildlife Refuge and the Middle Rio Grande Basin. The Sevilleta LTER support our
Schoolyard LTER program, the Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program, reaches
hundreds of middle and high school students annually in classroom and outdoor
settings. The Arts and Ecology REU Program brings together students from fine
arts and ecology for an 11-week summer research and creative experience. LTER
scientists and students actively participate in the Ecological Society of
America?s SEEDS Program by hosting workshops and mentoring SEEDS Fellows. The
Sevilleta LTER participates in the newly developed Junior Scientist Outreach
Program, a program sponsored by the Biology Department at the University of New
Mexico, which targets underserved Hispanic students in Albuquerque's south
valley. Activities include organized visits to the campus, summer field camps,
and active participation in field research.
