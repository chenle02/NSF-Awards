This research is aimed at advancing the field of solar building design and
simulation through the introduction of physical Building Information Modeling
(BIM) and the study of its applications in solar buildings. The project includes
research on a novel physical BIM method for integrated solar building design and
simulation, and the development and introduction of a new course using the
physical BIM prototype tool for designing solar buildings. The major objectives
are to: (1) research the new method integrated physical BIM for holistic
building energy simulation; (2) build a prototype of the method for solar
building and simulation integrating photovoltaic, passive solar thermal, and
daylighting systems; (3) test the BIM simulation results using benchmark
simulations; (4) evaluate the usability of the method in architecture design
classrooms; and (5) provide guidelines for software developers to create new
tools for solar building and whole building simulations.
