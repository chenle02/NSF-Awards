This project will investigate in a preliminary way two specific problems in
statistical mechanics for the purpose of preparing a more detailed proposal. One
problem is concerned with the limiting behavior of a large mass piston randomly
colliding with small atoms when the speed of all objects involved are of
comparable magnitude. The second problem is concerned with the stationary state
of a system, consisting of two reservoirs maintained at different temperature
and density and separated by a thermally conducting barrier with molecules
trapped inside the barrier colliding reservoir atoms passing freely through the
barrier walls.
