9725668 Lee This project makes a permanent record of the history, techniques and
regional and temporal variations of Alaskan Eskimo (Yup'ik) coiled basketry.
While often dismissed as "tourist art," and as a consequence ignored, Yup'ik
coiled basketry is an important women's art form. Also, it has been an important
component of the mixed cash-and-subsistence economy of modern rural Alaska.
Finally, changes in basketry styles are linked to important historical and
economic changes that have affected different Yup'ik societies. The
documentation of Yup'ik coiled basketry is of great interest to scholars of
Alaskan Eskimo ethnography and ethnohistory, researchers in the fields of arts
acculturation, material culture studies, and gender studies, and researchers
with interests in economic anthropology, diffusion, and innovation. This project
produces photo-documentation of different coiled basketry styles that is linked
to different historical and economic events affecting regional Yup'ik groups.
