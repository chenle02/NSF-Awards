With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors Martin L.
Kirk, Richard Kemp, Patrick S. Mariano, Robert T. Paine and Wei Wang from the
Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at the University of New Mexico
will acquire a low-field (300 MHz) multinuclear NMR spectrometer. The instrument
will be used to support research activities such as: 1) synthetic methodologies
that allow for step by-step (atom-by-atom) assembly of new families of main
group element ring and polycyclic cage compounds rich in Group 13, 14 and 15
elements; 2) activation and fixing of small molecules such as carbon dioxide,
COS, carbon disulfide, and oxygen to produce more valuable products; 3)
homogeneous catalytic routes to epoxides and other partially-oxidized organics
using late transition metal pincer complexes; 4) characterization of structures
and stereochemistry of synthetic intermediates and natural and non-natural
products; 5) rational design of Giardia lamblia growth inhibitors as well as
study of phosphoproteins; 6) study of donor-bridge-acceptor systems as potential
components of molecular wire devices and, 7) synthesis of new inhibitors of the
proteins cholesterol esterase, lactate dehydrogenase, NfKB, urokinase, aldose
reductase, HIV protease and Abeta aggregates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multinuclear
NMR spectroscopy is an essential analytical tool in chemistry and biochemistry
research. The spectra enable researchers to identify unknown substances and to
provide information on the atom arrangement and structures in species ranging
from small molecules to large proteins by detecting transitions between energy
levels arising from the nuclear spin properties of atoms. This spectrometer will
enhance many research activities of investigators and students, many of whom are
from underrepresented groups.
