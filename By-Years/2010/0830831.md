Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project builds and
develops information assurance education capacity. Critical to the success of
this partnership is extensive classroom teaching by the PI and the co-PIs at the
partner university as well as a hands-on personal mentoring of potential and
awarded SFS students at both schools. This project consists of four distinct
objectives: (1) Increasing the number and improve the skills of information
assurance (IA) faculty at both schools through professional development and
team-taught courses at the partner university campuses; (2) developing a multi-
disciplinary information assurance educational program with the ultimate goal of
qualifying the non-CAEIAE university as a National Center of Academic Excellence
in Information Assurance NSA (CAEIAE); (3) providing quality IA education to
Scholarship for Service students; and (4) facilitating joint faculty development
activities via joint workshops, joint publication and conference attendance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key elements of this proposal are extensive personal
contact between the faculty and students at both schools, and team teaching and
joint publication efforts between the universities. This proposal is all about
developing and expanding information assurance capacity at both
schools.&lt;br/&gt;
