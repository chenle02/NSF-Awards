A workshop, convened in Spring 1988, will bring together world-renown
geoscientists to stimulate improvements in the sophistication of stratigraphic
analysis through numerical simulation and computer modeling. Contributors will
summarize the present approaches to stratigraphic analysis, identify gaps in
existing model verification studies, and define research direction for the next
decade for enhancing predictions of stratigraphy and the movement of basinal
fluids. Results will impact participant's research, the disciplines they
represent and the community of stratigraphers, basin analysts, reservoir
engineers and hydrologists. The U.S.G.S., D.O.E. and industry are also providing
funding for this workshop.
