This program will investigate a new technique to explore the ?Hidden Universe?
of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. This will be accomplished via determination of
the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe through measurements of the
thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (the scattering of Cosmic Microwave Background
photons off hot gas in galaxy clusters) and gravitational lensing. The proposed
technique will be applied to real data from the Atacama Cosmology Experiment,
the Planck experiment and the Subaru telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students. In
addition, Dr. Spergel has participated in several TV programs on cosmology per
year and will continue to do so. He will also continue his program of speaking
to elementary school students on measurement and cosmology.
