Florida Atlantic University has acquired a computer automated radioactive
particle tracking (CARPT) system for use in fluidized bed experimentation. There
are only two such facilities in United States universities. This research will
explore the suitability of CARPT for gaining information about flow in bubble
columns with special attention devoted to recirculation in such devices. The
research will be a cooperative effort between Florida Atlantic University and
Washington University. Bubble columns are important gas-liquid contacting
devices whose design could be improved if their flow phenomena were better
understood.
