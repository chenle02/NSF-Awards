The general goals of this research are to determine the geometric structure of
surfaces, in particular reconstructed surfaces. This work provides a deeper and
wider understanding of the factors that affect atomic positions at interfaces
and to use this knowledge to artificially produce surfaces with interesting and
potentially useful properties. Some of the issues that will be addressed
include: 1) the influence of external perturbations, like steps and adatoms of
different electronegativity, on reconstruction phenomena; 2) what are the
microscopic factors that cause influence bilayer growth?; what new insights can
be obtained about the vibrational properties at a surface? The principal
experimental technique to be employed is medium energy ion scattering.
