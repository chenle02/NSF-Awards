The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project consists in addressing the growing
demand for mobile data in the newly released 5th generation cellular network
technology (5G). We will develop handset technology to meet these new 5G
requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims at overcoming
technological challenges to facilitate the translation of wideband lithium
niobate acoustic filters for 5G systems. The lithium niobate thin-film resonator
technology is already capable of a 5-fold increase in available bandwidth over
any other handset filter technology, while keeping filter losses at a minimum in
a small form factor. This PFI-TT project will extend the frequency of operation
of these filters to those required by 5G standards and overcome the
technological challenges to enable this lithium niobate acoustic resonator
technology to be deployed at scale by quintuple the bandwidth of the acoustic
filters in a radioâ€™s front-end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
