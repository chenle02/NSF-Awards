9632489 Carr The PI is organizing the Informal Conference on Photochemistry,
which will be held in Minneapolis, MN, during the period June 16-21, 1996. This
conference is organized every other year by different institutions. It is not
affiliated with any professional organization and is held in a style similar to
Gordon Conferences. The community typically attending these meetings consists of
both atmospheric scientists, in particular laboratory researchers, and
investigators involved with physical chemistry. The interactions between these
different groups is one of the strengths of these meetings, where both basic and
applied work is discussed. NSF support will help graduate students and post-docs
are to attend this meeting.
