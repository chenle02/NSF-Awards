Professor Mahan will study a wide range of topics in many-body theory of
condensed matter systems. These include: lattice dynamics in ionic solids,
actinides and heavy fermions, and transport in small devices. Professor Mahan is
a world leader in many-body theory and his past work has enhanced our
understanding of electron interactions in solids considerably. The problem he
proposes to study is of current interest and importance not only to fundamental
physics but also to technology. He is eminently qualified to do the work.
