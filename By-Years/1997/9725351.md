9725351 Hauri This is a geochemical and geochronological study of volcanic
islands and seamounts comprising the Austral Islands chain of French Polynesia.
This chain is being studied in order to determine whether the Hawaiian model of
a focused, narrow mantle plume is an adequate one for describing all aspects of
the actively convecting part of the Earth's mantle. The Austral Islands are
differ in almost every aspect from the Hawaiian islands. New Ar-Ar dating of
lavas and seamounts will be combined with plate-motion reconstructions using
Pacific pole of rotation fixed by the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots to
determine if the size of the Austral anomaly is consistent with a narrow plume,
a sheet, or a leaky plate over a diffuse warm-spot. Combined geochemical studies
on lavas, xenoliths, and melt inclusion will address several key questions
regarding the coupled morphologic and geochemical variation across the Austral
Fracture Zone including what role the oceanic lithosphere plays in the style and
composition of the Austral volcanism. The combined Os, O and He isotope studies
will help determine if the chemical characteristics of the Austral HIMU and EM
sources are more consistent with crustal recycling or intra-mantle metasomatism.
