Male birds display remarkable variation in plumage coloration, and females
assess these differences when selecting mates. The rationale for such mate
choice is that ornamentation is correlated with genetic quality so that, by
choosing colorful males, females obtain good genes for their offspring. Genes
contributing to greater disease resistance are quintessential in the natural
world because pathogens greatly affect their hosts' reproduction and survival.
As a result, "resistance" genes have often been assumed to be the good genes
associated with bright coloration. The hypothesis of plumage coloration
signaling good genes will be tested first by determining which genes are
switched on or off when House Finches are infected with the bacterial pathogen,
Mycoplasma gallicepticum. Gene expression will be determined using tools called
microarrays that can accurately quantify the increase or decrease in expression
of thousands of genes simultaneously. Gene expression patterns will be compared
between brightly colored and drably colored male House finches. If the Good
Genes Hypothesis is correct, brighter males should show different gene
expression profiles than drabber ones. Furthermore, the turning on of specific
genes known to play a role in disease resistance will help determine whether
plumage coloration is associated with specific good genes. This research is
important because it improves understanding of the evolutionary processes that
lead to the evolution of disease resistance. Understanding all facets of disease
resistance is crucial for predicting and responding to the threats of emerging
infectious diseases in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.
