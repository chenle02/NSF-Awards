The goal of this research project is to develop a novel framework to support
more effective and secure content-based video access over large-scale database.
Specifically, the framework includes: (a) a hierarchical video database
management and indexing structure to define the contextual and logical
relationships among the related visual concepts and thus facilitate more
efficient video access; (b) a probabilistic semantic video classifier to bridge
the semantic gap between the low-level visual features and the high-level visual
concepts; (c) a hierarchical visual summarization and presentation technique to
enable fast video browsing over IP networks; (d) a multi-level video database
access control scheme to serve different classes of users and maintain the video
data integrity and security. A wide range of potential applications could
benefit from this research, such as education and distance learning, health care
and telemedicine, digital library, national security and defense, network-based
media, and entertainment
