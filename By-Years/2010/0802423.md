The Waterjet Technology project is developing an effective training program in
state-of-the-art waterjet cutting processes for machine tool technicians and
other programs in manufacturing. Waterjet processes have experienced many
improvements in design and function during the last decade, and its industry
usage has accelerated rapidly so that it is quickly becoming a standard tool in
machine shops around the world. The project's activities consist of developing
faculty expertise, acquiring equipment and resources to build training capacity,
identifying competencies and developing curriculum components to teach skills in
waterjet technology. In addition, the project provides training opportunities
and informative seminars to college faculty members, secondary-level teachers
and students throughout the region, industry representatives and incumbent
workers. The project identifies competencies and develops curricula for
effective training in waterjet technology. Newly developed curriculum components
are adopted throughout the statewide community and technical college system, and
are disseminated to a larger audience. The training provided by this project
enhances job opportunities for graduates and expands opportunities for regional
businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
