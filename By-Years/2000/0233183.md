0233183&lt;br/&gt;Ryan&lt;br/&gt;Data will be collected to quantify virus
transport in physically and geochemically heterogeneous unconsolidated aquifer
materials under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. The results will be
incorporated into a stochastic model of virus transport in aquifers. The
bacteriophage PRD1 will be radiolabelled and used for this work. Phage will be
introduced into glass chromatography columns packed with porous media. Solution
chemistry will be altered and fractions collected and analyzed for the phage by
plaque assay.
