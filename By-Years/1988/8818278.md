Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will spearhead establishment of a
Consortium of universities, employers, and national laboratories -- dedicated to
aiding underutilized minorities and women earning graduate degrees in physical
sciences. The intent is to generate sufficient momentum among initial members
that the Consortium will be self-sustaining in three years. After discussion
with many universities, employers, and national laboratories, NPSC has concluded
that interest, conviction, and willingness to participate are abundant.
Gestating this idea is not administering but defining a structure that binds
members in a common goal, plants the seeds for administrative and fiscal
responsibility, promotes the freedom that recognized institutions of learning
require while developing worthy intellect. This award focuses on underutilized
minorities and women: attainment of their graduate degrees, monetary assistance,
and a network of mentors to provide counselling and support. LLNL aspires to see
NPSC become a viable entity and then become a sustaining member of a productive
organization.
