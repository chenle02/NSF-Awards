This proposal is designed to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate translation
of the mRNAs encoding transition proteins, protamines and the mitochondrial
capsule seleno-protein in haploid spermatogenic cells in mice. The central aim
is to determine whether the observation that protamine 1 messenger
ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) form initiation complexes with 80s single
ribosomes slower than deproteinized protamine 1 mRNAs in brief incubations in
the reticulocyte cell free lysate reflects the mechanisms that repress
translation of protamine 1 mRNA in vivo. The kinetics of formation of initiation
complexes in vitro will be compared for mouse protamine 1 mRNAs in deproteinized
poly(A) plus mRNA, translationally repressed mRNPs, translationally active mRNPs
and translationally repressed mRNPs after disruption of mRNP complexes with high
salt. The interactions of cis-acting sequences in protamine 1 mRNAs and trans-
acting mRNP proteins will be analyzed by synthesizing radiolabeled run off
protamine 1 transcripts with bacteriophage RNA polymerases, constituting mRNP
particles by incubation with cytoplasmic extracts, and translation in cell free
system and gel mobility shift assays. Non-isotopic in situ hybridization will be
used to determine whether protamine 1 mRNAs are sequestered intracellularly in
round spermatids. This proposal is intended to introduce promising
undergraduates to research in molecular biology.
