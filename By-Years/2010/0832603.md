This award is for travel funds to support technical coordination by various
collaborators with the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical
team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will make available, on the Blue
Waters computing system, computational tools and environments for social and
biological research involving interacting automata at nodes of very large social
contact network or interaction graphs. Such research includes the evaluation of
mitigation strategies for contagion on realistic national and global-scale
social contact networks, worm propagation on the Internet, percolation
processes, viral marketing, database replication for sensor networks, and social
phenomenon such as the propagation of fads and norms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of research with the tools to be deployed may help provide better
understanding of how different strategies for dealing with emerging infectious
diseases can influence the course and impact of pandemics. The principal
investigators are new NSF investigators.&lt;br/&gt;
