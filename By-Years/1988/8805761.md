Coral bleaching is a process whereby living coral animals expell the symbiotic
algae that are nomally retained in the coral tissue. This has occurred to an
unprecendented extent thoughout the Caribbean in the fall of 1987. Drs. Porter
and Fitt of the University of Georgia will conduct an analysis of this
phenomenon at a previously well studied site in the Florida Keys. They will
monitor bleaching events and subsequent reinfection or death of the corals in
the Key Largo National Marine Sactuary during 1988. The field work will include
an early 1988 census of the area and the establishment of new experimental sites
for monitoring recovery, reinfection and isotope analysis.
