Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supporting the
organization of a series of interactive, web-based faculty development workshops
to improve the participants' proposal writing skills for educational development
projects that are submitted to the Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement
(CCLI) Program and other NSF programs. The workshops, which are based on a
successful pilot effort, are being presented by the engineering program
directors of the Division of Undergraduate Education using webinar software. The
principal investigator is organizing ten interactive-web-based proposal writing
workshops with each involving 15-20 institutions and a 150-200 participants. He
is scheduling the workshops, inviting all institutions with accredited
engineering degree programs to participate, handling all questions and
registration details, providing operational guidelines to local facilitators,
and collecting and reviewing participant demographics and assessment data
collected to improve the workshops. The broader impacts of this project include
outreach to a large and diverse set of faculty who may not have access to
proposal writing workshops in any other way.
