AST-0452760/Fisher, NRAO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve the
development of a system of signal processing algorithms and hardware that will
allow passive and active users of the radio spectrum to share frequency bands.
The resulting instrumentation will enable radio astronomers and other scientific
users of the radio spectrum to measure weak radiation at many more frequencies
than can be exclusively protected by national and international radio
regulations. This development research will also provide valuable technical
information to scientific radio spectrum managers in their negotiations with
active users of the radio bands.
