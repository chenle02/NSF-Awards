The research will examine stress corrosion cracking under the combined effect of
stress and environment. It will study dealloying theory which suggests that one
constituent of the alloy is preferentially corroded, resulting in a very thin
layer, dealloyed surface, which could undergo brittle failure under high
stresses and high strain rates. The approach will be a combination of
experiments and analysis, on a model Cu-Au system, using high resolution
microscopy on one hand and eigen stress analysis on the other to treat the
dealloyed surface layer. Mechanical properties of the dealloyed material will be
studied with bending of cantilever microbeams.
