This project will combine approaches of biochemical engineering, cell biology,
and molecular biology to increase quantitative understanding of how binding and
trafficking aspects of growth factor/receptor interactions influence mammalian
cell proliferation, and to exploit this increased understanding to suggest
design principles for paracrine and autocrine cell culture systems. Epidermal
Growth Factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) on fibroblastic cell lines will
serve as the system of focus. Mathematical models which describe EGF/EGFR
trafficking and its effect on cell growth regulation by exogenous EGF in terms
of mechanistic ligand/receptor parameters have been recently developed and
experimentally validated. These models will now be used to investigate
strategies for perturbation of cell culture systems, and will be extended to
paracrine and autocrine EGF sources. The extended models will be critically
tested by constructing artificial paracrine and autocrine systems using cells
transfected with genes encoding EGF and/or EGFR. Modification of these genes by
site-directed mutagenesis will allow key rate parameters of the system to be
directly varied. These studies will identify parameters that can be usefully
manipulated to regulate cell growth for biotechnological purposes.
