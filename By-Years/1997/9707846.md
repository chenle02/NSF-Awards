Award Abstract Fellow: Cheryl A. D. Wilga Proposal number: DBI 9707846 This
action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1997. This
fellowship supports research and training in the area of ecological and
evolutionary physiology. The title of the research and training plan is "Fluid
dynamics and functional morphology of pectoral fins during swimming in benthic
and pelagic sharks." The classical model of shark locomotion is tested, and
pectoral fin function during swimming is evaluated in sharks. Comparative
ecomorphology of sharks is analyzed using fluid dynamics, kinematics, and motor
pattern. The integration of functional morphology, performance (fluid flow), and
ecology (realized niche) is necessary to accurately interpret the ecological
role and evolution of organismal design.
