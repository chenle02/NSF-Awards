PI: Mertz, Jerome&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1508988&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective
of this proposal is to build an ultraminiaturized imaging device that can be
used to image at arbitrary depths within tissue, and to reach confined regions
in samples that are difficult to access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key feature of
the device is that it will be able to focus to variable depths, even though it
is lensless in design and contains no moving parts. The device can be used with
any type of luminous object, such as fluorescence, bioluminescence or even
white-light illuminated scenes. The device is based on an invention the PI
recently patented that enables high-throughput imaging through a single optical
fiber. This uses the principle of a spread-spectrum encoder (SSE), wherein
light-ray directions entering a fiber are converted into unique, broadband,
fingerprint spectral codes that then propagate through the fiber to be detected
and decoded at the other end. Because image information (i.e. ray directions) is
converted into spectral information, this information becomes insensitive to
fiber bending or motion, so that the technique can readily be used for
microendoscopy applications.
