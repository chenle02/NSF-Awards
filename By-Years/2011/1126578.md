This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a multi-
photon laser scanning confocal microscope for research and training in
interdisciplinary fields on the University of Oklahoma (OU) Norman campus. The
new instrument has higher sensitivity and faster speed and will significantly
boost the capabilities for live and deep-tissue imaging by a diversity of life
science and engineering researchers on the OU campus and at nearby research
institutions. This new confocal microscope will be used by a number of NSF-
sponsored laboratories that are already active in cell and molecular imaging as
well as by new users who will incorporate confocal imaging in their research
projects. The research topics include, but they are not limited to, neural crest
migration in the primitive vertebrate lamprey, neurite outgrowth and synaptic
vesicle trafficking in fruit flies, calcium imaging of deep nerve tissues,
temporal and spatial patterns of protein complex formation in plants, and
biofilm growth and morphology during corrosion of metallic surface. The new
microscope will be an important part of education and research integration;
students will be trained initially through a new upper undergraduate and
graduate student course, Applied Confocal Imaging, taught collectively by the
PIs. In addition, the PIs and their students will collaborate with rural and
urban Oklahoma K-12 teachers in developing and implementing cutting-edge
outreach and classroom projects. The results of these research, teaching, and
outreach efforts will be broadly disseminated through participation of students
and faculty at professional meetings and through peer-reviewed publications.
