The Cell Physiology course is being upgraded through the acquisition of
increased centrifuge capability. The centrifuge is also being used to improve
the Genetics and Biochemistry courses. A Sorvall Superspeed centrifuge and an
additional rotor for the college's current IEC centrifuge are enabling students
in the Cell Physiology laboratory to perform experiments requiring cell
fractions, to perform more effectively experiments which used to be done poorly,
and to be more efficient in the use of time in the laboratory. New laboratory
projects are being introduced requiring the high speed centrifuge. These
included experiments involving separation of mitochondria, study of
mitrochondrial enzymes, and analysis of enzymes in the post- mitochondrial
fraction. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
