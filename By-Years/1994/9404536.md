9404536 O'Malley Analytical Approaches to Singular Perturbation Problem of
Significance in Applications. Robert E. O'Malley, Jr., Principal Investigator
University of Washington Abstract: This research project seeks asymptotic
solutions to nonlinear singularly perturbed boundary value problems which
involve boundary, shock, and other localized regions of rapid change. Such
problems involve substantial computational, as well as analytical, challenges,
and their effective solution requires hybrid asymptotic/numeric approaches using
numerical algorithms based on the structure of asymptotic solutions and
corresponding asymptotic techniques motivated by careful numerical experiments
on difficult models. In this way, we continue to broaden our understanding of
the fundamental practical concept of asymptotic matching. Such mathematical
problems occur frequently in important applications throughout science and
engineering; in particular, in metastable models for phase-separation and
coarsening in materials and in reaction-diffusion models which provide patterns
for evolving biological processes. The need to use an asymptotically
exponentially-long time scale in such aontexts corresponds to the mathematical
issue of doing "asymptotics beyond all orders."
