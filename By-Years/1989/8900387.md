Marron lobster, Cherax tenuimanus, a freshwater lobster or crayfish indigenous
to southwest Australia, is a promising new species for U.S. aquaculture. It
looks and tastes like American lobster and grows in pond culture feeding on
detrital organisms. Results from Phase I indicate that marron aquaculture may be
feasible in the U.S. During Phase I of this project, it was demonstrated that
marron grow at rates equal or greater than those reported in Australia; evidence
of reproduction was observed; marron shipping methods were perfected; and key
water temperature and quality parameters for marron aquaculture were identified.
During the two-year Phase II, it is proposed to conduct the following activities
to prepare for commercializa- tion: (1) examine marron growout and refine marron
aquaculture production techniques under commercial pilot-scale conditions at two
sites in ponds and tanks; (2) continue experimental growout, survival, and
density work at Auburn University; (3) conduct physiological, nutritional, and
pathological studies; (4) examine marron through one or two reproductive cycles;
and (5) complete a financial feasibility analysis in preparation for
commercializa- tion.
