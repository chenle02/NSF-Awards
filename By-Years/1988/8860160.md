The control of termites is a major problem in the United States. At present, the
principal wood preservatives used are inorganic arsenic compounds,
pentachlorophenol and creosote. These agents are toxic, carcinogenic and
environmentally hazardous. Preliminary research has revealed that the heartwood
and leaf of the junipers (Junipers) have high termiticidal activity. The
proposed research will use a biological assay to isolate the active termiticidal
component(s) from extracts of the heartwood and leaves of J. ashei and J.
virginiana, two species which are currently harvested for the production of
cedarwood oil. The termicitidal activity of the most active fractions will be
compared to that of commercial termiticides. The yields will be determined from
whole trees in order to asses the economic feasibility of the procedure. If
successful, the research will lead to the preparation of a new, superior class
of termiticides from and under-utilized plant.
