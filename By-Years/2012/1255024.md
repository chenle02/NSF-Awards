With this five-year CAREER project, the PI aims to create a long-lasting
integrated research and education program in solar physics at the New Mexico
State University (NMSU), which is an accredited Hispanic minority serving
institution. Proposed is a creative effort based on the concept of modular,
interdisciplinary, components of science. On the education side, this project
will provide the general public, local schools, and NMSU students (4-6 graduate
and 10 undergraduate, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities) with
opportunities, methods, and tools for learning about the Sun. It therefore helps
increase diversity in STEM education, public awareness, and research. On the
science side, this project will identify the key components of complexity and
dynamics of coronal heating and solar flares through student research projects.
The integration of education and research lies in identifying, creating, and
using modular, interdisciplinary tools. The proposed research and EPO agenda
supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning,
diversity, and interdisciplinary research.
