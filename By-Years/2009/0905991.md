This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009 and
supports a research and training plan entitled "Gene regulation in vertebrate
evolution and embryo development" for Aaron T. Garnett. The host institution for
this research is University of Colorado under the sponsorships of Dr. Daniel
Medeiros and Dr. Xuedong Liu.

Two important types of DNA sequences found in animal genomes are (1) sequences
that encode proteins and (2) regulatory sequences that determine where and when
protein-coding sequences will be used. While encoding proteins in DNA is fairly
well understood, encoding regulatory information is far from complete. For
animal development to occur, it is essential that proteins be made in the proper
places at the proper time in the embryo, so discovering how regulatory
information is encoded in the genome is crucial to understanding animal
development. In addition, many of the changes that occur during evolution are
the result of changes to regulatory DNA which modify the way in which an
organism develops. This research is exploring how regulatory DNA encodes the
information necessary for proteins to be made in the neural crest, a structure
that gives rise to the facial skeleton and the peripheral nervous system and is
found only in vertebrate embryos, by identifying the DNA sequences that cause
protein expression in the genome of the puffer fish Fugu (a vertebrate), and
then comparing the Fugu sequence to the lancelet (an invertebrate) sequence to
determine the regulatory DNA necessary for the neural crest to arise during
vertebrate evolution.

The training goals for this project include techniques involved with amphioxus
embryology and strengthening computer-programming skills to improve
understanding of evolutionary concepts. In addition to addressing fundamental
questions in vertebrate evolution, this project involves the development of
computational techniques for detecting regulatory DNA which will be useful in
studying a range of biological systems.
