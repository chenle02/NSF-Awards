Faeth This project comprises a series of field and laboratory observations and
experiments to examine the role of endophytic fungi in deterring herbivory on
Arizona fescue and enhancing its competitive ability against other plant
species. The investigators are also determining the costs to the plant (in terms
of reproductive fitness) of the relationship with endophytic fungi under various
environmental conditions. The investigators are also examining the effects of
maternal (vertical) transmission of the endophytes on seed predation and seed
dispersal by seed-harvesting ants. The results of this research have important
implications for the role of microorganisms in dynamics of plant-animal
interactions and the organization of plant communities. The results of this
research have applications in conservation biology, rangeland management, and
reclamation ecology. The re-establishment of native grasses in reclamation and
range management efforts may be seriously affected by relationships with
endophytes. These relationships may also affect native ungulates and introduced
livestock.
