The investigators propose to organize a U.S.-Asian Workshop on Random Dynamical
Systems, to be held at the S.S. Chern Institute of Mathematics, Tianjin, China,
June 8-12, 2009. The goals of the workshop are to nurture high quality
scientific activity, to develop and strengthen international mathematical
collaboration, and to stimulate the interest of U.S. graduate students, post-
docs, junior mathematicians in random dynamical systems.
