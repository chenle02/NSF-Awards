Two fundamental problems in groundwater hydrology are the need to locate and
track subsurface water, and to identify subsurface properties that facilitate
model predictions. These needs have led to the development of a wide range of
data collection and interpretation methods. Among all of these methods, only
one-time lapse gravity monitoring provides direct measurements of changes in the
mass of water in storage. Recent advances in gravimeters allow for collection of
spatially distributed, temporally continuous gravity data. To make full use of
the data that these instruments provide requires the development of new
approaches to coupled hydrologic/gravity modeling. Under this project, an
extensive pre-existing gravity data set, collected at a water storage and
recovery facility, will be modeled to develop and improve hydrogravimetric
modeling approaches. Then, a spatially extensive data collection effort will be
conducted based on these analyses to refine our interpretations of subsurface
water movement beneath the storage and recovery facility.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is at the forefront of the
continuing evolution of integrating geophysical data with models and has wide
applications in fields needing to tracking and modeling subsurface fluid
movement, such as hydrology, but also including oil and gas reservoir
monitoring, carbon sequestration, and volcano monitoring. The project will
demonstrate that a new, superconducting gravimeter, which is the most precise
instrument in existence, can be moved without affecting instrument drift,
allowing for mobile monitoring with this advanced instrument. The proposed
research supports student training specifically to develop the expertise in the
use of these instruments within the United States.
