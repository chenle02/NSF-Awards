In 1993, NYU was selected by the NYS Science and Technology Foundation as the
site for the Center for Advance Technology (CAT) in Digital Multimedia
Production, Publishing and Education. It is the only such Multimedia CAT in New
York State (the 12 others concentrate in 'hard sciences' including Robotics and
BioTechnology). Thus, not only has New York State targeted Multimedia for
intensive development (coinciding with the NSF selecting "use of multimedia" for
eligibility in Computer Science: Human Interface Design for Access to Computers
and Networked Information (CS/HID) under the GRT program), but NYU has been
selected as a key Multimedia site in New York. We have begun to establish
facilities for the CAT, and are developing a greatly expanded Multimedia degree
program with provides a full-scale, project-based set of graduate courses which
will emphasize computer science, but also include cognitive and perceptual
psychology, and graphic design issues. This will form part of our regular
Computer Science "with specialization in multimedia". Our state grant charges us
to cooperate actively with NY area multimedia firms; we expect these firms to
offer many internship opportunities to our students.
