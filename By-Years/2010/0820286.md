Proposal Number: 0820286&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Adaptation-Based
Programming&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Alan Fern&lt;br/&gt;Co-PIs: Martin Erwig
and Thinh Nguyen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing software for complex, dynamic
environments is a huge challenge using existing programming paradigms.
Programmers must specify the exact behavior of a program at each point which,
for complex problems, such as network control and designing intelligent game
agents, is extremely difficult to do close to optimally. To better facilitate
software development for such problems, the paradigm of adaptation-based
programming (ABP) is investigated. In the ABP paradigm, programmers only exactly
specify the parts of the program that they are confident about and leave other
parts as adaptable. In addition, the programmer will specify an objective
function to be optimized by the program. During program execution, the adaptable
parts of the program will then be automatically optimized using state-of-the-art
machine-learning techniques in order to maximize the objective function. The
research focuses on three key directions: 1) developing theoretical foundations
including formal programming-language semantics and learnability results, 2)
speeding up the learning process via program transformations and programmer-
specified adaptation advice, and 3) producing freely available ABP libraries for
both the C++ and Haskell languages. Importantly all of the work is driven by a
focus on applications of ABP to real problems from computer networking and
intelligent agents for simulation and game environments.&lt;br/&gt;
