8805870 Pigozzi The systematic investigation of the connection between quasi-
equational and propositional logic has recently begun. The investigator will
continue his work in this area. In particular he intends to extend the theory of
commutators in universal algebra to relatively congruence-modular quasivarieties
and filter-modular deductive systems. He also proposes to investigate possible
applications to the algebraic theory of data types and to the connection between
equational and Horn logic programming.
