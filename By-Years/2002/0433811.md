This proposal was an unsolicited submission. This proposal aims to develop a new
methodology to prepare gene therapy vectors by an electrostatic co-extrusion
(ECE) process. This process would make it possible to encapsulate DNA using
charge-neutral bilayers, potentially reducing the cytotoxicity of the vectors
and improving the bioavailability of the DNA by not having a strong attachment
of lipid to the DNA. Importantly, the encapsulation would be performed with very
little loss of DNA, giving ECE a major advantage over pressure extrusion or
other liposome preparation methods.

The specific aims of this research are to: (1) demonstrate the ability of
electrostatic co-extrusion to efficiently encapsulate naked plasmid DNA, DNA
condensates, and siRNA within bilayers of varied lipid composition, (2)
characterize vectors created by electrostatic co-extrusion to classical
techniques through the assessment of homogeneity and range in size, zeta
potential, and DNA content, (3) quantify and optimize DNase resistance, serum
stability, and in vitro transfection rates of vectors produced by electrostatic
co-extrusion, and (4) investigate approaches that would allow this technique to
be scaled up for bulk manufacturing.
