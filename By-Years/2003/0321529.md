This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop
technologies to automatically generate large meshes appropriate for finite
element and similar analyses directly from CAD model representations. This will
be done using scalable, parallel algorithms that will enable the generation of
meshes on distributed parallel computers including workstation clusters. The
result of this project will be software that is capable of generating meshes
with hundreds of millions of elements in an efficient manner. The generated
meshes will already be partitioned to be compatible with the needs of parallel
analysis codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this
research are in those industries that need to perform large-scale simulations of
complex problems over general domains. The procedures to be developed will allow
simulation based design technologies to be applied to applications that demand
massive simulations. By enabling these large-scale simulations for industrial
problems, this technology will enable the more widespread and effective use of
numerical simulation in the design of manufactured products in all industries
(automotive and aerospace being two major industries with an immediate need for
this technology). The software developed in this project will be available for
licensing to all CAD/CAE software developers to enhance the capabilities of
their products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
