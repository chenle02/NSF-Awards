This Research Initiation Award is for analysis of time-varying imagery when the
camera and light source are both moving relative to objects in a scene. This
extends optic-flow techniques developed for camera or object motion with a
constant light source. Applications include passive vision in outer space and
active vision under water or in reconnaisance situations. Industrial robotic
applications may also be developed.
