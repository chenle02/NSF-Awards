PI proposes to continue his study of Alexandrov spaces and convergence and
collapsing of Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bounds.

Alexandrov geometry is a powerful technique in modern geometry. It makes it
possible to attack important conjectures via axiomatic methods similar to those
of classical Euclidean geometry. At the same time it gives a more satisfactory
form for many geometric results.
