9321571 GOAD This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for
the research vessel LAURENTIAN operated by the University of Michigan, Center
for Great Lakes &amp; Aquatic Sciences, and dedicated to use in support of ocean
science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of
ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items as deck
equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Dr. Linda Goad is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to replace a Radar
and install bilge keels to reduce the ship's roll thereby increasing science
productivity. ***
