This project is concerned with the further development, analysis,
implementation, and application of fast adaptive composite grid method (FAC) for
the solution of partial differential equations. The FAC method is a
discretization and solution method designed to achieve efficient local
resolution by systematically constructing the discretization based on various
regular grids and using them as a basis for a fast solution. Software will be
developed enabling FAC to handle systems of equations and three dimensional
problems.
