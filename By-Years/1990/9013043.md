The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an independent, nonprofit
field station with mo institutional affiliation, which provides facilities for
researchers who wish to study high-altitude biology in a field setting.
Researchers have come to the RMBL for six decades, and during that time have
patiently put up with exceedingly inadequate housing. Recent facilities grants
from the NSF have assisted with new cabin construction. This proposal will
provide funds for renovation of three existing researcher cabins. One of these
is an historic structure 112 years old, and improvements at this stage will
prolong their useful life for at least another three decades.
