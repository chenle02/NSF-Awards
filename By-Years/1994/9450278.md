9450278 Boynton The Engineering Design Experience (EDE) - designing,
constructing, testing and evaluating, and communicating - is incorporated in
three, 6-8 week units for middle school students. Each unit is based on a
"technological challenge" which requires the students to work as a design team
to build and present their solutions to the challenge. The design challenges
include development of a toy, a vehicle and an amusement park ride at sixth,
seventh and eighth grades respectively. The materials engage students in
authentic engineering challenges which become the context for learning
mathematics, science, technology education, social sciences and language arts
concepts and skills appropriate to middle school students. The students,
teachers and community members form learning teams in which students assume
various engineering and marketing roles. The products include print materials,
hands-on kits, and videos and videodisc reference materials, complemented by
software tools. The materials are brought to schools by engineers from industry
who interact with the students and teachers as they engage the challenges. ***
