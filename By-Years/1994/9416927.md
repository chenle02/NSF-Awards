9416927 Shokurov This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. scientists in
a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Classification of Algebraic Varieties, to be held at
the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore in March 1996. The co-organizers are Dr.
Vyacheslav Shokurov of the Johns Hopkins University and Professor Yujiro
Kawamata of the University of Tokyo. The seminar will focus on recent advances
in the Log Minimal Model Program and its applications to the classification of
algebraic varieties, in particular, log Fanos and Calabi- Yaus. Topics to be
discussed include: vector bundles, chern numbers, rational Riemann-Roch;
completions of log divisors and elephants; logarithmic structures; and rigid
spaces. The seminar will foster the type of contact between Japanese and U.S.
scientists that can be expected to have significant influence on the future
course of the field. The proposed participants and observers have been selected
for their past contributions and current activity in the field and the meeting
can be expected to produce concrete plans for future cooperation and exchange.
Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange
and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
