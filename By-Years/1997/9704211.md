This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the study of multiple electron transfer systems with
emphasis on two electron transfer processes. Professor Evans and his students at
the University of Delaware will use low temperature fast scan cyclic voltammetry
at microelectrodes, electrochemical impedance measurements, and electrochemical
quartz crystal microbalance measurements to study multiple electron transfer
reactions of substituted anthracenes, durenes, and bicyclooctane compounds. Of
particular interest in this work will be multiple electron transfer reactions
that are coupled with atom transfer reactions. Through a deeper understanding of
these reactions better electroorganic synthetic schemes that can produce fine
chemicals in environmentally superior ways will be developed. The preparation of
organic chemicals by electrochemical means is an under- developed area of
synthesis due to the need to combine expertise in both electrochemistry and
organic synthesis. This work aims to develop electroorganic synthetic procedures
that will have technological impact and also be attractive for their economics
and environmental advantages. Multiple electron transfer processes that are
coupled with atom transfer processes will be of central interest in this work
due to their common occurrence in several areas of practical synthesis.
