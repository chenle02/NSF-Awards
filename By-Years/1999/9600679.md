INT 9600679 Bansil This U.S.-Czech materials research project between Dr. Rama
Bansil of Boston University and Dr. Cestmir Konak of the Institute of
Macromolecular Chemistry will examine microphase separation phenomena in several
copolymer systems, including block, graft, random, and random multiblock
copolymers. To do so, the researchers intend to combine techniques of time-
resolved small angle light scattering (SALS) with time-resolved small angle
x-ray scattering (SAXS) to perform a systematic examination of microphase
separation kinetics and structure in block copolymers. Their objective is to
determine which features of the phase separation process are universal and which
depend on specific chemical interactions. Findings should improve our basic
understanding of the relationship between the structure of polymers and their
specific interactions with solvents. Results may have technological applications
in areas such as adhesives, emulsifiers, and barrier materials. This project in
polymers research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ??
