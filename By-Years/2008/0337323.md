WGBH Educational Foundation is requesting $1,709,863 to produce 20 new shows and
new outreach and Web activities for ZOOM. ZOOM is a daily half-hour PBS series
targeted to kids ages 8 to 11. Uniquely by and for kids, ZOOM gives its viewers
a chance to explore, experiment and share their creativity. The series, along
with its far-reaching outreach, offers its audience an innovative curriculum
that promotes the acquisition of basic math and science knowledge and the
development of problem solving skills called "Habits of Mind." The goals for
Season VII are to: (1) develop three new content areas-"Survivor Science,"
"Sleuth Science," and "Conservation Science"; (2) launch "ZOOM Into Action and
Conserve," a new campaign designed to give kids conservation activities to fuel
their volunteerism and help them understand the science behind their efforts;
(3) create new science training materials for afterschool program leaders; and,
(4) conduct summative evaluation to continue to gauge ZOOM's effectiveness at
teaching math and science to targeted audiences. Outreach for the project will
include print materials for kids, families and educators. ZOOM-related
activities at community-based organizations include 1,450 ClubZOOM science
afterschool programs and 23 ZOOMzone science museum exhibits. ZOOM currently is
carried by 261 public broadcasting stations and is viewed by close to 5 million
children per week. The 2,400-page interactive web site is updated weekly and
attracts almost 43,000 visitors per day.&lt;br/&gt;
