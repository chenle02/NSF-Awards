This award is to subsidize student-related expenses (e.g., travel, registration,
and accommodation) incurred by US students attending the 47th annual North
American Power Symposium (NAPS), NAPS 2015. The Symposium will be hosted by the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte, from October 4 to October 6, 2015.
NAPS is a nonprofit event with technical sponsorship from IEEE and is aimed
primarily at providing a forum for students to present and obtain feedback on
their research in power engineering. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of
papers in NAPS are presented by students. NAPS has been supported by the
National Science Foundation in the past. Support from NSF has helped to enable
student participation in the past. In addition to providing subsidized
accommodation for students, the symposium will foster and encourage student
participation through a comprehensive student program, tours of nearby
facilities related to symposium topics, and a student paper competition. Topics
to be addressed in the Symposium include power system operation, power system
performance, power system protection, power system control, power electronics,
Smart Grid, and microgrid operation and optimization. Measures will be taken to
encourage participation of women and underrepresented minorities in NAPS 2015.
