Due to their different locations, our left and right eyes have slightly
different views of the world. It has been known since the 1830's that a
horizontal disparity (shift) between the position of an image on the retinas of
the left and right eyes is sufficient for humans to see that image in depth.
Combining the two retinal images allows us to see stereoscopically the full
three-dimensional volume of scenes (and even some movies and comic books).
Stereoscopic vision helps people to navigate, to locate, identify and grasp
objects, to judge distances, and to drive vehicles. The goal of this research
project is to understand how the brain interprets retinal disparities as cues to
stereoscopic depth. Horizontal disparities are relative easy to interpret; this
is because of the separation of the eyes, when we are in upright posture, is
horizontal. However, in naturalistic scenes disparities can have any direction,
not just horizontal, and interpreting them is complicated by the variety of
spatial arrangements among objects can influence the disparity directions we
encounter. Therefore, understanding how humans see depth requires that we
understand how the brain analyzes this two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical)
disparity signal. The investigator will measure the depth that people perceive
as they view displays containing several patterns, each with its own disparity
direction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gained from these studies will
help scientists understand how humans and other animals combine images from the
two eyes in order to recover information not available from either eye alone and
how perception of 3-D space can be distorted when this information is combined
incorrectly. Learning about the brain's strategies in achieving normal 3-D
vision will help explain why visual areas of the brain are organized the way
they are and aid in the design of treatments for impaired stereoscopic vision
(from, for example, amblyopia and strabismus, or "lazy eye"). It will also help
in the design of more effective artificial depth-sensing systems and improve
machine-vision algorithms for object recognition, robotics, and visual
prosthetic devices.
