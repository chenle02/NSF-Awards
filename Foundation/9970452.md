9970452 Knight This award will support mainly the travel of graduate students in
mathematical logic to professional meetings and to a lesser extent will support
travel of some outside speakers to the Notre Dame Logic Seminar, which is also
important for providing the broadest background in logic for the students.
Finally, a small portion of the funds (about 10%) will enable the students to
have permanent access to certain important reference books. Knight and her
students are working on various aspects of computable structure theory. One
student, Charles McCoy, has several results connecting definability with
complexity. He is now trying to characterize in a mathematical way the linear
orderings and Boolean algebras with the feature that between computable copies,
there is always some isomorphism at level two in the arithmetic hierarchy.
Another student, Andrew Arana, is beginning work on models of arithmetic and
enumerations. Knight herself will concentrate on problems involving existence of
computable copies of structures. In particular, she hopes to extend the partial
results of Khisamiev on reduced Abelian p-groups with computable copies. She is
interested in a question of Shore, on what statement could serve as a computable
non-structure theorem. Knight has a side interest in systems theory. The area of
computable structure, a new and arguably more suggestive term for what has long
been known as recursion theory, has its roots in the discovery more than half a
century ago of sets of integers for which no algorithm exists to decide if a
particular integer is a member. Moreover, another old result (from the 1950's)
established that there are incomparable sets of this type, i.e., two sets such
that neither permits one to construct the other from it in a mechanical way. As
a practical matter, one cares about the speed and efficiency of algorithms and
not their mere existence. Nevertheless, understanding the inherent limits of
algorithmic possibility is an important philosophical accomplishment and triumph
of the human intellect, in a way the ultimate in self-knowledge. ***
