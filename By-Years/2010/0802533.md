Aiken Technical College and Texas State Technical College are conducting a one-
year planning process to develop a strategic plan for a Center for Hydrogen
Energy Technology. Hydrogen energy technologies are moving out of the research
lab and are rapidly becoming economically competitive solutions in niche markets
such as backup power and utility vehicle applications. As hydrogen technologies
are adopted on a wider basis, a technician base will be needed to support the
manufacture, installation, and operation of these technologies. A strategic plan
that fulfills the workforce training needs of all aspects of the hydrogen energy
industry is needed. The planning effort focuses on developing and sustaining the
Hydrogen Energy Technology (HET) workforce within the United States through the
creation of a Center for Hydrogen Energy Technology. The project is anchored by
a planning partnership between Aiken Technical College and Texas State Technical
College-Waco, with participation of an extensive research and industry
collaborative that includes the Savannah River National Lab, the Center for
Hydrogen Research, industry, government, higher education, and K-12 school
districts. The planning process for the Center unites regional and national
industry, universities, federal research facilities, non-profit economic
organizations, and two-year colleges to build a regional workforce with
expertise in the generation, storage, and usage of hydrogen and efficient local
usage of the energy produced by hydrogen fuels. A detailed strategic plan that
outlines the workforce needs of the hydrogen energy technology industry by
sector and identifies goals and milestones for the Center for Hydrogen Energy
Technology is being produced.
