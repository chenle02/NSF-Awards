SSC-9450417 Stanislaus County Office of Education Modesto, CA Byrd, Jim and
Diggle, Pamela "Project WATER" The Stanislaus County Office of Education (SCOE)
will operate a Summer Science Camp (SSC) for 50 minority students from 1994
through 1996. Certificated Science/Math teachers will provide instruction
emphasizing the hands-on approach involving student activities and projects.
Learning activities will center on the theme of WATER, its multitude of uses and
how it impacts our daily lives. Students will be housed in the Outdoor Education
Center which is located in the Sierra foothills. This is an area rich in
geological examples, fossils, environmental issues, power generating facilities
and scientific stimuli. Professional scientists, mathematicians, engineers and
individuals from related fields will participate in the instructional program
and serve as mentors. They will focus upon the importance of remaining in
school, the selection of science and math courses and the choice of careers
available if the students pursue the path of learning. Selected students will
matched with a control group on the basis of ethnicity, gender, age, and
community type (urban, small community, and rural). Comparisons will be made
over a five-year span on frequency of dropouts, selection of science and math
courses in high school, grades in these courses, attendance, and frequency of
attendance in higher education institutions. The results of this study will be
disseminated to cooperating school districts, supporting organizations, the
National Science Foundation and minority organizations such as the NAACP, the
Hispanic Leadership Council, The Asian Coalition, etc. ***
