The aim of this CAREER project led by Amy Ellis at the University of Wisconsin
is to explore the hypothesis that a curricular focus on quantitative reasoning
in middle grades mathematics can enhance development of student skill and
understanding about mathematical proof. The project is addressing that
hypothesis through a series of studies that include small group teaching
experiments with students, professional development work with teachers, and
classroom field tests of curricular units that connect quantitative reasoning
and proof in algebra. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work of the project will produce:
(a) insights into ways of unifying two previously disconnected lines of research
on quantitative reasoning and proof; (b) models describing realistic ways to
support development of students' proof competencies through quantitative
reasoning; (c) improvement in students' understanding of algebra through
engagement in proof practices based on quantitative reasoning; (d) insights into
middle-school students' thinking as they negotiate the transition from
elementary to more advanced mathematics; and (e) increased understanding of
teachers' knowledge about proof and their classroom practices aimed at helping
students progress towards understanding and skill in proof.
