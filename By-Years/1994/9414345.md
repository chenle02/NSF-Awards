9414345 Jayasuriya In this research project, a frequency domain design
methodology is developed for the synthesis of controllers for highly uncertain
systems to insure robust stability, for assuring non- overshooting step
responses and other time-domain specifications, and for maximizing the tolerance
to external disturbances. In addition, a new control theory is formulated for
eliminating critical speed vibrations and other rotodynamic instabilities in
high speed rotors by utilizing actively controlled magnetic bearings. The
control methodology is applicable to multivariable uncertain plants with more
actuators than controlled out puts and to linear time-varying and nonlinear
compensation for the elimination of limitations brought about by the presence of
non- minimum phase zeros. ***
