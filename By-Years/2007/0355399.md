Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is for partial support for
graduate students, postdoctoral associates and US academic speakers at an
international conference on Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design,
FOCAPD-2004, which will be held at Princeton University, July 11-16, 2004. The
major theme of the conference, "Discovery Through Product and Process Design,"
reflects the shift in the industrial sector during the last decade. The primary
goal of the conference is to create an academic and industrial dialogue, a
critical assessment of existing enabling technologies, a discussion on research,
education, industrial needs, and a forum for new directions, challenges and
opportunities in product and process design. FOCAPD-2004 will feature a keynote
lecture, 21 plenary lectures and a contributed paper session. The conference
aims at attracting over 150 international participants and over 75 contributed
papers. A particular emphasis has been placed on increasing the participation of
graduate students and postdoctoral
associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better product and process design should lead to
faster response times and more efficient utilization of the chemical,
petrochemical, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and services/software industries'
product and processing facilities, which should benefit the US economy. A
session at the conference is scheduled to address education, training and
industrial needs - to identify the prospects and challenges of shifting the
focus from "process design" to "product and process design."&lt;br/&gt;
