While mid-ocean ridge basalts provide wide-spread samples of the oceanic upper
mantle and the chemistry of these rocks potentially constrains mantle
temperature and composition, interpreting these constraints requires inversion
using petrogenetic models that specify mangle mineralogy, temperature,
geochemistry, and dynamics. Oxygen-isotope variations in these basalts have the
potential to add important new constraints because oxygen-isotope composition of
subducted oceanic crust differs from that of common mantle peridotites such that
subduction of crust into the uppermantle can create domains that are both
compositionally compositionally enriched in basaltic and sedimentary components
and anomalous in delta 018. Detailed sutdies of suites selected to examine the
influence of crystallization-differentiation, crustl assimilation, and sub-
solidus alteration on the delta 018 of mid-ocean ridge basalts.&lt;br/&gt;
