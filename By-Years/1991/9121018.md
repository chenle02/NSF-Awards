The Second Behavioral and Computational Neuroscience (BNC) Workshop will be held
at the Georgetown University, Washington, D. C., May 18-21, 1992. The workshop
will address the broad spectrum question of neuronal computation at several
distinct levels: artificial and biological neural networks; material substrate
for sensory and cognitive process; and transputer hardware, concurrency and
object-actor programming. The multi-disciplinay speakers have been selected to
represent a congruence of theory that might serve to identify a new viewpoint.
The key issue to be addressed is the extension and/or refinement of the
"neuronal model" of neural computation by both top down and bottom up
investigations. An anticipated out-come would be the development of multiple
industrial and university research projects.
