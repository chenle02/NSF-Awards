This project explores the behavior of interfaces between overlayers and certain
semiconductor surfaces; emphasis will be on the (100) orientation of gallium
arsenide, and gallium antimonide. A microscopic understanding of morphology,
atomic structure, chemistry(bonding), and electronic states at the interface is
sought. The model systems to be studied are chosen on the basis of the formation
of abrupt, ordered layers. Materials will be prepared by molecular beam epitaxy,
and analyzed by sophisticated electron and photon surface analysis techniques.
This work, by providing information on fundamental materials properties and
behavior of interfaces is expected to increase basic scientific knowledge of
electronic and photonic materials, and to contribute to the advancement of
compound semiconductor materials for technological applications such as
computing and telecommunications.
