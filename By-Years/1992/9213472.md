This is the first year of a three year continuing grant. As computing moves in
the direction of small portable devices, speech and pen will become input
modalities of choice. This research addresses a critical issue of the
identification of the structural, linguistic and performance characteristics of
handwriting and speech and issues of their interaction when used together in an
application. A series of subject-placed experiments will assess writing and
speech when they are: (1) channeled by different types of system prompts, (2)
resolving typical system recognition errors, and (3) experiencing system
response delays deferring in magnitude and predictability. This research will
provide a more complete understanding of how people will write and speak to
future interactive systems and how this can be altered by fundamental parameters
of system interactivity. It will also provide a more principled basis for the
design of complex multimodal systems.//
