This research suggests a new model of decision under uncertainty in a multi-
period framework where the decision maker (an individual or an organization) is
assumed to be boundedly rational. The model differs from existing ones in two
key assumptions: (1) the process is assumed to have an infinite history, i.e.,
to be in a "steady state," and (2Ã•) the bounded rationality notion is modeled by
a new computational model--a Turing machine with memory. The research objectives
are: to define formally a Turing machine with memory; to study the various
models of machines with memory, compare their computational ability and analyze
the trade-offs among their complexity, size of memory and length of recall; to
study the effects of interaction, assuming more than one decision maker is
involved, and; to generalize the model in order to allow for the appearance and
disappearance of decision makers (or agents) in the context of cooperative and
competitive models.
