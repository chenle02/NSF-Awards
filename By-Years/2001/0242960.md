The Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) hosts 10 students each summer to
participate in our Research Experience for Undergraduate Program. The program is
open to all undergraduate students, and stipends, room, board and travel are
provided. Students conduct field research in ecology and evolutionary biology
under the supervision of a senior scientist. The focus of the program is to help
students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, consider and
pursue a career in field biology. The primary emphasis of the program is an
independent research project that students design and conduct under the guidance
of a scientist at the RMBL. To assist both mentors and students, the RMBL
conducts workshops in experimental design and statistical analysis. Upon
completion of projects, all students in the REU program communicate their
results orally at a summer-end symposium. Students are also required to place a
paper written in the scientific format on file with the RMBL. We strongly
encourage students to submit their papers to our online, peer-reviewed journal
Undergraduate Research in Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution. Students interested
in the RMBL's REU program should contact Dr. Ian Billick (director@rmbl.org,
(970) 349-7231). Information is also available online at www.rmbl.org
