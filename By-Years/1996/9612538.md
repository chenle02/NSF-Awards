9612538 Kenny This proposal describes an effort to develop a Micromachined
Calorimeter for the NASA/JPL New Millennium Spacecraft Program. This device will
be used to study effects of the ion engine exhaust plume on passive infrared
radiators used to release heat from the spacecraft core and from science
instruments. New Millennium is a technology validation program, and will provide
a flight opportunity on the first Deep Space 1 (DS1). The performance of
exposure calorimeters is improved through reduction of heat capacity and thermal
conductance. Silicon Micromachining is ideally suited to this task, offering
low-stress nitride membranes with well-characterized, thermal, mechanical, and
optical characteristics. The expected characteristics of the Micromachined
Calorimeter offer a significant performance improvement over conventionally-
built calorimeters. ***
