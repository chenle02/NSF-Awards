This project will support the purchase of computing equipment which will be
used to create laboratories for a new program in calculus which is currently
under development. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the quality of the
undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or improved
instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in science,
mathematics, or engineering. In particular, the calculus program will use (1) a
small number of prototype problem areas to motivate the introduction of
mathematical concepts, (2) an exploration-based computer laboratory, and (3)
writing assignments. The mode of the computer laboratory experiments will be
discovery learning through guided exploration; the laboratory will allow
students to explore the questions inherent in modeling real-world problems and
to develop intuition for the properties of functions of one and several
variables. Written reports on these laboratory experiences will constitute a
major portion of the writing assignments in the course.
