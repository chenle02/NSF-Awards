With the support of the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry,
Professor Neil Garg of the University of California, Los Angeles is pursuing the
chemical synthesis of an important molecule that possesses interesting chemical
properties and an interesting structure. Chemists synthesize such molecules for
the purpose of pushing the boundaries of known chemical technologies. What is
learned from these studies provides the foundation for discovery in numerous
fields, including agrochemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Professor Garg also maintains efforts to promote science and science education
to the general public. His outreach activities and initiatives challenge
existing paradigms in undergraduate education and render the notoriously
difficult subject of organic chemistry accessible to a broader audience.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Garg is studying the complex molecule
dodecahedrane. The chemical structure resembles the well-known dodecahedrane
shape and is comprised of carbon and hydrogen atoms. This molecule is of
longstanding scientific interest and is a notorious challenge for synthetic
chemistry. The key transformations in this synthesis are also of interest from a
mechanistic perspective. Forays in chemical synthesis, such as these, define the
scope and limitations of known reactions and advance the modern state of
synthetic chemistry. With regard to educational initiatives, Professor Garg is
redefining the landscape of chemical education. He is developing online
resources for students, children, and the general public, with a particular
interest in engaging people in organic chemistry and helping people visualize
the 3-dimensional structures of molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
