This basic study is to examine the feasibility of using conducting polymers for
the electronically controlled release of drugs. The novelty of the proposal is
in the use of a photo-polymerization rather than the more conventional
electrochemical polymerization process. The new method allows the three-
dimensional growth of polymer films, and is expected to facilitate the
incorporation of drugs into the polymer matrix. Since the polymers are
conductive, electrical signals may eventually be used for controlling the rate
of drug release. Phase 1 research will concentrate on the study of the photo-
polymerization process. If successful, this research could have a substantial
impact on the way medicine is delivered in long-term therapy.
