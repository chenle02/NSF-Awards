With this award, the Organic Dynamics Program will support the research of Dr.
Philip E. Eaton of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Dr.
Eaton is recognized for his syntheses of molecules containing special geometries
that force the constituent carbons to rehybridize and adopt unusual bonding
parameters. These properties produce systems which provide new insights about
the role of bonding in chemical reactivity. Current studies are focused on the
synthesis of hexaprismane, 1,3-dehydrocubane, pentaprismane, azahomocubanone,
azacubane and other highly strained molecules. These compounds will be
characterized fully by spectroscopy and by their reaction chemistry. The
dehydrocubanes will be studied in detail using spectroscopic methods to measure
the energy difference between a very highly twisted olefin and its carbene
isomer. The cubyl carbocation is being investigated in order to determine what
factors make this structure more readily accessible than originally predicted.
