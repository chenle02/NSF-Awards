The goal of this project is to determine the influence of aerosol hygroscopic
growth on the optical properties of ambient aerosols during dust and pollution
input periods of the Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE) Asia at the Kosan
Supersite on Cheju Island, Korea. Of special interest is whether the hygroscopic
and optical properties of dust are significantly altered during periods when the
dust has experienced anthropogenic influence. This work will take advantage of
the very comprehensive data set that was collected on aerosol chemical,
physical, and optical properties and related parameters. Thermodynamic models
that predict water uptake by ambient aerosols will be extended to include
complex mixtures of inorganic and organic compounds as well as Asian dust.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this work will reveal how particle size,
concentration, and chemical composition impact the ambient light extinction
coefficient, single-scatter albedo, phase function, and Angstrom exponent, as
well as the wavelength dependencies of these parameters. Closure calculations
will test our understanding of these relationships and provide information on
the quality of available measurement techniques and models and point to the most
urgently needed improvements in the future. In collaboration with Prof. John
Seinfeld at CalTech, a graduate student will be involved in this project.
