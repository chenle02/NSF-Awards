9304345 Lockley In this renewal, PI and collaborator A. Hunt will conduct
further studies of biostratigraphy, and paleoecology and systematics of
vertebrate tracks on the Colorado Plateau, where the record is exceptional. PI
will expand, curate and synthesize his data base, going into older strata than
most previous work; fossils will be placed in a new repository established by
his institution. Work will allow new and better correlations, and assemblage
data will also provide insights into the composition, diversity and distribution
of communities. ***
