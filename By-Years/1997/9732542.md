9732542&lt;br/&gt;Salby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Satellite records of total ozone
indicate a systematic decline at midlatitudes after 1980. A clue to the origin
of these changes comes from their strong seasonal and geographical dependence
which mirror the seasonality and structure of total ozone itself. Numerical
models underestimate the observed trend in midlatitude total ozone, with models
predicting only half of the observed decrease. Dr. Salby and his colleagues
believe the discrepancy may stem from sources of interannual variability not
currently accounted for in model simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Accordingly,
Dr. Salby and colleagues will explore interannual variations of ozone in
relation to variations of tropospheric structure. Following preliminary results
from a pilot study, they will composite interannual variations of stratospheric
chemical and dynamical structure. Interannual variations of tropospheric
structure composited in a similar fashion will then be used to drive numerical
integrations in an investigation of how stratospheric changes depend on changes
in planetary wave activity and other tropospheric features influencing
ozone.&lt;br/&gt;
