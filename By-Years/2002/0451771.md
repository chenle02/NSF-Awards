The Southern Ocean is a critical region for understanding the role of the oceans
in global carbon cycling and its potential to regulate climate change. Besides
being an area of high influx of atmospheric carbon and deep water formation, the
persistently high concentrations of major nutrients in Antarctic circumpolar
waters represent the largest pool of unrealized primary production potential in
the oceans. This project is part of a larger effort to test the hypothesis that
iron availability limits phytoplankton production and biomass accumulation,
nutrient utilization and C02drawdown in the Southern Ocean. Drs. Landry,
Chisholm and Bidigare, will contribute by investigating the effects of iron
enrichment and silicate availability on the species composition and size
structure of the plankton community and taxon-specific growth rates and
fluorescence responses of the phytoplankton. Functional and taxonomic components
of the plankton community from bacteria to mesozooplankton will be quantified by
a combination of flow cytometry, taxon-specific pigments, video image-analysis
microscopy and optical plankton counting. In addition, they will use dilution
and gut fluorescence techniques to determine micro- and mesozooplankton
contributions to grazing and to evaluate grazing as an alternate control
mechanism preventing significant net growth of some or all of the phytoplankton
populations. The research will bring a community perspective to the
interpretation of these in situ fertilization experiments which is essential for
a mechanistic understanding of the biological and geochemical responses.
