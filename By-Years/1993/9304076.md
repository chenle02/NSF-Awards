9304076 Poole The long term objectives of the project are to understand how
genes interact during development to specify a complex body plan in higher
organisms. Several cell type specific transcription factors in mammals share a
two part DNA binding domain known as the POU domain. POU domain proteins play a
variety of roles in vertebrate development. The closely linked pdm-1 and pdm-2
genes of Drosophila also share this domain and are most closely related to the
mammalian Oct-1 and Oct-2 POU domain genes. Their developmental expression
patterns, responses to genes that organize the body plan, and effects of their
misexpression together suggest that the pdm genes play important roles in
regulating different aspects of Drosophila development. In addition, the study
of this class of genes in Drosophila should give fresh insights into the
structures and functions of the mammalian genes. The overall aims of this
project are to understand the roles these presumed transcription factors play in
Drosophila development. Specific aims are to generate chromosomal deficiencies
in the pdm gene region to narrow down the genetic area in which to search for
mutations. To predict the effects of mutations on development, phenocopies of
pdm mutations will be induced by injecting antisense oligonucleotides into early
embryos. To generate mutations in the individual pdm genes, the chromosomal
region will be saturated for lethal mutations induced by the mutagen EMS. After
identifying the different genes in the region, the effects on development of
specific mutations in the pdm genes will indicate in which processes the genes
are involved. ***
