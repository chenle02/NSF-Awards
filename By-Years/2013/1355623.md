This research team plans to further develop a suite of products that aid in
mobility for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The technology
includes stand-alone sensor modules as well as controllers that can convert an
existing power wheelchair into a semi-autonomous mobility platform. These "smart
wheelchair" technologies are designed to achieve the following qualifications
(1) modular, reconfigurable and customizable designs that satisfy practical user
and provider constraints and; (2) intuitive user interfaces combined with shared
human-robot control algorithms for enabling mobility for individuals with
general and age-related disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project could
help further the field of assistive robotics through the creation of cost-
effective, modular, reconfigurable and customizable sensor, actuator and
controller designs for smart wheelchairs by enabling individuals with
disabilities with assistive mobility. The technologies developed through this
project may enable translation of capabilities to alternative applications
involving robots in smart and connected healthcare, such as rehabilitation
devices for improved health as well as general human-supervised robot control
systems.
