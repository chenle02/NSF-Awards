Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a rapidly growing area of mathematics. This
project will focus on Galois representations arising from modular forms and/or
the cohomology of algebraic varieties. In particular, two main themes will be
addressed: (1) Serre's conjectures on modular forms and Galois representations
and (2) topics arising from the Galois action on the cohomology of algebraic
varieties. This project will support a workshop in Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry
to be held at Sundance, Utah from May 13-19, 1992. The workshop will concentrate
on Galois representations arising from modular forms and/or the cohomology of
algebraic varieties. The conference is designed to emphasize current research,
to focus on open questions, and to facilitate new work.
