The focus of this work will be to cross-couple 3-ene-1-yne intermediates using
palladium catalysis. The resulting living polymer will lead to the production of
ring-expanded radialenes or the evolution of a tubular helix structure. The
properties of both of the potential products are of interest. With this Small
Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Eric D. Edstrom of the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Montana. Professor Edstrom will test the hypothesis that
unsaturated hydrocarbon units can be induced to polymerize to afford tubular
helix structures. The resulting polymers are expected to show interesting
physical properties.
