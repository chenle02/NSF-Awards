This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Alison Butler, University of California Santa Barbara
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Butler is studying haloperoxidase
enzymes, more specifically the vanadium bromoperoxidases found in several types
of marine algae. The mechanisms of these enzymes and the biogenesis of
halogenated terpene and acetogenin marine natural products will be explored.
Using site-directed mutagenesis, Butler will determine the functional role of
selected amino acid residues in the enzymes and prepare mutants suitable for in
vitro reactivity. These mutants may eventually be used for the industrial
synthesis of halogenated compounds suitable for medical applications.

In addition to the fundamental bioinorganic chemistry and enzymology proposed,
the work has broad implications for marine biology and pharmaceutical chemistry.
Butler also trains a diverse group of students in an emerging interdisciplinary
field
