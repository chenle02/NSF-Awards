(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Major Research and Instrumentation (MRI) program,
Professor Paramjit S. Arora, James W Canary and Michael D Ward will acquire a
MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer. The instrument will be used in a large number of
research projects, for example: a) the design of synthetic helices as inhibitors
of protein-protein interactions; b) structural DNA nanotechnology; c) reaction
pathways of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with DNA; d) charge transfer
interactions in crystals and their relevance to MALDI mass spectrometry; e) the
structure of the backbone in unfolded proteins; f) protein mimetics - synthesis
of macromolecular sequence-specific heteropolymers; g) bioaffinity interactions
and microarray technologies; and, h) design, synthesis and photophysical
properties of photosynthetic model systems.

A MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization -
time of flight mass spectrometer system) is used to identify the chemical
composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in
the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. The
MALDI method provides a soft ionization method for producing ions from large
molecules and biomolecules with less complication than when more energetic
ionization protocols are employed. The TOF feature is an analysis technique that
separates the ions based on their masses after they are produced. The instrument
will provide structural and compositional characterization for a core group of
faculty users, as well as the teaching and undergraduate/graduate student
research programs, in the NYU Department of Chemistry and the Polytechnic
Institute of NYU.
