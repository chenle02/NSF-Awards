This research program has two objectives: The immediate goal is to generate
realistic analytical and computer models for determining the three-dimensional
earthquake response of sedimentary basins using massively-parallel
supercomputers. The aim is to obtain an understanding of the time and spatial
distribution of earthquake-induced surface ground motions within populated
basins, such as the Los Angeles basin, or the San Francisco Bay area. The
ultimate objective is to derive analytical models that provide, with sufficient
accuracy, the ground motions needed in the design of constructed facilities.
This feasibility study addresses these objectives by investigating the needed
computer requirements, computer methodologies, and modeling techniques. It
represents a benchmark on how far currently available advanced computer software
and hardware can be used toward the ultimate objective; and a means of
determining the direction of further advances needed to meet this objective.
