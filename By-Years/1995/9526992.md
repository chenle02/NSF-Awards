9526992 Park The first phase of the Southern Sierra Continental Dynamics Project
(SSCD) yielded the surprising result that a mountain range standing up to 2800 m
higher than surrounding lowlands has a sialic crust of thickness nearly equal to
that of the lowlands (30-40km), based on both passive and active seismic
imaging. Three-dimensional tectonic reconstruction of the adjacent Basin and
Range province suggests Neogene thinning of both eastern Sierran and Basin and
Range crust by a factor of two. These results confirm an upper mantle origin for
buoyancy beneath the range, and present perhaps the starkest illustration of a
major unsolved problem in the dynamics of the cordilleran lithosphere: How can
the profound loss of buoyancy from Neogene crustal thinning be reconciled with
long-standing paleobotanical, geomorphological, and stratigraphic arguments
indicating 1-2 km or more of Cordillera-wide late Cenozoic uplift? Obvious end
member solutions include: (1) little or no thinning of eastern sierran crust (2)
an unusually large decrease in density in the upper mantle (3) regional
subsidence of a high, Andean-type plateau, rather than uplift. This award is one
component of the second phase of the SSCD that has as it's goal the evaluation
of the above hypotheses with a focused, multidisciplinary approach involving
balanced cross-sections, seismic tomography, thermochronometry and isotope
tracer studies, long-period MT, and low-temperature thermochronometry of Sierran
granitoids. ***
