The University of New Mexico S-STEM program is supporting cohorts of 27 computer
science and engineering students annually. Student recruitment, at both the high
school and community college levels, is being conducted by Engineering Support
Services. Students selected to participate in the program must join at least one
of four learning communities in bioengineering, green/renewable energy, high-
tech materials or aerospace engineering. As they foster student growth and
interest in a student's field of study, tutoring, mentoring and professional
career development are integral parts of the program. Additional program
elements include: 1) guest speakers on topics associated with the learning
communities, 2) financial aid guidance, and 3) a "family focused" annual
banquet.&lt;br/&gt;
