The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is ideally suited for an
integrative and multidisciplinary graduate training program in coastal ocean
processes. Ten faculty including 4 physical/optical oceanographers, 4 biological
oceanographers and 2 chemical/paleooceanographers who already have an
established record of productive collaboration are seeking support for 5
graduate traineeships. A sixth student will be supported by matching funds from
the University. The training program will emphasize two highly interdisciplinary
areas crucial to our understanding of the coastal ocean made possible by UCSB's
unique location and research expertise; 1) bio-optics, photoadaptation, and
remote sensing of coastal primary production and water column optical properties
(5 faculty) and 2) spatial and temporal variability in coastal hydrography and
water column processes and their impact on the long-term climate record
deposited in the sediments (8 faculty). Students will be co-sponsored by two
faculty to foster interdisciplinary thesis projects and will received training
in state-of-the-art technologies including satellite imaging and remote sensing,
ocean mooring instrumentation, bio-optics, computer modeling, and modern isotope
geochemical, microbiological and chemical techniques. Recruitment of women and
minority students will be facilitated by liaisons with 2 feeder institutions,
(Moss Landing Marine Lab, California State University at Long Beach) and by the
availability of 3 women mentors among the participating faculty.
