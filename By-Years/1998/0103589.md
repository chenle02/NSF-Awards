Several classes of asymptotic problems are considered. The averaging principle
for deterministic and stochastic perturbations, asymptotic problems for
reaction-diffusion equations, and problems related to stochastic resonance are
among them. The long-time evolution of perturbed systems with conservation laws,
even in the case of purely deterministic perturbations, leads, in general, to
stochastic process on complexes defined by the conservation laws. So the
classical averaging principle (say, for deterministic perturbations of
integrable Hamiltonian systems when the Hamiltonian has many critical points)
should be treated in the stochastic framework. In this research small diffusion
asymptotics for reaction-diffusion in an incompressible 2D-fluid, which is
closely related to the averaging for Hamiltonian systems, is studied. Another
class of problems concerns the large deviation theory and stochastic resonance.
A number of new effects such as large amplitude oscillations and stabilization
induced by the small noise in autonomous systems are
considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The asymptotic approach is one of the most
powerful tools of applied mathematics. In particular, the averaging principle
plays the leading role when systems combining multi-scale processes are
considered. Such problems arise in mechanics, in material sciences, in
biophysics, and in other areas. This research does not just consider problems
concerning the mathematical justification of the averaging principle, but also
describes new applications and new effects. In recent years stochastic-
resonance-type effects, which first appeared in the theory of long-time
evolution of the climate, have attracted the attention of specialists in many
areas of physics, engineering, and biology. The mathematical theory of these
effects is
