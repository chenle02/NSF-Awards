The award supports research into Expertise Networks: the technical augmentation
of the ad-hoc social networks by which people seek information, answer
questions, and accomplish tasks. This research undertakes case studies of
expertise use in current organizational setting in order to more fully
understand the social requirement in augmenting an expertise network. The
proposed research also designs, implements, and evaluates mechanisms for finding
and storing expertise. A result of this research will be the Ad-Hoc Memory
System designed to provide a range of services to augment expertise networks.
This system includes distributed CSCW components such as information
distilleries to create expertise artifacts from informal interactions, expertise
beacons to signal the location of expertise agents to locate expertise, and user
interface mechanisms to handle the increase in queries. The emphasis is on
finding new ways to augment people's expertise, rather than automating, and in
providing usability through examining social requirements.
