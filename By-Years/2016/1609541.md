Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Organic molecules can crystallize in a variety
of solid state forms, each of which exhibits different physical properties.
While only one form can be the most stable under any given set of environmental
conditions, transformations between hydrated (H) and anhydrous (A) forms are
frequently observed as a consequence of changes in environmental conditions
(e.g. temperature, relative humidity, etc). In this project supported by the
Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials
Research, the solid state transformations between hydrated and anhydrous forms
of nucleic acid crystals are investigated. The structural, thermal, and
mechanical properties of these crystalline materials are analyzed using a
battery of complementary experimental techniques available on site and through
collaborations with researchers at United States National Laboratories. Through
this work, the specific effects of crystal defects and surface structures on the
material properties of H and A phases are explored. Insight gained through these
fundamental studies has direct impact on several industries that rely on organic
molecular crystals such as pharmaceuticals, foods, agrochemicals and energetics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to systematically prepare and characterize the physical properties
of purine and pyrimidine hydrated phases with well-defined defect/dopant
concentrations, and to characterize their structural, thermal and mechanical
properties. A broad range of experimental methods will be applied including
diffraction, microscopy, spectroscopy, thermal analysis, moisture sorption and
nanoindentation. This work will advance our understanding of solid state
dehydration and deliquescence processes in general, and specifically the role
defects play in the transformations between hydrate and anhydrous phases. This
collaborative research provides valuable interdisciplinary training
opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.
