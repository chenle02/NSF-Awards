Portable equipment and other relatively inexpensive devices can be used to
stimulate student interest in astronomy provided that the instructor has the
appropriate background. This workshop is particularly for faculty who teach
introductory astronomy courses but who have had limited professional training in
the field. These instructors, at both 2- and 4- year colleges will participate
in a two-week workshop involving various activities that illustrate the methods
of astronomy and that will enhance undergraduate teaching programs. Through the
Center for Science and Mathematics Teaching, new technologies will be
introduced, while in other daily sessions participants will be actively involved
in the type of exercises they might use with their students. Two field trips are
planned: to introduce participants to certain aspects of radio astronomy; and,
at night, as a follow-up to a session on astrophotography. In four evenings
scientists at Tufts will discuss their current research in relevant fields. In
addition to the NSF funds, participants will contribute about 10% in travel
expenses toward the cost of operation of the project.
