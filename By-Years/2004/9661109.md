*** ABSTRACT 9661109 McConnell This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project is designed to prove the feasibility of real-time World Wide Web
displays based on Internet transfer of polled data, automated data sanitizing
and database loading, and dynamic creation of web displays. The specific
commercial opportunity has been created by a recent Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) order requiring all U.S. electric power transmission network
providers to make transmission line availability and pricing data publicly
available as Open Access Same-Time Information Systems (OASIS). Research
objectives include the development of an inexpensive database that can be
queried via a web browser and that can be integrated with a network provider's
existing resources; a standard data format for shipping OASIS input data via the
Internet; an automated sanitizing and loading process for transferred data.
Research will involve determining a feasible database solution; defining a
standard format for data transfer and loading; investigating sanitizing
processes and transfer/loading mechanisms; developing a prototype database/web
display interface. Anticipated benefits include the ability to use the Internet
and standard web browsers for display of real-time data. Limited research has
been accomplished in this area, particularly with regard to use in commercial
applications using diverse hosting platforms. The proposed technology is
designed to be compatible with the growing specifications of information to be
provided by transmission system owners as a result of the restructuring of the
electric power industry. Research results will enable development of a
commercial OASIS. ***
