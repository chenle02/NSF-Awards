9501103 Sahin The proposed research concentrates on areas in measurable
dynamics. In particular, it is proposed to study measurable dynamical systems
with multidimensional time parameters. Some of the topics considered are tiling
based dynamical systems and restricted orbit equivalences. Every
multidimensional continuous-time dynamical system can be represented as a tiling
based dynamical system. There is a natural discrete-time dynamical system
associated to each such representation. This investigation will explore the
intrinsic relationship between discrete dynamical systems arising from different
representations of a fixed continuous-time system. Tiling based problems are
interesting in their own right. They provide a link between crystallography,
multidimensional continuous-time and discrete-time dynamical systems. They also
make it possible to pose problems of abstract measurable dynamics as concrete
tiling geometry questions. This investigation will provide insight into some of
these connections. In addition, the method proposed here introduces a new one-
step constructive technique. This technique differs from the traditional
sequential approximation techniques used in studying higher dimensional
dynamical systems. ***
