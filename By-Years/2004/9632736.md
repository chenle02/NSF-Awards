This is a project that researches the history of the electrical analyzer in
order to understand the articulation of ideological, political, and economic
forces behind the social production and use of the electronic computer. The
project groups electrical analyzers into three categories: artificial electric
lines, short-circuit calculating tables, and alternating current network
analyzers. They are all referred to as electric analyzers in order to emphasize
the continuity between three couples of hegemonic as well as dialectically
opposing social tendencies: mechanizing and calculating which brought about the
mechanical calculator, electrifying and analyzing which brought about the
electrical analyzer, and electronifying and computing which brought about the
electric computer.
