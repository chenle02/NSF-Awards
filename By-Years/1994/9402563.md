9402563 Darwin The research represents the continuation of the first major
revaluation of reinforcing bar geometry in the United States in over forty
years. The study capitalizes on current research efforts to develop new
deformation patterns that optimize bar development characteristics. Tests are
used to evaluate the improvement in bond provided by the new bars, both with and
without epoxy coating, as a function of confining reinforcement, cover, and bar
spacing. The bond characteristics of the new bars also evaluated under cyclic
loading. Fracture mechanics concepts and load and resistance factor design
techniques are used to develop rational, rather than empirical, design
procedures. The research is carried out in conjunction with reinforcing bar
producers, fabricators, coating applicators, and epoxy powder manufacturers.
Emphasis is placed on improved bar deformation patterns that are cost effective
and practical.
