The proposed research is aimed at the development of novel algorithms for the
solution of shape optimization problems in fluid dynamics. Despite the
availability of several analysis techniques for flow problems, design techniques
that are much needed from an engineering perspective are scarce. In a design
approach, the goal is to find the shape that gives the best performance. The
proposed work will address the inverse problem of how to determine the system
geometry for optimum flow performance when the system behavior is described by
the steady Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. This problem will be approached using
ideas of constrained optimal control. The NS equations and an additional set of
adjoint partial differential equations needs to be solved. In the proposed
research, a computational code for the solution of the adjoint equations will be
written and an optimization algorithm will be developed. Numerical results will
be obtained using this algorithm for several sample problems to demonstrate the
feasibility of the approach. The analysis and the numerical implementation will
also be extended to compressible laminar flow. Computational implementation will
be performed on the Cray YMP of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.//
