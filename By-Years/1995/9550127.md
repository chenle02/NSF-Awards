9550127 Bollwinkel The University of Northern Iowa, the Geographic Alliance of
Iowa, and the Environmental Issues Instruction (eii) program, in conjunction
with the Iowa State Department of Education will 1) develop a structure for
involved personnel, 2) establish evidence of broad support, 3) form a list of
consultant resources, 4) evaluate curricular assumptions, and 5) outline a
development and institutionalization plan. Once these activities are done, they
will develop and submit proposals for support to implement their plan. To
accomplish their goals, they will develop both a steering committee (6 members)
and a planning committee (17 members) drawn from a broad base of partners
(formal, informal, and general public), identify stakeholders, and evaluate
various assumptions they have about developing a global change curriculum model,
activate participation in a communication network, outline a plan for training
trainers, and establish a list of consultants. The results of this work will be
dissemination by means of the network of approximately 1000 teachers trained in
environmental issues. Cost sharing is $6500 (%) and comes from funds and in-kind
contributions made by the Geographic Alliance of Iowa and the University of
Northern Iowa.
