The Goshen College Physics Department is stepping into a new area of research
and teaching in the holographic study of vibrating objects. This represents a
deliberate new direction for our well-established undergraduate research
program. Our aim is to move into an area of great value to students and to carry
out a research program that is intrinsically interesting, pedagogically useful,
and connects us to local industry including musical instrument manufacturers.

We propose to study the vibration modes of musical instruments using an
electronic holography system (often called TV holography). Such a system can
create an image of a vibrating object decorated with a pattern of fringes, which
show the vibration mode. We will also use finite element analysis (FEA) to model
the vibration of these musical instruments. By comparing with the holographic
results and refining the model, we will build an accurate FEA model, which can
be used to try out new possibilities.

The Goshen College Physics Department has a history of serving certain local
industries with our x-ray diffraction expertise. Similarly an electronic-
holography system will provide a nondestructive testing capability that will be
of value providing studies of stress-strain deformation and location of hairline
cracks and defects. This capability will be a valuable addition to internship
opportunities for our (binary) engineering students.
