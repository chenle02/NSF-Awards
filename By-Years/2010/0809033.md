This Dissertation Improvement Grant, investigator Ramona Harrison/PI Thomas
McGovern, proposes to examine local production and imported trade items during
the medieval period in Iceland through zooarchaeological investigations that
will connect data to a larger environmental archaeology project, the Gasir
Hinterlands Project. The larger Gasir project is a highly integrated,
interdisciplinary environmental archaeology project to gain insights into
social, cultural, material and environmental change in medieval Iceland. Ramona
Harrison will be responsible for the excavation and analysis of archaeofauna
from four medieval Icelandic sites in order to gain insight into the resilience
stategies of local social groups and their adaptations to climate perturbations.
