This award provides support for organizing three workshops around the theme of
Geometry of Polynomials at Simons Institute - Berkeley. Simons Institute at
University of California, Berkeley has taken a leading role in advancing the
state-of-the-art in Theoretical Computer Science by bringing together the most
prolific and upcoming researchers. This effort will bridge ideas from
mathematics and computer science and develop new techniques with broad
applicability. Researchers will engage in diverse research areas like
combinatorics, probability, statistical physics, optimization and real algebraic
geometry. These workshops will be open to all potential participants, and video
recordings of presentations will be distributed to the public for comment and
engagement. The organizers will invite students and scientists from a diversity
of backgrounds to participate.

Geometry of polynomials is a topic which has shown a lot of promise recently in
solving Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems, Constructing Ramanujam Graphs
and other problems. The power of this framework stems from the fact that certain
classes of these polynomials are general enough to encode a variety of
interesting combinatorial, probabilistic and geometric data, and special enough
to have useful global properties and structure theory. To further develop,
enrich and popularize these techniques, this project will organize three
workshops around the topic: (1) Beyond randomized rounding and the probabilistic
method (2) Deterministic Counting, Probability and Zeros of Partition Functions
and (3) Hyperbolic Polynomials and Hyperbolic Programming.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
