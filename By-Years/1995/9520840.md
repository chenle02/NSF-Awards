9520840 Mittelbach Ecologists have long understood the importance of resource
use in defining species interactions and the population and community level
consequences of these interactions. In stage-structured species, different
stages may utilize resources which themselves interact, thereby influencing
dynamics between the stages. This dissertation research will examine such a
situation by studying the dynamics of larval and adult bluegill in relation to
their resources, small and large zooplankton. These two resources are often
negatively correlated in lakes, possibly due to competition, predation, or the
presence of a refuge from predation. The zooplankton size-structure of a lake
may affect the growth and survival of each bluegill stage because growth of
adult bluegill is positively related to the abundance of large zooplankton,
while larval bluegill are gape-limited foragers. Comparative and experimental
studies will be conducted to test predictions of stage-specific growth and
survival of bluegill as mediated by resource interactions. This research seeks
to improve upon our mechanistic understanding of the processes that regulate
stage-structured populations, thereby helping to clarify the contribution that
these species make to community structure and function.
