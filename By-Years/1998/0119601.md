The conference, Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, provides a general
forum for disseminating the most recent developments in bioinformatics.
Bioinformatics has become an increasingly important tool for understanding
biology, driven by genomic sequence efforts and other large data sets in
biology. The meeting brings together scientists from computer science, molecular
biology, mathematics and statistics. The systems include cutting-edge software
and database technologies. Emphasis is placed on validation of methods using
real data sets, on practical applications in the biological science and on
development of novel computational techniques. The funds will provide travel
support for students and young investigators who submit applications and are
required to present either a paper or poster at the meeting.
