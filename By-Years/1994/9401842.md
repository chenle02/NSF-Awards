9401842 Khuller Over recent years, the Capital Area Theory Seminar has been
particularly active, hosting a talk every other week. Some of the speakers for
the seminar are local, and others are visitors to the DC area. The mailing list
has 107 entries, some of which are other mailing lists. The goal of the seminar
is to stimulate activity in theoretical computer science. In this regard, the
seminar has been quite successful. The seminar is often attended by researchers
from Univ. of Maryland at Baltimore County, Johns Hopkins Univ. and Georgetown
University. ***
