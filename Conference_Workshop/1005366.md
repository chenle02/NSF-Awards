The annual international Gokova Geometry-Topology Conferences started seventeen
years ago with the purpose of creating an informal friendly environment where
the latest results in Geometry and Topology are discussed by active
mathematicians along with enthusiastic graduate students. So far this experiment
has been quite successful. We hope to continue these activities and continue to
publish its annual proceedings as well as a high level free online journal.

Though many world experts frequently visit Gokova, the main emphasis of these
conferences have always been on the young researchers and the graduate students.
Over the years many young now-well-known mathematicians got their early
international exposure in these friendly conferences, many instances by giving
their first talks there. We hope to expand these activities by advanced mini-
courses for talented graduate students and publishing its proceedings.
