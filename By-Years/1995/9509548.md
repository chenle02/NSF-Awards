9509548 LANGLEY The goal of this research is a quantitative understanding of the
forces determining molecular genetic variation and divergence between species.
Such understanding of the effects of mutation, recombination, natural selection
and genetic drift is fundamental to effective applications in agricultural,
conservation and medical genetics. The first project is a thorough and
quantitative survey of DNA sequence variation at four genes near the tip of the
X chromosome (where crossing over is much reduced) in four populations of
Drosophila melanogaster. Several currently viable hypotheses attempt to explain
the consistently observed reduction of heterozygosity in these regions of the
genome. These models will be tested with the data from this survey. The second
experiment is a parallel survey in D. simulans that will provide a "replication"
and allow a careful analysis of the relationship between variation and
divergence.
