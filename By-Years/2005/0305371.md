This research involves the study of the magnetic properties of transition metal
complexes in which the metal spins confined to one or two spatial dimensions
(1D, 2D). Because of the low-dimensional couplings, the materials exhibit
interesting magnetic phase diagrams as a function of temperature, magnetic
field, and pressure. The phase behavior will be investigated by a range of
experimental techniques, which include susceptibility and specific heat
measurements that extend to temperatures as low as 50 millikelvin and field
strengths up to 9 Tesla. These thermodynamic studies complement optical and
magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigations. In one linear-chain material
with S=2, the temperature dependence of the first critical magnetic field will
be mapped and compared with theory and simulation studies, which predict
possible new critical behavior. In two dimensions, novel layered materials based
upon Prussian blue analogues will be investigated. These new systems are
magneto-optically switched below 150 K. Students participating in the project
will learn a wide range of modern experimental techniques, many of which require
skills associated with attaining ultra low temperatures and very high magnetic
fields. This training provides excellent preparation for careers in industry,
academe and government. The primary impact of the research is on fundamental
physics, though the research dealing with layered magnetic materials may have
some technological relevance to the information storage industry.

This project focuses on the investigation of novel magnetic systems confined to
one or two spatial dimensions. A striking aspect of low dimensional systems is
that their properties are often qualitatively and quantitatively predictable
since new analytical and numerical tools are now available due to increased
access to fast computers. The experimental research requires investigations at
the extremes of low temperatures and high magnetic fields. The work presents
stringent tests of the models and yields insight relevant to the information
storage industry. The participating students receive training in a variety of
interdisciplinary fields, namely physics, chemistry, and materials science, and
are well prepared to enter the technologically diverse work force.
