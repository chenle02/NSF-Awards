9317030 Thurber This project involves a collaborative investigation of the
structure of the crust along the San Andreas fault zone in the Northern Gabilan
Range, California. A principal focus of the investigation will be the collection
and analysis of seismic data from linear and 2-D arrays of PASSCAL stations
deployed across the San Andreas fault. Specific objectives are to use the data
collected by the arrays to 1) resolve details of the fault zone structure
through forward modeling of travel times and waveforms and tomographic imaging
of travel times of various phases (P,S, converted, etc.) from both active and
passive sources, 2) use the improved velocity structures to relocate hypocenters
to improve the definition of fault complexity at depth, 3) examine anisotropy in
the fault zone through shear wave splitting, and 4) determine if and where
trapped modes propagate efficiently within the fault zone. ***
