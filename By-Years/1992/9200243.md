This effort consists of installing a low.end McIDASWorkstation in Kuwait City,
enabling (asynchronous)communications between the workstation in Kuwait and
McIDASmainframe facility in Madison, Wisconsin. It is anticipated thatNOAA
personnel will dial into the mainframe facility and downloaddata on demand.
Besides METEOSAT, other data relevant to thedispersal of the smoke are also
available via McIDAS (e.g. NOAA.11 and 12 AVHRR imagery, surface and upper air
data from the Gulfstations, NMC forecast products, etc.), which will also
beaccessible from Kuwait. SSEC provided similar capability inBahrain in support
of the University of Washington and NCARaircraft during May and June of this
year. A McIDAS workstation located in Kuwait would also be a veryuseful research
tool. It would allow the scientists locatedthere to investigate the effects of
the smoke on the localweather including: the effects of the smoke on visibility
andtemperatures, the predictability of the smoke based on the localconditions,
the probability of "black rain" in the coming wintermonths, etc.. The
workstation can also provide a means ofexporting local data such as those
gathered on the 15 towersinstrumented by NOAA for use by scientists in the US
through themainframe McIDAS. Other research opportunities include
theinvestigation of the impact the smoke has on Kuwait's environmentas well as
the impact of dust storms on local activities such asaviation.
