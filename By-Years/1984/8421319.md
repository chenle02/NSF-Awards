The objective of this Phase II project is to develop an electrolyte-supporting
solvent for secondary (and perhaps primary) lithium cells (batteries) that would
improve cyclability (and thereby extend the lifetime). Such cells are considered
thre key component needed for a variety of important applications including
electric vehicles and utility load leveling.
