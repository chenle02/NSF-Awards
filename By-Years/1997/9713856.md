9713856 Linderman The responses of cells are governed to a large extent by the
binding of ligands to cell surface receptors and the signal transduction steps
that follow. Multiple ligands which bind to the same receptors often show
differences in their abilities to elict cellular responses despite equivalent
occupancy of receptors (i.e. there are differences in ligand efficacy). An
estimated 80% of all signaling receptors transmit their signal through guanine
nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins). A quantitative understanding of the
determinants of ligand efficacy in G-protein coupled receptor systems is thus
vital to biotechnological applications such as rational drug design and cell and
tissue engineering. The objective of this project is to use and integrated
engineering/cell biology approach to demonstrate that three critical parameters
determining ligand efficacy and cellular responses in G-protein couple receptor
systems are: (a) the rate of transition between receptor states; (b) the
lifetime of an individual receptor/ligand complex; and (c) the extent of
receptor/G- protein precoupling. The primary methods to be used are flow
cytometry and mathematical modeling. ***
