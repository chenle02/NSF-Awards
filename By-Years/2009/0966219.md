This project is providing 20 scholarships to academically talented and
financially needy students at in two baccalaureate degree engineering technology
programs (Computer Engineering Technology and Mechanical Engineering Technology)
at Indiana State University (ISU). The project develops new support mechanisms
including multi-disciplinary seminars, industry forum, and online
academic/social networking to compliment mature student support services, such
as learning community and co-ops/interns. Interactions among students and
industry professionals help increase the focus and interest of students, enhance
the educational experience of students, and build a relationship of feedback and
exchange for students' ongoing success. Women and underrepresented minorities
are also being recruited as participants of the project. An independent
evaluator is involved in project evaluation.
