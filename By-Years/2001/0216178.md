MRI: Acquisition of High Performance Computer For Wichita State University

This proposal from an institution in an EPSCoR state, expanding the high
performance computer in their High Performance Computing Center, enables the
faculty in physics, chemistry, mechanical and aeronautical engineering, and
their students to solve large-scale computational problems. Over 120 faculty,
staff, and students will use this centralized facility. The National Institute
would also use the machine cycles for Aviation Research (NIAR). The current
facilities have been outgrown. Below follows some examples of the projects
underway:

1. Integrated Computational Tool for Hypersonic Flow Simulations 2. Evaluation
and Retro-fit of Fail-Safety in KC-135 Fuselage Structure 3. Design of Plasma
Sprayed Coatings through Computer Simulation 4. Computational Analysis in
Adhesive-Bonded Composite Joints 5. Quantum Neural Networks 6. Model Atmospheres
for Cool Stars 7. Mixed-Metal Complexes: Multielectron Transfer Agents 8.
Molecular Modeling of Dimeric and Polymeric Ionic Liquids
