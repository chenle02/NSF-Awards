9418378 Walther The research supported through this award will determine
experimental equilibrium solubilities of a number of geologically important
silicates at elevated temperatures (350-650 oC) and pressures (up to 3 kb) in
aqueous salt fluids. Emphasis will be placed on studies of silica, sodium, and
particularly aluminum speciation in H2O-salt solutions. These data will find
application in modelling fluid-rock interactions in metamorphic processes.
