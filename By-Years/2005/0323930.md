This award supports laboratory experiments on ice nucleation, the distortion and
shattering of droplets as they freeze, the light-scattering properties of ice
crystals, and the chemistry of the ice-crystal surface. Specific projects
include (1) determining the homogeneous freezing temperatures of solution
droplets containing salts such as ammonium sulfate, thought to be typical of the
droplets found in the lower stratosphere; (2) determining the heterogeneous
nucleation properties of bacteria found in sea ice; (3) examining the conditions
under which freezing drops become deformed and shatter; (4) measuring the
scattering phase functions of ice crystals for comparison with theoretical
calculations; (5) measuring the pH at the surface of ice formed by different
processes and its dependence on the presence of impurities and trace gases. The
work on droplet freezing employs a freezing-tube, in which the droplet slowly
descends through air with accurately controlled temperature and humidity to
approximate conditions in the high atmosphere. The studies of ice crystal growth
and scattering employ a cloud chamber with an electrodynamic balance that
permits the observation of individual, levitated crystals for long periods of
time as they grow or evaporate in controlled conditions of temperature,
pressure, and humidity. The work is motivated by the need for a better
understanding of the microphysical characteristics of cirrus clouds - how they
form, grow, and affect the transfer of solar radiation. Discrepancies currently
exist between the measured and computed effects of clouds on sunlight, using
different radiative-transfer models. The laboratory measurements of light
scattering by crystals with well characterized sizes, shapes, and orientations
will enable evaluation of the different scattering models. Results will also
provide an improved characterization of the rate at which ice crystals form, as
a function of droplet temperature, size, and chemical composition, which will be
useful in large-scale atmospheric models.
