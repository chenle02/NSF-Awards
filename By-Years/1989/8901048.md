This proposal is for the purchase of equipment to be located at Poker Flat
Research Range. The items to be acquired will be used for the improvement of
services to visiting scientists and the consolidation of a newly developed
imaging Fabry Perot Etalon. A terminal server will be purchased which allows for
up to sixteen different experiments to serviced by telephone modem from outside
the Research Range. Up to the present, we have used dedicated lines, one per
experiment, for this purpose. This addition will enable service to many more
remote users of the facility than the current capability with a restricted
number of phone lines.
