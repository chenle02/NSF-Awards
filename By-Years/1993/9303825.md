9303825 Smith It is known that orography exerts an important influence on
atmospheric motions. It is considered to be crucial that the effects of
mountains be properly included in numerical prediction models whether they focus
on climate, synoptic, regional or local weather. In previous research on this
topic, the Principal Investigator has been instrumental in advancing fundamental
knowledge of atmospheric flows around mountains and the influence of these flows
on the atmosphere. The Principal Investigator will attempt to determine the
nature of the transition between three-dimensional laminar mountain wave flows
and mountain flows with dissipation and wakes. Using numerical models and
observational studies, the Principal Investigator will further refine the
conditions under which different atmospheric flows occur near mountains. ***
