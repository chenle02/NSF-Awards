The as yet little understood decision to commit a crime is importantly
determined by the perceived costs, rewards and opportunities. Further the
effects of prior experiences with the criminal justice system are important in
shaping those perceptions. Dr. Matsueda utilizes a unique longitudinal data set
which has as its foci a population that is likely to be criminally disposed and
serious criminal acts to examine the criminal decision-making process. His
research not only will increase our understanding of this process, but also will
contribute to the integration of the sociology of crime and the economics of
crime. Specifically, taking differences by age, race, sex and histories of prior
arrest and incarceration into account, Dr. Matsueda will test both a complete
and a limited rational decision-making model of criminal behavior. This research
should add an important component to our understanding of the motivation of
people at high risk for committing crimes.
