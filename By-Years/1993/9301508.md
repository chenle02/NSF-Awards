McCarthy will study various spaces of holomorphic functions and the natural
operators acting on these spaces. He will investigate the existence of radial or
non-tangential boundary values for every function in an infinite dimensional
Hilbert or Banach holomorphic space, and the connection between this phenomenon
and the geometry of the space. He will also investigate how elements of
holomorphic spaces can be decomposed into products of special functions,
analogous to the inner-outer factoring in the classical Hardy spaces. Operator
theory is that part of mathematics that studies the infinite dimensional
generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted to finite
dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties, and thus can
be represented by a matrix. The central problem in operator theory is to
classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of associated
operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space. Operator
theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
