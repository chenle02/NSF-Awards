This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to design a generic
framework for formalizing and automatically extracting domain-specific
information from unstructured text for the purpose of automatic processing. The
rate at which new information becomes available has increased to a point that it
is impossible for people to identify the nature the information content as it is
made accessible and even less feasible to absorb the actual information content.
Current search technologies solve the problem of finding documents, but they do
not address the fundamental problem of cognizance of the information contained
in newly available documents. Being aware of the information content has now
become the real challenge. Therefore it has become critical to automatically
process information as it becomes available. The framework will handle domain
specific areas where language variations are wide. The commercial applications
of Teragram's proffered technology include alerts based on content, feature
extraction for clustering and visualization of large information contents, and
structuring data from documents into databases for numerous domains, including
financial analysis, financial earnings releases, sport results, weather
forecasts, terrorist events, election results, and product price comparisons.
