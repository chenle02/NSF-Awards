The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of insecure ownership or
property rights on the use of natural resources in the developing world. One
cause of ownership insecurity is volatile political and legal regimes. Several
empirical studies will be undertaken to explore the relationships between
measures of political volatility and natural resource development and
extraction. Models are developed to identify the effect of insecure ownership on
incentives to develop resources, on investment in extraction capital, and on the
timing of resource recovery. The empirical studies will focus on the pattern of
deforestation that results from commercial logging, the incentive to invest in
plantation forests, the mix of commercial products obtained from forests, the
extent of fossil fuel exploration in developing countries, and the rate at which
fossil fuel resources are extracted. Data on the stability of political
institutions, across countries and over time, are used to indicate ownership
security. In addition, the effect of ownership insecurity on the frequency and
structure of transactions involving natural and environmental assets will also
be analyzed. The transactions to be studied are debt-for-resource swaps and
contracts involving exploration and development rights for fossil fuels.
