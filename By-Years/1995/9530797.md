9530797 Shearer This grant provides $67,350 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading computational facilities used for research in geophysics at the
Institute for Geophysics &amp; Planetary Physics, University of California, San
Diego. Specifically, the equipment will include 12 HP 712 workstations and six 9
Gb hard disks to be purchased over a period of three years. The computers and
additional mass storage devices will be used by a group of 19 faculty, students
and post-doctoral researchers for a variety of studies including, inversions of
3-D global seismic data sets for testing hypotheses about mantle dynamics,
stacking long- period waveforms to image upper mantle seismic discontinuities,
numerical modeling of mantle flow dynamics and modeling the geomagnetic field
using large paleomagnetic data sets. ***
