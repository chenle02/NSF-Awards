An experimental program to investigate the interactions between nuclei, the
structure of light nuclei and the mechanisms of nuclear reactions is proposed.
The program is based on two classes of nuclear reactions: elastic scattering and
knockout reactions. Recent measurements of Lithium elastic scattering data at
210 MeV on a range of targets have provided the first unique Lithium-nucleus
optical model potentials, together with preliminary energy and target-mass
dependence. Higher energy measurements are proposed to obtain further
confirmation of the unique potentials, and their energy and target-mass
dependence. Proton and alpha induced alpha- knockout reactions heavier targets,
will permit a systematic study of alpha clustering in nuclei across the periodic
table. The search for heavier clusters by means of knockout reactions to
complement results of transfer reactions will provide data, for theorists to
develop improved cluster structure calculations.
