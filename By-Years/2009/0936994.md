(Public Law 111-5).

The Division of Chemistry supports Aaron Socha of Brown University as an
American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Socha will investigate the
biodegradation of lignocellulose by the soil-dwelling bacteria Streptomyces
setonii. Dr. Socha will use isotopic labeling and analytical chemical methods to
unravel the catabolic pathways for degradation of lignocellulose in these
bacteria. Dr. Socha will work in collaboration with scientists at Brown
University, the United States Department of Agriculture and the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory. In his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Socha
will work with students and teachers at East Providence High School to develop
hands-on activities in a unique "Diesel from Dirt" program.

Research like that of Dr. Socha is aimed at developing new, efficient ways of
producing technologically useful fuels from plant biomass -- a renewable energy
source. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Socha are
aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented
groups in the sciences.
