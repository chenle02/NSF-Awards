The goal of this research project is to develop computer algorithms that can
detect and interpret faults in operating chemical plants, to be used by plant
personnel making operating decisions during plant upsets. Expert systems will be
developed which allow the accumulated experience, judgment, and heuristics of
process engineers and operators to be incorporated into an automated reasoning
system. The expert system would apply this knowledge in real time by accessing
plant measurements through the process control computer. This system will be
designed in modular form so that complex plants can be decomposed and computer
logic for individual units be developed separately (and recombined in subsequent
iterations). The specific problems that will be addressed in this project
include: (1) theoretical development of new algorithms for disturbance location
and discrimination which account for realistic factors such as noisy and time-
varying data; (2) the development of a theory and methodology of diagnosis based
on uncertain reasoning techniques, to replace the current theory based on
Boolean logic; (3) research on expert system architectures for integration of
heuristic and model-based inferences; (4) basic research leading to development
of guidelines for optimal process instrumentation to increase the effectiveness
of the new diagnostic systems; (5) a theoretical study of qualitative fault
simulation to provide accurate qualitative predictions of the effects of
malfunctions on plant operations; and (6) the implementation of theoretical
ideas in more complex and realistic simulations, to test methodology, and to
give further insight on how to improve and extend the current diagnostic system.
