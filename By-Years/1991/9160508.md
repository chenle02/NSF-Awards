High speed optical links are finding ever increasing uses in optical
communications and signal processing applications. Currently available planar
waveguide lasers used in these links suffer from a high insertion loss due to a
mode mismatch between the fiber and the modulator and the inability to implement
a 2D array configurations. The vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL)
currently under development at several U.S. labs address these problems. These
VCSEL devices consists of a quantum well Fabry-Perot cavity sandwiched between n
and p doped high reflectivity mirrors. Vertical cavity lasers, however suffer
from a high contact resistance due to a doughnut shape top electrode. This leads
to increased heat and current crowding in the laser. We propose to eliminate
this problem by depositing a transparent top electrode made from single crystal
GaN. GaN is transparent to IR and visible and forms a ohmic contact to heavy
doped GaAs. The Phase I program will determine if the VCSEL is damaged during
the GaN deposition and measure the improvement in the top contact resistance.
This will be followed by developing 2D fiber pigtailed VCSEL modules with
monolithic detectors in Phase II. Anticipated Benefits: The proposed VCSEL
modules and the developed technology form the basis of several high speed
modulator, laser and optical interconnect devices. These offer unique system
architectural possibilities for future DOD and commercial systems.
