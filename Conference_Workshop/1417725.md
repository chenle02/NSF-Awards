The conference "Growth in Groups" will take place in the conference center Le
Louverain, which is located in the vicinity of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, during
the period June 24-27, 2014. Growth in groups has been a fascinating and
successful subject connecting algebra, geometry, analysis and combinatorics to
give some groundbreaking and profound results, such as the celebrated theorem of
Gromov on groups of polynomial growth or the existence of groups of intermediate
growth by Grigorchuck. This conference will provide an overview of recent
results in the area through the research talks given by the invited speakers. It
will also contain two mini-courses for PhD students and post-docs. The topics of
the conference include: standard growth in groups and graphs, growth rates,
growth in Coxeter groups, conjugacy growth, uniform growth, geodesic growth,
subgroup growth, growth and amenability, growth and 2-Betti numbers, formal
languages and growth.

Through its nature, the conference seeks the interaction between senior and
junior mathematicians. The conference will take place in an isolated, relatively
small, but well organized conference center, a location which should be very
conductive to discussions and research. The mixture of world-class scientists
presenting their work together with the mini-courses for young scientists will
provide an introduction to this field in a friendly and accessible manner. The
conference is designed to be a great opportunity for networking and training for
junior mathematicians. Funds will be used mainly to cover the travel and hosting
costs for young participants.
