University of Rochester in Fall 2020, Syracuse University in Fall 2021, SUNY-
Albany in Fall 2022.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conferences focus on recent

two magnet lectures by a leader researcher, and many short talks by junior
conference participants. The organizing committee will strive to make this
funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available at: https://sites.google.com
