The purpose of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between Dr. Allen
Cowley of the Medical College of Wisconsin and Dr. Emil Monos of the Semmelweis
Medical University is to take advantage of the complementary expertise of the
two groups to investigate the contractile mechanisms of blood vessels. In
particular, combination of the Wisconsin group's expertise on the ionic basis
for depolarization of vascular and muscle cells, combined with the
Hungarians'expertise on the biomechanics of the blood vessel wall, is expected
to lead to improved understanding of venous myogenicity (the extent to which
venous pressure causes contraction of the vein wall), the scientific basis of
which is virtually unknown. Improved understanding of this phenomenon is crucial
for defining the basic mechanisms which regulate vascular compliance in the
cardiovascular system.
