In-forest biomass processing is being broadly promoted to address the costs
associated with transporting low-value biomass to central facilities. However,
current approaches for scaling-down conventional process technologies are
unlikely to result in sufficiently low costs for accessing most woody debris
resources. Previous research led to the development of a low capital cost,
engineered blanket pyrolysis system that is used to convert forest residue into
carbonaceous biochar through temperature-controlled slow pyrolysis. The
technology is simple enough to be operated by existing fire-crews, keeping
operating costs low. The team has demonstrated this approach for biochar
production from as much as 500 lbs of wood. Preliminary studies are consistent
with prior literature, showing that biochar can serve as a high value soil
amendment or greener alternative to coal. The team has secured an initial supply
of woody debris and has initiated discussions with potential customers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use the funds to commercialize this
technology to address the major ecological and societal challenges posed by
slash, while reducing the cost to landowners. The current plan for the
commercialization of this technology involves two strategies 1) the direct
service of slash removal and 2) bringing biochar to the market as a soil
amendment and landscaping material. Understanding scale-dependent processes in
the new technology, and showing its applicability at a scale relevant to
forestry operations, will significantly advance the engineering science and
commercial potential of this NSF-funded research.
