The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is carrying
out a series of case studies in science and mathematics education as a part of
its continuing concern to provide more effective instruction for all of its
populations. As the international community becomes more interdependent, not
only in economic activity, but in terms of environmental and other concerns, the
degree of commonality held by the developed countries in particular becomes more
and more evident. A key assumption of the OECD Case Studies Project is that the
context, characteristics and implementation of an innovation that is interesting
and important in one country will in many instances be significant in other
nations, as well. The proposed project will carry out up to ten case studies in
science, mathematics and technology education. The studies will be selected with
a view to representing exemplary practice in the United States. The framework
for the studies has been devised by science, mathematics and technology
education experts at OECD conferences (attended by U.S. specialists). The actual
work will be carried out in the United States by the co-principal investigators
and their associates, with the advice of a panel of nationally recognized
experts in science, mathematics and technology education.
