9405561 Riley To carry out integration of information on the genome of the
bacterium E. coli scientists working on E. coli in different areas will meet.
The sequencers, cloners, geneticists, cell physiologists, biochemists, database
builders and computer scientists all come from different perspectives that are
now fusing. This meeting will facilitate the necessary interactions by bringing
together leading researchers in the analysis of genomes at the genetic and
sequence level, and will facilitate the coordination of the structural and
functional analysis of this organism's genome. %%% The E. coli genome analysis
efforts are likely to be the first which will achieve a complete sequence
determination of a free-living organism. At this writing over 2000 genes and
open reading frames have been sequenced, over 55% of the chromosomal DNA, and
their gene products where identified are in the Swiss Protein database. The
extensive genetic, physiological and biochemical knowledge of E. coli make this
the best defined of all organisms. There is much excitement surrounding the
unprecedented opportunity now to integrate these bodies of information as we
approach total sequence E. coli DNA and all gene products. ***
