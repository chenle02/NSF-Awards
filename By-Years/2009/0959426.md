This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Support from the NSF MRI-R2 program has allowed The Richard Stockton College of
New Jersey to acquire a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with video capabilities,
scanning sonar for ranging and avoidance, an acoustic /GPS navigation system,
gripper/cutter collection tools, integrated computer controls for sonar,
navigation and video storage, and a water quality data logging sonde. The ROV
can operate in estuarine and coastal waters to a depth of 150 m, and will
augment research, teaching and training capabilities in biology and marine
science. The acquisition of the ROV will enable research on the population
genetics of the northern star coral, a temperate reef organism, the ecology of
artificial reef colonization and utilization, stock assessment of scallop
populations, linkage between estuarine and inshore water quality and mapping and
delineation of Essential Fish Habitat. The data collected by faculty and
students will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles, and via a
publicly available project wiki based website and also through the Stockton
College website, thereby allowing access to the broader community and
contributing to the National Science Digital Library. The ROV would also enhance
teaching and training of a large number of students in research, in this
primarily undergraduate institution.
