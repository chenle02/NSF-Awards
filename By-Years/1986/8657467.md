Dr. Chernoff will conduct a research program with this Presidential Young
Investigator award which will primarily cover two areas in theoretical
astrophysics: the interstellar medium and globular cluster evolution. The
interstellar medium work will be directed toward understanding how magnetic
fields affect the emission which is observed in shocked regions. Modelling of
the structure of globular clusters will be done to better understand the
formation and evolution of such star agglomerations. Much of our knowledge of
the interstellar medium comes from observations of the radiation emitted by
energetic gas flows as they interact with quiescent molecular material. Dr.
Chernoff concentrates his research on the question of the influence and
importance of magnetic fields on the emission which is observed. The predominant
thrust of theoretical research on globular clusters in the past two decades has
been to isolate the clusters from their surroundings and focus on their internal
processes. Dr. Chernoff is interested in establishing the connection between
internal structure and evolution of clusters with external factors.
