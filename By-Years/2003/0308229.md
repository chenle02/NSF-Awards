SCENS (Secure Content Exchange Negotiation System) is a centralized repository
of metadata that indexes data held on other sites and allows data holders to set
conditions for data access and reuse. The system extends previous work on
MetaDLs (metadata digital libraries) to enable different entities to advertise
their data holdings through a common, structured interface. In addition to
matching data holders with those searching for data, SCENS functions as a broker
of data exchanges, recording agreements on usage (and thus also documenting
statistics of data demand and usage), and also providing a receptacle for
collecting feedback. The system is being developed in the domain of healthcare
data, but the negotiation model it represents is powerful, with applications to
many other domains. Once data sharing has been demonstrated as improving
efficiency and usability of acquired information within the involved heath care
agencies, and has become an integral part of workflow and communication, it will
be easier for other biomedical organizations, government agencies, and other
entities to be convinced that adopting data sharing will make it easier to
achieve objectives, exploit synergies, and gain access to more information than
previously possible. The project's findings have wide applicability in many
fields, such as medicine, science, commerce, entertainment, and security, and
will be available at the project Web site (http://scens.cs.dartmouth.edu/). From
a management viewpoint, overall efficiency and optimal redistribution of
resources within an organization can be improved by monitoring the sharing of
data between separate parts of it. SCENS aims to provide a flexible yet powerful
method of achieving these goals.
