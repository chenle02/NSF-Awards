The goal of this research is to increase the safety and reliability of real-
world software systems. The research is directed toward the development of
practical techniques and the construction of automated tools for verifying
properties of concurrent and real-time software. Many techniques have been
proposed for this task, but little is known about their performance and range of
applicability in practice. This research will conduct a thorough empirical
evaluation of two promising techniques and a new technique that is a hybrid of
the two. The techniques will be evaluated by constructing tools that automate
them and applying these tools to a large number of sample systems. The
information obtained will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of
the techniques examined and will help developers choose an appropriate technique
for their particular domain.
