This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns the
development of an electrochemical-based array nondestructive testing and
evaluation (NDE) system for the detection of corrosion at the microscale level.
Formation of small flaws of a destructive nature results during corrosion of a
number of engineering metals and alloys used in transportation,
microelectronics, electrical power production, and hazardous waste containment.
The stability of these materials is determined by the extent to which a high
integrity passive oxide film forms and is retained during continuous exposure to
the ambient environment. Localized corrosion due to breakdown in these oxide
films is responsible for limiting the lifetime of components made from these
materials. The key to avoid flaw formation in engineering metals and alloys is
the detection of early stages of corrosion. The proposed technology will provide
spatially resolved information on the corrosion process at the microscale level
as well as information on corrosion rates. The fabrication and test of a lab-
scale electrochemical array-based corrosion sensor will be carried out during
the Phase I project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are large potential commercial
applications for this technology in various industries, such as aerospace
(defense and commercial), marine and automotive industries, electric utility
plants, chemical processing plants, refineries, microelectronics, electrical
power production, and hazardous waste containment.
