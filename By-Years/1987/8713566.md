This project will result in the construction of an automatic digital playback
system for retrieving event data from 17 years of analog data tapes from the
Carnegie Institution.Department of Terrestrial Magnetism broad.band seismometer
network. The seven instrument network produces broad.band (0.008 to 30 Hz),
high.dynamic range (160 db) recordings of seismic events. Automatic digitization
of the analog tapes will require: (1) a mechanical playback system with ultra
low-noise electronics, and (2) a high-speed workstation with real-time response
sufficient to digitize and acquire data at a rate of a million samples per
second. Hardware and software implementation of the playback system will be
accomplished in six months, and digitization of the tape library will take an
additional year. When completed, this archive will represent the largest source
of digital broad-band seismic data available and will be a valuable resource for
the seismological community in its studies of the interior structure of the
Earth.
