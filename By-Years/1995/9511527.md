This project examines the questions of whether and how the costs of war - in
purely human terms - affects the conduct of domestic politics. The study focuses
on the link between U.S. casualties, Congressional policies, and electoral
politics during the Korean and Vietnam wars. Casualties are seen as a framing
mechanism that determines the relative salience of war as a political issue and
interacts with candidate positions to influence electoral outcomes. Incumbent
positions, interacting with challenger positions and a state's casualty rate,
shape electoral outcomes, controlling for other well-recognized peace-time
predictors of Senate elections. This research will allow assessment of the claim
that the link between foreign and domestic politics was unique in the Vietnam
War, a relationship that fundamentally changed over time after the 1968 Tet
offensive. The modeling strategy and analysis plan adopted by the principal
investigators permits a broader and deeper understanding of the processes of
political representation.
