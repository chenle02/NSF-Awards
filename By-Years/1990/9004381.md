This research is to emplace a 3-component seismometer at depth in the Cajon
Pass borehole. At the 3.5 km depth of the borehole, this is important because
this is a zone of seismogenic activity in crystalline rock, and deep sampling of
local seismic events increases our understanding of the components of the P- and
S- wave seismic spectra and the seismic coda in crust undisturbed by near
surface phenomena. If spatial and temporal statistical properties of earthquake
occurrence, for example, b-values and coda Q, contain important precursory
information, the largest and cleanest seismogram sample set is available from
sensors placed at depth. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
