The proposed study will investigate how dopamine, an important neurotransmitter
in the brain, is involved in the regulation of motivated behavior. The proposed
studies will investigate which brain areas are involved in this behavior, and
will study the effects of different drugs in this paradigm. These results will
increase our knowledge of how dopamine is involved in motor processes that are
related to motivation.
