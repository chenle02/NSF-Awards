A team of institutions is developing, organizing, and managing the next stage
growth of the core integration (CI) capabilities of the National STEM Education
Digital Library (NSDL). Collaborators include: UCAR, Cornell University,
Columbia University, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Center
for Intelligent Information Retrieval at the University of Massachusetts, the
San Diego Supercomputing Center, the Merit Network, and Eastern Michigan
University. The project is bringing together many efforts already underway, and
engaging new efforts as well, in support of a comprehensive large-scale digital
library expected to enhance every aspect of education in science, mathematics,
engineering and technology. The organizational and technical underpinnings of
the proposed work fall into three categories of effort, each within the overall
context of educational excellence: 1) engaging the community, 2) providing
technology, and 3) operating core services. To promote the vision of a strong
NSDL community that sees itself as owning the program and having major influence
on the character of the library, the project team is working with all NSDL-
funded projects, helping to integrate their work into the library. Additional
partnering with efforts such as those funded by the NSF's Digital Library
Initiative and by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and
independently developed collections and services, is also taking place.
Development and support of models for intellectual property and digital rights
management are being undertaken, as well as promotion of a library evaluation
framework, administration of an NSDL program advisory group, and development of
an overall governance mechanism for the NSDL. A robust, flexible information
technology infrastructure is being implemented based on two themes: a "spectrum
of interoperability" and "one library, many portals". The other two awards in
this collaborative project are 0227648 and 0227656.
