This research explores the atomic structure of spin glasses. Aging and
deformation treatments are systematically applied to vary the local atomic
arrangements in the selected alloy systems, gold-iron, copper-manganese, and
nickel-manganese. Magnetic properties are measured and correlated with atomic
structure, which is derived from x-ray scattering and transmission electron
microscopy. Comparisons are made between the selected alloy systems to clarify
the magnetic behavior.
