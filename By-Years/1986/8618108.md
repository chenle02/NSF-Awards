Current optimization approaches to nondeterministic structural systems subject
to random loads almost invariably treat the serviceability and ultimate limit
states separately. A major drawback to these approaches is that design decisions
at one limit state must be made in the absence of explicit information as to
their consequences at other limit states of concern. This leads either to a
considerable waste of money because of overdesign or to a low reliability of
structural systems. The essential objective of this project is to develop an
efficient and effective method for the multi-objective reliability-based
optimization of structural systems subject to performance constraints imposed
simultaneously at both serviceability and ultimate limit states. Almost no basic
studies in structural optimization have been performed to develop such a method.
A survey of recent research will be made for identifying probabilistic behavior
models for nondeterministic structural members under service and ultimate random
loads. These individual models will be incorporated into a general system model
which will be used for developing a multi-objective reliability-based
optimization method whereby performance constraints will be satisfied
simultaneously at both service end ultimate limit states. This method will be
extended to accommodate generel response sensitivities of the optimum solution
to changes in the random parameters that define the loading and the member
resistances. It is anticipated that the results will be of considerable value
for the efficient design of structural systems under multiple reliability-based
performance constraints.
