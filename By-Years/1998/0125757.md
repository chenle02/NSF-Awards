The Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California at Berkeley will
develop the "Real Astronomy Experience (RAE)" in which science center visitors
will explore the universe by controlling and viewing robotic telescopes via the
Internet; by using image processing software to understand the images they
capture; and by capturing images with a hands-on, functional telescope equipped
with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera to learn how a modern telescope image-
capture system works. Guided by project materials, visitors learn about the
cosmos, tools and methods of scientific research, data analysis and the general
progress of modern astrophysics.
