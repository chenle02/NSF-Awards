The source of gravity waves in the region 80km - 100 km is from the troposphere
and stratosphere, and the ability to divine common sources can be achieved by
ray-tracing techniques. Ray tracing methods are here enhanced by a three-fold
research effort that first addresses the traditional limitation of application
to slowly varying gravity waves. Our approach includes treatment of rapidly
varying waves generated by tropospheric convection. The second task of the
research is reconciliation of the classical dispersion formalism in both
Eularian (ground-based) and Lagrangian (with the wave) reference frames, which
to date appear to produce differing ray-trace results. Finally, this effort
expands common ray trace methods to include wave propagation through a
realistic, three-dimensional atmosphere rather than the steady-state
approximations used to date.
