9352173 Bern This project builds on faculty expertise on biomaterials (such as
grain, oilseeds, forage, animal waste, dust, soil, water, odor-laden air, or
animals) developed through research to develop new lab activities. In
particular, instructors plan to offer innovative exercises in new areas like
computer-vision quality analysis of grain, three-dimensional stress analysis of
soil core samples, grain deterioration measurement, and animal response to
environment. This project involves procuring specialized lab equipment for use
in student labs and undergraduate research projects. The 18 pieces of equipment
requested will be used in 16 courses, for lab activities involving 1,500
students taking departmental courses and completing research projects over the
next 5 years. In addition, 14 research ideas for the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program will use equipment requested, and minority high school
students will participate in weekend workshops in the biomaterials lab. ***
