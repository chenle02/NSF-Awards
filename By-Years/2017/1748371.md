Title: Implicit Biases and Discretionary Prosecutorial Decision Making
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States,
prosecutorial discretion provides criminal prosecutors with the ability to
decide whether to pursue or dismiss initial criminal charges, and whether to
negotiate a plea bargain. However, not much is known about the factors that may
motivate prosecutors when they make these significant legal decisions, including
whether any biases may influence their decisions. Understanding this decision-
making process is particularly important when the crime involves intimate
partner violence (IPV). This project will study and compare potential implicit
biases in prosecutorial decisions in cases of IPV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will employ an experimental approach with prosecutors recruited to
participate. Measures will be taken to assess any explicit and implicit biases.
In the experiments the prosecutors will then be provided with materials from the
initial stages of an IPV criminal investigation, including the arrest report and
witness statements. The gender and sexual orientation of the individuals
involved in the alleged offense will be manipulated and varied. Prosecutors will
then determine how they would proceed in the case, including whether to charge a
felony or misdemeanor, and whether to offer a plea bargain. This
multidisciplinary project engages theoretically in the psychology and criminal
justice literatures. The research will provide insight into various influences
on prosecutors when rendering decisions in IPV cases. As well, by offering a
more comprehensive understanding of prosecutorial discretion, it has the
potential to guide reform and improve practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
