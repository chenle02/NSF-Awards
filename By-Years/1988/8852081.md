The objective of this project is to provide all undergraduate mechanical
engineering students with a capstone, open-ended laboratory experience near the
end of their education in which they must apply various principles of science
and mathematics in a team effort to solve an engineering problem experimentally.
To accomplish this, state-of-the-art equipment is needed for a Diesel Engine
Center and a Textile Drying Center, and expansions of Centers for Mechanics of
Materials, Tribology, Controls, and Vibrations. Each Center is a fully-
instrumented facility, coordinated by a faculty member, pertaining to a
particular area of mechanical engineering and incorporating the use of the
computer as a resource for data acquisition and reduction, and preparation of
results for presentation. When completed, the experimental centers will provide
a quality structured environment for a required laboratory course.
