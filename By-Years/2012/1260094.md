Updates to the SPECFEM3D wave propagation code will be developed so that it can
handle fully elastic, 3-D behavior at and near the seafloor-ocean interface. The
current version does not fully account for attenuation, which 2-D modeling has
shown is a key factor in partitioning of compressional and shear energy at the
solid-fluid interface and within porous shallow sediments that characterize most
of the seafloor. Predictions from the updated code are to be benchmarked against
a commonly used Parabolic Equation algorithm that is well suited for long-
distance (far field) calculations, thus enabling study study of water-borne
seismic phases all the way from source, through the near field, to far-range
receivers. A dataset from the North Pacific will provide constraints for model
parameter testing.
