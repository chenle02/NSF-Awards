This S-STEM scholarship project for low income students focuses on preparing
engineers with the skills required to be part of a global engineering workforce.
The Global Engineering Preparedness Scholarship (GEPS) program includes
strategies to equip a total of 25 academically talented, low income students to
enroll and graduate from the Swanson School of Engineering at University of
Pittsburgh with technical, global competency and leadership skills. With the
development of students' intercultural and global competency skills, the GEPS
program is addressing the National Academy of Engineering's Educating the
Engineer of 2020 (2005) call for preparing engineers to be leaders in global
engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the GEPS program are to:
1) provide access, through scholarship opportunities, to engineering education
to talented low income students to enroll and graduate in engineering, with
concerted effort to increase the enrollment of underrepresented minority (URM)
students; 2) provide continuous academic support for the retention and
graduation of GEPS scholars in engineering; and 3) provide opportunities for
GEPS scholars to develop global competency and leadership experience. Scholars
gain global leadership experiences by selecting from four options: stay-at-home
service learning activities, internships, Engineering for Humanity Certificate
capstone design course, or study abroad experiences with on-location projects.
Recruitment strategies include emphasis on transfer students, who typically are
not provided scholarship opportunities. Evaluators will provide formative
feedback to assist in iteratively improving global engineering preparedness,
peer and faculty mentoring, academic counseling, tutoring, and other program
components.
