Parque Nacional "Noel Kempff Mercado" is one of only three functioning
biological reserves in the Andean country of Bolivia. Several preliminary
inventories of its flora and fauna have been conducted by U.S.-based scientists
and have consisted of short term visits during the dry season. This new project
is a joint effort by two Bolivian research institutions and the Missouri
Botanical Garden. Project personnel will conduct an extensive plant inventory
over a three year period, during wet and dry seasons, and the results will be
incorporated into a computerized Geographical Information System that will be
used to formulate management plans for the park and surrounding areas. Bolivia's
largest forest reserves are adjacent to the park, and rational stewardship of
these resources including surrounding watersheds requires information about the
plants, their habitat preferences and flowering and fruiting schedules, and
geographical distributions. A significant component of the research involves
training and research with host country botanists and students.
