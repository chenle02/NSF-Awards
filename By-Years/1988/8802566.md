The objective of this research is to study the East Asian summer monsoon. It
aims at a fundamental understanding and ultimately prediction of a diverse range
of phenomena found in the East Asian monsoon region. Specific phenomena include
the seasonal migration of the convection zone (Mei-yu), the abrupt- jump
phenomena, 40-day and 20-day oscillations, monsoon intermittency, onset and
breaks, intraseasonal as well as interannual variabilities. The research employs
a three-prong approach involving empirical data analyses, theory and GCM. The
importance of this research is that it has the potential to provide the enhanced
understanding required to improve our ability to predict monsoon activity and
hence the global weather and climate with which the Asian Monsoon interacts.
