In this project, the PI will study geometric spaces that have singularities.
Most of the existing literature in geometry deal with non-singular, thus smooth,
geometric objects such as a plane, a sphere, a saddle surface and their
generalizations. On the other hand, most objects in nature are non-smooth with
singularities of varying degrees of complexity. The PI proposes to study certain
singular geometric spaces by analyzing maps into and between them that are
optimal in the sense that they minimize energy. From the analysis of these maps,
the PI proposes to study symmetry properties of the singular geometric spaces.
Such results are of interest in mathematics and physics and will lead to a
greater understanding of the natural world.

A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces is defined by
measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain and then
integrating. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional. They
can be seen as both a generalization of harmonic functions in complex analysis
and a higher dimensional analogue of parameterized geodesics in Riemannian
geometry. Next to totally geodesic maps, harmonic maps are perhaps the most
natural way to map a given geometric space into another. In this proposal, the
PI proposes to extend the harmonic map theory for singular geometry and apply it
to solve problems in other fields. When studying harmonic maps, natural
questions that arise are: Under what conditions are harmonic maps regular? If it
is not regular, what is the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set? Is the
singular set rectifiable? We consider these questions in the singular setting
(i.e. the domain and/or target space of a harmonic map not necessarily a smooth
Riemannian manifold). By gaining a better understanding of these issues, we
realize the potential applications of harmonic maps in the singular setting that
include rigidity problems in geometric group theory and understanding
degeneration of hyperbolic structures.
