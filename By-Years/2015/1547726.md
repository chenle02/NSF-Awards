&lt;br/&gt;The American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the Society of Exploration
Geophysicists (SEG) have teamed up to provide a series of workshops on topics
that overlap and complement their respective memberships. This year, these
professional organizations are jointly sponsoring a workshop on applying
potential-field and electromagnetic methods to studies of sedimentary
basins.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There has been considerable student interest in
attending this meeting; in fact 13 students have had their abstracts accepted
for participation and the purpose of this award is to provide support for the
travel and fieldtrip expenses of 12 of the student participants. These students
will have the experience of presenting their research and interacting with
leading researchers in potential-field studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference has been widely publicized via internet announcements and prominent
webpages constructed by the American Geophysical Union and the Society of
Exploration Geophysicists, and the response has been excellent from a diverse
audience. The expected audience is 70-100 participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
