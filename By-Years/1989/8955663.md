Northern Kentucky University will initiate a 4-week commuter Young Scholars
project for 40 students in grades 8-9 in physics and math. The goal of the
Northern Kentucky University Young Scholars Program-Early Alert Initiative is to
increase the awareness and interest of junior high students in mathematics and
physics as potential career options. The program is designed to present
mathematics, physics and other applied sciences and the tools for solving
exciting problems, individually, and in small cooperative learning groups. This
four-week commuter summer program enjoys community and industrial support as
students take weekly tours of research and development centers, and engineers
and scientists come to campus to work with students. Follow-up activities
include a bi-monthly newsletter and six Saturday workshops to further develop
problem-solving skills.
