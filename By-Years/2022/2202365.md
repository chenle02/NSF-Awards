Algebraic geometry, which is the geometric study of solutions of polynomial
equations, has seen in the last few years major developments. Of these, one of
the most striking is the invention of modern curve-counting invariants and the
understanding that their computation can be understood in terms of solutions of
certain differential equations related to the geometry of so-called mirror
spaces. The ideas for doing this originated in physics, through the fields of
string theory and mirror symmetry, but are now a major part of modern algebraic
geometry. Costello introduced in 2005 a categorical generalization of curve-
counting invariants, defined for all genera, called categorical enumerative
invariants (CEIs). Despite considerable interest, little is known about them,
primarily due to a range of difficulties that arise when trying to compute them.
The first calculation of CEIs, for the universal family of elliptic curves, was
achieved by the PI in 2017, in joint work with Junwu Tu. This computation led to
work by Costello, Tu, and the PI which laid out a new foundation for the
definition of CEIs, in a way that is explicitly computable. In addition, the PI
will direct undergraduate research projects and train graduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crucial ingredient in the above computations is a choice
of a splitting of the non-commutative Hodge filtration. The general theory of
CEIs does not specify which particular splitting to use, but in order to obtain
geometrically meaningful invariants special choices must be made. In previous
work the choices were guided, via mirror symmetry, by the symplectic geometry of
the A-model. However, many of the choices appear ad hoc, and a general theory of
splittings of the non-commutative Hodge filtration is largely missing. In this
project the PI will expand our understanding of the role played by the spltting
of the Hodge filtration in the definition of the categorical invariants. The
main application will be to compute CEIs not only for geometric spaces, but also
replace the actual spaces with algebraic structures called categories of matrix
factorizations. This is of independent interest in itself: the invariants of
these categories should be closely related to the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten
invariants, but such a relationship is not explicitly
known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
