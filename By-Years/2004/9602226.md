This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research training program focused
on understanding nonlinear processes in biological systems at the level of cells
to that of populations and communities. A group of 25 faculty from eight
departments at the University of California at Davis will train undergraduate,
graduate and postdoctoral students with backgrounds in mathematics or biology in
non- linear mathematical methods suited to the analysis of a variety of
biological problems. Graduate students will be required to complete a set of
core courses in mathematics, and additional training in laboratory or fieldwork-
based biology, depending on individual backgrounds. Laboratory rotations will be
required as will participation in a year- long group research project involving
trainees at all levels. Graduate students will then complete a multidisciplinary
thesis research project under the guidance of two mentors in one of three
general research areas: Cellular, Biofluid or Population Dynamics. In its
overall approach, the program will emphasize collaborative research and
mentoring by faculty and by graduate and postdoctoral students within and across
training levels.
