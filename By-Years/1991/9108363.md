This award supports a project in computational lexicography which is an
international collaborative effort of Vassar's Computers Science Department and
the Groupe Representation et Traitement des Connaissances (GRTC) of the Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Marseille, France. The project
involves the construction of a large-scale lexical and textual database from
machine readable materials in English and French, with the goal of extracting
information that can be used for automatic language processing tasks. A number
of machine-readable materials in English and French, including dictionaries in
typesetter's format but also corpora and other linguistic data, have been
acquired by the project and installed at each site. Software tools are being
developed to structure, access, and analyze these data. The project involves the
structuring of machine readable dictionaries and other linguistic data into a
consistent lexical database, and the extraction of lexical knowledge from these
data for use in natural language understanding and translation.
