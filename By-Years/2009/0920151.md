Building on a CCLI Phase 1 program that integrates genomic science via the
development of a nonmajors introductory genomics course and an advanced level,
capstone course, Bacterial Genome Sequencing and Analysis, this Phase 2
vertically integrates bioinformatics and genomic science with the formation or
enhancement of seven courses for undergraduate biology students at the
University of Florida (UF). An interdisciplinary team from four different
departments (Microbiology &amp; Cell Science, Computer Science &amp;
Engineering, Statistics, and Zoology) are working together to develop these
courses ranging from an introductory level Biometry course to an advanced level
course, Programming for Biologists. The impact of these curriculum improvements
is extended to neighboring community college partners Brevard Community College,
Indian River State College, and Miami Dade College using an online distance
platform made possible with Elluminate and course management system technology.
All of the modules and courses at UF use a computer classroom, and they are to
be part of a new genome science certificate program. Workshops are offered to
both the 4-year and 2-year faculty who are interested in teaching the modules or
courses.
