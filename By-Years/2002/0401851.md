This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site program at North Carolina State University
entitled, "Kenan Fellows for Curriculum and Leadership Development RET Site,"
under the direction of Dr. Ruben Carbonell. The proposed site will provide
science and engineering research projects for 20 middle and high school teachers
from multiple school districts in order to develop a cohort of teacher leaders
who will bring enhanced knowledge of engineering and technological innovation
into their classrooms. The program is designed to foster student enthusiasm,
interest, and competence both for pursuing careers in the field and for the
acquisition of skills and knowledge demanded by an increasingly technological
society.
