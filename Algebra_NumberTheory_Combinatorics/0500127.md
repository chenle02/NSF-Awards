The proposal deals with invariants of singularities with the origin in
birational geometry, D-module theory and tight closure theory. Invariants like
the log canonical threshold or minimal log discrepancies play an important role
in Mori Theory: as shown by Shokurov, their conjectural properties would have
strong implications to one of the main open problems (the so-called Termination
of Flips). On the other hand, it has been realized that these invariants are
closely related with invariants from other fields, for example with the
Bernstein polynomial (from D-module theory), with invariants defined in positive
characteristic, such as the F-pure threshold, or with spaces of arcs and jets.
The main goal of this proposal is to further study the connections between these
different approaches, and to apply this towards a better understanding of these
invariants.

One of the long-term goals in algebraic geometry is to give some sort of
classification of nonsingular varieties. A basic insight in the last twenty-five
years is that singular spaces appear naturally into the picture, and that a good
understanding of their singularities is crucial for the classification process.
General properties of the invariants that measure how bad the singularities are
play an important role in this study. The plan is to use approaches from various
perspectives to shed some light on these general properties.
