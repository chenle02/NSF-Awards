Dr. Patrick Dussault and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Nebraska at Lincoln are being supported to provide a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98,
twelve undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged
in basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Participants are recruited nation-wide. A special feature of the
program is interaction with industry: four area companies with substantial
operations in chemistry contribute to the site through tours, career briefings,
technical training, and student research training.
