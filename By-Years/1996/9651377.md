This interdisciplinary project will develop experiments for undergraduate
students in chemistry, geology and physics to use surface analysis and imaging
techniques to characterize materials. Presently, Ball State University has a
scanning electron microscope used by the three departments. The acquisition of
an x-ray detector for the existing electron microscope will facilitate
quantitative analysis and elemental maps of samples. The chemistry department
operates an infrared microscope. The addition of an attenuated total reflectance
objective will allow information about molecular or crystalline structure to be
obtained on a wide variety of surfaces. These two techniques, which provide
complementary elemental and molecular information, will offer the student an
integrated and superb application of the fascinating theories of the behavior of
electrons, atoms, and molecules. Practically speaking, these experiments will
broaden the experience of the chemistry, geology and physics students. They can
use surface analysis as an analytical technique while preparing themselves for
future opportunities in research and industrial applications.
