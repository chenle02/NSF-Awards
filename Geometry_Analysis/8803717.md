Jon Pitts will continue his study of minimal surfaces by variational
techniques. This is an area which is currently experiencing dramatic
developments. Pitts will focus his attention primarily on minimal surfaces in
three dimensional manifolds rather than Euclidean space. The computational
aspects of this research provide a new direction for Pitts' research. This is an
exciting development which is very much in line with contemporary work of other
researchers. The study of minimal surfaces in three dimensional manifolds is an
important aspect of Thurston's geometrization conjecture. Here the
investigations will concern the possibility of constructing metrics which admit
infinitely many minimal spheres and tori. Another part of the project will be
aimed at finding conditions on a noncompact hyperbolic manifold which guarantee
that it supports a compact minimal surface. Pitts is also developing numerical
methods for approximating minimal surfaces. He will implement these algorithms
in software and produce graphics of the stereographic images of the surfaces.
The ability to visualize these surfaces is rapidly becoming an essential
ingredient of current research into these variational problems.
