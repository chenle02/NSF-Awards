This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
online chiral detector for industrial bioprocessing. Manufacturers in the fine
chemicals and food additives market are constantly searching for ways to improve
quality control in their manufacturing process lines. Online instrumentation is
preferred to batch sampling, especially in continuous processes, to maintain
more consistent product quality and to enable a quick response to process
aberrations that may result in an off specification product. The objective of
this project is to build a robust generalizable online detector specific for
chiral molecules that is inexpensive, robust enough for manufacturing lines, and
has the sensitivity required for quality control.

The commercial application of this project will be in the pharmaceutical and
specialty chemical processing markets.
