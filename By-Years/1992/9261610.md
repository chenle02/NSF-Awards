Accurate control of the mold interior surface temperature is critical for
quality production of plastic parts. Currently, most of the injection molding
machines use open loop control without any direct measurement of the mold
surface temperature. The control variables are water temperature and valve
settings for the cooling/heating water that is circulated through the mold.
Recently closed loop systems with thermocouple measurements have become
available, but provide only limited usefulness. This proposal discusses an
innovative design for two dimensional temperature monitoring and regulation
using an infrared sensor, image processing and robust controller design using
modern control theory approaches. Experimental data will be collected during
Phase I by Nalge Company, a leading plastics manufacturer, to validate the
accuracy of temperature estimation using infrared camera, to identify models for
controller design and to verify the performance of the closed loop controller.
Phase II will consist of actual on-line demonstration of the system in an
operational environment.
