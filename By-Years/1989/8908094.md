This is a collaborative effort devoted to the study if films and structures
fabricated from high temperature superconducting materials. The work includes
unique fabrication methods based on physical vapor deposition and sputtering
techniques. The microstructure, transport and physical properties will be
determined by an unusually broad range of techniques. Experimental
investigations of the superconducting state will involve macroscopic
superconducting properties, the thermodynamics of the phase transition, and
studies of electron tunneling. A theoretical effort synergistic with the
experimental program is also present. Participants of the Materials Research
Group are from Physics, Chemistry and Materials Science Departments.
