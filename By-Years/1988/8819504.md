The objective of this project is to rescue a valuable and irreplaceable
archival tape collection from deterioration and provide better access to
researchers. The Archives at the University of Washington contains more than
4,000 ethnomusicological field tapes from Asia, North and South America, Africa
and Eastern Europe. It is the third largest holding of ethnomusicological
collections in the United States. These original field recordings are unique in
that they constitute records of non-replicable cultural events. Throughout its
history, the ethnomusicology archives has suffered from insufficient resources
to provide for a safe storage environment and for the production of second
copies of materials to function as work tapes for researchers. Through prior
National Science Foundation support the Archives has solved its storage
problems. During this project the project directors will complete the re-
recording of the tapes.
