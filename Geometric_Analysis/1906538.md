These projects will study some fundamental questions about negatively curved and
nonpositively curved metrics. For instance, questions about the existence of
such geometric structures on spaces, that is, how to construct nonpositively or
negatively curved metrics. This includes not just general geodesic metrics but
also the more regular smooth versions, i.e, Riemannian metrics.

The principal investigator plans to continue his study of the topology of the
space of negatively curved metrics, and its variations: the Teichmuller space of
negatively curved metrics and the moduli space of negatively curved metrics,
together with its generalizations to nonpositive curvature. He also plans to
continue his work on some fundamental questions about CAT(0) spaces, the
existence of geodesics in spaces of curvature less than infinity, and continue
his research on the general area of manifold topology and its applications to
geometry.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
