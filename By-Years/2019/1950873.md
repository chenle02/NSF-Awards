This funding renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the
University of Missouri – Columbia. Undergraduate students will investigate a
variety of interesting and challenging problems that involve consumer networking
applications and services that are of significance to the economy and quality of
life in areas such as social computing, health care, and public safety. The
students will participate in the faculty mentors’ on-going funded research,
investigate technically challenging issues, and develop viable solutions and
insights. They will participate in professional development activities to
prepare them for future graduate studies and a broad range of emerging computing
careers. The site will focus on recruiting students from non-PhD granting
institutions with particular emphasis on institutions in and around the state of
Missouri. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project rests
with the leadership, an experienced research group with excellent expertise and
experience in the research area. The research will focus on application areas
such as public safety, health, nature conservation, and immersive learning The
research activities will lead to a better understanding of the multitude of
efficiency, performance, reliability, scalability, and security issues and
tradeoffs in consumer networking technologies and related applications. Advanced
networking environments and software developed in the previous REU site programs
as well as novel testbeds such as the Missouri University Science DMZ
(demilitarized zone) environment, NSF-supported CloudLab/GENI (Global
Environment for Network Innovation), smart device equipment, and sensor-based
monitoring will be leveraged by the participating students in hands-on
experiments within their research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
