"It's Analytical My Dear Watson|" promises participants an intense multi-
disciplinary experience in forensic chemistry, scientific ethics, psychology,
criminalistics, and criminology. A group of fifteen junior and senior high
school students will be selected with the assistance of local high school
science teachers and counselors and will reflect the ethnic, racial, and
economic composition of rural communities on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The
Forensic Science Project will meet on the campus of Washington College for a two
week summer residential program. A staged crime constitutes our opening
statement. Our expert in eyewitness testimony and the effects of discredited
witnesses on jurors will lead students through a description of the crime and
the difficulties and ethical problems posed by their flawed perception of the
event. Lecture sessions will provide the theory of "wet" and instrumental
analytical methods and pose the chemical and criminal puzzles, but more time
will be spend in the laboratory. We will begin with fingerprinting and blood
typing working up to the use of the Chemistry Departments's phalanx of research
grade instrumentation. These high schoolers will gather data for the growing
Chemical Analytical Network, a computer simulation in Forensic Chemistry at
Washington College. We will visit crime and environmental laboratories where
these young, open minds can observe potential role models working in exciting
and rewarding fields. A representative of the Walters Art Gallery will speak to
fakes and forgeries in the art world as demonstrated in a recent exhibit there.
The course will build to a trial in which students will serve as expert
witnesses, attempting to convince the judge and jury of the correctness of their
forensically gathered evidence.
