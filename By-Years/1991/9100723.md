Univariate splines and their tensor products will be used to construct
approximations to infinite-dimensional main effect and interaction components
for models of unknown (exponential family) distributions or conditional
distributions. Theoretical properties will be explored in mathematically
rigorous fashion and real examples will be pursued for data assumed to come from
independent trials and for data from bivariate time series. The overall goal is
to improve the efficacy and accessibility of the statistical framework
underlying the analysis of data and the design of experiments.
