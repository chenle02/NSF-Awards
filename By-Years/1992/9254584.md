Each year for three years, 40 teachers of high school psychology will be chosen
to attend a four week workshop at the University of Houston. The workshop has a
multiplicity of components where each of the teachers would learn about
psychology, educational theory and research, aiding the development of effective
demonstrations and teaching techniques, and fostering communication between high
school and college teachers. Over the course of the next two years, each teacher
will agree to complete a research project in some particular area of psychology.
Each teacher is expected to access an electronic network where a five to ten
page update will be posted at least once each month. These updates will be
prepared initially by the faculty of the University of Houston and Western
Carolina University, but will be broadened in succeeding years to include
faculty from other universities. The cost share of this project represents 21.3%
of the grant request.
