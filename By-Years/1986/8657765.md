This grant provides support for Prof. Banerjee under the Foundation's
Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program. His research concerns the
problems of wave propagation in nonlinear and dispersive media and their
numerical simulation on computers. He is also interested in acousto-optics and
optical information processing, including the optical interconnection problem.
The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most
outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are
intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic institutions to respond to
the demand for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic
and industrial research and engineering. This PYI has made significant
contributions to his field of engineering and has potential to become a leader
in academic research and education. The diary note describes the rigorous
selection procedure. A basic grant award in the amount $25000 is highly
recommended.
