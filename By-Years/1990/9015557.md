Blockstein Funding is requested for a one day program, "Minorities in Biology:
Opportunities for Growth" to be held August 8, 1990 at the 41st annual meeting
of AIBS in Richmond, Virginia. The program will consist of a morning program for
high school students in the local region, a buffet lunch for high school
students and teachers, an afternoon symposium, and an evening reception for all
participants in the meeting. The goals of the program include: 1. To inform high
school and college students of ethnic minority groups about career opportunities
in biology; 2. to increase contact between ethnic minority biologists,
especially at historically black colleges and universities, and other
professional biologists; and 3. to raise the awareness among professional
biologists of issues, concerns, and opportunities regarding ethnic minorities in
biology.
