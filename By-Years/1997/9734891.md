In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Weitz will investigate coordinatively unsaturated metal
carbonyls using transient infrared spectroscopy. He will focus on the kinetics
and mechanisms of a number of reactions of coordinatively unsaturated metal
carbonyls with an emphasis on catalytic processes. Proposed studies include
mechanistic studies relevant to olefin isomerization induced by iron and group
VI carbonyls; manganese carbonyl-olefin complexes; H2Fe(CO)3(C2H4) reaction
kinetics and the hydrogenation of olefins; hydrosilation of olefins;
determination of bond dissociation energies; and formation of compounds by
oxidative addition processes. Infrared laser absorption spectroscopy with time
resolution will be used in these studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project
real time information about a number of catalysis reaction processes will be
obtained, and the important kinetic steps in their mechanisms will be
elucidated. This information is important for being able to understand and
improve on many of the industrial processes which involve these types of
reactions, and so it will be of widespread interest to both pure and applied
chemists.&lt;br/&gt;
