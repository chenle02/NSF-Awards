The project is intended to investigate the estimation of an unknown statistical
covariance matrix of a multivariate random vector. It includes related
charactertistics such as generalized variance, discriminant coefficients,
correlation and precision matrices. The goal in the case of the normal
distribution is to find admissible and minimax estimators and to determine prior
distributions which give rise to such procedures. The asymptotic study of these
problems is to be performed and the resulting problem of positive normal mean
estimation will be studied in detail. The asymptotic distribution of the maximum
spread for a sample from a bivariate normal distribution will be studied along
with its asymptotic efficiency.
