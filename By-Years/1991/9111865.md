This Science in Developing Countries award will support a Workshop on Shorebird
Ecology and Conservation in the Western Hemisphere, held in Quito, Ecuador,
November 3-9, 1991. The U.S. Reserve Network. The workshop aims to provide a
regional forum for discussing significant advances in knowledge of shorebird
migration, ecology, and conservation. The workshop will feature 5 invited
speakers, presentations by 10 Latin Americans whose participation will be
supported competitively through this award, and a roundtable discussion.
Shorebirds have been the subject of intensive study and conservation. Though
many researchers in North, Central, and South America are involved in shorebird
work, there have been few opportunities for interaction among them. Thus, a
major benefit of this workshop, with its simultaneous English- Spanish
translation, will be the promotion of maximum communication and exchange among
shorebird researchers in advancing the knowledge base and providing the ground
for future research collaboration throughout the Hemisphere.
