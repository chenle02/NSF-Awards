Research will continue in string theory, studying solutions already discovered
to string vacua to get some insight into the fundamentals of strings. Also,
since string theory appears to be a consistent theory of quantum gravity, it is
planned to use it to address such questions as the high temperature regime in
thermodynamics, high energy limits of scattering amplitudes, singularities of
the standard cosmology, and singularities of black holes. Particular topics
include an attempt to find solutions of string equations which do not have
"time" in the usual sense and an effort to understand how string theory modifies
the standard cosmological scenario, and how strings can predict the
dimensionality of space-time.
