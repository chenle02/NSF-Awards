9409288 Mendis-Handagama ABSTRACT Leydig cells in the testis are the primary
source of the "male hormone" or testosterone in mammals. Testosterone production
by Leydig cells is activated by another hormone named luteinizing hormone (LH).
Cholesterol is an essential ingredient in testosterone production and following
activation by LH hormone, cholesterol is moved into a special site within the
cell named mitochodria to begin this process. To date, the way that cholesterol
is moved into mitochondria during testosterone production is poorly understood.
However, it is certain that cholesterol needs a special mode of transport within
the cell to reach its destination, because it is insoluble in water. Studies are
planned in this grant proposal to understand this process.
