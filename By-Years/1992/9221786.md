Understanding the functioning of terrestrial food webs requires quantitative
knowledge of the diversity of prey consumed by spiders, because spiders are
major predators in these systems. This project will develop a biochemical
technique to analyze rapidly and accurately the diets of wandering spiders. Once
the technique is perfected, its feasibility as a tool in field research will be
tested by analyzing the feeding relationships in a population of a model
generalist predator, the wolf spider Schizocosa oreata. This research uses
polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to detect prey proteins in the guts of
spiders. %%% Prudent management &amp; conservation of natural communities
depends on fundamental understanding of how food webs function. Forest - floor
communities are particularly important because they often control rate -
limiting processes for forest productivity &amp; growth. The results of this
project will allow quantitative analysis of predatory dynamic's in forest floor
communities.
