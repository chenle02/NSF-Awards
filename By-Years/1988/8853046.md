The award provides funds for equipment to improve the breadth of laboratory
experience provided upper division undergraduates enrolled in General,
Environmental, Mammalian, and Invertebrate Physiology courses at the University
of Southern Mississippi. The vehicle for such training will be a required team
taught laboratory course emphasizing experimental approaches to problem solving
and featuring a diverse array of laboratory exercises, models and protocols. The
instrumentation to be obtained includes refrigerated animal holding facilities,
a biological oxygen monitor, physiological recorder with accessories, flame
photometer, organ/tissue baths and computer with software. These items will
upgrade existing facilities, augment the capabilities (through allowing use of
additional experimental models and investigations of new phenomena) and provide
opportunities for computer simulation of significant aspects of physiology which
are normally impractical to investigate directly in a classroom setting. The
grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
