The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
award is to improve the effectiveness of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) by
developing and using a new paradigm for constructing linear and nonlinear MIP
formulations. Such formulations are used to describe the selection among a
finite number of alternatives in optimization models and their attributes can
significantly affect the performance of the software employed to solve these
models. Unfortunately, there is often a strong trade-off between favorable
formulation attributes. The research in this award will result on methods to
systematically reduce these trade-offs. The approach to develop these methods
will include a mathematical analysis of the proposed paradigm, the design of
algorithms to construct the associated MIP formulations and extensive
computational experiments to evaluate their effectiveness. The deliverables of
this work include new mathematical techniques for constructing and analyzing MIP
formulations, algorithms and software for using and evaluating advanced MIP
formulations, and educational material for engineering students and
practitioners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research
will provide tools to improve the effectiveness of optimization software for a
wide range of MIP applications in business, science and engineering. Recent
examples of such applications include efficient energy production and dispatch,
clinical trial design and analysis, and trajectory optimization of unmanned
aerial vehicles. Results from this research will be disseminated through various
channels to allow their integration into commercial optimization software. In
addition, all developed techniques will be implemented in open-source software
tools available through a variety of modeling languages. The educational
material developed in this award will help students at all levels develop
crucial mathematical modeling skills. Graduate and undergraduate students will
further benefit from this award through lectures and research experience.
