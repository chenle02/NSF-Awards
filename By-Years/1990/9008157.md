This proposal offers new insights into the sources of cooperative behavior in
small-group situations involving prisoners' dilemma games. Previous analyses
have explained the behavior either by assuming supplementary incentives or by
assuming that cooperators are capable of recognizing defectors. Both approaches
place substantial demands on human cognitive capacities that appear
unreasonable. The present approach, in contrast, is based on an alternative
heuristic involving two decisions: (1) whether to participate, and if so, (2)
how to participate. This approach provides a basis for studying the evolution of
cooperative behavior. The ideas will be tested using a new experimental paradigm
that holds particular promise. The proposed approach offers advances both
theoretically and empirically. In particular, the results of this research will
define conditions under which cooperative behavior tends to breed cooperation.
Because the focus is on cooperation rather than competition, the proposed
research should provide new understanding of small-group behavior.
