The work will study creep crack growth in nickel and iron-nickel based
superalloys using HTMI and DIC techniques to obtain crack tip displacements
associated with creep crack growth process in the primary and the steady state
creep crack growth regimes. The work will critically evaluate the validity of
the creep parameters such as K, J-integral, Ct, C(t) and C*.
