Nowadays, a burgeoning amount of data is made available continuously. Example
sources include various sensors, RFID, computer network traffic, phone
conversations, and web searches. Much of this data is noisy, inconsistent, or
even erroneous. Compared to deterministic data, uncertain data carries more
information. Forcing uncertain data to be deterministic (e.g., by taking the
expectations) can cause significant information loss in query results, possibly
leading to wrong judgments for queries that aid decision making. Moreover, real-
time decisions based on these data can have a significant impact on the quality
of life, on the economy, and on our security. However, fast and real-time
processing of uncertain data is a difficult problem. The broad goal of the RURAL
(querying Rich Uncertain data in ReAL time) project is to provide techniques
that make this query processing task feasible. To achieve this goal the project
includes: (1) integrating data cleansing, distribution learning, and query
processing through pipelining; (2) developing fast and online query processing
algorithms on uncertain data; (3) providing a rich treatment of uncertain data
distributions including compression, sharing, and gauging their reliability; (4)
using predictive models to infer uncertain data distributions; and (5) answering
top-k queries with consideration of typicality of
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RURAL project extends the state of art in
real-time query processing of uncertain data for decision-making. It is used by
the Kentucky Transportation Center for the application of dynamic traffic
routing and control, and by the Biomedical Division at the University of
Kentucky for real-time monitoring applications. The research results are
integrated with education through class projects in Computer Science graduate
courses at the University of Kentucky and tutorials at conferences. Further
