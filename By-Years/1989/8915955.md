A laser scanning confocal microscope will be acquired to allow structural
analysis of: 1) The development of and cellular communication in the central
nervous system and 2) chromosome movement and partitioning within cell nuclei.
Specific projects include analysis of synaptic transmission, analysis of 3-D
neuronal structure, cellular and molecular responses glia to immunoegulatory
molecules and molecules that regulate regeneration, and analysis of the
interaction of the centromere/Kinetochore with microtubules in mitotic cells.
