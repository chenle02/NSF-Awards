This research will address the effects of the concentrations of carbohydrate (C)
and nitrogenous (N) nutrients, and the C/N ratio, on products obtained from
various microorganisms. Computerized analysis will be used to move quickly
through a large experimental design. The Principal Investigators (PIs) will
focus on growth-associated and non-growth-associated effects, and on nitrogen
starvation.
