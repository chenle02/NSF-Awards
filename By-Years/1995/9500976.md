AST-9500976 Appelquist, Thomas W. 1995 Aspen Winter Astrophysics Conference,
January 8-14, 1995, Aspen, Colorado. The 1995 Aspen Winter Conference Series
will devote one week, January 8-14, 1995, to an Astrophysics Conference on
"Clues to Galaxy Formation: Quasar Absorption Lines and Deep Galaxy Surveys".
The emphasis will be on using current theoretical ideas to synthesize a coherent
interpretation of the wide variety of new observations of events associated with
the universe converting from diffuse gas into discrete galactic systems. ***
