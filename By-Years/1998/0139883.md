0139883&lt;br/&gt;Swager&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on advanced polymer
chemistry for the 21st century to be held in Nagoya, Japan from December 7-10,
2002. The co-organizers are Professor Timothy Swager of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) and Professor Yoshio Okamoto of Nagoya University
in, Japan. The emphasis of the seminar will be on polymers that in contrast to
commodity materials are chemically complex and not necessarily inexpensive to
produce. New generations of polymers that can justify such expenses are expected
to play a role in many evolving technologies. The last decade has resulted in
enormous progress in the development and understanding of synthetic chemistry,
molecular recognition, molecular scaffolds, biological processes, and self-
organization. Presently these advances are under-utilized in the design and
synthesis of new advanced polymers. The term "advanced" is used to describe
polymers with non-traditional properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This seminar
seeks to bring together specific individuals from the United State and Japan
that have synergistic programs to catalyze new advances in the design and
synthesis of advanced polymers. The seminar advances international human
resources through the participation of a number of younger researchers. Through
the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of
basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.
Arrangements are being made with the "Journal of Polymer Science" to have
proceedings published in a special issue. &lt;br/&gt;
