Proposal: DMS-0410791&lt;br/&gt;PI: Felix E Browder&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Rutgers University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference on Nonlinear Partial Differential
Equations and Applications&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international "Conference
on Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Applications" will be held in
Paris, France, June 21-25, 2004, in honor of Professor Haim Brezis. The program
emphasizes the interplay between theory and applications of nonlinear PDEs.
Areas of application covered at the conference include materials science,
combustion, relativity and gravitational waves, and fluid mechanics. A
distinguished group of speakers has accepted the invitation to speak at the
conference. The conference organizers expect between 200 and 300 participants.
The program includes invited talks, short presentations by selected young
researchers, poster sessions, and a round-table discussion. Four speakers have
been asked to give short tutorial courses prior to the conference. Details are
to be found on the conference's web site,
