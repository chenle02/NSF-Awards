The scientific strategy for this research exploits recent breakthroughs in
stable isotope dendro-ecology, mass spectrometry, and analytical chemistry to
develop chronological and climate proxy data in tropical trees that lack rings.
Tree-ring records have shown great potential for long term observations (&gt;500
years before present or longer) but are limited in extent because many tropical
tree species form rings intermittently or not at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ultimate goal of this research is to develop annually resolved proxy estimates
of rainfall variability from Indonesia for the past several centuries. These
data are expected to directly contribute to observations of past changes in
frequency and strength of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by
complementing the existing proxy data network composed of tropical reef corals
and extratropical trees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tropics are an important
component of the global climate system, possessing the dynamics and energetics
to organize global-scale climatic anomalies on seasonal to interannual time
scales. Evidence from models suggests the tropics may be a persistent influence
of global climate variability on long time scales. Long-term variability in the
tropical climate has the potential to affect the lives of fully a quarter of the
world's population primarily through the interruption of seasonally normal
precipitation and agricultural patterns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date the most
important archives for seasonal to annual resolution proxy records in the
tropics have been derived from measurements from coral reefs and ice cores. They
have their limitations, however, as few coral records predate the existing
100-150 year long historical observational record and ice core records, while
older, are limited to a few rapidly disappearing tropical ice fields. Prospects
for obtaining replicated 300-500 year long records remain challenging but
isotope dendroclimatology offers great promise in closing the data gap and, in
this manner, offers the potential for broad impact to many scientific fields.
