Generalized host/pathogen models have shown that pathogens can theoretically
regulate host population dynamics, as well as have evolutionary impacts. At the
same time, there has been little or no work done to measure ecological or
evolutionary relationships between hosts and pathogens outside of human
epidemiology or agricultural crop systems. The major goals of this proposal are
1) to develop population dynamic models relevant to plant host/pathogen systems,
2) to extend the theory to examine the effects of genetics on population
dynamics, 3) to develop models that explore evolutionary impacts of pathogens on
host life histories, 4) to experimentally determine the effects of density
dependence in Silene populations, and 5) to establish long term experimental
populations that allow model assumptions to be tested, thus acting as a guide to
future theory development.
