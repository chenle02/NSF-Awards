The aim of this project is to characterize the mechanism of retroviral
integration. Retroviruses efficiently and stably introduce foreign genes into
the host genome. Defining the pathway and requirements for integration is
significant both for the understanding of the viral life-cycle, but also as a
means of introduction of DNA, in general, into mammalian cells. Two known viral
components are needed for an integration event: the IN protein and the inverted
repeat sequences found at the termini of the Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs).
Experiments are aimed at defining the functional domains of the Moloney-Murine
Leukemia Virus (M-MuLV) IN protein. A second objective is to define the specific
sequences recognized by the IN protein and possibly other proteins with the LTR
terminal inverted repeats. A third objective is to see if the virus could be
directed to integrate into a known site in the host DNA. The information
resulting from this work will give greater insight into the molecular mechanisms
utilized by viruses. Such insights will obviously affect the practical concerns
in using viruses as vectors.***
