Non-technical Abstract: The Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School and
Workshop focuses on the synthesis, characterization and electronic modelling of
quantum materials. The program includes two major elements: i) the school
providing pedagogical training to students and early career scientists, and ii)
a workshop event organized to maximize the exposure of participants to the
forefront of current research into quantum materials, including presentations
and laboratory visits. This approach results in an impactful mix of pedagogical
background and practical training for junior scientists.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: The program begins with a school
program during which undergraduate and graduate students as well as junior
scientists/postdocs receive instruction in quantum materials synthesis and
characterization, and is followed by a one-day workshop attended by all school
attendees where senior researchers present high-level talks on recent
developments. The lectures are recorded and publicly available online. In 2020
the school will concentrate on the topic of "Exotic and Topological
Superconductors" and will feature leading experts as invited lecturers. The
structure of the school includes mornings of pedagogical lectures with
afternoons devoted to practical demonstrations in laboratories in the University
of Maryland's Quantum Material Center. The school also includes a visit to the
NIST Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, MD, and a poster session
attended by senior scientists. The Winter School is committed to diversity and
inclusion, and has been proactive in promoting the participation of junior
scientists and underrepresented minorities in quantum materials research. An
active public outreach effort is implemented to share learning materials with
members of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
