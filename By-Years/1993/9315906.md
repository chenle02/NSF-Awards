9315906 Rotello This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Rotello's
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award. The focus of the research
will be on molecular processes in non-Newtonian fluids. Solution organization
will be used to model the ordered, yet dynamical environment created by protein
and nucleic acid structures. The dynamic pockets formed in these solutions will
provide many of the features present in enzymatic catalysis such as local
concentration of reactants and conformational "pressure". The magnitude of these
effects can be monitored by NMR and varied by modifying physical conditions such
as spin rate and sample tube size. Molecular recognition and catalysis will also
be studied in non-Newtonian solutions. %%% Non-Newtonian fluids are widespread
in nature including blood, the interior of globular proteins and protoplasm.
These typically aqueous polymer solutions vary their viscosity as a function of
the applied stress. This research will address the fundamental nature of
biological and synthetic polymers under non-Newtonian conditions. ***
