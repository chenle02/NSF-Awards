Recent reorganization of our four year degree curriculum in Environmental
Science as an interdisciplinary program in the College of Food and Natural
Resources has injected a number of academically strong and active areas and
faculty into the program. This project, therefore, is developing an analytical
instrumentation program to allow the establishment of a new laboratory course.
The course emphasizes biological and chemical techniques for the detection and
quantitation of a variety of environmental toxins and contaminants. It is
expected that the new course will also impact four adjacent colleges and enhance
the training of our undergraduate students in the environmental sciences.
