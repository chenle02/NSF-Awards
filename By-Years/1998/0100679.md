In this project, the principal investigator pursues a research program in
nonlinear partial differential equations, the calculus of variations and
singular perturbation theory. The research&lt;br/&gt;topics come from three
applied settings: Ginzburg-Landau type models for superconductivity, von Karman
type models for thin film blistering, and a model in micromagnetics. In the area
of superconductivity, the P.I. will focus on the response of samples to large
magnetic fields, with particular attention paid to the bifurcation from the
normal state to a superconducting state. In the area of thin film blisters, the
P.I. will investigate the nature of instabilities of the blistered region
through the analysis of various dynamical models for blister growth and thin
film growth. Finally, in the area of micromagnetics, the P.I. will analytically
explore a model thought to capture a new kind of magnetic wall structure
associated with a geometric constriction within the
sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project concerns the behavior of
various materials when subjected to outside fields or when forced to take on
specific shapes. The energy of these systems is generally described through a
function, often called an `order parameter,' whose values indicate what state is
taken on by the material under a given set of circumstances (such as geometry,
applied fields,&lt;br/&gt;etc.). Through this type of study, one hopes to gain
an understanding of what shapes are optimal for a given sample in order to
enhance or diminish various physical effects. For example, in the case of a
superconductor, one hopes to learn which shapes are most conducive to producing
a supercurrent that conducts without losses due to resistance. The relevant
mathematical tools come from the calculus of variations and from the theory of
nonlinear partial differential equations, as well as from methods of asymptotic
analysis as applied to the previou&lt;br/&gt;
