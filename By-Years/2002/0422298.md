This project, based on a previous successful CSEMS project, is recruiting low-
income students interested in pursuing an educational career in Computer
Science, Engineering or Mathematics from the Miami-Dade High Schools, Florida
Community Colleges, and also from students applying for admissions to the
University. Recruiting and screening processes and criteria have been
established to identify the candidates in terms of need, well roundedness, and
scholarship. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;FIU is an HSI
(Hispanic Serving Institution), and Hispanics are underrepresented in the CSEM
areas. The project is actively seeking Hispanic students among the eligible low-
income qualifying students without discriminating against other minority or non-
minority students. The goal for the freshman students is to graduate them with a
Bachelors degree in the 4 years the program lasts and for the junior students is
for them to finish first their Bachelors degree during the first 2 years of the
program and then possibly get a Masters degree in one of the 3 targeted areas
(Computer Science (CS), Mathematics (MATH) or Engineering (ENG)) during the
following 2 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;A
counseling, guidance, and mentorship program is in place to provide students
with adequate support mechanisms to assist the students in achieving the goals.
A research experience and internship program is available to all the
participating students. Faculty from each of the participating disciplines serve
as advisors and mentors to the CSEMS scholars, meeting with them regularly to
provide advice on academic, career, support services, and learning enhancement
opportunities, as well as personal support and encouragement.&lt;br/&gt;
