This Minority Career Advancement Award provides funds to support the
development of low-noise readout electronics for use in particle-physics
detector instrumentation. This will allow development of skills to enhance
future research competence and opportunity to engage in forefront research. The
particular application will be in the RICH subcomponent of the upgraded CLEO III
detector at the Cornell storage ring CESR. The P.I. as well will study
properties of Charm particle decay products of B mesons produced at CESR.
