Abstract

Award: DMS-0432284 Principal Investigator: Jozef H. Przytycki

This award provides partial participant support for the 18th conference in the
series, "Knots in Washington." This meeting is devoted to the theme of Khovanov
homology, and aims to bring exponents of that new theory together with recent
and current students in topology, along with experienced researchers in other
aspects of knot theory and quantum topology.

A large number of methods have been developed for computing numbers or
polynomials that each measure some aspect of the complexity of a knotted curve
in space. The Alexander polynomial, which is approximately 70 years old, is the
first example of this powerful class of tools. The search for sharper ways to
distinguish one knot from another and to understand associated geometric
questions gathered speed approximately 20 years ago with the discovery of the
Jones polynomial and related invariants. Mikhail Khovanov of the University of
California, Davis, found in 1999 that the Jones polynomial can be viewed as a
one-line summary of a richer theory, and ongoing work with Khovanov's ideas will
be the theme of this conference.
