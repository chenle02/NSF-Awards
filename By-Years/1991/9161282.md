The new light valve, based on a novel two-layer architecture, provides
significantly higher aperture ratio/pixel density combinations than any of the
currently available or proposed light valves. The use of polymer dispersed
liquid crystal (PDLC) is selected as the choice LC medium for this application.
The combined VLSI/PDLC light valve will result in fabrication of an
ultraminiature light valve with a projected cost factor which is approximately
an order of magnitude less than competing (lower resolution) displays currently
under development. The research effort will be devoted to a feasibility study
which will involve construction, testing and evaluation of the first
experimental prototype valve based on combined VLSI/PDLC technologies. The work
represents a new, innovative approach in the development of improved high
resolution displays. The core feature of this new display centers on
construction of a revolutionary new light valve which combines state-of-the-art
capabilities in very- large-scale-integration (VLSI) and liquid crystal (LC)
technologies.
