The Bromeliaceae (Pineapple Family) is an important component of the vascular
epiphyte flora of the New World tropics and subtropics. The family, which
contains an estimated 2,500 species, is generally considered to be monophyletic,
and recent molecular studies indicate that subfamily Tillandsioideae (with the
genus Glomeropitcairnia removed) is also monophyletic. In contrast, four of the
five remaining genera within the subfamily (Tillandsia, Vriesea, Guzmania,
Mezobromelia), which encompass over 800 species, represent artificial groupings
based on just one or two characters. Recent morphological and preliminary
chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) data suggest that the fifth genus, Catopsis, is
monophyletic. The objective of this research is to construct generic level
phylogenetic hypotheses for subfamily Tillandsioideae using cpDNA restriction
site data obtained from a group of selected, representative species. This
molecular phylogeny will be used to evaluate morphological character state
changes within Tillandsioideae, as well as form the framework for future
phylogenetically based generic level taxonomic revisions within the subfamily.
