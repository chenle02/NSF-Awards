In a cooperative effort between the National Solar Observatory at Sunspot, New
Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), junior and senior
electrical and computer engineering students spend the summers working on design
projects at UTEP and at the observatory. At present, observatory personnel do
not have the time or resources to retrofit or redesign existing equipment that,
although marginal, functions at an acceptable level. This opens the door for
many student design projects aimed at optimizing existing equipment. These
projects include the design of a seeing monitor for observing solar phenomena
and a CCD camera interface.
