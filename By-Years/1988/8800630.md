Geochemical investigations of beryllium will be continued that include studies
of Be isotopes in aerosols, in rain, in ocean, river and estuarine waters and
their particulate matter, and in marine deposits. Particular attention will be
paid to: determining the distribution and degree of isotopic homogenization of
10Be/9Be in the deep ocean, evaluating the 7Be/10Be ratio as a tracer of oceanic
process, exploring the use of pore water 9Be as an normalization parameter for
the 10Be geochronometry, and studying non-steady state elemental removal in
surface ocean with multiple tracers of 7Be/10Be and U/Th series isotopes.
Planned field collections include water column 10Be/9Be study in the S.
Atlantic, atmospheric 7Be/10Be study in Los Angeles, and Be and U-Th series
isotope study in the San Pedro Basin off Southern California. This project aims
at gaining an understanding of the geochemical behavior and distribution of the
isotopes of beryllium (10Be, 9Be, and 7Be) in the ocean-atmospheric system. Such
an understanding will provide insight and facilitate the use of these isotopes
as tracers for a number of oceanographic and geophysical problems such as
geochronology of marine deposits for the past 15 million years, ocean mixing,
particulate flux, trace element scavenging, variation of cosmic-ray and
geomagnetic field intensity.
