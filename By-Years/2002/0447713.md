This project will establish the Vision and Neural Engineering Laboratory at
NJIT. The PI has already established a working oculomotor research laboratory.
The PI proposes a set of experiments to assess vergent (depth) eye movement
mechanisms in motion tracking. The core of her proposed techniques is based
around learning a motor control task under paradigms of reinforcement and
interference learning. Visual tracking as well as fMRI diagnostics will be used,
followed by subsequent analysis via ICA.
