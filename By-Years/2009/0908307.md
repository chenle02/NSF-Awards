Dr Goldberg, Dr Richards and their team will develop and use a new technique to
improve mass estimates for galaxy clusters that are derived from gravitational
lensing -- the way that the light of distant galaxies is bent by gravity while
passing by the cluster on its path to us. The new method combines the
information from small distortions in the images of galaxies lying well away
from the cluster on the sky (weak lensing) with the large distortions (strong
lensing) seen when a galaxy lies almost directly behind a cluster. This
combination is challenging because weak lensing typically demands that
information is smoothed on angular scales large compared with the separation
between the strong-lens images. Dr. Goldberg and his team will also refine their
technique to include additional aspects of the measured galaxy images, including
the banana-shape that weak lensing imposes on them. The technique will be
applied to observations of binary clusters and merging systems.

A woman graduate student and an undergraduate student will be trained as they
participate in the research. Dr Goldberg has written a popular book on astronomy
which he expects to be published in 2009, and Dr. Richards is director of the
campus observatory. Both will continue their public outreach activities.
