This dissertation research award will help an anthropology graduate student
finish studying social and economic differentiation in southwestern Kenya. The
project will examine the distribution of resources, homestead composition and
farm operation, and oral histories and native texts and discourse in two
locations, a market town and a poor, remote community. The goal of the research
is to analyze the factors that produce differences between households, and to
study how these differences are conceptualized by the people. Methods include
surveys, participant observation and structured interviewing. This research is
important because socio-economic differences within and between communities are
a fundamental fact of life and source of problems, especially in the developing
world. Research on the causes of the differences, and how people rationalize and
explain these differences, can help us understand how to deal with the problems
and conflict that arise.
