This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to use
novel polymer processing techniques to fabricate high quality, inexpensive
polymer (plastic) optical fiber image guides and other highly customized
endoscopic devices. Polymer based imaging guides have several distinct
advantages over their glass counterparts. The key advantages include reduced
cost, a smaller bend radius, and increased ruggedness. Additional benefits
include the ability to dope the polymer matrix with molecules that can be used
as environmental probes or indicators, to tailor the imaging guide for
specialized applications, and to impart diverse functionality into a single
imaging guide. The cost of the polymer imaging guide is expected to be
significantly lower than those currently in use. This will allow the polymer
guides to be used as disposables if desired. Disposable endoscopes for one-time
use will eliminate the need for sterilization, which is costly, often unreliable
and time-consuming.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of medical
devices and instrumentation.
