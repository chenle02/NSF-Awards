This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
correlator chip intended for cross-correlation and auto-correlation spectroscopy
at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. The correlator chip to be
developed will have 500 MHz bandwidth, 256 channels, and a 4-level quantization
scheme. A laboratory prototype of a 32-channel correlator will be developed,
fabricated, and tested in Phase I to demonstrate experimentally the feasibility
and to provide the critical design information for the development of the much
larger correlator chip planned for Phase II. To reach the desired level of
performance, the proposed correlator chip will employ an innovative on-chip
parallel processing architecture to achieve a bandwidth equal to the clock
frequency. The high frequency operation will be achieved with a combination of:
bit-systolic arrays, a novel family of hyperfrequency CMOS digital circuits,
input/output circuits capable of operating at data rates equal to the clock
frequency over controlled impedance transmission lines, and the most advanced
CMOS fabrication process available through the MOSIS service ( Hewlett-Packard
0.5 m). The commercial market of correlator chips is estimated by us at $4
million in 1997, and it will grow 20% annually as many radio astronomy centers
will be building focal-plane arrays. The firm's business plan is to focus on the
research, development, marketing, selling, technical support, and maintenance of
a family of state-of-the-art correlator chips and spectrometers with application
in radio astronomy and atmospheric research. A competitive advantage is in the
application of the innovative high-speed, non-saturating logic circuits to the
implementation of correlator chips with superior performance-to-cost ratio.
