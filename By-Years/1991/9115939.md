This research program is focused on basic theoretical aspects of ego-moving
observer (e.g. a camera), a huge amount of visual information is captured. The
aim of this project is to extract relevant visual information from a sequence of
images and to use it as part of feedback control loops. In other words, to
characterize changing visual data using only a few variables which are essential
for the dynamic response of the observer relative to the scene, and use these to
control the motion of the observer. The vision-based algorithms will be
integrated in a real-time closed loop control system that has been developed at
FAU. In addition, the Robot Systems Division at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) has agreed to provide FAU with all the available
hardware and software that are necessary for the successful completion of this
project. Based on previous and on-going research work, there is reason to
believe that a new, promising direction for visual motion with sound theoretical
basis is emerging.
