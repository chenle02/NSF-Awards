This project, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, is in the field of low temperature ion chemistry. Prof. M. Smith of
the University of Arizona, will study the binary chemistry of ion-molecule
reactions and the relaxation and energy transfer at ultra low temperatures
produced in a supersonic jet expansion of the reactant gases. He will also
conduct photoelectron spectroscopy for state selection of molecular ions and
cluster initiated state-selected chemical reactions. Using Laval nozzle
expansions of the component gases the experiments will be extended to
temperatures above those obtained with free jet expansions but below those
accessible with conventional techniques. %%% The chemistry of ion-molecule has
been studied in many laboratories yet there are very few investigations in the
regime of very low temperatures. Prof. Smith's research in this field has had
notable successes and he is one of its very few practitioners. The results of
this research will be important to astronomers modeling interstellar chemistry.
