0129369 Kuo

This is a 24 month AWARE center-center linkage proposal submitted by Dr. Ying-
Hwa (Bill) Kuo, UCAR, for establishing start-up phase of a broad-based program
to create new and strengthen existing research, operational and education
linkages between the U.S. atmospheric science community and that of the nations
of East Asia. The scientists involved, both in the U.S. and East Asia, are among
the world's best, with excellent records of prior research. The science to be
incorporated is cutting edge, innovative, groundbreaking, and facilities and
opportunities available for U.S. scientists at research sites in Taiwan related
to COSMIC project and the Earth Simulator in Japan are unique in the world.

The two-year start-up phase of this program will allow UCAR to develop a
relationship with its international counterparts, to formulate detailed plans
for its educational programs, and to establish its cooperative research and
training projects. At the end of the start-up phase, UCAR will submit a follow-
up proposal to continue the collaborative education, research and training
program. This broad-based program can create new and strengthen existing
research, operational and education linkages between the U.S. atmospheric
science community and that of the nations of East Asia, and will greatly benefit
to U.S. students and junior scientists in atmospheric science.
