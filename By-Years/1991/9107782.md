A conference entitled 'QCD in Nuclear Physics' will be held in Tilton, NH on
July 22-26, 1991. The subject matter is central to current directions in nuclear
science which will be addressed at the new national user facilities, CEBAF and
RHIC, now under construction in the US. Phenomena will be discussed which are
explicitly related to quark and gluon degrees of freedom in nuclear systems,
which span the interface between nuclear and elementary particle physics, and
include: color transparency, quark-gluon plasma phase transitions, EMC effect,
and spin structure functions.
