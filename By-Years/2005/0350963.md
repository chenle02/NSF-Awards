This Small Grant for Exploratory Researh provides support for two annual
institutes that will each bring together approximately 60 graduate students and
junior faculty and fifteen instructors for two weeks of intensive instruction
in, and discussion of, state of the qualitative research
methods.&lt;br/&gt;These institutes seek several complementary goals. First,
they train graduate students and junior faculty in qualitative methods so they
can improve the use of these methods in their own work and teach graduate
courses on qualitative methods at their home institutions. Second, they allow
faculty to present recent and ongoing work on qualitative methods for feedback
from other faculty as well as institute students. Third, they provide direct
feedback to institute students on their current research designs (in most cases,
the research design of their Ph.D. thesis). Fourth, they provide networking
opportunities among and between students and faculty and encourage collaboration
in efforts to improve and disseminate qualitative methods.&lt;br/&gt;The
institutes are sponsored by the Consortium on Qualitative Research Methods
(CQRM). The syllabus from the 2003 institute, and a pdf file of the face-book
distributed to attendees, are available at the CQRM website:

has the added broader societal value of providing outstanding standards for
students who indertake qualitative research.
