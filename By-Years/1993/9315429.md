This award is made in the Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and
Processing Program and is jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry and the
Division of Chemical and Transport Systems Engineering. Additional support is
provided by the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics of the Environmental
Protection Agency, and the industrial collaborators are from DuPont, 3M, and
Unilever Research. Joseph M. DeSimone of the Chemistry Department, University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will develop chemical synthesis and processing
technologies using carbon dioxide-based solvent systems for both homogeneous and
heterogeneous manufacturing processing, and Keith P. Johnston of the Chemical
Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin will perform studies of phase
behavior and structures of microemulsions. Carbon dioxide is an environmentally
sound dispersing medium for chemical reactions, and has been shown to be useful
for polymerization reactions. In carbon dioxide solvent, this research will
study: (1) synthesis of materials under homogeneous conditions; (2) phase
behavior and structure of microemulsions and emulsions; (3) synthesis of
materials utilizing dispersions and emulsion techniques; and (4) processing of
materials concentrating on product isolation with desired morphologies. Chemical
industry uses large volumes of organic and chlorinated solvents which present
serious disposal or recycling problems. The utility of carbon dioxide as a
replacement solvent for the manufacture of polymers, including reforming and
extrusion steps, will be examined in this project. Fundamental properties of
supercritical fluids and reaction chemistry in this medium will be investigated.
Representative synthetic routes will be tested, so that positive results could
be extended to many systems.
