Collections of thunderstorm cells which organize themselves into stable
patterns for periods of several hours or more are termed Mesoscale Convective
Systems (MCS). MCSs typically affect multi-state areas and bring beneficial rain
as well as most springtime severe weather (e.g. tornadoes, flash floods, hail).
A major focus of the meteorological community is to improve our understanding of
MCSs. The Principal Investigator will use conventional and Doppler radar data,
upper air soundings and surface measurements to investigate the alterations an
MCS undergoes as it changes between different structural configurations. A
second goal is to study the relationship between the structure of an MCS and its
precipitation characteristics. Finally, the P.I. will complete a study of
tropical convective systems, including their similarities and differences with
midlatitude systems. Case studies for this research will come from the NSF
sponsored Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central (STORM stands for
STormscale Operational and Research Meteorology) and the Global Atmospheric
Research Program's Atlantic Tropical Experiment and Winter Monsoon Experiment.
