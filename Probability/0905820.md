This project explores problems connected to large scale properties of random
matrices and interacting particle systems. The beta-ensemble is a one parameter
family of distributions of random points on a line; for specific parameter
values it describes the eigenvalues of some of the most famous classical random
matrix ensembles. Understanding the scaling limit of these classical ensembles
has been an important problem of random matrix theory. This project aims to
build on the recent results of the PI and a collaborator in which the point
process scaling limits of the beta-ensembles are described. The plan is to
extract more information and to reach a better understanding of the limit
process while exploring connections to other fields.

Interacting particle systems arise from various applications in several fields.
Examples include growth and deposition models, traffic models, chemotaxis, the
spreading of a disease. In recent decades a concerted effort has been made to
provide mathematically rigorous analysis of such systems. One of the goals of
this proposal is to analyze the equilibrium fluctuations in a certain family of
interacting particle systems. The plan is to develop robust, model-independent
methods to compare various particle systems and to work towards proving the
universality of the scaling exponent in a broad class of models.

The project deals with problems related to large random systems with lots of
components and non-trivial interactions. The treatment of these problems
requires a wide range of tools which connects them to various other fields of
mathematics besides probability, e.g. combinatorics, complex analysis, operator
theory, partial differential equations. Such systems occur in many other fields
in addition to mathematics, for instance in physics, biology, engineering and
economics.
