9629081 Via A basic process generating biological diversity is speciation, when
populations of one species diverge and eventually become separate species. The
genetic changes that produce population divergence and speciation are poorly
known. The goal of this project is to determine the number and effects of genes
that influence divergence between populations of a single insect species, pea
aphid, that infests two host plants. Pea aphid populations on alfalfa and clover
are highly genetically divergent and significantly isolated due to habitat
choice, and so appear to be incipient species. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
influencing host plant choice and survival and fertility on each host plant will
be mapped on chromosomes using molecular linkage map analysis, as well as
biometrical analyses. Studying the genetic basis for speciation is fundamental
for understanding the generation of species biodiversity. It is also useful for
understanding how pests adapt to new hosts, and how much gene flow there can be
between related pest species.
