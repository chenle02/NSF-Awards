In this project, the researcher will analyze techniques for combining different
datasets. The general purpose of this research is to build on the distinct
strengths of the different datasets. Some datasets such as the Current
Population Survey (CPS) are particularly representative but may contain only
limited variables. Other datasets, such as the National Longitudinal Survey
(NLS) or the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) may be less representative
than the CPS but have the advantage of more detailed information. In addition,
datasets such as the NLS and PSID have information on the same units over longer
periods of time (panel data) rather than only once (cross-sections). Methods
will be developed, extending those previously developed in econometrics and
statistics, that allow combining such datasets. They will be connected to
standard methods such as weighting and interpreted in the context of missing
data problems. This research will lead to a better understanding of the links
between techniques used in econometrics, such as generalized method of moments
estimation, and techniques in statistics such as raking and weighting. These
methods will then be applied to artificial as well as real datasets to evaluate
their performance in a realistic setting.
