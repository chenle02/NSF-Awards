Abstract

Award: DMS-0707150 Principal Investigator: Todor Milanov

The long term goal of these projects is to understand the topology of moduli
spaces of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds in terms of the theory of
integrable systems. The first project aims to construct an integrable hierarchy
which governs the topology of the moduli spaces of degree d stable holomorphic
maps from a genus-g, nodal Riemann surface to a variety X which is assumed to be
a toric complete intersection. The topological information is encoded in a
formal power series called the total descendant potential of the toric variety,
and the goal is to show that this potential is a solution to an integrable
hierarchy. The second project in this research program is dedicated to an
interaction of integrable systems with symplectic field theory of a compact
Kaehler manifold Y, developing a potential related to the total descendant
potential described above. Relationships are expected to emerge between Gromov-
Witten invariants for Y and for a projective line bundle over Y, with the
relationships described via transformations of integrable systems.

Symplectic geometry is the structure underlying the Hamiltonian formalism of
classical mechanics, in which the behavior of a mechanical system is determined
by an energy-like function. Geometric spaces carrying such structures can be
high-dimensional and structurally complicated, and much recent work in the area
is devoted to exploring symplectic structures through associated spaces of well-
imbedded two-dimensional subsurfaces of them. Two-dimensional surfaces have been
studied for more than 150 years and our detailed understanding of them leads to
constraints upon the associated invariants of high-dimensional symplectic
manifolds. The principal investigator's work explores new constraints of this
kind that take the form of well-behaved differential equations, the integrable
systems of the proposal title.
