Intellectual Merit: What tactics and strategies do international missionaries
use in their outreach to deaf people and how do deaf missionary subjects
respond? What articulations are there between conversion to deaf sociality and
conversion to Christianity? The Fellow presents an ethnographic project that
explores the role of Christianity in deaf world in the United States and India,
critically asks questions about the black box of conversion, and analyzes impact
of what happens as (global) Christianity travels. This research will contribute
to the current literature that critiques the analytic boundaries of 'religious'
and 'secular.'

Broader Impacts: Currently there is little known about role of the church in
developing deaf communities. Results will contribute to social scientists'
knowledge of deaf people in the United States and India and will explore
possibilities and constraints existing in terms of sociality, education, and
participation within 'mainstream' society. The Fellow's research findings will
be relevant to both social scientists and to policymakers and service providers
working in the field of deaf human services. The Fellow intends to organize
coursework on deafness and disability and will attend academic and policy
oriented conferences to present research results.

Lastly, the Fellow will continue to serve as a mentor to disabled students
considering STEM fields. Deaf people are under-represented in STEM fields and
mainstream academic settings; therefore this project, by supporting a deaf
researcher, will increase participation in minority groups in STEM.
