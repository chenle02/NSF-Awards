The relative effects of history, dispersal and ecology on the community
structure of island systems of arboreal day geckos in the genus Phelsuma will be
investigated. Restriction enzyme analysis of mtDNA will be used to distinguish
between these effects. First, phylogeny of the genus will be compared with
biogeography and physical history. Second, maternal inheritance patterns of
mtDNA will be used to identify genotypes on recently emerged islands and
determine whether these genotypes evolved in situ or represent dispersal events.
This will provide a lower estimate of colonization rate. Third, maternal
inheritance patterns of mtDNA will again be exploited to reconstruct the
colonization history of the granitic Seychelles by P. sundbergi and P. astriata.
This information will be used to determine the influences founder effects and
ecological interactions have had in producing observed body size patterns.
Preliminary results indicate that the Seychelles were originally "colonized" by
two distantly related ancestors. The colonist leading to P. astriata was a close
relative to P. lineata; the colonist leading to P. sundbergi was close relative
to P. madagascariensis and P. abbotti. Further work will include basic
ecological studies, ecological comparisons with Anolis radiation, and
phylogenetic comparisons with other taxa.
