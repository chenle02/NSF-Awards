This project deals with the problems of nonlinear hysteretic structures
subjected to random earthquake excitations. The objective is to develop a modal
response spectrum procedure for the calculation of structural responses such as
member forces, deformation, and maximum ductility. Two approaches employing
stochastic linearization are used to analyze structures exhibiting hysteretic
force-deformation behavior. The approaches developed are iterative, employ the
modal analysis method of structual dynamics, and are able to provide response
quantities such as member forces, member ductility requirements, acceleration
response and floor response spectra. As a final product, the research provides
an analytical approach which should be of direct help to structural engineers in
their design evaluations of structures for the earthquake design loads.
