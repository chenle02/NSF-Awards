A new technique for measuring stellar distances using Oxygen lines in F type
supergiants is being developed by Professor Deane Peterson of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook. This award funds research to test the new
method on objects in M33, a member of our local group of galaxies. If
successful, the new technique promises an independent way to determine distances
to more distant galaxies, improving our knowledge of the value of the Hubble
constant and the age of the universe.
