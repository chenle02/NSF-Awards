This project examines the relation of positive and negative mood states to
people's ability and willingness to attend to and process negative information
about themselves. Most current theories of mood and cognition predict that
positive mood, relative to negative mood, makes people less likely to attend to
and process negative information. For example, many theories predict that people
are motivated to maintain good moods and so should avoid any information that
might jeopardize their good mood. If this is the case, the psychological
implications of positive mood are striking: what makes people feel good, also
makes them less likely to pay attention to potentially useful but negative
information. Failing to attend to negative information and to use it in related
judgments can have serious costs in contexts such as education, health, work,
and interpersonal relations. In contrast to recent findings, however, the PI has
found that positive mood and beliefs can increase one's attention to and more
effortful processing of negative information when the information is self-
relevant or important. This suggests that positive moods and beliefs may bolster
people's ability to attend to negative information, but little is understood
about this process. The current research includes nine experiments to test the
processes through which positive mood may facilitate attention to and use of
specific kinds of negative information in judgments. The goal of the research is
to increase understanding of the factors that affect people's willingness and
ability to confront negative information and to highlight the role of positive
feelings and beliefs in the management of negative events and information.
