The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development and commercialization of an automated system that safely provides
highly purified chemical reagents for researchers in laboratory settings.
Traditional purification methods such as chromatography and distillation consume
time, require experienced personnel, introduce hazards due to chemical exposure
and can cause lab accidents that may result in injuries or even fatalities. The
chemical purification system supported by this award eliminates these issues; it
is simple, safe, fast and economical. The technology improves upon already
available solvent purification systems by extending the use to reactive reagents
with special storage requirements. Research personnel working in academia,
government and corporate research environments will benefit from this technology
in terms of reduced costs, accelerated workflows, and increased safety.

This I-Corps project describes an innovative chemical purification system that
is safe, fast, economical, standalone and portable. The unit is a self-contained
refrigerated purification system comprised of specially designed stainless steel
packed columns in series with a reservoir tank holding inert-gas-purged
precursor. The innovative design of the chemical purification system enables
research personnel to purify chemicals to exacting standards by removing
impurities, air and moisture via a simple column cleaning process while limiting
exposure to harmful chemicals and preserving the shelf-life of sensitive
chemicals. Initial prototypes have been used over the past two years to produce
purified monomers for use with the anionic polymerization technique; the
resultant polymers have low polydispersity indices and on-target molecular
weights, confirming the monomer purity. Commercialization of this project will
improve the device by developing a more integrated and compact design,
broadening the application space to a wider variety of chemicals and adding
various automation features for improved ease of operation.
