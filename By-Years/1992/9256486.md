Professor Mark A. Ratner is supported by a grant from the Chemistry Division and
the Graduate Education and Research Division at NSF for a Graduate Traineeship
Program emphasizing the chemical aspects of molecule-based electronics. A team
of six Northwestern University chemistry faculty members with teaching and
research expertise in this and related areas will be assembled to provide
graduate training and mentoring as well as research program direction in this
area. To ensure the program leads to a net expansion of training within the
chemistry department, an aggressive recruitment plan emphasizing minority and
female students will be devised. Once recruited, the trainees will take part in
a rigorous program designed to provide: 1) courses pertinent to the central
themes of molecule-based electronics; 2) exposure to and interaction with
leading academic and industrial researchers from outside Northwestern
University; 3) research training within the laboratories of Northwestern
University faculty; and 4) experience in team-oriented, interdisciplinary
problem solving via collaborative research interactions. %%% Molecule-based
electronics is the use of molecular materials for electronic or photonic
applications. The scope of this field ranges from well-defined and well-
understood phenomena such as nonlinear optical response of a single crystal of
an organic chromophore to the more tantalizing and conceptually more difficult
areas involving optical computing and optical memory storage systems at the
molecular level. This interdisciplinary field encompasses not only chemistry,
but also physics, engineering and materials science. With the emergence of the
first commercial molecular electronic technologies, the need for U.S. trained
Ph.D. level scientists has become self-evident. Funding provided through this
Graduate Research Traineeship award will help to provide scientists in this area
of national need.
