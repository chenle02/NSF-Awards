The proposed project will focus on techniques and tools for high-
precision&lt;br/&gt;static and dynamic analyses of software. Current static
analyzers often&lt;br/&gt;suffer from a high spurious error ratio, while dynamic
analysis tools&lt;br/&gt;generally provide only partial coverage of program
executions. It will be&lt;br/&gt;studied how to build on techniques from program
abstraction, model&lt;br/&gt;checking, and theorem proving, to improve this
status quo. At its core, the&lt;br/&gt;proposal is to investigate the trade-off
between the quality of the&lt;br/&gt;analysis results, and the computational
effort needed to obtain them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact will be to
enable the creation of software that is more&lt;br/&gt;robust, with shorter
development times. In addition, it is expected that&lt;br/&gt;the research will
lead to a better scientific understanding of several core&lt;br/&gt;techniques.
A key component of the proposal is to build effective tools&lt;br/&gt;that
incorporate these research results. These tools will enable
the&lt;br/&gt;application of our research ideas to the NASA testbed, and
communicate them&lt;br/&gt;to the programming community at large. The research
results are also&lt;br/&gt;expected to be communicated to the research community
through conference&lt;br/&gt;and journal publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
