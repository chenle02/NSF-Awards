Oceanic core complexes (OCC) expose intrusive mafic rocks and lenses of mantle
ultramafic rock, that are controlled by long-lived detachment faulting within
the axial zone of a spreading center. The PI will analyze existing MCS OBS data
at Atlantis Massif and the structural insights gained from detailed analysis of
this oceanic core complex will allow her to compare it with other core
complexes. Based on consistencies between the sites, or lack thereof, she will
test current models of OCC formation and evolution. The existing seismic data at
Atlantis Massif will allow the PI to document fairly detailed structure (several
10's m vertical resolution) within the upper ~1.5 km and broader scale structure
(few-hundred meters vertical resolution) to lithospheric depths of 4-7 km. By
combining MCS and OBS refraction data, she will obtain a velocity model along a
grid of lines that cover each structural component of this OCC. The resulting
tomographic model will allow her to determine the extent and continuity of
likely mafic intrusive bodies, to characterize the transition between these
bodies and crust that has normal velocity-depth properties, and to compare the
signature of the domal core of the OCC to that of the adjacent hanging wall and
conjugate outside corner crust.

The project is large part for the support of a graduate student for the
completion of a Ph.D. thesis. It will also allow further development of the SOBE
processing system for MCS refraction analysis, a major community service, and it
may help in future drilling on the Atlantis Massif.
