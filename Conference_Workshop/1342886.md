This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar" that will be held from October 26-27,
2013, on the campus of the University of California-Davis.

This conference is the twenty-first installment of a series (WCOAS) that
annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary
research interests are in operator algebras and related topics. Among the topics
to be discussed by speakers at this year's meeting are the following:
classification of C*-algebras (the Elliott program); noncommutative geometry;
operator algebras in solid state physics; rigidity for actions of countable
groups on von Neumann algebras; free probability and its applications;
subfactors and their invariants; applications to geometric group theory;
topological dynamics; K-theory and representation theory; quantum groups. The
conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs,
and other young scientists to present their work.
