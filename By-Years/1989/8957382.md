Research will concentrate on nonequilibrium relaxation and transport processes
in semiconducting systems as measured through conventional transport techniques
(both current-voltage measurements and noise measurements) and optical
techniques. Research plans include extending calculations of the femtosecond
transient absorption to include the effects of the hole relaxation. Interest is
also taken in the femtosecond spectroscopy of organic molecules.
