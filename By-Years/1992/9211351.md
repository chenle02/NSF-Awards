This is a 1992 RIA Award. The object of this proposal is to develop basic
understanding of ferroelectric thin films and apply them to ULSI DRAM memory
cells. Specifically the research will investigate the three major limitations to
developing practical ferroelectric DRAM memory--namely, electrode materials,
thickness scaling and thin film reliability. The study will: (a) identify and
experimentally explore alternative electrode materials (e.g. Ru/RuO2 system)
which are suitable for the integration of ferroelectric capacitor with silicon
microelectronics process. (b) investigate and develop various techniques and
approaches to the scaling of ferroelectric film thickness (to &lt;&lt; 2000A)
while satisfying all the challenging requirements of ULSI DRAM dielectrics. (c)
develop better basic understanding and models of device degradation mechanisms
(e.g. fatigue, aging and time-dependent dielectric breakdown), and techniques
for improving thin film reliability. The results of the study should have
significant impact in successfully integrating ferroelectric thin films with
silicon processing.
