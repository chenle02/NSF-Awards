This project will analyze how cartilages, bones, and muscles develop in the
various stages of developing fish larvae and juveniles. Changes in the
proportions and relative sizes of the skeletal elements and muscles will result
in drastic changes in the respiratory and feeding abilities. Whether a
developing fish will survive these critical periods depends on the proper timing
and differentiation of functional systems which will be studied in this project.
It is known that there is an enormously high mortality of fish larvae during
critical developmental stages. These studies will elucidate the patterns and
mechanisms of development in fishes with free-living larvae and in live-bearing
fishes in which the larvae are protected from environmental hazards. By
comparing these two groups it will be possible to gain a precise knowledge of
the factors governing the development of fishes. Such a study is expected not
only to promote theoretical evolutionary knowledge, but also practical
applications in reducing or managing mortality of fish larvae.
