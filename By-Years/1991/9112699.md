Dr. Karplus proposes to investigate the structure and structure- function
relationships of two flavoenzymes: ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNR), which is an
FAD-dependent enzyme which produces NADPH during photosynthesis, and Old Yellow
Enzyme (OYE), an FMN- dependent NADPH oxidase of unknown physiological function.
The main methods to be used in these studies are single crystal x- ray
diffraction for structure determination combined with protein chemistry, for
purifying the individual enzymes, preparing relevant crystals and complexes, and
testing hypotheses based on the structures. The time is ripe for the study of
both of these enzymes as they have been cloned and expressed within the last
year, so that site-directed mutagenesis studies can be used to probe functional
aspects of the structure as revealed by crystallography. %%% The overall goal is
to elucidate the specific structural factors involved in catalysis for both of
these enzymes. The results will give significant insight into general features
of flavoprotein catalysis because FNR is the only structurally known NAD(P)
dependent dehydrogenase-electron transferase and OYE has a flavin environment
which is unique with respect to other characterized flavoenzymes.
