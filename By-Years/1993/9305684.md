9305684 Kreidenweis This study is aimed at development of an improved
understanding of the importance of clouds and cloud processes upon aerosol
transport and transformations on both the local and global scales. A two-
dimensional Eulerian cloud domain model study of the impact of deep convection
on tropospheric aerosol distribution and production, with particular attention
to the upper troposphere, will be performed. Descriptions of gas- and cloud-
phase chemistry will be coupled with mixed-phased quasi-explicit microphysics.
This new model of aerosol formation and evolution will be employed to study the
effects of chemistry and transport upon aerosol number and size concentrations.
From this initial work, a parameterization for use with the NCAR Community
Climate Model (CCM2) will be developed. Aerosol optical depths from the climate
model runs will then be compared with available satellite measurements, with a
particular view toward understanding the role of clouds in seasonal and
latitudinal variations on this property. This work will lead to improved
understanding of the magnitudes of cloud effects, and will assist in the
prediction of global effects that may occur due to changes in aerosol
distributions, anthropogenic emissions or in cloud type and amounts.
