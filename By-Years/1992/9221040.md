professor Richard Ernst of the University of Utah will conduct research on the
chemistry of metal-pentadienyl compounds with funding from the IBO program of
the Chemsitry Division. Titanium will be the primary metal center, with other
early-transition metal centers such as chromium and zirconium playing a
secondary role. Coupling reactions of the coordinated pentadienyl ligands with
unsaturated organic molecules can form organic rings, and they will be explored
extensively by Ernst. Ligands containing two conjugated pentadienyl fragments
(open fulvalenes) will also be studied for their ability to bind two metal
centers; paramagnetic derivatives of such dinuclear compounds will be of
interest because the conjugation should foster strong communication between the
two metal centers. %%% Atoms of titanium and other metals will be attached to
organic molecules containing five-membered carbon chains with two double bonds.
By modifying the organic molecules in this way they can react with other organic
molecules containing one double bond to form organic rings. Such ring-forming
reactions will be investigated in some detail because of their potential as
routes to complex organic products.
