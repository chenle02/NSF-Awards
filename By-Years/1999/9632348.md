9632348 BEARDSLEY Phase 1 of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies -
Georges Bank Program supported two years (1994-1996) of physical oceanographic
research employing moored arrays and drifter measurements. This project will
support a three-year (1997-1999) continuation of these measurements. Analyses
will be focused on (a) the physical processes related to stratification, forcing
(both surface and advective, e.g., a Slope Water intrusion) and spatial current
structure, (b) the effects of insolation, water properties, and mixing on
biological parameters, currents and the advection patterns of the zooplankton,
and (c) the identification of parameters for monitoring and making model
predictions of the biological conditions on Georges Bank. ***
