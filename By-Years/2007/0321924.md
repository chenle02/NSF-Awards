Abstract DEB-03219424/0317890&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to
Dr. Stephen Karl of University of South Florida and Stanley Rice of the
University of Tampa to uncover evolutionary relationships among global
populations of the polychaete worm, Polydora cornuta using DNA sequence data
from the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase c subunit I gene (COI). The
goal is to determine whether populations are genetically distinct (and therefore
may be separate species) or are in fact a single species with world-wide
distribution. Samples will be collected intensively around North America
(particularly the east coast) and from the Caribbean, Europe, South America,
Australia, and New Zealand. Once a global phylogeny of P. cornuta populations is
determined, the data can be used to develop of a model marine system for the
study of gene flow and speciation. Ultimately, the study will lead to a better
understanding of mechanisms of speciation in the sea and how reproductive
incompatibility, genetic divergence, and morphological variation are
interrelated. &lt;br/&gt;
