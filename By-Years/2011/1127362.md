The proposed research will strengthen the CdTe PV innovation ecosystem. CdTe PV
is now economically viable in many applications and suitable for gigawattscale
implementation. The project will utilize CSU's state-of-the-art deposition
system to pursue two separate routes to higher-efficiency manufacturing-friendly
cells: (1) higher voltage from a new device structure that employs a Cd1-xMgxTe
electron-reflector layer to reduce electron recombination, and (2) higher
current with a larger band-gap CdS layer achieved by the incorporation of plasma
activated oxygen species. The project will develop novel semiconductor alloys,
novel processing methods, novel defect-passivation approaches, and novel device
structures. At the same time, detailed understanding of the defects, interfaces,
and the device physics of the advanced devices will be developed.

The most significant broader impact is the production of clean energy globally
on an unprecedented scale. This will provide a major benefit for the U.S.
economy and will create thousands of well-paying jobs in the U.S. It builds on
the success of the CdTe PV industry, which now has the lowest cost-structure and
largest production of any U.S. PV technology. . It also builds on the
technology-transfer experience of the PI, co-founder of Abound Solar which has
grown to 370 employees with current manufacturing at 65 MW/Yr and a near term
target of 200 MW/Yr. This project will also provide well-trained students for
the photovoltaic industry, which is growing rapidly and requires a highly
skilled workforce. The PV-training approach at CSU is strongly team based:
students from different disciplines work closely with each other, with engineers
from industry, and in many cases with students at other universities.
