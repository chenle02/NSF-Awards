In upper-level courses students are introduced to advanced microscopy skills
such as phase and differential interference contrast and epifluorescent
microscopy, photomicrography and computerized video image analysis. Attention is
paid to the repeated use of the same principles to deal with problems in a wide-
ranging set of biology courses by each faculty member with emphasis on
quantification and investigative use of these microscopical tools.
