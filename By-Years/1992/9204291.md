Ravenel will investigate several questions in stable homotopy theory raised by
his counter-example to the telescope conjecture. He also has a program to
compute the complex cobordism of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and some ideas about
computing the cohomology of the Lambda algebra. Neisendorfer plans to pursue the
discovery of the fact that, up to completion, finite complexes may be recovered
from their connected covers. He also intends to investigate the preservation and
lack of preservation of homological finiteness in covering spaces. This project
is concerned with tools for reducing geometric information to a subject for
calculation. The nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the
problem. While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth
virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what
are known as topological properties of geometric objects. These are properties
such as connectedness (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes,
and so forth. All systematic study of such properties, for example, how to tell
whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to one of these
properties or are only superficially different, or how to classify the variety
of differences that can occur, all these have only truly been comprehended and
mastered when they have been reduced to matters of calculation. Modern algebra
furnishes many of the tools and the attitudes toward the tools that are needed,
and the interplay between the algebra and the topology remains a fascinating
subject.
