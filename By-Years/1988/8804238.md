The University of Alaska at Fairbanks is being supported by the Chemistry
Division and the Division of Instrumentation and Resources to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
and biochemistry for outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of
experienced research chemists. For the summer of 1988, the program will support
8 students recruited from the University of Alaska and other institutions.
Research activities will include the following areas: o Raman spectroscopy o
Atmospheric, environmental and analytical chemistry o Chemical ecology o
Petroleum and geochemistry o Bio-organic and marine chemistry o Chemical
anthropology and molecular evolution
