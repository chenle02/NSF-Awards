9311124 Schatzberg Dr. Schatzberg is illuminating the nature of technical change
by investigating the extent to which ideologies of progress influenced technical
choice. Ideologies can affect technical choice by shaping expectations of future
changes. Assessing the influence of ideologies of progress is only possible
through detailed case studies of technical change. Dr. Schatzberg is extending
his prior work on the role of ideology in the choice of airplane materials and
is applying it to two new case studies: one in electric traction and the other
in electric lighting. In the first study, he is examining the choice between
steam and electricity for streetcars when they were both reasonable options for
providing public transportation in and between cities. In the second study, he
is examining the choice between electric and gas lighting when Thomas Edison
first tried to convince cities to substitute electric for gas lighting. The case
studies test Dr. Schatzberg's hypothesis on the influence of ideology by
examining alternative explanations, based on structural factors, most
importantly the ability of the supplier firms to innovate. The case studies are
primarily American, but his analysis is supplemented by comparisons with
European technology. ***
