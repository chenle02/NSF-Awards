This project will investigate the following problems: (1) Determine explicit
bounds involving primitive roots and Artin's conjecture that are useful in the
analysis of several number-theoretic algorithms under the assumption of the
extended Riemann hypothesis. (2) Study two problems involving GCD algorithms.
The first is to design and implement genetic algorithms for the extended GCD
problem. The second is to analyze the left- and right- shift k- ary GCD
algorithms, including determining average-case behavior and studying the so-
called "spurious factors" introduce during the main loops of the algorithms. (3)
Design, analyze, and implement algorithms for computing the Jacobi symbol based
on Lehmer's Euclidean GCD algorithm. Undergraduate students will be involved in
this research, in particular in the design and implementation of algorithms in
the last two problems above. ***
