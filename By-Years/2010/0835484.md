This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal aims to elucidate the
impact of processing parameters on the performance of thin-film encapsulation
layers used in organic electronics, leading to new architectures with improved
performance. These films act as permeation barriers to prevent the exposure of
organic electronics to atmospheric water vapor and oxygen which are detrimental
to their performance. Vacuum deposition of thin-film barriers will be performed
using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), atomic layer deposition
(ALD), and combinations of the two techniques. Recent results have shown that
unique combinations of ALD and PECVD processing may yield ultrahigh barrier
films with submicron thickness and improved processing speeds. In this work, we
will explore the impact of processing temperature, plasma power and frequency,
and cycle times on the deposition of these thin film encapsulation layers. By
varying these parameters, it will be possible to control both barrier and
mechanical properties of the encapsulation films. Diffusion coefficients of the
films will be determined using quartz crystal microbalance testing while water
vapor transmission rates through the films will be determined using Ca corrosion
testing. Mechanical properties will be investigated using flexure testing,
nanoindentation, and atomic force microscopy. Microstructural analysis will be
performed using high resolution SEM and FIB microscopy.

If successful, this exploratory grant will yield a new architecture for
encapsulating organic electronics which is thinner and more mechanically robust
than state of the art encapsulation films. An understanding of the role of
processing parameters on thin film properties will provide a framework for
optimizing the encapsulation films of other compositions. Moreover, the combined
PECVD/ALD method will be tuned to provide ultrahigh barrier performance with
improvements in deposition rates which is necessary for future implementation in
mass manufacturing of flexible organic electronics.
