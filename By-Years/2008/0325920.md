This work is developing a patient specific simulation tool that combines medical
images and functional motion measurements to create a reliable biomechanical
model suitable for pre- and intraoperative simulation of a patient's knee
biomechanics after insertion of a implant. There currently exists no patient
specific biomechanics simulator, and patient outcomes and quality of life should
be improved through the ability to produce an ideal placement of medical devices
and grafts. The work involves development of a novel knee biomechanical
structure, based on parallel kinematic structures; automatic generation of
patient-specific geometric models of joint anatomy from magnetic resonance
images and deduction of soft-tissue information from motion capture data; and a
surgical planner to determine the performance of a desired implant location,
find the optimal placement of the implant, and simulate postoperative joint
performance.

The parallel kinematic description more faithfully represents the motion of a
knee, which undergoes complex twist motions that current techniques attempt to
model with simple revolute joints in a serial chain. Potential surgical outcomes
are then modeled by inserting implants into the parallel structure and
simulating the outcome, and optimizing the placement of the implant to maximally
improve the positive results of the procedure. In addition to the technical
achievements of this research, the broader outcome will include improved
surgical results and quality of life for patients undergoing knee implant and
graft procedures.
