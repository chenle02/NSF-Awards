A grant has been awarded to Dr. John Gatesy at the University of California,
Riverside to study the evolutionary history of Mysticeti (baleen whales), the
largest animals on earth. Evolutionary relationships among baleen whale are, at
present, unresolved. The proposed study combines the detailed analysis of poorly
understood fossil whale species, many of which were found in southern
California, with comprehensive genetic characterization of living mysticetes.
The diverse paleontological and molecular data will be used to examine how these
giant animals have evolved over the past thirty million years of earth
history.&lt;br/&gt; Whales have long captured the interest and attention of the
public. Therefore, an important objective of this study is education and public
outreach. Results from this grant will be used as a framework to interpret the
radical transformation from ancestral toothed whales to the more derived baleen-
bearing whales. This remarkable example of evolution will be incorporated into a
new exhibit planned at the San Diego Natural History Museum. In addition,
undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in all phases of the
research and will receive broad training in modern biological techniques.
Finally, most mysticetes are highly endangered, and several are on the brink of
extinction. The data collected in this study will offer critical information for
the conservation of baleen whales.&lt;br/&gt;
