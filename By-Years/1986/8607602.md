A new state-of-the-art 2.5kW power CO2 is purchased for conducting processing
research on a range of work materials. Processing methods for which this laser
would be used include welding, cutting, and surface treatment. Work materials
that can be processed include most metals, plastics, and advanced composite
materials including Kevlar composites. The laser will be used for fundamental
studies including the cause and supporssion of high-speed welding defects and
welding microstructure of rapidly solidified aluminum and titanium alloys.
