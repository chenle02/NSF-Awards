Synthesis, processing, and characterization of technologically important but
less developed AlGaP/GaP(As) on GaP and Si1-xCx alloys on Si will be conducted.
The co-PIs provide a strong interdisciplinary team with expertise in the key
areas of importance for this project: gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE),
heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT), and material characterization.
Hydride-source MBE shall be used for growing the phosphides, and laser- or
plasma-assisted gas-source MBE shall be used for growing the Si1-xCx alloys.
Characterization by structural, optical, and electrical measurements, including
HBT's, shall be used to evaluate the materials quality. The research aims to
achieve fundamental understanding of materials growth and processing, and to
contribute to the technology for large-bandgap semiconductors for high-
temperature, high-power and high-performance microelectronic circuits. %%% This
research is expected to advance the materials science in synthesis and
processing of wide-bandgap materials based on phosphides and silicon. They are
suitable for applications in high-temperature microelectronics for operation in
adverse environments, such as in engines; in high-power microelectronic circuits
for diverse realms of applications; and in Si-based high-speed transistors with
wide-bandgap emitters.
