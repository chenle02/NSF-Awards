A Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is established at the
Combustion/Fluid Dynamics laboratory in the Department of Aerospace Engineering,
Mechanics and Engineering Science at the University of Florida. Eight projects,
at a level of complexity appropriate for undergraduate students and for a
duration of ten weeks, have been identified. All these individual projects
constitute components of an ongoing research program in the area of high speed,
chemically reacting flows. The undergraduates participating in this program will
have access to the extensive facilities and instrumentation available in the
laboratory and to other support facilities. They will continuously interact with
each other and with the graduate students involved in the same research program.
They will be advised by three faculty members who are currently coordinating
this research. The undergraduate students will be recruited primarily from the
University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez and Florida A&M, both minority
institutions.
