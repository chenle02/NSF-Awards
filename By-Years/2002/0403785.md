The objective of this research is to fabricate nanoscale devices and structures
at time scales, size scales and yields which significantly outpace current
methodologies based on photolithography. The approach comprises the use of
particle beams to pattern functional nanoparticle building blocks of metals,
semiconductors and insulators at very rapid time scales. The goal of ultrafast
nanoscale fabrication is to bring about a significant impact on the complexity
per unit cost at which nanoscale devices may be fabricated enabling, for
example, significantly more powerful processing elements and higher density
memories than those anticipated to be enabled by conventional means. Ultrafast
nanoscale fabrication may also serve as a useful tool for the rapid prototyping
of nanoscale devices and structures allowing a broad cross section of people to
rapidly and inexpensively try out ideas at the nanoscale.
