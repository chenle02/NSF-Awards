This planning grant under the Research Opportunities for Women program will
assist the Principal Investigator, whose experience has been in instrumentation
for high energy physics, in switching her research activities into infrared
astronomy. She will begin the design of an infrared array camera for the 1.3
meter and 2.4 meter telescopes, operated jointly by Michigan, Dartmouth, and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The camera, operating in the 1-2.5
micron region, would be used to study very low mass stars, to search for
galaxies in the process of formation, and to study the nuclei of active
galaxies.
