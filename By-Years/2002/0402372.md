&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project focuses on a major, unanswered
question in biology: Why are so many plants polyploid? The prevalence of
polyploidy in plants and its rarity in animals represent a fundamental genomic
distinction between these kingdoms. Genomic sequences for representatives of
each of two major angiosperm branches (dicots: Arabidopsis and monocots: Oryza),
together with new information from other taxa, provide new opportunities to
examine the evolutionary significance of polyploidy and its abundance in
angiosperms. An anticipated new synthesis about the role of polyploidy in
evolution is expected to be generally relevant both to angiosperms and ancient
polyploids in other kingdoms such as fungi and animals. Goals in this planning
project are the assembly of a multidisciplinary team and the development of a
comprehensive research plan. These goals are being pursued through a series of
smaller meetings followed by a workshop. These meetings will enable participants
to explore computational methods for inferring the antiquity of specific
polyploidization events; the feasibility of linking resulting computational
inferences to paleobotanical and paleoclimatological data; and wet-lab
approaches to test new hypotheses about polyploidization in an array of taxa
across the plant family tree. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This
planning project includes the development of plans for opportunities to
participate in cutting-edge integrative biology research opportunities at both
pre- and postgraduate levels. This will be coupled with ongoing ties to strong
outreach programs designed to effectively engage under-represented groups in the
project. Additionally, plans will be developed for enhancing the research and
education infrastructure by Web-based dissemination of deliverables valuable to
a diverse clientele. Such materials are being developed through partnerships
with unique programs at the participating institutions and by forging links
among these programs. For example, through an NSF GK-12 program at UGA project
participants will contribute actively to the development and implementation of
new research-based educational materials. Together with ten GK-12 graduate
students and an associated statewide network of high-school teachers, project
participants are exploring metaphorical examples and dialogue by which to
portray key scientific concepts. Materials will be developed for broad
dissemination to enhance public understanding of science, both directly and via
museums (such as the FL Museum of Natural History, with which three participants
are associated), nature centers, and similar institutions. &lt;br/&gt;
