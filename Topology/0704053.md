The main theme of this project is the application of Heegaard Floer homology and
gauge theory for problems in low-dimensional topology and knot theory. New
surgery formulas in Heegaard Floer homology allow the PI to study applications
for surgery problems in three-manifolds, and surgery characterization for
knots.In a different direction Floer homology is used to investigate unknotting
numbers for knots in the 3-sphere. The project includes foundational problems
for knot Floer homology and the study of combinatorial techniques as well. In a
different direction, gauge theoretical techniquesare used in the search for
small exotic 4-manifolds.

The project studies three and four dimensional spaces and some central problems
in knot theory and low dimensional Topology. One of the main tools is a
relatively new theory called Heegaard Floer homology. This theory has close ties
to gauge theoretical invariants that originated from interactions between
Mathematics and Mathematical Physics. It is expected that advances in Heegaard
Floer homology will lead to a better understanding of these gauge theoretical
invariants as well. Another integral part of the project is the study of
unknotting numbers for knots. While this is a classical invariant in knot
theory, the unknotting process is also relevant in the study of knotted DNA. A
way to measure the complexity is to study how many times the strand has to be
cut by an enzyme and recombine itself to be unknotted.
