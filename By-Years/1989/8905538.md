The project's main goal is to study relationships between the topology of real
algebraic varieties and algebro-geometric properties of these varieties. It is
divided into the following areas of research: (1) regular mappings (i.e. real
algebraic morphisms) and polynomial mappings, (2) algebraic homology and
cohomology of real algebraic varieties, (3) comparison between algebraic and
topological K-theory of real algebraic varieties. Methods to be applied are the
combinations of various techniques of algebraic and differential topology, and
algebraic geometry. As opposed to the more common investigations of algebraic
varieties over the complex numbers or another algebraically closed field, real
algebraic geometry has a more vivid visual appeal and a much less highly
developed and satisfactory theory. On the other hand, applications of real
geometry may be more natural, for example, applications to the motion of robot
arms, where the appropriate interpretation of imaginary coordinate values is
ordinarily that the corresponding positions cannot be attained.
