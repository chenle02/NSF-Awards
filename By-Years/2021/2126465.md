Surfactant replacement therapies rely on plugs of liquid to carry drugs into the
lungs and treat respiratory distress syndrome. The administered liquid plugs
travel through airways lined with mucus, a gel that traps inhaled contaminants.
The deposition of liquid in the airways is often held responsible for
therapeutic failures, yet the influence of the mucus lining on drug delivery
remains to be understood. This NSF-CASIS project will conduct experiments
onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and on Earth to establish the role
of a gel lining in the transport of a liquid plug. The team will examine and
explain how the gel's mechanical properties affect the liquid delivery in
gravity and microgravity conditions to study the different plug dynamics at high
resolution. This project will provide a unique opportunity to train and
encourage students and community members to think about biological systems as a
source of inspiration for engineering design, in part through ongoing
collaborations with the Santa Barbara Zoo and the City of Riverside's Ameal
Moore Nature Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a
comprehensive understanding of free and forced liquid imbibition through gel-
coated tubes. The project will investigate how dissipation in the viscoelastic
gel at the moving contact lines influences (i) the macroscopic rate of transport
of the plug and (ii) the fluid deposition at its trailing edge. The project
accomplishes these goals with a combination of extensive experimental and
theoretical investigations. The research team will use a model system consisting
of a transparent tube lined with a clear gel to image the motion of the liquid
and the deformation of the gel. Onboard the ISS, the liquid will spontaneously
imbibe the gel-coated tube due to capillarity, while in Earth experiments,
gravity will drive its motion in addition to capillary wicking. The team will
then develop predictive models for the transport of liquid plugs in small and
large ducts, accounting for both the local viscoelastic dissipation in the gel
at the moving contact lines and the global viscous dissipation in the viscous
fluid plug. This work will provide new insights into the delivery of drugs in
the lungs to support improved treatment strategies; the results may also lead to
engineering solutions for intermittent flows in pipes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
