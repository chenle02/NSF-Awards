9424551 Pickett This proposal seeks funding to partially support the 6th Cary
Conference on, "Enhancing the ecological basis for conservation: heterogeneity,
ecosystem function, and biodiversity," to be held 9-11 May, 1995. The conference
will focus on the synthesis and future development of the ecological foundation
of conservation practice. The general goals of the conference are to (1)
evaluate a theoretical framework for conservation biology that addresses the
emerging focus on species networks and entire ecosystems, (2) explore the
linkages of the non-equilibrium paradigm of ecology with the practice of
conservation, and (3) expose the findings of the conference to a larger audience
for evaluation, modification, and application. As with previous conferences, the
emphasis of this meeting will be on discussion and examination of fundamental
issues in ecology and their application. The results of the conference will be
published This conference is an important, timely, and cost-effective forum for
discussion and dissemination of information on the ecological underpinnings of
conservation biology.
