Lynn Riddiford #IBN 9419957 Proposed are studies to elucidate the role of the
nuclear 29kDa protein that specifically binds juvenile hormone (jp29) in the
regulation of larval molting and metamorphosis. Studies on the tobacco hornworm,
Manduca sexta, will concentrate on three aspects: 1) isolation of other nuclear
protein(s) with which jp29 may interact and their subsequent cloning and
sequencing to elucidate their function, 2) immunocytochemcial localization
within the nucleus, and 3) developmental and endocrine regulation of jp29. We
also plan to isolate the homologous gene from Drosophila containing the Manduca
jp29 cDNA under the control of a heat shock promoter will be used to determine
the effects of over-expression of this protein on development, reproduction, and
JH esterase production in the presence and absence of JH. Also,
immunocytochemical studies will concentrate on its developmental and endocrine
regulation in various tissues. This study in the two insects should help
elucidate the molecular mode of action of JH in directing metamorphosis and
whether jp29 has a functional role in adult responses to JH. ***
