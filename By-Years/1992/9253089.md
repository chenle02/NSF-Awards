This project will provide funds for the expanded dissemination of innovative
developments in engineering curricula by increasing publicity activities and
providing travel grants to principal investigators on 17 NSF sponsored projects
who will present their results in special sessions of the Frontiers in Education
conference. The conference has become one of the premier vehicles for the
communication of new methodologies in engineering education and the project will
accelerate the dissemination of new results and also increase awareness of the
NSF programs devoted to course and curriculum to curriculum development.
