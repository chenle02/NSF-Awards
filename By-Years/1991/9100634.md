This project will bring 6 undergraduate students to the Ohio Supercomputer
Center for 10 weeks during the Summer of 1991 to work on problems in
computational fluid dynamics, flow visualization, grid generation, and numerical
solution of PDEs. Half of the positions are committed to minorities selected
form colleges and universities located in the northeastern United States. The
students will receive three weeks of instruction in the use of supercomputers
followed by 7 weeks of in-depth research on an appropriate project.
