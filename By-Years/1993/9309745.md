Technology Transfer is difficult to measure in an industry/university
environment. This difficulty appears to be due to causes. The first is that
there have been almost no studies within organized technology-based research
ventures that have sufficient data points to make them generalizable. The second
is because there is a dearth of tools for assessing transfer of technology and
information in inter-disciplinary cooperation research programs. This proposal
will address these problems by: 1) holding an Invitational Technology Transfer
Assessment Consensus Conference to develop the assessment instruments for a
study, 2) study Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) using
the recommended instruments for possible use in the I/UCRC, Evaluation Program.
The Principal Investigator is a noted evaluation researcher studying technology
transfer and has the experience necessary for this study. The Program Manager
recommends Dr. Craig Scott be awarded $54,548 for one year for this project.
