9304622 Mao Recent experimental advances in high-pressure technology have
provided the ability to simulate the P-T conditions of the entire Earth in the
laboratory. This award is for continued support of a systematic study of the
equations of state and elasticity of Earth materials with diamond-anvil cells.
The PIs will use synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques to determine lattice
parameters and molar volume, and to use Brillouin spectroscopy to determine
compressional and shear wave velocities, both at high P and T. With recently
established experimental techniques, they will systematically acquire a
comprehensive and accurate database representative of realistic Earth
compositional models. ***
