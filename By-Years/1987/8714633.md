Potable water disinfection is accomplished primarily through various
chlorination processes. Several problems such as the production of toxic
byproducts, lack of stability toxic gas leaks, and corrosion of distribution
systems can result from these procedures. Recent research has indicated the
potential for using organic N-halamines as general purpose disinfectants. These
compounds are formed by the addition of chlorine, bromine, or chlorine and
bromine to either oxazolidinone or imidazolidinone rings. As a group these
compounds exhibit numerous characteristics desirable in a disinfectant including
stability in solid and aqueous forms; limited reactivity with organic impurities
in water; and effectiveness against a variety of bacteria, protozoans, fungi,
and viruses. They are noncorrosive and nontoxic. The organic N-halamines have
the potential to be more effective disinfectants than many of the chlorination
procedures currently used. The proposed project will test the disinfectant
potential of three organic N-halamines; a chlorinated compound (agent A), a
brominated compound (agent AB), and a chloro-brominated compound (agent ABC).
Following synthesis of the compounds, aqueous solutions will be tested for
bactericidal activity under different concentrations, pHs, temperatures, and
organic loads. The compounds will be tested against Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonos aeruginosa, and Streptococcus faecalis. These organisms were chosen
based on their resistance to antimicrobial agents, their potential health
hazards, and/or as indicators of fecal pollution. Award is recommended as a
standard grant for two years in the amount of $82,018 to be in two increments,
the initial one of which will be $11,812 (FY 87). The remainder is recommended
to be made as a unilateral action by NSF in FY 1988.//
