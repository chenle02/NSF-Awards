This research project will employ a fundamentally new approach to optical remote
sensing of atmospheric haze, using both hyperspectral and multispectral imaging
techniques. The scientific objective is to measure for the first time the
combined angular and spectral properties of tropospheric haze at visible
wavelengths. Because no such measured angular distributions of haze spectra
exists, these datasets will constitute an entirely new tool with which to vet
atmospheric radiative transfer models. A second scientific objective is to
analyze the range of haze's colorimetric and photometric properties, important
visual measures that are little better understood than its spectral
ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is twofold.
First, it will permit a systematic analysis of haze optical properties that is
now impossible, mapping actual distributions of tropospheric haze spectra as
functions of sun elevation, scattering angle, and haze aerosol optical depth.
Second, the research will provide independent tests of the colorimetric,
photometric, and spectral accuracies of multispectral imaging systems based on
RGB digital cameras. When acquired through a linear polarizer, hyperspectral
data also can be used to independently test existing multispectral techniques
for mapping haze polarization. Spectral measurements of haze polarization are
rare, and data obtained in this study will be
unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond advancing atmospheric science itself, the
research will (1) benefit science education and (2) have broader impacts on the
general public. On point (1) digital imaging techniques will be used both in
daily classroom instruction and in year-long honors research projects for Naval
Academy midshipmen. On point (2), better understanding the angular and spectral
distribution of haze has practical applications in such areas as improving
visibility for drivers, pilots, and sailors, estimating object distances from
single outdoor images, and providing new ways to measure air pollution
properties.
