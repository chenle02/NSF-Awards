The Phase I effort has demonstrated that holographic windows for daylighting is
a viable and valuable technology. The holograms effectively and efficiently
diffract sunlight. The Phase I effort, as expected, uncovered several problem
areas requiring additional research. In particular, to optimize the
effectiveness of the holograms, high quality gelatin films of uniform and
controlled thickness must be prepared. Commercially available films may be used
for demonstration, but are not optimum. The chromatic problem was addressed by
overlapping patterns from adjacent holograms and this area needs some further
work. An invention under the contract using a film with imbedded mirror elements
shows promise of deploying an inverted spectrum to mix with the direct spectrum.
Other research areas for the Phase II effort were anticipated, namely those
associated with scale up to a full size room illumination demonstration. The
research will focus on both the fabrication of large holograms and the
measurements of total room illumination.
