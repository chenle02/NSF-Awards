This project is to continue the development of implantable force transducers to
measure the load on tendons for up to three weeks. The experimental work will be
supplemented by a mathematical model to account for the interactions between the
transducer and the tissue; the model should be helpful in the calibration of the
transducers. The work, if successful, will aid the understanding of the long
term behavior of tendons, and may lead to the more scientific design of tissue
substitutes.
