This project is concerned with the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture in the modular
representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups. The principal
investigators will make use of quasi-hereditary algebras and highest weight
categories in attacking this problem. Questions involving representations of
finite groups and Lie algebras will also be considered. The central problem to
be considered in this project is the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture which states
that certain invariants attached to an algebraic group can be calculated from
polynomials. This is a difficult and central problem in group theory. It also
has implications in other areas of mathematics.
