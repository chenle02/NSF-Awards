9553348 Dimmock The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), Auburn University
(AU), The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and Alabama A&amp;M
University (AAMU) have teamed to create the Alabama Consortium for Optical
Technology (ALCOT) to develop optoelectronic materials and devices critical to
imaging,display, and energy conversion technologies. The consortium's objectives
are to significantly improve Alabama's research and educational infrastructure
and develop optoelectronic enabling technologies for application in commercially
important devices. By combining the resources of the consortium, we will be able
to significantly enhance the development of optoelectronic materials and devices
in the state of Alabama. Research to be performed by the consortium will address
a number of key optoelectronic technologies toward the development of
demonstration devices. These include: (1) Two- and three- dimensional liquid
crystal flat panel displays on the surface of VLSI chips for ultra-high
resolution projection systems, high definition television, head-mounted
displays, medical imaging, and virtual reality systems. (2) High resolution,
broad spectrum optical 3-D imaging for safe, noninvasive interferometric
measurement of biological tissues. This has application to skin cancer
detection, detection and characterization of coronary artery disease, endoscopic
optical biopsies, periodontal diagnosis of the level of bone attachment to
dental implants, and as a safe alternative to radiographic mammography. (3)
Optoelectronic materials development, patterning, and characterization directed
toward the development of enhanced photovoltaic devices to power earth- and
space-based systems. (4) Development of novel heterostructure photodiodes and
broadband photodetectors b ased on quantum size effects. The combined
multilayered optical device fabrication capabilities at UAH and AU, the ion beam
tailoring capability of AAMU, and the diagnostic and modeling capabilities at
UAB will be used to sup- port these efforts.
