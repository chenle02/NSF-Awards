This project will develop a social intelligence capability for computers, for
use in educational software applications. Social intelligence plays a critical
role in human tutoring and teaching. By modeling social intelligence in software
it should be possible to create educational software that is aware of the
learners' attitudes, that interacts harmoniously and responds to learner needs,
that is able to develop rapport with learners, and that uses responsiveness and
rapport to influence learner motivation. This could be &lt;br/&gt;particularly
valuable for learners who have motivational problems such as low self-
confidence. The social intelligence model will be realized in an animated
pedagogical agent, that uses a combination of speech and nonverbal gestures,
that can express emotions and attitudes, and that reacts to and adapts to
learners over time. It will respond to a variety of learner inputs, including
learner performance on assigned problems, conversational dialog, and eye gaze
and facial expressions recognized using computer vision techniques. The model
will be applied in the context of the Virtual Factory Teaching System, a
simulation-based learning system for teaching industrial engineering
&lt;br/&gt;concepts. The effectiveness of the model will be tested by comparing
learner performance with and without the assistance of a socially intelligent
agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
