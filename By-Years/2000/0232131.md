This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to reduce
the cost of fuel cell electrodes by preparing a novel class of oxygen reduction
electrocatalysts featuring high activity, low cost, and greater longevity. The
basis of this catalyst is a novel multimetallic catalyst. The result of this
effort will be an electrocatalyst suitable for use in the fuel cells envisoned
for next generation vehicles (NGVs), as well as fixed fuel cells for commercial
power generation.

This research will advance the understanding of electrocatalysis, extending the
world of known catalytic materials, and providing further opportunities for
research. This will also provide opportunities for teaching, training, and
learning. Additionally, the technological fruits of the project will benefit
society by reducing pollution from fossil fuel sources. Finally, society will
benefit economically from the elimination of costly platinum from fuel cells.
