The philosophy driving this mathematics research project is to approach the
study of knots from a data-driven perspective. The project aims to employ
powerful computational techniques to calculate invariants on a large scale, make
these algorithms and their output available to the community, and use
computational resources to empirically arrive at and test conjectures. The
investigators plan to develop new algorithms that will expand existing databases
of knot invariants and may lead to resolving old open problems, thus also
broadening the potential for applications throughout the sciences, from
molecular biology to quantum physics. Mathematical tools for studying knots
generally fall into two categories: geometric and algebraic. The project will
rely on large-scale computations to analyze connections between these two points
of view, harnessing the data collected to attack questions that have so far
remained intractable. In addition, the project intends to make deep questions in
the field accessible to students by developing new combinatorial and exploratory
techniques. The investigators will actively engage students in impactful
research, directly addressing known pipeline gaps in the field of mathematics.

The research goals of this project include: (1) approaching the meridional rank
conjecture from a computational perspective, with the aim of verifying the
conjecture for all tabulated knots and extracting theoretical results from these
empirical findings; (2) designing an efficient algorithm to compute bridge
numbers for large classes of knots by combining techniques for finding lower and
upper bounds for these numbers from knot diagrams; (3) computing homotopy ribbon
obstructions for slice knots using Kjuchukova's invariants and developing
algorithms to test potential counterexamples to the slice-ribbon conjecture; (4)
constructing four-manifolds as branched covers of the sphere with knots as
singularities on the branching sets; classifying these branched covers and
studying, with the help of trisections, the smooth structures on the four-
manifolds constructed.
