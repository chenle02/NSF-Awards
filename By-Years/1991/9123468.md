Direct manipulation user interfaces are difficult to build. User Interface
Management Systems (UIMS) have attempted to alleviate this problem by providing
models of the interactive dialog which can drive the interface implementation.
Such models, however, have failed to directly express the changes of information
which comprise most operations in direct manipulation interfaces. A data pattern
and transformation language based on matching will be developed as a model of
such additional processes. Techniques will be developed for using this language
as a user interface design tool. These techniques will include approaches for
visually expressing the patterns and transformations interactively. This data
transformation language can then be used for creating visualization of data.
Such a language can express attribute modifications, style sheets, critics
(which monitor and advise users) and searches. Unifying the interaction in such
a transformation language provides a foundation for more intelligent tools to
reason about the behavior of the interface.
