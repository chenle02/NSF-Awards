9415511 Levander This grant is to provide partial support for a three-day
workshop entitled "Investigations of Lithosphere Architecture and Development"
jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of
Scientific Research, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Incorporated Research
Institutes in Seismology (IRIS). It will be held in November 1994, in Taos, New
Mexico. The workshop goal is to develop a community organization which will 1)
formulate a science implementation plan for new and innovative study of the
continental lithosphere and that complements and supports the technical plan for
seismic instrumentation developed by IRIS, 2) provide a community forum for
exchange of scientific ideas and experiment design, 3) encourage scientific
collaborations within the community, 4) provide community-wide scientific
consensus on instrumentation needs for lithospheric seismology. ***
