An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) will be purchased to conduct dedicated
experimental research in three areas: (1) nanometer- scale measurement of
temperature and properties of thin solid films and nano-structures; (2)
nanometer-scale measurement of mechanical properties and frictional forces for
fiber-matrix interfaces in composite materials; and (3) fabrication of
nanometer-scale solid structures for solid state devices and sensors. Arizona
State University will provide 50% of the instrument cost.
