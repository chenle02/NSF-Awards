9414293 Galloway Recent modeling studies indicate that anthropogenic and natural
aerosols impact climate through direct (radiation absorption and scattering) and
indirect (cloud albedo, frequency, and extent) effects. Scavenging and removal
by precipitation are the principal sinks for radiatively important aerosols. To
develop a predictive capability for the influence of aerosols on climate, the
deposition flux of non-sea salt (nns) SO4 =, black carbon, and mineral aerosol,
and the corresponding influences on optical characteristics of the scavenged air
parcel must be quantified over space and time. As part of Theme 2 of the
Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE), Phase III, the University of
Virginia 1) measure the chemical composition of precipitation at Bermuda and
Barbados; 2) measure, as a function of wavelength, the optical extinction
coefficient for insoluble aerosol scavenged by precipitation at the two site; 3)
quantify the influence of scavenging and removal by precipitation on the aerosol
burden and associated radiative properties of S, N, C, and mineral aerosol over
the western North Atlantic Ocean; and 4) provide data for the chemical
composition of precipitation to evaluate and refine atmospheric model
calculations proposed under AEROCE and as ancillary studies to the program.
