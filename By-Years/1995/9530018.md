This workshop, organized by the Dr. Robert Naiman, of the Center for Streamside
Studies, University of Washington, in collaboration with Dr. Kevin Rogers, of
the Center for Water in the Environment, University of the Witwatersrand,
Johannesburg, South Africa, brings together scientists from the U.S., France,
UK, South Africa, and other countries in Southern Africa, from a range of
disciplines, to examine the environmental factors creating and maintaining the
characteristics of riparian corridors in Southern Africa. The expected outcomes
are a comparison of the state of knowledge about riparian corridors in temperate
and subtropical regions, and a statement of priority research directions,
especially for Southern Africa. The workshop will include active researchers and
graduate students from the biological, geological, and social sciences, as well
as policy makers and resource managers. Five South African universities are
represented, including two historically-disadvantaged institutions. The African
participants come from five different countries: South Africa, Malawi,
Mozambique, Botswana, and Namibia The structure and function of riparian
corridors and the human impact on these systems is an important issue for
Southern Africa, where over 60 percent of the population lives within one
kilometer of surface water. This workshop on this important theme can help to
strengthen collaborative linkages internationally (between US and Southern
African scientists), regionally (between So. African scientists and their
counterparts in neighboring countries), between historically white and
historically black institutions in South Africa, across disciplinary boundaries,
and, it is to be hoped, between researchers and policy makers.
