Modifications of DNA without any change to the sequence of genes known as
epigenetic effects, play important roles in gene expression and allow an
organism to adapt to its environment. In the nervous system these non-coding
changes to DNA, such as addition of a methyl group, can affect behavior and
learning. In the honey bee it was found that aggressive behavior shows a
paternal effect, suggesting that some genes inherited from the father are
expressed at a different level than genes that are inherited from the mother
possibly due to modifications of the DNA. It has been theorized that parent-of-
origin effects on gene expression may be more common in social insects because
families have one mother and many fathers, and these effects may play a role in
many social behaviors in honey bees. This project will use sequencing of gene
products in families of bees from specific genetic crosses to determine which
honey bee genes have expression that is influenced by whether they are inherited
from the mother or the father. The results will aid in the identification of
genes that influence specific behaviors such as aggression and provide a better
understanding of epigenetic processes in animals. Honey bees are important
pollinators for our food crops and a greater understanding of honey bee behavior
is important to apiculture. Additionally this project will train a postdoctoral
researcher, undergraduate and graduate students in cutting edge genetic
techniques thus producing future researchers for this important beneficial
insect. Information will also be provided to the public through websites and the
popular press.
