This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on
designing a series of extremely efficient metal extraction products (MEPs) with
tailor-made properties for specifically extracting and purifying platinum group
metal (PGM) anions from acid solutions. Existing PGM recovery and separation
methods are complex and expensive. The Phase II project will fully develop the
separation and purification of PGMs, scale up the MEP synthesis and expand the
scope of the work to launch the technology into PGM recycling market.
&lt;br/&gt; These novel MEPs will have wide applications in the precious metal
refining as well as recycling industries. It is estimated that the total value
of precious metal catalysts in spent automobile catalytic reactors in the United
States alone is $ 800 million a year. Additionally, these MEPs could also be
used in the separation and purification of actinides, such as plutonium, and in
the pre-concentration of trace amounts of anions (e.g. chromate, arsenate) to
aid in environmental analysis. Modifications of the structure may also lead to
the production of highly specific environmental sensors for the in-situ
detection of contaminants in groundwater and other aqueous streams. &lt;br/&gt;
