9722128 Bodenschatz In order to measure important parameters of fully developed
turbulent flow, a novel particle tracking system will be developed and used.
This system is based on the technology developed for the analysis of high energy
particle collision data. This research will contribute significantly to our
understanding of turbulence, and will provide data for comparison with
theoretical predictions. This grant is supported jointly be the Division of
Physics, the Division of Materials Research, and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA) of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS).
