The overall objective of this proposal is to establish that a fast and
efficient constrained Molecular Dynamics (MD) algorithm developed by us recently
(called the Newton-Euler Inverse Mass Operator, NEIMO) can serve as a powerful
tool for understanding the long term conformational and structural changes in
large proteins and enzymes. Such a tool could be used to characterize the
interdomain motions in molecules and would considerably enhance the
understanding of structure and activity relationships.
