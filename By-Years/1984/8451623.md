There are a number of important unit operations in manufacturing to which it is
difficult to apply feedback control. They include pressbrake and tube bending,
workpiece straightening, sheet rolling, upset forging, die casting and polymer
processing. The research will investigate these operations with a view to making
control possible. Mathematical models that are simple enough to permit fast
(real time) computations, but complex enough to predict the effects of
importance, will be developed. Parameters such as material properties, geometry
and tool/workpiece friction will be measured, and new methods for sensing these
parameters will be developed.
