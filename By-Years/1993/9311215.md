9311215 Wickert In this project a laser interferometry system is developed for
conducting experimental research in the areas of vibration, acoustics and
dynamics. Specific projects include the dynamics of axially moving materials and
devices such as high speed magnetic and magneto-optical tapes, and power
transmission chairs and belts. Also, the dynamics of micromechanical structures
is investigated to identify the vibration issues that become significant when
mechanical structures are significantly down- sized, for instance, through
silicon micro-machining techniques. Characterizing the dynamics of such systems
is generally challenging since the fundamental vibration frequencies can be
extremely high, with the vibration amplitudes being in the sub- micron range.
The interferometer used in the project has a laser spot size between 10 and 100
pem, a bandwidth of a least 500 khz; and a resolution that is variable between
0.008 pem and 20 pem for displacement measurements, and between 0.5 pem/sec and
10 pem/sec for velocity measurements. The system provides a reliable vehicle for
obtaining fundamental understanding of micro- mechanical structural dynamics.
