This project evaluates the potential of using neural network computations for
solving certain signal processing problems. Basic issues such as feasibility,
robustness, and computability are addressed with the major goal being to lay
theoretical and algorithmic foundations for the use of neural processing
techniques. Guidance and comparisons with classical approximation theory and
modern data analysis and machine learning theory are sought. Preliminary studies
indicate the need for enormous computational resources to compute mature
networks for solving nonlinear prediction problems and nontrivial
classifications. High performance parallel algorithms for computing and
evaluating mature neural nets are developed and implemented on the CEDAR
multiprocessor at the University of Illinois. This is a timely work on the
theoretical analysis of neural networks. The principal investigator is a capable
researcher and the award is strongly recommended.
