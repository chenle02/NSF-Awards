Funds were requested for a flame/furnace atomic absorption spectrometer and
microwave sample digestion system to be used by both Florida Institute of
Technology and Brevard Community College. It was located in a new Center for
Chemical Instrumentation, a modern 4000 square foot laboratory complex jointly
managed by FIT and BCC. At FIT it was used by undergraduates in several courses
offered in the Chemistry Department. At BCC it was used by students in an
innovative new Instrument Technician program. Because instrument based
analytical chemistry is critical to the nation's high technology industries, the
demand for skilled analytical chemists and instrument technicians is expected to
remain high for many years. The equipment of this proposal was used to help
educate and train those chemists and technicians.
