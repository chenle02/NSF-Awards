9730878 Abstract Hydrothermal vent communities are characterized by the use of
geothermal energy to drive the primary production of organic carbon. The vent
communities originated earlier than the Silurian, at least 430 million years
ago. Because of the largely local production of food, the organisms are
independent of surface produced organic carbon. One genus, the polychaete
Alvinella, is found at modern vents and apparently has been a member of this
community since the beginning. The members of this genus are characterized by a
living habitat in close proximity to black smoker effulent which is exposed to
extremely high temperatures of up to 80 oC. We propose to build a heated
pressure retaining container to collect live alvinellids and use these for
shipboard experiments in already existing pressure vessels. We will test their
temperature tolerance and verify measurements made in situ. This should provide
access to the apparently most heat tolerant animal known and allow us to begin
to investigate the mechanisms allowing this phenomenon. As a final goal, we will
describe conditions and metabolic responses which may have developed during the
early period on earth and may have been carried over in a refuge from surface
extinctions; the hydrothermal vent community.
