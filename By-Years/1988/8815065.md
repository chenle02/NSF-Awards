This project is the American Mathematical Society's 1989 Summer Symposium in
Pure Mathematics, which is entitled "Complex Geometry and Lie Theory." Its
organizers are Professors James Carlson and Herbert Clemens of the University of
Utah, and the conference will be held May 26-30, 1989 at Sundance, Utah. The
purpose is to review critically the interaction over the last twenty years
between algebraic geometry, hermitian differential geometry, and Lie theory, and
to identify opportunities for future interactions. There is some participant
support available.
