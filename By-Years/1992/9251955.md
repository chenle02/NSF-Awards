The goal of this project is to improve mathematics instruction for preservice
and inservice mathematics teachers by utilizing a networked computer laboratory.
By focusing on teaching mathematical content using interactive computer
technology, the project is preparing teachers to effectively teach mathematical
concepts using technology as they enter the classrooms of the future.
Interactive computer technology provides a powerful way to depart from the
traditional lecture mode and challenges students to work cooperatively and
individually to develop mathematical concepts, to make generalizations, and to
solve problems. The computer is helping students develop the ideas of geometry,
algebra, probability, and statistics inductively as they are led to generalize
concepts and solve problems efficiently. By coupling interactive computer
technology with cooperative learning in this project, they are enhancing the
mathematics learning of elementary and secondary mathematics students and the
students they teach in the future.
