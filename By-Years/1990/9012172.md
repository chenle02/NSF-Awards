Based on observations in the modern ocean, it ishypothesized that lower glacial
ocean CO2 (aq) now evident fromVostok ice core data will be expressed as
significantly highersediment delta C13 (org) values in glacial>.>age strata.
Thishypothesis will be tested by carefully selecting and analyzingmaterial from
appropriate horizons within archived sedimentcores. The cores to be used will be
representative of either theequatorial or the high>.>southern>.>latitude
Atlantic Ocean, and willhave undergone previous study with respect to
geochronology andpaleoceanography. Core material will be selected to
documentisotopic abundances within late Quaternary interglacial andglacial
periods, with special attention to the transitions.
