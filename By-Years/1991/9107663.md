In recent years, the field of algebraic topology has become increasingly
applied to problems in geometry and physics. Homotopy-theoretic techniques have
yielded new insight into problems derived from gauge theory; there has been
important progress in applying topological techniques to problems in modular
representation theory; and geometric information can now be extracted from group
cohomology, which serves as a fertile common ground for an exchange of ideas
from representation theory, group actions and stable homotopy. This grant will
support a conference in algebraic topology at the University of Wisconsin in the
fall of 1991. The invited speakers are the top researchers in the field and the
conference is likely to result in fundamental advances, both in topology and in
the applications of topology, and in fruitful interactions between the disparate
fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.
