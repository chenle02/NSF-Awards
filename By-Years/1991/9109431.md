The principal theme of this research is the development and application of
deformable models for computer vision. In contrast to traditional, purely
geometric object models, deformable models simulate elastic material which
change shape in response to externally applied forces. The main advantage of
this approach is that it produces coherent object models where low level vision
techniques often suffer from pixel artifacts and may not yield closed object
boundaries. The work begins by extending existing surface-based models in two
fundamental ways. First, models are developed which can dynamically change to
reflect the underlying topology of the object being modeled. This makes it
possible to model object deformations with less complete and prior knowledge.
Second, the deformable models are generalized so objects in higher dimensions
can be modeled. This will enable scientists to study object behavior in time-
sequence images and gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved in object
deformation. In order to accurately model complex objects in nature,
computational methods are needed that are capable of handling models with
hundreds of thousands of elements. The approach combines two optimization
techniques, simulated annealing and multiresolution analysis, to reduce both the
time and space complexity of fitting deformable object models. To evaluate
effectiveness of the deformable models, the object modeling techniques are
applied to several challenging biomedical computer vision problems: image
segmentation; shape description; and object recognition.
