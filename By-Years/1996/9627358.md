9627358 MacPherson This award provides partial support for a graduate student in
the mathematics department at Princeton University, working on a Ph.D. thesis
under the direction of Robert D. MacPherson, a permanent member of the Institute
for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J. MacPherson's current research covers a wide
area, including the geometry of symmetric spaces in relation to Langlands
theory, combinatorial topology, perverse sheaves and toric varieties. He has had
a large number of successful students. ***
