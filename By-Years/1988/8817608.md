Paper wasps are a diverse tropical group within the family Vespidae, and their
social behavior and complicated nest architecture have been the subjects of
considerable study. Dr. James Carpenter proposes an analysis of the evolution
and classification of the species in the Polybia genus-group. The study will use
a combination of adult characters revealed by electron microscopy, larval
morphology, and nest architecture. New approaches to data analysis will result
in a reconstruction of the group's evolutionary relationships. Taxonomic keys
and guides to identification will also be produced. An evolutionary
classification of the paper wasps would have impact beyond the confines of
taxonomic specialists. Dr. Carpenter proposes to construct the framework on
which a variety of behavioral, biogeographic, and functional hypotheses can be
tested. This study will open the door to a diverse array of comparative research
projects.
