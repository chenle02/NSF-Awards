9322786 Gordon The overall objective of the Phase II Oasis program is to design
, fabricate and test an underwater ambient noise sensor with an ADCP. Such a
system would be capable of inferring wind speed, rainfall parameters, and wind
direction better than either system alone. Synchronization is easily
accomplished because the ADCP CPU will be controlling both insturments. Phase I
results indicate the feasibility of computing wind speed, and utimately rainfall
parameters, from the ambient noise spectra. Analysis of several data sets
indicates that a modified algorithm using the shear of near surface bins from
the ADCP is very, well correlated with wind direction, even in locations with
high surface currents. Additionally, the ADCP can infer near surface bubble
concentrations which have a direct bearing on the attenuatuon of the higher
frency ambient sound levels.
