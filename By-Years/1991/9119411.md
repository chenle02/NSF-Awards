The processes by which animals, plants, and other life forms adapt to patterns
of environmental stress and variability will be studied in the context of how
individuals acquire and use energy. An insect model system will be used; much
progress has already been made in understanding this system, and general ideas
derived from it have been shown to apply to life forms as diverse as bacteria,
crustaceans, fish, and mammals. Natural genetic variation in the mechanisms of
energy processing and allocation will be studied in the context of how these
mechanisms are impacted by patterns of environmental change. The results will
have importance not only for fundamental understanding of how living beings
adapt to their environments, but potentially also for understanding how domestic
animals, crop plants, or managed forest trees do so in the specific context of
human agricultural/economic management and global climate change.
