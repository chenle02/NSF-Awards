The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will operate the research vessel
PELICAN, a 105' general oceanographic vessel constructed in 1985 and the R/V
ACADIANA, a 57' research vessel constructed in 1986. Both ships will operate in
the Mississippi River and delta region. The R/V PELICAN will also operate in the
Gulf of Mexico. These vessels are part of a fleet used by the National Science
Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic
research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support
from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require
equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship
must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew
members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same
manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the
operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic
research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions
around the country.
