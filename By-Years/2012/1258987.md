The Scholars Program at SUNY Oneonta is supporting two 12-scholar cohorts, each
for 4 years, with scholarships of up to $5,400 per year. Scholars are in the
fields of Biology, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Earth &amp; Atmospheric
Sciences, Mathematics, Computer Science &amp; Statistics, Physics &amp;
Astronomy, or Environmental Science. The project, based on a careful review of
the literature, is meeting its specific objectives of (i) reducing the student-
loan debt load at the time of graduation, (ii) improving educational outcomes
for academically qualified STEM majors by leveraging existing support programs;
(iii) providing new team-building activities, information science education
opportunities, multidisciplinary educational experiences, and close student-
faculty mentoring; (iv) encouraging undergraduate research and/or professional
travel through financial incentives; and (v) enhancing opportunities for
scholars to secure STEM-focused internships, careers, or opportunities for STEM
graduate studies. The project is continuing to evaluate scholar progress,
satisfaction, and achievement, through 24 months post-graduation and is working
both on institutionalizing program facets as well as disseminating findings.
Scholars, including those recruited via the Educational Opportunity Program
(EOP) or the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) are experiencing a
student-focused environment, (supported by a multidisciplinary team of STEM
educators) including S-STEM-specific freshman and senior courses as well as
traditional academic and support services, all designed to foster scholar
success. Scholars are being challenged to think critically and to synthesize
knowledge from across the STEM disciplines in answering questions about science
and its impacts on society. The project is enabling students, who would
otherwise have significant barriers to overcome, to graduate and to then enter
STEM careers or continue in advanced degree programs.
