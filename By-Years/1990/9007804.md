ABSTRACT Anaphora has played a key role in studying language. It is widely held
that the study of anaphora can shed significant light on the logic that
underlies our linguistic capacities. The investigators plans to see whether
logics that are more "dynamic" than classical logic (such as some of the logics
designed to deal with certain aspects of the semantics of programming languages)
are better designed for understanding anaphora. He will start from Discourse
Representation Theory and use dynamic logic to deal with some of the problems
that it leaves open (such as the interpretation of quantifiers like most). He
will then look into other relevant issues such as the semantics of definite NPs
(including definite descriptions, ordinary pronouns, interrogative pronouns and
relative pronouns) and the semantics of impersonal subjects (like si in Italian
or on in French). These topics are important not only in their own right but
also because the provide crucial evidence in understanding the way in which
meaning is generally encoded in syntactic structure.
