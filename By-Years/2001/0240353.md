This proposal is to request funds from the SGER program for research to study
postfire plant response in chaparral shrublands burned during the massive fires
this summer in Arizona and New Mexico. There is an urgency to this request
because the work needs to be initiated this September. While extensive research
has been conducted on the immediate postfire response of California chaparral,
relatively little is known about these Southwestern U.S. chaparral stands.
Californian chaparral has a unique ephemeral postfire flora comprising hundreds
of mostly annual species derived from long-lived seed banks, the vast majority
of these species are endemic to California. There is reason to believe the
immediate postfire response is different in Arizona and New Mexico chaparral
stands, and is dominated by herbaceous and woody perennials.

These Southwest U.S. chaparral stands are of interest for what they can
potentially tell us about causal factors behind species area relationships.
Prior studies show annual dominated California shrublands exhibit very different
species area relationships then perennial dominated Australian shrublands. There
is evidence that community structure revealed by very different dominance-
diversity curves play a role in the species area relationship and life form
differences are hypothesized to be the primary determinate of species area
relationships. The Southwestern U.S. chaparral stands will provide an
independent test of this idea. An additional dimension of this project is the
predicted differences in functional type response to fire in these summer rain
shrublands relative to summer drought shrublands in California. The competitive
relationships of the two main disturbance functional types, reprouters vs.
seeders are predicted to differ between these two climate regimes.
