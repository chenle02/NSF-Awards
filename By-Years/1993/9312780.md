This project conducts a US-Japan Cooperative Workshop on Smart and High
Performance Materials and Systems in Tsukuba, Japan on May 14 and l5, 1993. The
technical program of the workshop focuses on the applications in civil
engineering structures under seismic loads and generic motion conditions. This
workshop involves U.S. and Japanese researchers from academic institutions,
government laboratories and industry. The purpose of the workshop is to discuss
the state-of-the-art of the subject matter and to develop future cooperative
research agenda for U.S. and Japanese researchers. Recent advances in sensor,
actuator and computer technologies as well as the emergence of modern high
performance materials pose a great challenge to the civil engineering research
and development community. National consensus now exists for urgent necessity to
develop safer, more economical and environmentally friendly infrastructure
systems by rehabilitating, upgrading and retrofitting the nation's
deteriorating, obsolete and aging infrastructure systems in order, among other
things, to significantly enhance the international competitiveness of the
nation. In this respect use of smart and high performance materials and systems
is considered as a most promising area for the concerted effort on the part of
the U.S. researchers. All the U.S. researchers participating in this workshop
are university-based and present the cutting edge research work at their
respective institutions. The Japanese participants are expected to represent
primarily government laboratories, and construction and other industries, thus
presenting more application oriented research results to the benefit of the U.S.
delegation. This workshop is implemented as a part of the U.S.-Japan in National
Resources (UJNR) program.
