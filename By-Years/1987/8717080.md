This research continues the principal investigator's time series analysis of
financial and macroeconomic data, the purpose of which is to evaluate simple
theories of financial market behavior and the relation of financial markets to
the macroeconomy. Important new understandings of the behavior of financial
markets already have been achieved through improved models, new techniques of
improving the fit of models, and through the use of new econometric tools. The
proposed research addresses two distinct areas: (l) Time series analysis of
financial markets and the market for private homes. (2) Survey analysis of
individual and institutional investors. In the first, time series modelling of
cointegrated vector autoregressive models is used to explore further the
behavior of financial markets and their relation to the macroeconomy. In the
second, questionaire surveys are used to learn about the fundamental patterns of
human behavior in financial markets. The investigator's research differs from
most other work in this field in that he is attempting to develop behavioral
theories that do not rely on the conventional economic assumption that all
investors are rational. The lines of inquiry are complex, but there is a good
chance for significant scientific as well as practical payoff.
