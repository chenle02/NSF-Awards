This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program. Dr. Lipshutz
will continue his very productive studies of organometallic reagents based upon
complexes of copper. These have the potential for producing highly selective
synthetic tools that can be used in the synthesis of the reactive molecules that
are found in nature. This research describes, in part, a number of new synthetic
methods which take advantage of the efficiency and mildness of higher order
cuprate-based transmetalation processes of organotin compounds. Tolerance to a
variety of functional groups within the stannane precursor itself will be
studied, looking to form highly functionalized cuprates. Allylic reagents are to
be examined with respect to substitutions at both tetrahedral and trigonal
centers. Moreover, cyclic allylic stannanes are considered, as is the chemistry
of allyl cuprates in the presence of carbon monoxide en route to direct
1,4-acylations of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones. As part of a program in
polyene construction, new lynchpins will be developed which will take advantage
of site-selective transmetalations made possible by differences in relative
rates between vinylstannanes. Applications to synthetic problems in the
leukotriene and pheromone areas will be pointed out. The possibility of using
oxidative "decomposition" of higher order cuprates, in a synthetic sense, to
effect biaryl couplings will also be studied. The last portion of the research
involves spectroscopic investigations of several species. One concerns the
nature of the new reagent derived from CuI/LiCl/Bu3SnH, believed to be (X)HCuLi.
Another will be an in-depth study of Yamamoto's reagent.
