This work centers on the study of theory and application of functional
differential equations. These are characterized by differential equations in
which the derivative of the state at any time depends not only on the state at
that time but upon the history of the state up to the present Specific
activities of this project will be to learn semigroup and evolution approaches
to current investigations on nonlinear and nonautonomous equations used in
modeling age- dependent population dynamics and in understanding the biological
processes involved in describing cell populations.
