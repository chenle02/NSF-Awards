Properties of highly-correlated electrons in metals (heavy-fermion compounds and
high-Tc superconducting oxides) will be investigated using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and muon spin rotation techniques. In heavy-fermion compounds
and alloys NMR and muon spin rotation studies will be carried out as microscopic
probes of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in these unusual
systems. Systems to be investigated include a uranium beryllium borides in which
substantial alteration of superconducting-state properties is associated with a
boron-induced change of the "Kondo" temperature Tc; and rare earth and actinide
silicides, where possible weak magnetic phases in close proximity to the
superconducting phase will be studied. Impurity-induced internal fields due to
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity will be searched for in
several heavy-fermion superconductors. La-139 nuclear quadrupole resonance will
be used to investigate charge and spin fluctuations in pure and doped lanthanum
copper oxides. This work involves collaboration with groups at Los Alamos
National Laboratory and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) (Switzerland).
