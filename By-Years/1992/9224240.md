The ultimate goal of this project is to understand why some weak tropical
disturbances become "organized" and intensify into major storms while other
similar disturbances do not. In his previous work, Dr. Molinari showed that
upper tropospheric cyclonic vorticity anomalies often interact with mature
hurricanes to produce renewed intensification. Using similar techniques and from
the perspective of large-scale processes, he will examine the initial stages of
hurricane development. Particular attention will be given to (1) the opposing
influences of vertical shear and upper tropospheric cyclonic vorticity, and (2)
the origin and effects of lower tropospheric "surges", which often precede
tropical cyclone development. The approach will be to conduct several case
studies, employing large-scale analyses and available aircraft reconnaissance
data. The importance of this research lies in its potential contribution to
improved hurricane prediction.
