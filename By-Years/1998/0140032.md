This proposal supports an experimental research program that studies atomic
coherence and interference phenomena in cold atoms, and explores related
applications in nonlinear optics and quantum optics. The approach is based on
interactions of multilevel atoms with multiple laser fields that lead to
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and dramatic enhancement of
optical nonlinearities. Cold atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) are
well suited for this type of fundamental studies because of the high atomic
density in a MOT and the near zero Doppler shift experienced by the atoms. The
objectives are to study nonlinear optical phenomena manifested by quantum
coherence and interference at low light intensities and carry out nonlinear
spectroscopic measurements in coherently prepared rubidium atoms. Specific
experiments include giant Kerr nonlinearities manifested by EIT, absorptive
photon switching at the single-photon energy level, the EIT enhanced four-wave
mixing at low light intensities and its application in photon storage and
recall, experimental quantification of dark-state decoherence, and the time-
dependent response of the EIT medium. The program provides research related
education and training activities for graduate and undergraduate students,
especially for minority students, who make up more than 65% of the total student
population at Florida International University.
