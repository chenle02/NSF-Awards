This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides funds for acquisition of a fast-scan, high
resolution, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer with laser ablation
capability. The instrument will be operated as part of a new Marine Research
Facility, which will emphasize fisheries, climate and oceanographic research
using trace element and isotopic analysis of calcified structures, such as fish
otoliths, mollusc shells, foraminiferal tests, and sponge and coral skeletons.
The project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution will provide cost-share support from non-federal funds
for 30% of total project costs.
