(i) Technical Description: &lt;br/&gt;Preliminary studies indicate that hybrid
semiconductor/molecular ("CMOL") circuits may serve as a basis for neuromorphic
network arrays ("CrossNets") capable of advanced mixed-signal information
processing with unprecedented density (beyond 1012 active devices per cm2) and
performance (up to 1020 elementary operations per second per cm2) at acceptable
power consumption (below 100 W/cm2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
project is to the key issue of the CMOL CrossNets: the development of effective
techniques of their training (including the error backpropagation and global
reinforcement), and the demonstration of the latter technique of such an
important task as modeling attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Non-technical
Explanation: &lt;br/&gt;Preliminary estimates indicate that array circuits,
based on both semiconductor (CMOS) devices and nanoelectronic (e.g., molecular)
devices and using bio-inspired architectures, may provide advanced information
processing with much higher performance than the usual semiconductor Boolean
logic circuits. However, in order to enable such processing, the existing
methods of neural network training should be modified to accommodate the
limitations imposed by the hybrid array hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on the development of two most prospective training techniques,
and their demonstration for modeling such a key function of brain as
attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
