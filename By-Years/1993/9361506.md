9361506 Meyer We aim to demonsate the feasibility of using hydrogen azide, HN3,
for ultra low temperature, plasma-free nitridation. Our goal is to achieve
breakthroughs both in reducing the time/temperature budget and in improving
performance of nitride films for ULSI microelectronics and flat panel display
manufacturing. Non-plasma based thermal and photodissociation of hydrogen azide
for low temperature silicon nitride CVD is the subject of the Phase I research.
The Phase I emphasis is placed on characterization of major process chemistries
resulting from thermal and photodissociation of hydrogen azide, including
analysis of the effluent, and determining deposition parameters which yield
films with good physical and electrical properties. CVD SiN films will be a
demonstration vehicle, forming the basis for applications evaluations in Phase
11. This approach promises ultra low temperature processing, the absence of
charged particle induced device damage, low pinhole density, reduction of
hydrogen incorporation, low particulate generation, wide area uniformity, and
controlled nitrogen radical species that can be tailored for specific films. The
variety of available azide sources allows for choice of best point-of-use
chemistries that will enable advanced ULSI and flat panel display fabrication
processes. ***
