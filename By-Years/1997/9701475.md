Parallel computing is becoming increasingly important to scientific advancement
and economic development. For parallel computation to succeed we need to build
machines that deliver high performance on real-world applications. This project
attempts to measure application performance on networks of workstations and to
implement applications to tolerate the high latencies in such networks. The
initial applications under study come from computational biology and from
geographic information systems. The integration of software, architectural, and
applications topics will be emphasized both in research and in courses developed
in this project.
