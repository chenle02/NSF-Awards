Definitions of disability vary significantly across time and space. A key
consideration in defining disability revolves around what an individual is able
to produce as a result of their labor. What forms of labor are deemed useful and
valuable change in relation to technology. Thus, technology affects how people
labor, in turn impacting how disability is defined. This doctoral dissertation
research project investigates how variation in technological labor intersects
with different forms of disability to affect how disability is understood,
valued, and experienced. In addition to training a doctoral student in
scientific cultural anthropology, this research disseminates research broadly to
academic and non-academic audiences, including policy experts and stakeholders
with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central question of this research
concerns the relationship between digital labor and definitions and valuations
of disability. The investigators conduct twelve months of ethnographic research
among organizations employing persons with disabilities. They use participant
observation, participatory research, interviews, and document analysis to
understand 1) what forms of labor are understood to be most critical for
productivity; 2) how work environments affect experiences of disability among
employees with disabilities; and 3) how broader political and cultural variation
in the valuation of certain technologies affect valuations and definitions of
disability. This multi-level investigation of work and disability will inform
understandings of what factors predict how disability is accommodated and
valued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
