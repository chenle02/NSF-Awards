9223209 Huebert This project includes the study of the nitrogen and sulfur
cycles in the troposphere, as a way of understanding the impact of nutrients and
aerosols on climate. This work can be divided into three general areas: (1) The
ASTEX/MAGE field program has just been completed. The PIs group collected a
month's worth of filter, impactor, and denuder samples from three platforms: the
R/V Oceanus, Santa Maria Island, and the NCAR Electra. The sulfate and MSA
measurements are critical to valuating the marine sulfur budget, whose evolution
was studied during two Lagrangian experiments. This proposal will analyze the
samples collected, interpret the data, test a large number of hypotheses
(related to aerosols, cloud, and climate), and organize workshops and joint
publications among the ASTEX/MAGE PIs. The goal for this ASTEX/MAGE data is to
understand the marine aerosol production and removal systems well enough to
include them in predictive models of marine aerosols, CCN, clouds, atmospheric
radiative properties, and climate. (2) This proposal will continue a series of
nitric acid measurements at Mauna Loa. The suggestion in data of a multi-year
cycle in nitric acid implies that the delivery of new fixed nitrogen to the
remote oceans may depend on long-term climatological changes in precipitation
and transport patterns. The PIs long-term aerososl record will also help in
understanding the global impact of Pinatubo-derived sulfate aerosol. (3) This
proposal will continue an active role in IGAC activities, including the planning
and execution of a major international southern-hemisphere aerosol experiment in
1994 or 1995. ***
