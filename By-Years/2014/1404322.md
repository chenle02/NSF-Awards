Plasma from the tail reconnection site is transported into the inner
magnetosphere where it forms the ring current. The most common type of model for
studying this transport is a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. These are
frequently coupled with models of the plasma transport in the inner
magnetosphere since MHD models do not describe the physics well in the inner
magnetosphere. This is a project to enhance the physics of the MHD models in the
tail where they work best. This effort will add diamagnetic (pressure driven)
drifts, inertial drifts, finite Larmor radius effects on the pressure tensor,
and the energy dependence of these drifts. The improved model will be used to
study magnetospheric convection, fast bursty bulk flows and dipolarization
fronts, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the structure of thin current
sheets.&lt;br/&gt;The improved simulation code when coupled with an inner
magnetosphere model will be useful in studying transport during magnetic storms.
Therefore it will valuable for space weather studies. Since space weather
represents a series hazard this work may be of significant societal value.
