Existing restructuring compilers have been successful in detecting the
parallelism of regular programs, i.e., codes with relatively simple access
patterns that are statically (compile time) defined, by using current dependence
tests and symbolic methods. Unfortunately, for more than 50% of programs the
access pattern are either very complex or are completely undefined before
execution. Examples of such "cycle consuming" applications are SPICE, DYNA-3D,
GAUSSIAN, DMOL, CHARMM and FIDAP. As modeling techniques become more
sophisticated, future large scale simulations will be mostly dynamic in nature,
thus increasing the fraction of statically non-analyzable codes and therefore
effectively decreasing the coverage of current compiler technology. Sparse,
dynamic programs are fundamentally intractable through classic compile-time
analysis techniques making parallelization or other optimizations impossible.
This work will extend the coverage of current technology to dynamic programs by
creating a framework that will complement static compilation with run--time
analysis and optimization techniques. Application level programmable hardware
for the acceleration of certain simple, repetitive operations will also be
studied. Finally, an adaptive strategy in which static and run-time methods will
be connected in an adaptive loop with hardware and software performance monitors
and statistical databases will tune the application to its data during
execution.
