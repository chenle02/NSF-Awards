The problem of second order continuity of blending and fairing surfaces has
received only approximate or very restricted solutions, although, it is a major
challenge in Computer Aided Design of Naval and Aerospace surfaces, where it is
dictated by fluid dynamics. Based upon the result of previous research in
Variable Sweep Geometric Modeling, this research will develop a blending
strategy that is mathematically exact and insures second order continuity of the
blend. The specific research objectives are summarized as follows: (1) Formulate
the Variable Sweep representation of the second order continuous blend of two
second order continuous surfaces. (2) Define trimming of the second order
continuous blend near the ends of the blended edge. (3) Formulate the (possibly
recursive) definition of the blend of previously blended surfaces.
