The Eocene Clarno Formation of Oregon contains a diverse assemblage of fossil
fruits, seeds, woods and leaves. Although frequently cited in discussions of
Eocene phytogeography, only a small percentage of the Clarno flora has been
described. Because it contains several kinds of plant structures preserved in a
variety of depositional settings that can be dated radiometrically, the Clarno
assemblage is potentially important as a link in correlating Eocene floras
across the Northern Hemisphere. A comprehensive treatment of the Clarno flora
including reproductive structures and leaves will facilitate intercontinental
correlations between the early Tertiary floras of Europe, known mostly from
fruit and seed deposits, and those of Asia and North America, best known from
leaves. The resulting data set will provide a better understanding of relative
intra- and intercontinental floristic uniformity in the Northern Hemisphere
during the Eocene and insight into the timing and directions of phytogeographic
migrations.
