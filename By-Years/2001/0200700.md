McCutcheon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
focuses on multiple recurrence in ergodic theory, &lt;br/&gt;with applications
to combinatorial number theory, specifically&lt;br/&gt;density Ramsey theory.
The analysis of the returns of positive&lt;br/&gt;measure sets under measure
preserving actions along combinatorially&lt;br/&gt;benign trajectories, such as
the ranges of polynomials or IP-systems,&lt;br/&gt;has led to a variety of
strong theorems not accessible by other&lt;br/&gt;methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical dynamics originated with the investigation of
the long &lt;br/&gt;term average behavior of physical systems evolving over
time, and&lt;br/&gt;abstract ergodic theory grew out of such developments. Study
of the&lt;br/&gt;applicability of this theory to seemingly unrelated, non-
physical &lt;br/&gt;entities, such as those arising in combinatorics,
strengthens our&lt;br/&gt;sense of the connectedness of and the unification of
the landscape&lt;br/&gt;in the whole of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
