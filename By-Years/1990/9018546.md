The potential for utilizing biological systems as a source of biodegradable
thermoplastics is becoming increasingly attractive in view of the environmental
problems associated with the disposal of oil based polymers. A. eutrophus H16
and P. oleovorans are biological organisms that produce poly D-3
hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with interesting polymeric properties. The genes for
the polymerases from these organisms have been cloned and sequenced. The present
proposal seeks support to develop methods for high level expression of the
polymerases. Large amounts of protein should facilitate isolation of
polymerases, characterization of their substrate specificities and study of
detailed reaction mechanism. A detailed understanding of biological polyester
formation should allow generation of PHA analogs (polymers and copolymers) of
defined composition, length and functionality.
