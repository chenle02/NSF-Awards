The GRC on Biomineralization 2022 titled “Bridging scientific disciplines to
understand biomineral formation in breadth and depth,” will to bring together
early career and established scientists from around the globe with diverse
backgrounds and a variety of expertise including, but not limited to biology,
physics, geology, chemistry, engineering, environmental sciences, dentistry and
medicine. Speakers and poster presenters will share a broad spectrum of state-
of-the-art topics to cover genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms of
formation, structure and function of biomineralized tissues. Interactions of
biominerals with the environment, impact on health and disease, as well as the
translational aspect of biomineralization in tissue engineering will also be
covered. The accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will emphasize creating
new connections between students, postdoctoral fellows and early-career and
experienced researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
