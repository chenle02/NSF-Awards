A major role for hearing in many animals is communication. There is evidence
that many animal brains have nerve cells or nerve circuits that are in some way
specifically "tuned" to recognize particular timing, duration, or pattern of
sounds such as mating calls. Crickets have provided very useful models for
investigation because they have single, identifiable nerve cells that are
accessible for physiological recording. This project investigates the roles that
individual nerve cells play in controlling the female cricket's recognition of
and response to acoustic signals from the male. The anatomy and encoding
properties of single cells will be determined using synthetic calls with
variable parameters. Methods are developed to simultaneously record from single
cells while the animal is actively behaving, turning toward the recognized sound
source. Powerful new techniques for inactivation of single cells then will be
used with a behavioral assay to determine the role of those single cells in the
call recognition and response. The influences of hormones on these cells and on
the behaviors also will be tested. Results will establish the cellular circuitry
underlying this response behavior, and will be exciting to auditory scientists,
and also should be interesting to those working on signal coding, neural
circuits, or communication behavior. Results may also be relevant to aspects of
insect biology and control.
