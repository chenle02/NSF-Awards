The program is an experimental study of scientifically and technologically
important point defects in elemental and compound semiconductors using optical
detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR) and optical detection of electron-nuclear
double resonance (ODENDOR). The theory of such defects in semiconductors, the
"deep level" problem, has made exciting new advances recently. The investigation
outlined in this program is directed toward determining the identification and
microscopic lattice configuration of the defects, and mapping out the electronic
and vibronic structure in their ground and excited states -- information vital
to guide and confront theory. The power and potential of ODMR and ODENDOR for
such studies has been demonstrated dramatically by experiments conducted under
the present grant. In the proposed renewal program, new ODMR and ENDOR
experiments are outlined for the study of the intrinsic lattice defects
(vacancies, interstitials, Frenkel pairs, antisites, etc.) as well as some of
the more important chemical impurities and simple complexes resulting from their
interactions. A new direction to our studies will be afforded by the
instrumentation of time-resolved ODMR for the study of the poorly understood
dynamics of luminescence and energy transfer processes in these materials.
