This award is for a postdoctoral fellowship. The investigator will assess the
life histories of flatfish species in the eastern Bering Sea, specifically the
spawning strategies of northern rock sole, flat head sole, and flounder. The
objective is to determine whether the downward trend in the biomass of these
major commercial species of flatfishes has been affected by alterations to their
unique habitat needs and life histories. This research will explore the utility
of otolith (fish ear stone) chemistry in the reconstruction of past habitat use,
the identification of essential habitat, and the connectivity between flatfish
populations within the eastern Bering Sea. The identification of essential
spawning habitat and the ability to assess recruitment within major commercial
flatfish populations will have profound consequences for these arctic fisheries,
and will go well beyond the current methods of identifying spawning habitats and
recruitment successes by the presence of spawning adults, and will assist in the
prioritization of restoration of essential habitats as well as in the continued
management and sustainability of flatfish fisheries. The study will apply
analysis techniques of otolith chemistry by laser ablation inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) developed for fresh water fish to the
arctic marine environment, and provides an excellent example of
interdisciplinary research in fisheries ecology and oceanography.
