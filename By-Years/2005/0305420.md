Computer algebra (also known as symbolic computation) is an area of research
involving both mathematics and the computer sciences. Computer algebra systems
are widely used in many areas for research, education and practical problem
solving. Research in computer algebra is the driving force for technological
advances in commercially available computer algebra software. Its major goal is
the development of highly efficient algorithms and automated software systems
that can solve a wide variety of mathematical problems symbolically,
numerically, or in a hybrid way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The East Coast Computer
Algebra Day (ECCAD) is one-day regional conference on computer algebra, its
applications and related technological developments. Since 1994, ECCAD has been
held annually at various North American locations on the East Coast. This
meeting in the series is being held on Saturday, April 5, 2003, at Clemson
University, Clemson, South Carolina. Three internationally recognized invited
speakers will make featured presentations. There will be contributed
poster/software demo sessions, covering many aspects of computer algebra.
