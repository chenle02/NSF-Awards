The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of Missouri for the summers of 2004-2006. Susan
Lever is the site's program director and J. David Robertson is the co-PI. The
focus of this program is training in, and conduct of radiochemistry research in
the broad areas of nuclear medicine, life sciences and the nuclear industry.
Seven faculty from the departments of chemistry, environmental health services
and radiology, nuclear engineering, radiological sciences and biochemistry, will
serve as student mentors to 8 students each summer in an eight-week program. The
faculty members have expertise in radiochemistry as well as one additional field
including organic, inorganic, analytical or nuclear chemistry. Students will be
recruited nationally and from minority serving institutions that have served as
sources of summer students in the past and the LSAMP program in Missouri. There
will be workshops on environmental health and safety, safe handling of isotopes,
and weekly lectures and discussions of radiochemistry research. The students
will present their research at an end-of-summer symposium and capstone poster
session. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering
(NIBIB), National Institute of Health (NIH) cofunds the award.
