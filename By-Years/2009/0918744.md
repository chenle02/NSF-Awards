The Dynamic Geometry in Classrooms project, led by faculty at Texas State
University San Marcos, is conducting repeated randomized control trials of an
approach to high school geometry that utilizes dynamic geometry software and
supporting instructional materials to supplement ordinary instructional
practices. It compares effects of that intervention with standard instruction
that does not make use of computer drawing tools.

The basic hypothesis of the study is that use of dynamic geometry software to
engage students in constructing mathematical ideas through experimentation,
observation, data recording, conjecturing, conjecture testing, and proof results
in better geometry learning for most students. The study tests that hypothesis
by assessing student learning in 76 classrooms randomly assigned to treatment
and control groups. Student learning is assessed by a geometry standardized
test, a conjecturing-proving test, and a measure of student beliefs about the
nature of geometry and mathematics in general. Teachers in both treatment and
control groups receive relevant professional development, and they are provided
with supplementary resource materials for teaching geometry. Fidelity of
implementation for the experimental treatment is monitored carefully. Data for
answering the several research questions of the study are analyzed by
appropriate HLM methods. Results will provide strong evidence about the
effectiveness of dynamic geometry methods in high school teaching, evidence that
can inform school decisions about innovation in that core high school
mathematics course.
