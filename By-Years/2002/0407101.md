Night Fire Films is producing a one-hour show for PBS titled "Breaking the Maya
Code," based on the book by Dr. Michael D. Coe. "Breaking the Maya Code" will
explore the history of the decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphic script. The
400-year scientific detective story, climaxing in the past thirty years, will be
told through footage shot at key locations in Central America, Europe and the
United States, together with dramatizations, animation and graphics; archival
materials; and interviews with major participants in the decipherment. An
outreach campaign, including an extensive web site, will enhance the television
viewing experience as well as promote further STEM learning.

The program will be produced and directed by David Lebrun; Nicolas Noxon serves
as Executive Producer. Michael Coe will serve the project as Principal Advisor,
along with an extensive board of advisors of ethnographers, epigraphers,
archaeologists, historians, iconographers and others. Multimedia Research will
conduct formative evaluation of the program; Knight-Williams Research will
conduct summative evaluation of the project. The National Endowment for the
Humanities has granted $550,000 toward this project.
