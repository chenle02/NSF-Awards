This project studies the application of the formal theory of knowledge to the
theory of distributed systems. The emphasis is on the application of theoretic
techniques to gain lower bounds on classical problems in distributed computing,
to design knowledge-based protocols that solve other problems, to study further
the concept of knowledge based-protocols and to automate stages in deriving
implementations of knowledge-based protocols. The project also studies the role
of knowledge in probabilistic systems where one has to cope with both random
coin flips and nondeterministic adversary behavior of some elements in the
system. Another closely related issue is that of capturing the knowledge of
agents who do not have perfect reasoning abilities. One of the goals in
investigating knowledge in probabilistic systems and knowledge of non-perfect
reasoners is us to determine the type of knowledge that arises in zero knowledge
interactive proofs. The PI is investigating the concepts of knowledge used by
game-theoreticians and trying to apply their methods and results to problems in
distributed systems.
