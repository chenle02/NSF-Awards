Abstract - Badgwell - 9714950 Model Predictive Control (MPC) refers to a class
of algorithms that control future plant behavior through the use of an explicit
process model. MPC technology is used throughout the petroleum refining and
chemical industries. A typical MPC controller adjusts plant inputs once a minute
in order to optimize future plant performance. Industrial MPC algorithms use a
variety of performance objectives, input parameterizations, and process models.
MPC algorithms owe their power to the fact that they have a mathematical
description of the process to be controlled. In practice, however, the model is
only an approximation of true plant behavior and problems can arise when model
errors become significant. The objective of this project is to develop and
implement a new family of robust MPC algorithms in which plant uncertainty is
incorporated directly into the control formulation. Theoretical and
computational issues will be addressed; prototype algorithms will be developed
in the Matlab programming language and will be tested on two simulated
processes. In addition, field tests are planned on a high purity distillation
columns and a polymer reaction system at Exxon Chemical Inc. The verified
algorithms will then be incorporated into next-generation MPC products by Aspen
Technology, Inc. This is a Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with
Industry (GOALI) grant.
