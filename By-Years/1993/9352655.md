This project is integrating graphical, numerical, and analytical (GNA)
approaches in all levels of the mathematics program at Adirondack Community
College through the use of classroom sets of handheld palm-top computers with
DERIVE and graphing calculators. Pilot programs at Adirondack have shown that it
is possible to transform the traditional mathematics classroom into an active
laboratory environment with cooperative groups of students exploring concepts
and real world problems. The project is producing curricular and instructional
changes resulting from the GNA approaches in a wide variety of courses ranging
from arithmetic through differential equations. Corresponding reforms in student
outcomes include an improvement in problem solving and critical thinking skills,
concept attainment, motivation, and making connections. This project is serving
as a model of a hands-on, active mathematics learning experience for both high
schools and universities.
