The 10th International Conference on Spectral Line Shapes will be held at the
University of Texas at Austin on June 24- 29, 1990. The conference emphasizes
those physical processes associated with the formation of spectral line profiles
as observed in the absorption, emission and scattering of light by plasmas and
neutral gases.
