This award supports the research in Analytic Number Theory of Professor Adolf
Hildebrand of the University of Illinois at Urbana. Dr Hildebrand intends to
investigate irregularities in the distribution of primes and probabilistic
models for the sequence of primes that might explain such irregularities. He
also plans to continue work on the distribution of additive and multiplicative
arithmetic functions on subsets of the set of positive integers, and to study
additive properties of integer sets with a multiplicative structure. The field
of Analytic Number Theory applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the
techniques of Analysis, dependent on the notions of continuity and limit,
originating in Calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the
discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic number
theorists such as Professor Hildebrand, the field has had a new rebirth.
