This award provides support to establish a Florida Center for Ocean Science
Education Excellence that will serve as a regional hub with a strong emphasis on
the integration of ocean research and education. The partnerships to be
established include a diverse mix of institutions: three state universities, one
private university, four state and federal research entities, multiple informal
education entities and public schools and systems from three different
geographic areas in the state. Stakeholders and audiences for the Florida COSEE
include ocean scientists, K-12 teachers, preservice undergraduates, state and
school-district decision-makers and the general public. Specific activities will
include workshops and outreach using multiple formats and platforms. There will
be a strong focus on diversity with the technology group for the Center located
at Florida A and M Univesity, a historically African American institution. On a
national scale, the Center will nurture development of new model programs for
educator-scientist training and collaborations.This COSEE Center will establish
a dynamic mosaic of partners that have excellent potential to promote the use of
the ocean sciences as an interdisciplinary vehicle for effectively integrating
research and education at multiple levels in Florida. The key role to be played
by the state's primary historically black university will strengthen minority
outreach and enhance educational and career opportunities for the diverse mix of
ethnic, racial and cultural groups statewide.
