This work will utilize meso-scale analysis techniques to study indentation
driven nucleation of dislocations in perfect crystals. In particular, the linear
mechanical response of mesoscale regions, intermediate between the atomic scale
and full system size, will be probed in order to search for embryonic defects.
Atomistic computer simulations will be performed using classical empirical
potentials to study the process in a perfect thin-film under a smooth,
nanometer-scale, indenter. Furthermore, the nucleation phenomenon will be
studied within a continuum framework, field dislocation mechanics (FDM). Direct
comparisons will be made with in-situ electron microscopy imaging during
indentation of single-crystal Al. The ultimate goal is to construct a simple
analytical framework which would be able to predict thermal activation barriers
governing nucleation given a few simple material parameters and geometrical
loading conditions as inputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current state-of-the-art
for predicting plastic deformation in ductile metals remains largely empirical
and phenomenological. A "first principles," bottom-up, quantitative
understanding of plasticity would allow for the design of materials with optimal
mechanical properties such as increased strength and toughness. The work will
also involve secondary education outreach co-ordinated through the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center and targeted at under-represented populations in the urban
core of Pittsburgh.
