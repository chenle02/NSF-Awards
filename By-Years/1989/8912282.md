This research is an experimental study of (1) droplet growth and evaporation
kinetics, (2) heterogeneous nucleation, adsorption and their film formation on
particles, and (3) chemical identification of aerosols by Roman scattering. The
experiments will employ electrodynamic balances to suspend single particles of
accurately known size within a controlled environment. Extremely sensitive
measurements of changes of particle size, often is small as 0.1 nm, will be
detected by elastic light scattering which also gives information on particle
composition and structure from the angular dependence of scattered light. The
research should help understand physicochemical processes of aerosols which are
relevant to environmental pollution, aerosol reactors for fine powder
production, and particle encapsulation.
