This award supports a symposium on the role of learning and motivation in
integrated cognitive architectures. The two-day meeting will be held at Stanford
University during March, 2003, and will have 12 speakers and approximately 30
attendees. The participants will include top researchers in the field of
cognitive architectures and planning, and a number of additional researchers
will be invited based upon submitted summaries of their research. This symposium
will contribute significantly to communication and cooperation between
scientists with different research emphases, and it will advance our
understanding of the nature of cognition, perception, and action, leading
eventually to unifying theories that combine the best ideas from alternative
frameworks.
