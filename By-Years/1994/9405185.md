9405185 Brooks In the past, Russian natural resources have been developed in
some areas of the country without giving due consideration to significant
environmental effects. As companies of the United States now seek to invest in
some of these areas of Russia, environmental issues need to be addressed before
development occurs. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Russian Environmental and Natural Resources can utilize Russian researchers to
study the environmental problems that need to be addressed for development to
occur. This award provides funding for Texas A&amp;M University to hold a
planning meeting with potential industry members to determine if there is enough
potential support from American companies to support an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Russian Environmental and Natural Resources. The
Principal Investigator and his colleagues are recognized experts in their fields
and well qualified to perform this study. The Program Manager recommends Texas
A&amp;M University be awarded $10,000 for one year.
