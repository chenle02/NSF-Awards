This is an award to support research on a technology based upon use of a
microporous hollow fiber membrane for removal of radon from water contaminated
with this gas. In the process being investigated in this project, radon would be
stripped from the water by passage through a microporous hollow fiber "gas"
membrane operated under vacuum created either by a water-operated aspirator or
by a vacuum pump. The evacuated radon would be concentrated in the liquid side
stream used to produce the vacuum or an alternative recirculating sidestream.
The redissolved radon in the sidestream would be removed by adsorption on
granular activated carbon in liquid suspension. This proposal was submitted in
response to NSF 92-30, Small Business Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d,
Environmental Systems. It addresses removal of radon from water supplies
contaminated with this gas. The process is expected to be especially attractive
to water utilities that must remove radon but are restrained from its emission
to the atmosphere.
