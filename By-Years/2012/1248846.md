The proposed Innovation Corps project will enable focused research by the team
to help bring a new system to market. The goal is to offer an alternative to
current computer-aided design systems, specifically by developing a tablet-
based, pen-driven, proof-of-concept system that abandons the assumption that a
system must maintain a valid 3D model at all times. In the exploring the middle
ground between sketch and object, the proposed work addresses one of the
significant problems in interactive graphics - how to move seamlessly between 2D
and 3D. This understanding includes not only a computer science perspective, but
also a design perspective, where practitioners have a deep working knowledge of
form creation but may lack a computational or mathematical
background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully deployed, the proposed work
will have a direct impact on the creative design professional by making
available a novel approach for creating and editing 3D form, and will also
impact the communication of ideas, where 2D representations have dominated. The
team's close relationship with academics and practicing designers will provide
opportunities to explore and test the new approach through application to real
design problems.
