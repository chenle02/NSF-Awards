The purpose of project is to investigate the effect of corporate debt-related
restructuring (that is, mergers, acquisitions, leverage buyouts) on research and
development in the U.S. over the period 1977-86. The extent of merger activity
in high- versus low-technology industries will be evaluated. Four large data
bases will be integrated and refined as part of the research effort: the Census
Quarterly Financial Report, the Census Longitudinal Research Data (Survey of
Manufacturers), the National Science Foundation/Census Research and Development
data, and a comprehensive list of LBOs and other restructurings (derived largely
from Mergers &amp; Acquisitions data). The project will provide statistical
data, definitional rigor, and the methodological approach for analyzing the
relationship between R&amp;D funding and other economic variables. The results
should provide further understanding of the role of industrial R&amp;D activity
in promoting national economic growth and competitiveness, and thereby
contribute to the Foundation's responsibility to provide for the collection and
interpretation of data for science and technology policy formulation.
