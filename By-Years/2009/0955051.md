The investigator takes up problems in the areas of (i) slow coarsening or
dynamic metastability of gradient flows, and (ii) logarithmic Sobolev
inequalities (LSI) and the hydrodynamic limit. In the first part, the
investigator and collaborators apply the abstract sufficient condition for
dynamic metastability developed by Felix Otto and the PI to the Cahn-Hilliard
Equation and then develop new but related methods to tackle the more applied
problem of coarsening rates in two-dimensional epitaxial growth models. In the
second part, the investigator and collaborators push forward their two-scale
method for LSI and the hydrodynamic limit to prove convergence of the
microscopic entropy to macroscopic entropy under general sufficient conditions.
The educational and outreach component of the proposal encourages and supports
women in mathematics and disseminates knowledge on multiple levels both in
coordination with the research plans detailed above and through four explicit
initiatives headed by the PI.

The work of this project focuses on understanding the way that energy (or
entropy) and energy dissipation (or entropy dissipation) affect the nonlinear
dynamics of a physical system. In general, science has a good understanding of
global minimizers but a very weak understanding of local minimizers and pathways
between them -- where many physical systems spend all of their time. A broader
understanding of multiscale energy landscapes is of both scientific and
practical importance; for instance, epitaxial growth models have implications
for nanotechnology and semiconductor development, technology with impact in
medicine, communications technology, and other fields. The education and
outreach component of the proposal addresses a critical need to recruit and keep
more women in mathematics, increase diversity in the sciences, and build
international ties between the scientific communities.
