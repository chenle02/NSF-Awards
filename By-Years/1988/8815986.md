This project will map the bathymetry and magnetic anomalies over a vast area of
the southwest Pacific from 5N to 46S and from 180W to 120W. The maps produced as
a result of this effort will be the basic charts for all future investigations
in the region. This will be the fifth in a series of Pacific basin charts
published by the principal investigator over the last ten years. The resulting
bathymetric contour map will be drawn on the basis of relevant Seasat satellite
altimetry, Seabeam swath bathymetry, and surface ship bathymetric profiles. The
magnetic anomaly map will be a composite of all existing magnetic data in the
region. %%%
