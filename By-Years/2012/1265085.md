The primary goal of this project is to develop a nanometer-scale
electrophysiological probe capable of recording the electrical activity both in
and around individual neurons in the intact brain. The probe will consist of a
single carbon nanotube (CNT) or a small bundle of multiple CNTs, grown from a
sharpened tungsten electrode. The device will be coated with Parylene, which
will provide electrical insulation as well as structural support for the contact
between the tungsten wire and the CNT. This probe will be the smallest passive
neural recording electrode ever built, by far, opening doors to many previously
impossible experiments and medical applications.

Public abstract This proposal will use nanotechnology to develop more sensitive
electrodes for monitoring activity of nerve cells in the brain. This new
technology will provide better information about neurological diseases and may
lead to better treatment of such diseases.
