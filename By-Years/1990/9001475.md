Professor Radin will continue his research on the question of why certain types
of matter are in an ordered state at low temperature. Recent results have shown
that generically, perfect (crystalline) order at zero temperature is not to be
expected. Radin's research will involve nonperiodic tilings and uniquely ergodic
symbolic dynamical systems to determine the range of disorder that can be
produced at zero and low temperature.
