This project permits undergraduate students to develop graphic software (with
film recording) that animates certain graphic algorithms. The laboratory that
supports this project is equipped with Sun workstations and a film recorder.
Students develop and record graphic algorithms for both computer science and
other disciplines. Experimentation in this lab not only allows students to gain
insight into the area of visualization techniques but they also produce
materials that are used for graphical display of phenomena in other departments.
This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
