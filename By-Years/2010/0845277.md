The need for increased participation in the mathematical sciences requires that
we identify and nurture students from underrepresented groups, both to serve as
professional mathematicians and to serve as role models and mentors for future
generations. NREUP supports the participation of mathematics undergraduates from
underrepresented groups in focused and challenging research experiences. With
combined funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Security
Agency, approximately 35 students per year will participate, at a minimum of
eight sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NREUP reaches students at the transition point
between lower and upper division studies and provides key components to
encourage students to pursue graduate studies and careers in mathematics--
enriching and rewarding mathematical experiences, mentoring by active
researchers, and both intellectual and social networking with peers. Moreover,
by supporting faculty at a diverse group of institutions to direct summer
research programs, this project simultaneously supports the development of a
community of skilled faculty mentors who are expected to provide ever-increasing
opportunities for undergraduate research.
