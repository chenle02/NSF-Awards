This research considers a scenario in which a piece of software needs to be
protected against an attacker (the man-at-the-end, MATE) who has physical access
to the software and so is able to inspect, modify, and execute it. The goal is
to prevent the attacker from extracting sensitive information from the software,
to prevent him from making changes to the behavior of the software, or, at
least, to detect and report when such attacks are
underway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man-at-the-end attacks can have serious
consequences. For example, on an individual scale they can violate the privacy
and integrity of medical records and other sensitive personal data; on a larger
scale, such attacks can cripple national infrastructure (such as the power grid
and the Internet itself).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores innovative
approaches to protect distributed systems from MATE attacks. To accomplish
comprehensive defenses, the project develops MATE attack models and security
metrics that formally characterize the process of device compromise, provides
attack tools to allow easy testing of defense algorithms, and devises community
standards for defense evaluation. Rigorously defined security metrics are
necessary for research outcomes to be compared to existing and future
approaches. A primary goal of this research is therefore to develop evaluation
procedures for MATE defense mechanisms. This includes both universal obfuscation
metrics and detailed red-team exercise protocols.
