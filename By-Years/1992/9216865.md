This project consists of conducting model experiments of Gulf Stream eddy
formation and evolution using a nested high-resolution model driven by a large-
scale, coarser resolution model constrained by high-quality in-situ data. Both
models are extensions of the Harvard ocean model, which is a descendant of the
GFDL Bryan-Cox model. The large scale model will assimilate data from the SYNOP
moored array program to provide realistic simulations of Gulf Stream dynamics,
which in turn will provide boundary conditions for the high-resolution (5-km)
nested model.
