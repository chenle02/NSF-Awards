ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Understanding how new species arise
("speciation") remains one of the most important and unresolved issues in
biology. Central to understanding this process is determining how barriers that
prevent species from mating evolve. Recent studies are beginning to show that
changes in the design of mating signal can lead to the rapid evolution of
reproductive barriers; however, little is known about the factors that drive
these changes in the first place. My research program attempts to fill this gap
by 1) determining which environmental factors can drive changes in signal
design, and 2) understanding how these changes act as reproductive barriers.
Closely related subspecies of the bearded manakin (Manacus manacus ssp.) show
dramatic differences in the color of male plumage -- a signal used during
intense courtship displays to females. Using a combination of behavioral
observations and experimental manipulations in the field, my work aims to
determine if differences in male coloration are linked to aspects of the visual
environment, and if these differences, in turn, act as reproductive barriers
among the different manakin color forms. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
