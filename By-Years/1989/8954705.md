The American Geological Institute (AGI), the umbrella organization for 19
professional earth science societies, will conduct a two-week conference of a
small group of earth scientists and teachers who will write a guide to curricula
for the K-12 school years which fit the needs of the 21st century. A series of
previous conferences sponsored by the AGI have provided the background for this
final step in defining the shape of earth science education appropriate for all
students today and tomorrow. Particular attention will be paid to preparing
realistic guidance for the earth science components needed for the education of
future K-12 teachers. The guides will be written during the conference, edited
subsequently, and published by the AGI. They will be widely disseminated to
educators and scientists through a variety of paths, including science teachers'
organizations, other educators' groups, scientific societies, and the AGI's own
National Center for Earth Science Education. Throughout the process, the AGI
will work closely with other groups involved in the reform of science education.
Cost sharing by the partners will total 60% of the NSF funding.
