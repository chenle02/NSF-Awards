9412887 This proposal attempts to link atomistic and continuum properties of
materials. The PIs focus here mainly on interfaces and surfaces. A local
definition of the elastic properties is developed which allows a good
description of localized long wavelength vibrational modes at grain boundaries
in single component metals and alloys, and at bimaterial interfaces. The PIs
plan to extend their work to more complex systems described by angular dependent
(covalent) forces. This work is anticipated to be of use also for studying
dislocation motion and crack propagation. %%% This proposal concerns an attempt
to tie together the large scale and small scale way of describing materials
behavior. It concerns, in particular, the local vibrational properties at
internal surfaces; that is grain boundaries and the plane which separates two
dissimilar materials in contact. The PIs previous work concerned systems whose
atoms interact via very simple force laws. The new work should become more
useful as it is applied to more complicated systems such as semiconductors and
transition metals (like iron). This work is extremely useful since it tries to
meld together two alternative ways of describing the properties of materials.
