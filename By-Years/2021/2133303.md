The Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics (BMSA) and the Committee on
Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) within the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provide a broad interface between the
mathematical sciences research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the
mathematical and statistical sciences. BMSA and CATS explore science policy
topics and create connections to mathematical and statistical foundations that
inform policy makers. They provide objective and authoritative advice on how
best to apply mathematical and statistical tools and techniques to problems of
national importance. These efforts strengthen federal policy making; identify
promising research frontiers; catalyze and support impactful collaborations; and
increase the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BMSA and CATS each consist of pro bono experts
from a wide range of technical research areas and with experience in academia,
industry, government, and national laboratories. These members carry out their
work by identifying important opportunities for use of the mathematical sciences
in federal policy making; recruiting diverse groups of experts to participate in
workshops, studies, and other activities; and developing efforts to further
increase the awareness of policy issues and solutions among the mathematical
sciences communities. BMSA and CATS each meet quarterly to stay up to date on
pressing issues and engage with stakeholders and members of the mathematical
sciences communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
