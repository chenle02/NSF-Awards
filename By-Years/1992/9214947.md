This award is for the development of an educational delivery platform to
support multimedia instruction. Multiple presentation methods will be supported
including textual description with annotation capabilities, dynamic
visualizations and animations, lecture-style slides and overlays, video windows
for aids such as instructor's explanations, and audio capabilities. The software
system and other materials developed will be disseminated through anonymous ftp,
and presentations at professional meetings. Georgia Tech is proposing to develop
a system infrastructure for a delivery platform for multimedia materials about
computer science data structures, algorithms, and methodologies. The platform
will support cooperative work, allowing students and instructors to interact
with the presentations and save annotations for others to view and hear. The
software system will be portable and will be available to any other interested
institutions.
