A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the ways in which
species become reproductively isolated from one another. One powerful approach
to this problem involves the study of naturally occurring hybrid populations. In
particular, inferences about the genetics of reproductive isolation can be made
through the study of differential movement of genes across a hybrid zone between
two species. Genes contributing to reproductive isolation are expected to move
less freely across a hybrid zone than genes that do not contribute to
reproductive isolation. The primary objective of the proposed research is to
assess the number and relative contribution of genes to reproductive isolation
between two European house mouse species, Mus musculus and M. domesticus, that
naturally hybridize in central Europe. Approximately 900 mice from two transects
across this hybrid zone in Germany will be genotyped for 68 genetic markers of
known chromosomal location and a statistical analysis of the relative movement
of these markers across the zone will be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the
complete sequence of the mouse genome will be available soon, this research will
lay the groundwork for identifying specific genes involved in reproductive
isolation. The study is both significant and unique in its utilization of a vast
amount of genetic information to address a fundamental problem in biology, that
is, the genetic basis of speciation. &lt;br/&gt;
