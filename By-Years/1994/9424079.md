9424079 As host institution, Lehigh University will offer ten undergraduates a
summer research experience in freshwater ecology at the Lacawac Sanctuary in NE
Pennsylvania. Students will be recruited broadly from many institutions, with
special effort to include minority students. The program will be an expansion
and intensification of an existing internship program offered since 1988 through
Lehigh's Pocono Comparative Lakes Program. Financial support will go mainly to
student stipends and housing costs. The program will involve a complete research
experience--including independent study at the student's home institution--to
consist of proposal development, research design, summer research, data analysis
and database documentation, and oral and written reports. Research topics will
closely tie-in to projects of a series of designated potential summer mentors,
who have on-going studies at the field site. This will ensure that students are
exposed to current issues in ecological research, and to modern techniques and
equipment. Particular emphasis will be paid to instructing students in effective
standards for recording and documenting data and in ethical issues encountered
in scientific research, such as questions of ownership of data from publicly
funded research and ultimate authorship of publications. Through weekly meetings
with mentors, research seminars, recreational opportunities, and the natural
history and conservation program of the Lacawac Sanctuary itself, interns will
receive a broad appreciation of the role of scientific research in the broader
scheme of environmental conservation.
