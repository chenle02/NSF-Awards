Bloomington&lt;br/&gt;Title: Models in
superconductivity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
is aimed at developing a variety of models in superconductivity. The specific
areas that are covered include mesoscopic networks, Josephson junctions, and
time-dependent models. One of the goals is the derivation of specialized models
in certain distinguished asymptotic limits. Another goal is to study the
relation between the applied magnetic field and the resulting current
distribution as a function of the geometry and the topology of the
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superconductors form a special kind of material
with the unique property that they exhibit quantum-mechanical (that is, atomic)
effects on large scales that can be observed by the unaided eye. This makes them
wonderful candidates to our understanding of the basic laws that govern atomic
phenomena. It also makes them candidates for many applications ranging from very
precise measuring devices and unusual generators of magnetic fields (already on
the market) to quantum computers. To understand the behavior of superconductors
we need mathematical models. Moreover, since the standard model is very
complicated, it is very useful to derive simpler models that fit special
circumstances. For example, some of the fascinating effects of superconductivity
are observed when the material forms a complex network of thin wires. I
therefore derive special models to describe such geometries.
