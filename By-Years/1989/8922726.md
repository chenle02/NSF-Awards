This award will support collaborative research in aquatic ecosystems between
Dr. Roy Stein, Ohio State University and Dr. Christer Bronmark, University of
Lund, Sweden. The objective of the proposed project is an examination and
evaluation of interactions among fish predators which affect the
>structurally.complex environment of natural ponds. Dr. Stein is currently
carrying out a large scale experiment in the northern Wisconsin lakes to study
the role of predators in structuring nearshore communities. Using laboratory
experiments, lake surveys and a large.scale inshore mesocosm experiment (where
portions of the nearshore are enclosed by a curtain), the Wisconsin research
team is exploring how biotic and abiotic factors influence all facets of the
littoral community, including predatory fishes, crayfish, snails, periphyton and
macrophytes. Because of the abundance of small ponds near Lund, Sweden with
piscivorous and benthivorous fishes, snails, periphyton and macrophytes,
whole.system manipulations of predators can be done without resorting to the use
of large enclosures. In contrast to the Wisconsin work, the work proposed for
Sweden, which includes a pond survey (to qualify field patterns) and predator
manipulations (where northern pike and tench densities are treatment variables),
will evaluate in a more extensive fashion how fish predators interact to
directly and indirectly influence snails, periphyton, and macrophytes in natural
ponds. This work will directly test the trophic cascade hypothesis, recently
applied to the pelagia of lakes, but largely untested in the
structurally.complex environment of the benthic, littoral community. The project
will benefit from the complementary expertise of the two investigators. Dr.
Bronmark has extensive experience with interactions among snails, periphyton and
macrophytes. Dr. Stein's expertise lies in quantifying the behavioral
interactions between fish predators and their prey and how these interactions
might be mediated by habitat structure.
