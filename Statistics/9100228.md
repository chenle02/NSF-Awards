Often models fitted to data must obey certain constraints such as monotonicity
or monotonicity for individual segments. This research concentrates on
statistical modelling when the constraints can be described as either
unimodality, piecewise monotonicity, or N-convexity. Fitted functions will come
from classes of functions defined by convex cones, unions of several convex
cones or intersections of a cone with a linear variety. Computational algorithms
will be written, statistical aspects of these procedures will be examined and
hypothesis tests will be developed.
