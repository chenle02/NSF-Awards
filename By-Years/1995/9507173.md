9507173 Delidow Regulation of pituitary prolactin (PRL) gene expression
involves the actions of a number of neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors
and other soluble signaling molecules. In addition it has been shown that
changes in extracellular matrix components can regulate PRL gene expression, and
that agents which regulate PRL can also induce changes in cell adhesiveness.
Preliminary data has shown that PRL gene expression in the rat pituitary tumor
235-1 cells is induces under culture conditions in which large cell aggregates
form, and that high PRL mRNA levels are dependent upon the presence of these
aggregates. To persue these observations, the proposed research will attempt to:
1. Determine by cell culture studies whether induction of PRL gene expression
requires contact with aggregates, or whether a soluble factor(s) is produced by
aggregates and acts independently of cell contact. If the signal appears to be a
soluble factor, aggregate-conditioned media will be assayed for the ability to
induce PRL mRNA. 2. Determine by agonist/inhibitor studies whether the signal is
transduced via cellular kinase pathways. Actin and tubulin staining will be used
to examine changes in cytoskeletal organization. The presence of
beta1-integrins, cadherins and neural cell adhesion molecules will also be
determined. 3. Determine whether the increase in PRL mRNA occurs at the
transcriptional level. These studies will provide a base of information for
future studies on contact regulation of PRL gene expression. ***
