The main emphasis in this project is the study of structural properties of
complexity classes and complexity bounded reducibilities. The goal is to shed
light on some of the major open problems involving the "natural" complexity
classes and reducibilities specified by algorithms with polynomial bounds on
their resources. Major emphasis will be placed on the problem of determining how
results on relativizations for "almost every" oracle set should be interpreted.
Specifically, the results of Bennett and Gill asserting that for almost every
oracle set, the (full) relativizations of the classes P, NP, co-NP, and PSPACE
form four different classes will be considered. This will be contrasted with
recent results on characterization theorems for complexity classes specified by
relativizations whose oracle access mechanism is restricted. The goal is to find
general principles that will apply to a variety of questions about relationships
among the natural complexity classes.
