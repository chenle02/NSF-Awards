0129492&lt;br/&gt;Russo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a workshop
proposal submitted by Dr. Raymond Russo, Northwestern University, and Dr. Martin
Flower, the University of Illinois, to request travel expenses to enable 15 U.S.
scientists to attend workshop on collision-related mantle flow fields beneath
East and Southeast Asia. The meeting will be held in Halong Bay, Vietnam, from
January 6-16, 2002. The topic of the workshop is important for earth sciences
and for understanding the India-Eurasia plate collision, which is the largest
continental collision in the world. The proposed list of participants is
impressive, including younger, women and minority scientists from U.S.
institutes, and represents many earth science disciplines. Participation in this
workshop by U.S. scientists will likely result in a number of new collaborative
studies between the U.S. and Vietnamese scientists. The NSF and the Geological
Survey of Vietnam jointly support this
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
