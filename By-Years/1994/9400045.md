9400045 Krasny This award provides funds to continue a successful REU SITE at
Cornell University for another three years. The program consists of a nine-week
Research Experiences for Undergraduates in the environmental sciences for 10
students, half of whom will be from predominantly minority institutions or from
institutions serving predominantly disabled students, and half of whom will be
from Cornell. Research projects include Population Structure within the Common
Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) and putative Mexican
Subspecies (Accipiter gentilis apache), Fish Communities and the Conservation of
Aquatic Habitats, Carbon Biogeochemistry in Wetland Ecosystems, Biological
Control of Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and American Indian Cultural
Practices for White Corn Production in New York. In addition to the individual
research projects, students will be involved in an ethics seminar and tutorial,
weekly seminars focusing on various aspects of the research process, and
teaching research to younger youth. Students will be required to give slide and
poster presentations during the summer and complete scientific papers during the
academic year following the program. ***
