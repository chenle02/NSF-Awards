This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II (SBIR) project will develop a
microfabricated subwavelength antireflective structure (SWARS) for use with a
MEMS infrared detector to form and infrared camera. The SWARS structure was
prototyped in Phase I and shown to allow greater than 90% of incident radiation
in the 8-12 Ã¬m portion of the IR spectrum to pass, thus performing better than
standard antireflective (AR) multilayer coatings which presently perform this
function. These AR coatings are notoriously unreliable, as the thick films tend
to delaminate during the processing and packaging of the IR device. In this
Phase II project, the SWARS devices will be mated with a thermal light valve
(TLV) to make the IR camera. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the
proposed approach may be used to produce MEMS devices for a broad range of IR
applications, including gas sensors, IR beacons and IR thermographers. Because
of their superior transmission properties and the robustness of the design to
temperature fluctuations SWARS structures will be used in devices which must
operate over a wide range of temperatures, and withstand virtually any operating
or processing temperature. Such applications include equipment for factory floor
inspections, power grid monitoring, maritime navigation, and security
monitoring, in addition to fire fighting and first response.
