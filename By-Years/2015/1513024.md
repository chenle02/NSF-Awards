This collaborative project is a research-based effort to make calculus
conceptually accessible to more students while simultaneously increasing the
coherence, rigor, and applicability of the content students are learning. Its
intellectual merit rests on an ongoing program of research from which the
principal investigators have conceptualized a framework for learning and
teaching calculus that builds on students' intuitive reasoning about
approximations and error analyses. Combining this framework with a
constructivist approach, the project team is refining and disseminating lab
activities that address the content of a standard course sequence in
differential, integral, and multivariable calculus with supporting materials and
interactive technology for students. The project is exercising broader impact
through its efforts to help develop a community of practice around these ideas
through a set of efforts that includes: conducting summer workshops, holding
weekly video-conferences, and making available classroom video and instructor
notes to support faculty professional development for implementation of the
labs. Finally, a research and evaluation component is assessing the impact of
the lab activities on student conceptual development of the central ideas in
calculus through the use of two quantitative measures: i) a Calculus Concept
Assessment (CCA) to measure shifts in students' understanding of the central
concepts of calculus and ii) a Limit Models Assessment (LMA) to measure shifts
in the cognitive models employed by students while reasoning with these calculus
concepts. The project is further adding to the knowledge base of STEM education
by studying the effectiveness of its faculty development efforts through an
analysis of pilot instructors' exams using an Exam Characterization Framework
(ECF) and the continuous collection of detailed feedback on all components of
the project.
