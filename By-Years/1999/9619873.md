Abstract ATM-9619873 Zielinski, Gregory University of New Hampshire Title:
Initial Development of an Interdisciplinary Data Base for the Evaluation of
Volcanism-Climate Linkages To reliably assess the impact of volcanism on the
atmosphere and specifically on climate change over annual to decadal time frames
requires the compilation of appropriate information on the global distribution
of volcanic aerosols, the resulting optical depth of those aerosols, and
evidence of the climatic impact of the eruptive products. Attaining this goal
requires the establishment of a data base that can resolve these parameters.
Several different sources are able to provide this type of information
including: ice core records of volcanism, tree ring records of the climatic
impact of volcanism, geologic deposits and records of atmospheric phenomena
related to the atmospheric loading of aerosols. This SGER award supports the
initial development of a multiparameter data base to include information from
all of these sources thereby providing a thorough compilation of the climate
forcing capabilities of volcanism.
