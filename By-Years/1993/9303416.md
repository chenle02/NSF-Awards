9303416 Jajodia This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.
The goal of this project is to investigate issues related to both mandatory and
discretionary security in object-oriented database systems. The database
security model, called the message filter model, proposed recently by Jajodia
and Kogan is used as a departure point for this research. The chief advantages
of the message filter model are its compatibility with the object-oriented data
model and the simplicity with which security policies can be stated and
enforced. Topics that are being investigated include: (1) how multilevel
entities can be modeled in the message filter model, operational semantics of
update operations, and implementation of a secure garbage collection mechanism
that does not have to be trusted; (2) how the conflict between integrity and
secrecy requirements can be overcome using the object-oriented approach; and (3)
how the message filter model can be extended to incorporate discretionary
controls. Access control is a crucial functionality for any data management
system. This research will lead to a security model specifically targeted to
object-oriented database systems, without compromising the advantages provided
by the object-oriented approach over conventional approaches. ***
