9410886 Janardhan Description: This project supports Three Indian scientists,
Dr. A.S. Janardhan of Mysor University, Dr. T.C. Devaraju of Karnatak
University, and Dr. B. Mahabaleswar of Bangalore University, to collaborate with
Dr. Robert Newton of the University of Chicago, and Dr. Edward Hansen of Hope
college, Holland, MI. The research will continue investigations of the late
Archean deep-crustal section of southern Karnataka and northern Tamil Nadu,
India, following on an earlier NSF-supported project of Dr. Newton. The
orthopyroxene isograde ("Fermor's Line") will be investigated as to causative
mineral reactions, areal continuity, geochemical progression, and evidence for
the role of infiltrating fluids in the Archean deep crust. The major thrust of
the project will be the elucidation of the early history of a continent. Scope:
The U.S. collaborators are well respected geologists with long experience in
Indian geological research. They are qualified to accomplish their scientific
objectives by collaborating with the Indian scientists who live and work in
southern India, where the field work is planned. The area of the research is
important to the Indian and the U.S. sides. This project fully meets INT
objectives. ***
