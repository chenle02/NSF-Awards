This is a project in the study of automorphic forms, representation theory, and
the statistics of unitary matrices. Professor Bump will study the symmetric cube
and the symmetric fourth power L-functions by means of a new technique of double
Dirichlet series. In this new approach L-functions are treated as residues of
double Dirichlet series whose functional equations arise from functional
equations of simpler L-functions. Other types of L-functions will be studied
using the methods of Rankin-Selberg. In related work Professor Bump will also
study the statistics of random unitary matrices via Shur functions. The
investigator hopes that a novel new approach will further this classical study.

This is a project in Number Theory. At its heart, Number Theory is the study of
the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.... These most basic numbers have elaborate,
interesting, and mysterious properties with applications in many branches of
science and modern technology. Many of the important properties of numbers can
be mathematically summarized in objects called L-functions. These L-functions
have their origins in the study of calculus and can be represented by several
different formulas. Professor Bump's project concentrates on the study of
certain kinds of L-functions. He expects his investigation of L-functions to
increase our understanding of the properties of numbers that these functions
encode.
