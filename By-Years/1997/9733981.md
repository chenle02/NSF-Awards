DMI-9733981 Sun This career development project in textile chemistry and science
involves both development of innovative surface modification technologies for
functional textile materials and clothing and incorporation of research
activities into textile chemistry education. The surface modification processes
will be able to impart durable and regenerable chemical and physical properties
to existing textile materials, which include durable and regenerable
antimicrobial and pesticide protective functions. These materials can be used as
medical protective clothing that can inactivate pathogens and prevent possible
cross contamination, and as chemical protective clothing that can effectively
detoxify chemicals on the surface of the fabrics. Furthermore, the materials are
reusable, durable, and comfortable, which will replace currently used
impermeable and disposable or thick and heavy materials, and significantly
reduce heat stress to wearers, especially to those who work in harsh
environments. The innovative processes and technologies studied and developed in
the research will be included in an undergraduate course of textile coloration
and finishing and in a new graduate course on functional textile materials. It
is anticipated that textile courses filled with up-to-date technologies and
theories will motivate more talented students to major in textile science and
strengthen the only textile program in the University of California system.
