David Coker is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical calculations and numerical simulations
on solvated electrons. Many important chemical and biochemical reactions involve
electron transport in solution. These calculations will provide a deeper
fundamental understanding of electron transport and electron-solvent
interactions in solution. Coker will develop computational techniques to model
nonadiabatic dynamics of excited localized states of excess electrons in
condensed disordered systems. Surface hopping trajectory methods will be
empolyed to generate initial guesses for the nonadiabatic paths of the classical
solvent coordinates. These trajectories will be refined using iterative or
simulated annealing techniques to search for paths with minimum classical
action. A fast Fourier transform technique will be employed to project the
excess electronic wave function for the rapidly varying potentials studied.
