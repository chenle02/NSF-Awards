The invertebrate fossil collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoology,
Harvard University, was begun by Louis Agassiz in the mid-1800s. It has grown to
be an internationally important collection of type and reference specimens of
all geologic ages from around the world. Curatorial improvement of this
collection will provide researchers with greater access to specimens of
interest, and will promote new research by uncovering and documenting type
specimens that are now filed with non-types. A catalogue of type cephalopods has
been completed recently, and work on a type trilobite catalog is now being
initiated. Natural history collections are the libraries in which the history of
life are preserved. This collection has served generations of students and
researchers in their explorations of the evolutionary past. Curatorial efforts
such as this will ensure that future generations of paleontologists,
invertebrate zoologists, and evolutionary biologists will continue to have
access to this critically important resource.
