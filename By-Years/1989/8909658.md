The goal is to use parallel computers to generate tests for VLSI circuits whose
complexity makes conventional test generation techniques costly in terms of
computation time. A parallel implementation scheme for representation and
manipulation of vectors is being created to provide a uniform basis for
development of various vector test generation techniques. Theoretical studies as
well as implementation are being used to evaluate alternatives. Approaches
ranging from tree- embedding procedures to macro-based techniques to fault
simulation based methods are being investigated to provide a comparative basis
for the various approaches. The implementation of the approach is efficient and
is being done on conventional vector machines as well as distributed memory
multi-processors. New approaches to VLSI testing need to be developed in order
to thoroughly test complex, high transistor count IC's. The research
investigates the use of parallel computers to efficiently generate test vector
sets. The approach is unique in that several test generation approaches, both
traditional and novel, will be compared to assess the effectiveness of using
parallel computers in reducing IC test time. The principal investigator is a
promising and competent young professor who should make a significant
contributions to the field.
