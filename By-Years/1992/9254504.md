9254504 Comstock Students, teachers, and researchers in the life sciences face
significant and complex ethical problems. Unfortunately, they typically do not
have formal training in ethical reflection. This project will teach basic
methods and principles in applied ethics to life science faculty at two land
grant universities, and equip them to lead discussions of ethical issues in
their classrooms and labs. The project will also challenge them to reflect on
various moral facets of their research. The training will occur during week-long
summer institutes, "Ethics and Agricultural Biotechnology." A team of three
philosophers, including faculty at the institutions where the workshops will
occur, will lead the sessions. Activities will consist of lectures on moral
theory, sessions on how to teach ethics to science students, and debates on
moral issues in science and technology. The institute will be held once a
summer, for two successive summers at two sites. It will reach a total of 60
life scientists. Most will be at the two host campuses: University of Illinois
at Urbana, and Michigan State University. Several slots will be reserved for
faculty at nearby institutions, to promote broader outreach. The project
includes preparatory activities and follow-up activities. Faculty participants
will continue to meet twice a semester for three years after the initial
workshop, forming a critical mass of scientists on each campus formally engaged
in ongoing discussion of ethical issues. The newsletter "Ag Bioethics Forum"
from Iowa State University will devote an issue each year to the summer
programs. ***
