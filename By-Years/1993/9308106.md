This award supports research on Kauffman's knot invariants and Hennings'
3-maniforld invariants, and the connection between Hennings' invariants and the
3-manifold invariants described by Reshetikhin and Turaev. General classes of
solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation will also be sought by imposing
certain conditions on a bialgebra closely associated to the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-
Takhtajan construction. The principal investigator will also study the classes
of finite-dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebras and ribbon Hopf algebras
emphasizing constructions from which new knot invariants are derived from given
ones. In addition, products related to the Hopf algebra dual of the quantized
coordinate ring of affine groups will be investigated. Quantum groups are a new
area of research for both mathematicians and physicists. On the mathematical
side, it combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics, algebra,
analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to physicists working on
conformal quantum field theory.
