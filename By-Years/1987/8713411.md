This study is intended to identify the decay of a muon into a positron and a
photon (which violates lepton family-number conservation) if its branching ratio
is greater than 10-13. The existing limit of 5x10-11 will be improved by a
factor of 500. The decay is distinguished from background through the unique
appearance of the gamma-ray and a positron each with an energy of 52.8 MeV in
opposite directions and in time coincidence. The experiment (under the acronym
MEGA) will be executed at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility as a
collaborative effort of a number of institutions. In the minimal standard model
of the weak interaction lepton family-number violation is not required. However
extensions of the standard model permit lepton family-number violation to some
level. The MEGA experiment is probing the physics beyond the minimal standard
model.
