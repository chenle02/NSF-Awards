DMS-998-7437 ABSTRACT

This general aim of this project is the development of the theory of definable
equivalence relations, and the closely related study of definable actions of
Polish groups, and the structure and classification of their orbit spaces. This
theory takes place within the context of descriptive set theory, which provides
the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in view of the
broad scope of this theory, there are natural interactions with other areas of
logic and mathematics, such as model theory, recursion theory, the theory of
topological and transformation groups, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, and
operator algebras.

One of the fundamental questions that arises in many areas of mathematics is
that of classifying a given collection of objects that is being studied in some
particular field. This amounts to providing a "catalog" or "listing" of these
objects, in principle not unlike that of cataloging species in biology or stars
and galaxies in astronomy. If such a classification is possible, one has a
"complete" understanding of the mathematical structures involved. Otherwise a
more or less "chaotic" behavior is expected. It is thus very important to
understand under what circumstances a classification is possible. This difficult
foundational question is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes
an acceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of
mathematics studied, so the criteria for a "good" classification in one area
might not be appropriate in another. At its basic level, this project aims to
develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can precisely
measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus provide objective
means by which one can decide, in any given field, whether a satisfactory
classification of the objects in question is possible. This is achieved by
associating with each collection of objects to be classified an appropriate
concept of "magnitude" or "size", which in a precise sense measures the
difficulty of its classification problem. This new theory of "magnitude" is
investigated in this project.
