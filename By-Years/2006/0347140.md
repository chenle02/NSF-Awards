This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program is to support Professor Catalina Achim at Carnegie-Mellon University to
create supramolecules that contain transition metal ions and are based on
peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), which are synthetic analogues of DNA. Ligand
substitution of nucleobases in PNA duplexes confer affinity for metal ions and
direct the metal ion binding to predetermined positions in these duplexes. The
proposed research involves the synthesis of new PNA monomers that contain
ligands, preparation of the PNA oligomers and duplexes, and the characterization
of the metal-PNAs by spectroscopic methods. The primary goals of the research is
to delineate the factors that influence the formation and stability of PNA
structures in which the transition metal ions are incorporated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information obtained from these studies will be used to
achieve the long-term goal of rational design of metal-based devices for
molecular electronics. The proposed research is developed at the interface
between bio-organic and -inorganic chemistry and offers students a unique
opportunity to garner a wide perspective of chemistry. New interdisciplinary
courses that bridge this field with Supramolecular Chemistry and with Art will
also be developed. A project-oriented approach will be used as pedagogic tool in
these courses and some of the projects created by the students will be used to
disseminate chemical science to the general public. &lt;br/&gt;
