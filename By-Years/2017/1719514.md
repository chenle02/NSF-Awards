The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development,
implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for
improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that
they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate
programs and/or careers. The project at Savannah State University seeks to
enhance undergraduate education by implementing an undergraduate certificate
program in interdisciplinary data analytics. The project aims to prepare
students in data analytics methodologies and tools in their respective
disciplines, conduct meaningful research and formulate managerial insights. The
activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and
summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
reaches across the Colleges of Science and Technology, Business Administration,
and Liberal Arts and Social Sciences. The strategies and activities center
around three goals which are: to strengthen the curriculum associated with data
analytics to enhance student preparedness in data analytic careers; to increase
awareness, student enrollment, and retention in data analytics; and to conduct
faculty and student development activities that enhance knowledge of data
analytical tools and methods. Undergraduate students will work closely with
faculty mentors to conduct interdisciplinary research in data analytics. The
project has strong industry partners and is expected to address the growing
demand for a workforce trained in data analytics.
