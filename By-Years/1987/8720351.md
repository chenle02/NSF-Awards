The acquisition of an analytical electron microscope facility is proposed. The
availability of this equipment would greatly improve the quality and extend the
scope of several ongoing and proposed materials research projects at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. Many of these projects are sponsored by the
NSF. The proposed equipment would have very high spatial resolution limits for
both microstructural observations and microarea X-ray and diffraction analysis.
The instrumentation will be interfaced with a recently acquired X-ray
microanalysis system and an image analyzing system. This will complement our
analysis capabilities that are available with our capabilities to include
ceramic and semiconductor materials. The research projects that would be
enhanced by the purchase of the proposed instrumentation include the following
studies: grain boundary nucleation and growth of carbide and laves phases in
high nickel alloys, the origin of deformation controlled grain size distribution
width, particle coarsening, characterization of II-VI semiconductors for
infrared detectors, processing and characterization of high temperature
superconducting materials, new materials for high-speed microelectronic
packaging applications, characterization of thin ceramic coatings on metal
substrates, structure analysis of hydroxyapatite bone filler material, heavy
metal ion attachment for antimicrobial effect, field ion microscope/atom probe
analysis of niobium and carbon segregation to grain boundaries in nickel-based
alloys, defects in alkaline earth oxides, processing and properties of metals,
identification of defects in crystals formed during growth, the relationship of
physical and magnetic properties of sputtered cobalt-chromium thin films to
corrosion behavior, and tissue ingrowth into polymer fabric implants.
