NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0140261 Mathematical Sciences: Conference on Progress
in Partial Differential Equations and Applications

Abstract

This award supports U.S. participants in the Conference on Progress in Partial
Differential Equations and Applications held at Washington State University on
May 15-18, 2002. The workshop emphasizes recent progress in nonlinear partial
differential equations arising from applied sciences and industrial
applications. The focus is mainly on three topics: control and inverse problems,
free boundary problems, and numerical analysis. One of the days of the workshop
features the Pacific Northwest Partial Differential Equations seminar series.

This workshop will help researchers develop new tools to tackle nonlinear
problems in their own research fields. It will provide an excellent opportunity
for communication and collaboration among faculty and between senior and junior
investigators. It will motivate young researchers and graduate students to learn
the latest developments in the field of partial differential equations and
applications. It will also facilitate collaboration between mathematicians and
researchers from other physical sciences and engineering fields.
