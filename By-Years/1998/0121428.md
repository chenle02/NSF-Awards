Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR/SY Reversible Computing Using Superconducting
Quantum Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring two
options of using the unique macroscopic quantum properties of superconductor
devices for implementation of classical and quantum reversible
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the first objective of classical
reversible computing, experimental demonstration of reversible processing of
digital information in a basic integrated circuit using Parametric-Quantuton
type devices, with bits coded by single quanta of magnetic field are
investigated. The implementation of this type of computing device is opening a
way to information processing at a rate of about 1025 bits per second per
Centimeter Square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the second objective of quantum
reversible computing, the experimental studies of decoherence in the charge-
based qubit ("single-Cooper-Pair Box"), using the radio-frequency single-
electron transistor as the readout, is being achieved. Measurement of the
decoherence time and investigation of possible ways of suppressing the
decoherence is facilitating more rapid development of a scalable quantum
computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
