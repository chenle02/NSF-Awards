John F. Geweke University of Minnesota - Twin Cities SBR-9514865 This research
will be in the area of Bayesian econometrics, which uses priors to improve model
results. The research has three parts. The first part will attempt to make
Bayesian methods computationally less difficult. The second part will
investigate the possibility that Bayesian results can be made publically
available and reused by other researchers through reweighting. The third part
will explore ways of relaxing distributional assumptions. Bayesian estimation is
sufficiently difficult such that most economists currently do not use it. The
main thrust of this research is to overcome the problems so that more economists
use Bayesian results and methods.
