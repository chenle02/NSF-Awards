Nuclei are the basic building blocks of matter. The entire Universe is composed
of nuclei and understanding their properties allows us a glimpse into how the
Universe transformed itself to support life. One way to study the properties of
nuclei is by exciting and de-exciting the nuclear system. This research focuses
on analyzing the lifetimes of the quantum states in deformed nuclei. This
project will also contribute to training the next generation of scientists by
actively engaging undergraduate students in research at the University of
Wisconsin - La Crosse (UW-L).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of low-lying
excitations, K = 0+ bands in deformed nuclei remain enigmatic in the eld. This
project focuses on the search for vibrational excitations in deformed nuclei.
The UW-L Nuclear Science Group has recently measured the lifetimes of states in
162Dy during the period of the grant, the group will analyze the results and
interpret the implications the measurements. The UW-L Nuclear Science Group will
also conduct detector work during the academic year in a small local laboratory.
The results will be broadly disseminated through publications and conference
presentations by the PI and undergraduate researchers.
