This project is improving the education of computer science and engineering
students in the field of data communications by providing a model for a hands-on
computer network laboratory. The rapid rate of growth in the area of digital
communications and networks will cause a shortage of knowledgeable personnel who
are capable of administering computer networks and services. This demand will be
felt first in technical industry, and then in the general corporate world. It
will be the responsibility of colleges and universities to prepare their
computer science graduates for the coming advances in networking technology and
the practical issues surrounding the current communication technologies. To
solidify the theory traditionally taught in data communications courses, the
project is developing a laboratory to put theory into practice. In the same way
that a chemistry student will better understand their discipline from practice
in the laboratory, a hands-on laboratory is essential for a computer science
student's understanding of network topics, including remote procedure calls,
spanning tree adaptive routing, dynamic versus static routing, routing
information protocol, hardware interface configuration, cabling issues,
bandwidth and timing limitations, network file systems, protocol analysis, port-
based network services, and peripheral configuration (such as networked printers
and routers). The hands-on laboratory is directed at upper-division computer
science and engineering students.
