This project is a three-year investigation into the relationship between the
geochemical and tectonic evolution of the ocean crust along the circum-Antarctic
Plate Boundary. This is a problem that relates directly to the motion of the
tectonic plates and to the driving forces in the underlying mantle. In recent
years it has become clear that the geochemical variability of basalts can place
major constraints on models of upper mantle convection by limiting the rate of
melt formation and the mechanism of melt migration through the mantle. The major
element composition of ocean ridge basalts reflect the composition of the
residual mantle, and so determine the overall degree of melting at the top of
the ascending asthenosphere. The trace element composition appears to be a
function of the small scale spatial variability in the initial composition of
the mantle. The analysis is based on rock samples dredged from the Southwest
Indian Ocean Ridge, and the South America-Antarctica Ridge. These ridges are
spreading at a very slow and nearly constant rate (between 0.8 and 0.92
cm/year), eliminating spreading rate as a variable, cross two mantle plumes, and
include two triple junctions. These characteristics provide a unique opportunity
to study the genesis of ridge basalts and the dynamics of mantle melting by
allowing the sampling of both the products and the residue of melting of the
asthenosphere beneath the ridges. The main objective of the program is to use
the trace element composition of sampled basalts and peridotites along the
circum- Antarctic Ridge system to determine the variability in overall
composition and the scale of heterogeneity of the mantle source in various plate
tectonic environments, and use the major element composition of the samples to
determine to what extent the variability is accompanied by initial temperature
differences, and differences in the depths of mantle upwelling and melt
segregation.
