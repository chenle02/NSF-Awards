A five day (August 9-13, 1992) workshop on Fuzzy- Neuro Systems is proposed by
the College of Engineering and Technology at Tennessee State University to
introduce and provide handson experience to the faculty and graduate students
from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) who have either
engineering and or computer science degree programs. A similar five- day
workshop on Neural Networks was funded by NSF, in May 20-21, l991 and was
extremely successful.
