In this study Guild will investigate and seek to demonstrate a proprietary
noncryogenic system to produce high-purity oxygen. Such a system offers the
potential for not only on-site generation of high-purity oxygen at the user
location, but large scale production of oxygen as a substitute for cryogenic
methods. This will be the first practical process capable of producing oxygen at
99.5% purity by means other than cryogenic distillation. The concept offers
users of oxygen a simple and lowcost alternative to the logistical encumberances
of present methods. It may also offer manufacturers a more economical method of
producing oxygen on a large scale. High-purity oxygen is used extensively in
industrial, medical and military applications. In industry, its primary use is
as a reagent in chemical synthesis. In the medical field and for the military it
is used primarily as breathing oxygen. High- purity oxygen is commercially
manufactured by cryogenic technoiques. These techniques are very complex, and
involve reducing the temperature of air low enough to liquify the oxygen and
nitrogen and facilitate their separation in a distillation column. The product
oxygen is supplied as liquid in bulk quantities or as bottled gas. Chemical
production plants, hospitals and military bases which rely on high-purity oxygen
must all have extensive and costly facilities for storing and handling tanked
liquid oxygen or bottled gaseous oxygen. Furthermore, they are reliant on an
outside source to provide them with the product which is, therefore, subject to
uncertainties with supply and price.
