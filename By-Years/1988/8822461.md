The Chapman Conference on the topic of magnetic flux ropes and reconnection is
timely and important for many areas in solar- terrestrial research. The
conference will bring together scientists from the solar, magnetosphere and
ionospheric communities. The exchange of new ideas and methods will enhance the
research produced in these areas.
