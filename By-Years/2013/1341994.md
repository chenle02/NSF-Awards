This grant will fund student participation at the "Future of Software
Engineering" (FuSE) symposium in Seattle in July 2013. All other costs
associated with student attendance will be covered by other sponsors. The goal
of the symposium is to bring together top software engineering researchers and
students to discuss a broad range of software engineering research topics, to
consider future visions for the future of software engineering, and to inspire
graduate and undergraduate students to work on the identified challenges.
Participants will include senior researchers from both academia and industry, as
well as up to one hundred students. The broader impacts are educational and will
help build the next generation of researchers in Software Engineering.
