Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0304407&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert B.
Lund&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies regression methods in time
series settings with periodic properties. The general goal of this work is to
put statistical inference for regression models with periodic error disturbances
on the same footing as that for its stationary brethren. The particular issues
examined include (1) simple linear regression for periodic series, (2) analysis
of variance methods for periodic series, (3) undocumented changepoint detection
in periodic series, (4) the adjustment of periodic series for documented and
undocumented changepoint times, and (5) trends in monthly extreme temperatures,
and winter snow depths. The work will advance and further connect the
statistical areas of time series, forecasting, extreme value analysis, and
regression modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a practical level, the research
will help resolve climate change issues within the United States and, more
generally, help quantify global warming. The statistical methods developed will
be used to study trends in United States monthly extreme (maximum and minimum)
and average temperatures. Trends in United States snow cover (over seasonal
maximums and snow water equivalent) will also be examined&lt;br/&gt;
