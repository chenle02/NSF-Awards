The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to use solar and stellar oscillation
data to learn about the interiors of the sun and the stars. This technique of
studying the sun and the stars is relatively new, called helioseismology and
asterseismology, respectively. In particular, the PI proposes 1. to place limits
on possible poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields in the Sun's radiative
interior, 2. to deduce phenomenologically the effect of the Sun's dynamo field
on the oscillation data and on the global, surface tempeture dips as functions
of longitude, and 3. to determine the magnetic fileds in certain Ap stars and
why and how these stars pulsate. Collaborations are proposed with Kuhn of the
Michigan State University, with Dziembowski, Kozlowski, and Sienkiewicz of
Poland, with Shibahashi of Japan, and with Kurtz of South Africa.
