Recent advances in autonomous agents research are pushing our society closer to
the brink of the widespread adoption of autonomous agents in everyday life.
Applications that incorporate agents already exist or are quickly emerging, such
as domestic robots, autonomous vehicles, and financial management agents.
Reinforcement learning (RL) of sequential decision making is an important
paradigm for enabling the widespread deployment of autonomous agents. However, a
few notable successes notwithstanding, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms are not yet fully capable of addressing generic large-scale
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is advancing in four directions
to scale-up application of RL systems. Specifically, the project is (1)
developing algorithms to automatically structure the input, output, and policy
representations for learning; (2) introducing parallelizable reinforcement
learning algorithms so as to exploit modern parallel architectures; (3) unifying
abstraction and hierarchical reasoning with model-based learning for the purpose
of enabling intelligent exploration of large-scale environments; and (4)
enabling reinforcement learning algorithms to benefit from low-bandwidth
interactions with human users. Finally, we intend to unify the four research
thrusts above into a single algorithm and conduct empirical evaluation on real-
world/large-scale applications, to include biped robot balancing and walking,
robot soccer in simulation and with real robots, and a full-size autonomous
vehicle capable of planning paths in an urban
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to research advances and
implications for improving national infrastructure, the project will contribute
to undergraduate and graduate curriculum development.
