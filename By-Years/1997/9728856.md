ABSTRACT Chemical and biological oceanographers have long puzzled over the
source of nutrients, especially nitrogen, to primary production in the central
ocean gyres. In the case of the central North Pacific, some believe that
nitrogen fixing bacteria may be the answer while a smaller group believes that
advection of nitrogen from other parts of the basin is more likely. In this
small but clever study, the principal investigator and a group of students from
the University of Washington will combine spatially continuous chemical and
hydrographic measurements taken underway on a cruise from Washington to Hawaii
to estimate how important horizontal transport from the North American shelf to
the basin interior can be expected to be. This will be the first time that a
horizontal profile of sufficient resolution has been made to allow assessment of
the importance of margin-to-central gyre transport of nutrients.
