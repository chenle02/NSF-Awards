This study employs the southern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys torridus) and the
bark scorpion (Centruroides exilicauda) as a model to test the hypothesis that
interspecific interaction between a predator and a toxic prey will result in
behavioral and physiological adaptations that mediate their interaction (i.e.,
coevolution). Intra- and interspecific patterns of variability in neurotoxin
resistance in grasshopper mice will be compared with geographic variability in
bark scorpion venoms. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be used
to screen serum samples in wild populations of mice in order to detect and
quantify antibodies that preferentially bind to the vertebrate neurotoxins in
bark scorpion venom. Quantification of antibodies that bind neurotoxins would
provide a tool for estimating the frequency and intensity of interaction between
mice and scorpions in sympatric populations. This research represents the first
attempt to understand, from an evolutionary perspective, the presence and
complexity of vertebrate neurotoxins in the Centruroides complex.
