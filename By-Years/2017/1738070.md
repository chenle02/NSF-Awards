This project on collaborative spectrum sharing brings together multiple research
areas not typically considered together on to a single radio platform, where a
successful implementation promotes potentially transformative advances in
communications and networking. From an educational perspective, this program
develops new undergraduate and graduate teaching laboratories and projects.
Human capital is developed through these coursework and laboratory experiences,
and the students also benefit through collaboration with both industrial and
international partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses its Dynamic Time
Division Multiple Access (D-TDMA) technology for synchronizing radio nodes for
optimal collaboration. GPU programming is also leveraged for low-latency, wide-
band RF spectrum awareness. Reconfigurable FPGA design for OFDM and the use of
machine learning algorithms are used for decision-making and ad-hoc routing. The
team also uses an Observe Orient Decide and Act (OODA) cycle for coordinating
with the radio environment and other participating nodes/networks. All
development takes place on dedicated Linux-based machines connected to USRP X310
software-defined radio nodes.
