Efficient use of limited spectrum is emerging as a major issue in wireless
systems. The proposed work focuses on technologies that provide better
understanding of wireless networks and greatly enhance spectrum efficiency. with
three coupled thrusts: (i) wireless network modeling; (ii) mechanisms for
efficient spectrum sharing; and (iii) exploiting enhanced spectrum efficiency
for wireless video communications. The project also includes an experimental
research component in which the developed approaches will be implemented and
tested on the cognitive radio testbed hosted at Virginia Tech and the
cooperative networking testbed hosted at NYU-Poly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research plans to systematically investigate several of the unique
technical challenges and open problems in enhancing radio spectrum efficiency,
and supporting emerging video services. This fundamental research will support
the development of technologies that achieve new levels of efficiency and
quality in wireless broadband services, and will help alleviate the wireless
bandwidth limits now being experienced. The work is supported by the Industry
Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the
potential to extend the center?s portfolio. The PIs plan to disseminate the work
to their industry members and the broader industry and academic community via
open-source software as well as introduce the content within their degree and
outreach programs. &lt;br/&gt;
