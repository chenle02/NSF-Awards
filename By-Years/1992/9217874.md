The proposal focuses on alternative constructions of atomic and molecular
eigenfunctions using collective coordinates. The main thrust is to identify the
best representations of the molecular complex at small, medium and large
distances and to connect these regions in an optimal fashion. The support is
entirely for graduate students.
