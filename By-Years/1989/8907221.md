Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers the
chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the study of the physical
and chemical properties of materials. Fundamental knowledge of structure and
dynamics of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals and liquid
crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques. Solid-state NMR studies
often complement those carried out using solution NMR and X-ray analysis. Access
to solid-state NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out
frontier research. This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin, to acquire
a high-field NMR spectrometer suitable for carrying out solid-state NMR studies.
The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include
the following: 1) Solid-state characterizations of new semiconductors and
ceramic composities 2) Studies of solid-state/molecular microstructures using
13C-CPMAS NMR 3) The SP allotrope of carbon 4) Use of solid-state NMR with
intractable polymers.
