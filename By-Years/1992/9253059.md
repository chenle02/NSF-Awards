ABSTRACT Social psychologists have long investigated the effects of applying
various stereotypes. Little is known, however, about how people are actually
perceived in the real world. When are stereotypes applied to make inferences
about others versus when are other types of knowledge used to make inferences
about others? Further, given that each individual can be perceived in multiple
ways (by sex, race, occupation, etc.), which stereotypes are most likely applied
to different kinds of people? This research is an investigation of some of the
parameters of stereotyping, focusing on understanding when stereotyping occurs
and what kinds of stereotypes are most likely applied. The research goes beyond
prior work in multiple ways. First, unlike much of the recent work in
stereotyping, this research does not assume that individuals are automatically
racist or sexist. Rather, it investigates how people are actually perceived,
testing how other types of knowledge (other known individuals) can be used to
make inferences about new individuals. Further, the University of Texas at El
Paso offers the unique opportunity to study inter-ethnic tensions in a place
where the usual white majority is the local minority. Given the changing
demographics, with Hispanics fast becoming the majority group in the southwest,
understanding racial stereotyping between Hispanics and Anglos seems
particularly important - before it becomes a national problem. Thus, this
research will test hypotheses derived from a newly developed model of person
perception with the goal of understanding intergroup relations between Hispanics
and Anglos.
