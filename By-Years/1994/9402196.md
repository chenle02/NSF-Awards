9402196 Soong The objective of this joint research program with researchers in
PRC is the full-scale implementation of passive and active control technology to
structures against wind and earthquake loads. While several structures in PRC
are being considered for structural control, the focus of the project is on the
Nanjing Tower, which has been chosen not only for control implementation but
also as a test-bed where multiple systems will be installed and their
performances observed, analysized and compared. During the first phase of this
project the research, development and installation of suitable control systems
for the Nanjing Tower will be carried out in collaboration with PRC researchers.
The systems under consideration include tuned liquid dampers, viscoelastic
dampers, and tuned, semi- active, and hybrid mass dampers. One of the direct
benefits to the structural control research community derived from this joint
research program is new information about some of the important implementational
issues in connection with structural control. Some of the issues to be addressed
in the second phase of this project include: system optimization, fail- safe
measures, reliability and maintenance, operational issues, diagnostics, and cost
benefit analysis. ***
