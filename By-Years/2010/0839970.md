BIATECH Nonprofit Research Center is awarded a grant to develop a prototype of a
customizable, easy-to-use, and robust database and data analysis software
environment for analyzing microbial proteomes. Simultaneous development of
statistical models and analysis software, with concurrent application to new
biological data, is preferable to isolated activity because of the high degree
of feedback between these domains. The investigators will work with multiple
microorganisms, enabling a rapid development and testing cycle that is robust to
differences across species, resulting in tools that are readily available to the
broader scientific community. The investigators will record dynamic organism
state and environment data and incorporate these into the analysis, providing a
rich potential for further discovery. The investigators will freely provide the
broader scientific community with usable database schema, software, and
statistical models, and the results of applying these to the analysis of the
three microorganisms. To encourage community use of the products of this
research, the investigators will develop a special Summer Program to instruct
undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and research staff,
beginning with those of the collaborating laboratories. The participants of this
Summer Program will learn, test, and apply the complete cycle of the proposed
developments and innovations to their organisms of interest, with the aim of
enabling them to deploy the tools and techniques at their own labs.
Additionally, BIATECH will host science courses for high school students from
public schools in the area, with priority given to at-risk and underprivileged
youth. These students will gain first-hand experience of how a real scientific
lab operates through hands-on sample preparation, mass spectrometry
experimentation, and computational analysis.
