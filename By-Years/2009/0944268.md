This project will support the travel of students to participate in the 11th
Americas Conference on Wind Engineering in San Juan, Puerto Rico on June 22 to
26, 2009. This is a major conference for the wind engineering community, held
every four years. The student participation in this conference will provide them
an excellent opportunity to interact with and learn from a large number of
established researchers and practitioners working in the area of wind
engineering and wind hazard mitigation. This will expose them to research and
implementation issues in this field and, thus, enhance their scientific
knowledge base to get involved more deeply in the topic to address the
engineering problems of current interest. This will also provide excellent
training to the next generation of workforce who will eventually be involved in
the mitigation of the wind related hazards
