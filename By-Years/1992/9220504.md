9220504 Thompson A laser guided adaptive optics system will be installed at the
Mt. Wilson 2.5-meter (100-inch) telescope. In its final configuration, this
system will allow the telescope to work at an angular resolution close to the
telescope's diffraction limit for all wavelengths between 500nm and 3 micros
(resolution = 0.050 arcsec at 500nm). One unique feature of the optical system
will be its ability to simultaneously image at both visual and IR wavelenghts.
Another unique feature will be its use of the "conjugate adaptive optics"
concept in which two adaptive mirrors will be operated in series, each mirror
being placed at a point in the optical system that is conjugate to a strongly
turbulent layer in the atmosphere. The adaptive optics system will be built from
components similar to (and for some components, identical with) working adaptive
optics systems developed by Thermo-Trex Corp. for use by the U.S. military. The
laser guide star system will be based on an excimer laser already available and
tested at Mt. Laguna Observatory. ***
