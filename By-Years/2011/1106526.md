An outstanding and long studied problem in statistical mechanics is to establish
the connection between the microscopic world and its macroscopic behavior. The
investigator's research concerns stochastic and deterministic models associated
with the evolution of gases, the formation of gels and crystals, and Hamiltonian
systems with random potentials. As the first step, one derives a partial
differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models.
Roughly, after a suitable scaling, the density of particles in a gas with
grazing collisions converges to a solution of Landau Equation, a rough interface
modeled by Hamilton-Jacobi PDE with impurity homogenizes to a homogeneous
Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and a chain of particles with random potential are
governed by an effective potential. Many issues related to these models are not
fully understood. Large-deviations type questions for the homogenization and a
central limit theorem type result for gases would provide us with valuable
information about the corresponding microscopic models. Also, simplified models
for coagulation phenomenon should help us to discover the rules governing the
mysterious interaction between gels and sols.



Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas
is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and
move erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage
to organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale?
Roughly the reason is that the local conservation laws impose constraints not
immediately visible on the microscopic scale. As an another example, consider a
solid to which further material sticks from the ambient atmosphere. The process
of the attachment is a function of a huge variety of growth mechanisms depending
on the materials involved, their temperature, composition, etc. Following the
tradition of statistical mechanics, one studies simplified models which
nevertheless captures some of the essential physics.

The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic
structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids, gases and crystals. The
analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of components
is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of our
microscopic world such as the formation of crystals, the emergence of clots in
blood, the roughness of the surface boundary of solids and occurrence of shocks
in fluids.
