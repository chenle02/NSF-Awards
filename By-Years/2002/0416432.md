Elston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator and his colleagues
organize the&lt;br/&gt;2004 Gordon Research Conference on Theoretical Biology
and&lt;br/&gt;Biomathematics. The format of the conference is nine
formal&lt;br/&gt;sessions, each beginning with an introduction to the field by
the&lt;br/&gt;session chair followed by two or three invited talks. In
addition&lt;br/&gt;to the formal sessions, there are two afternoon poster
sessions.&lt;br/&gt;The session chairs and invited speakers consist of
both&lt;br/&gt;established leaders and energetic new investigators who are at
the&lt;br/&gt;forefront of quantitative biology. Consistent with tradition,
a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of topics ranging from spatial modeling in ecology
to&lt;br/&gt;biological molecular motors are represented at the conference.
&lt;br/&gt;This breadth of topics, which includes biological
phenomena&lt;br/&gt;ranging from the molecular level up to the whole
organism,&lt;br/&gt;reflects the theme of this year's conference, "multi-
scale&lt;br/&gt;biology." Invited speakers are selected based on their
expertise&lt;br/&gt;and accomplishments, while trying to balance gender and
minority&lt;br/&gt;representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The primary goal of
this conference is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;established and young
investigators from the field of quantitative&lt;br/&gt;biology to share new
approaches and discuss advances in this&lt;br/&gt;exciting and rapidly growing
area. The relatively small number of&lt;br/&gt;attendees and informal format of
the meeting provide an ideal&lt;br/&gt;setting for germinating new scientific
collaborations. This&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary conference is crucial for
identifying new&lt;br/&gt;challenges and directions in the rapidly growing field
of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical biology. Many graduate students and
postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;fellows are attending this year's meeting. Therefore,
the&lt;br/&gt;conference serves to increase the number of scientists working
in&lt;br/&gt;areas of quantitative biology.&lt;br/&gt;
