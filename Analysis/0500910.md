ABSTRACT

This project deals with several problems on the interface between dynamical
systems theory and mathematical physics. The main object of study are linear
cocycles over general base dynamics, with special emphasis on Schroedinger
cocycles. The core problem is to decide whether the Lyapunov exponents of such
cocycles are positive. It is expected that positive Lyapunov exponents occur for
the majority of models. Spectral theoretical consequences of positive Lyapunov
exponents are absence of absolutely continuous spectrum, spectral localization,
and dynamical localization. General questions guiding the research on the
prevalence of positive Lyapunov exponents for Schroedinger cocycles are the
following: How much randomness of the base dynamics is needed? How relevant are
smoothness properties of the cocycle? Are Lyapunov exponents always positive in
the large-coupling regime? These questions will be investigated with the help of
a recent extension of Furstenberg's Theorem due to Bonatti, Gomez-Mont, and
Viana, a parameter exclusion method in the spirit of Benedicks-Carleson and
Young, and refinements and extensions of Kotani theory.

Positive Lyapunov exponents and their spectral and quantum dynamical
implications are essential to a better understanding of the consequences of
complexity and disorder in quantum mechanical systems. It is widely expected
that the degree of randomness of the environment should be reflected in the
transport properties of the associated quantum system. This connection is the
main motivation for the research project.
