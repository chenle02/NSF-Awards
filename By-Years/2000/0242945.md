Project Summary: Plasticity of Neural Integrator Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The oculomotor neural integrator converts brief input signals for rapid eye
movements into sustained patterns of neural activity that maintain tension in
eye muscles to hold the eye at a fixed angular position. The leading candidate
mechanism for the production of this sustained activity is re-excitation of
neurons through recurrent feedback loops, a mechanism that requires precise
tuning of the amount of positive feedback for proper operation. Normally, visual
signals produce the appropriate amount of tuning by changing the properties of
the sustained activity in the neural integrator. Experimentally, the plasticity
will be artificially controlled by a training paradigm consisting of a visual
pattern rotating with an angular velocity dynamically controlled in real time by
eye position. Optimal training protocols will be established and changes in the
properties of neurons in the neural integrator will be quantitatively measured.
These data will be used to incorporate learning rules into theoretical recurrent
neural network models of the neural integrator. The conversion of a transient
input into a sustained neural output is a form of short term memory that is
widely observed in the nervous system. Thus better understanding of the role
tuning mechanisms contribute to neural integrator function should have broader
significance in neurobiology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
