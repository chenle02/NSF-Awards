The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Eric Borguet of Temple University.
Prof. Borguet and his students will investigate the chemical reactivity of
molecules at solid-liquid interfaces in order to gain molecular level
understanding of the rules that govern charge transfer and transport at charged
interfaces. This will enable transformative advances in electrochemical and
nanoscale science that will be important in a variety of areas including
molecular electronics, electrochemistry, catalysis, information storage, solar
energy conversion and sensors. The study will provide excellent educational
training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees in a
highly multidisciplinary research area involving the development and application
of state of the art electrochemical imaging methods to analyze complex
interfaces of increasing technological importance.
