The mechanisms of power flow in electric power systems subject to harmonic
sources will be studied. The sources of the harmonics are primarily nonlinear
loads and generation devices (e.g., industrial rectifiers and inverters). The
mechanism by which these harmonics propagate in the network will be analyzed in
terms of the active and reactive power flow and the distortion power
characteristics. Alternative formulations of reactive voltamperes are compared
with regard to their propagation characteristics. The total harmonic distortion
and C-message weighted index is studied for guidelines on harmonic power flow
characteristics. Techniques to identify the source of harmonics from network
measurements are proposed.
