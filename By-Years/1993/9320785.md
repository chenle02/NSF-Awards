9320785 Slocum A novel polarizing thin film material was designed for use as a
high performance polarizer in Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCD. The
metal film polarizer (MFP) material consists of evaporatively deposited Ag metal
spheroid layers laminated with transparent dielectric layers. The MFP material
replaces the plastic polarizers which are currently attached to the outer
surfaces of a LCD cell. The MFP material is a non-organic sheet polarizer which
is formed by a proprietary process developed by Polatomic, Inc. for use in a
NASA solar observatory. In Phase I we established optical specifications for LCD
polarizers and designed by means of computer simulation a MFP material suitable
for AMLCD use. Experiments were performed to produce monolayer spheroid films
with contrast of 30 at the desired peak wavelength of 525nm. Computer design of
a MFP material with 90% transmission and contrast greater the 35 in the band
from 450 nm to 625 nm along with design of narrow band polarizers with contrast
greater than 10,000 at 530 nm established the feasibility of fabricating a high-
efficiency MFP material in Phase II. A Process Development Plan was prepared
describing the research and development road map for developing the fabrication
process in Phase II. ***
