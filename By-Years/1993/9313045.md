9313045 Berger The Fifth International Valencia Meeting on Bayesian Statistics
will be held from June 5 - 10, 1994, in Alicante, Spain. This series of
international meetings is the major venue for presentation and dissemination or
research on Bayesian statistical methodology. The Bayesian approach to
statistics has experienced astonishing growth in recent years, driven in large
part by its ability to solve difficult applied statistical problems in science
and society in general. Participation in this meeting is crucial for
researchers, especially young researchers, as the pace of developments in the
area substantially outstrips the pace of publications. By attending the meeting,
researchers will be able to acquire the latest Bayesian techniques, and will
have ample opportunity to obtain feedback on their own work. A portion of the
grant will go towards expenses of graduate students, since attendance at the
conference will greatly augment their statistical education.
