This is a continuation of an award made to the Council of Chief State School
Officers (CCSSO) in FY 1986. In the first year, an inventory was conducted in
the states to identify the information they now collect on the dimensions and
quality of mathematics and science education, using the framework being
developed for such indicators by the National Research Council, and applying a
data-collection "shuttle" procedure to describe how each state defines and
collects the information. In the second year, the information compiled through
the inventory will be analyzed with reference to emerging models for indicators
of math/science education, and strategies and priorities will be set for the
development of math/science indicators in each state that will bring states
toward a standard model of important, technically-acceptable information. At the
end of the first year's work, a major on-site review was made of the project. It
was the unanimous recommendation of the reviewing officials that the project is
meritorious and should be continued for at least another year.
