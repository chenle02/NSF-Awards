In this research two new general purpose algorithms for multidisciplinary
design optimization will be fully developed and implemented in application to
electronic package optimization. In one algorithm second order system
sensitivities will be generated using local second order design sensitivities
generated concurrently during subsystem optimizations. The concurrent subsystem
optimizations and local sensitivity calculations will be implemented in parallel
to achieve greater efficiencies. The algorithm provides a computationally
inexpensive procedure for quantifying subsystem interactions as compared to
previous algorithm proposals. The second algorithm will use neural networks to
build approximations of the system design space. The use of neural networks to
represent the design space moves the multidisciplinary design optimization
strategy away from the point design techniques used in previous algorithm
proposals. The neural network will be trained using data that is accumulated
during concurrent subspace optimizations. The algorithms will be developed as
general purpose design optimization tools for application to a variety of
complex coupled multidisiplinary systems. Electronic packaging design is an area
where immediate benefits can be realized through the application of
multidisciplinary design optimization. In multidisciplinary design optimization
the complex couplings between subsystems are formally quantified and exploited
in a concurrent design process. //
