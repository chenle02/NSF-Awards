A three-day meeting will be held during the period September 29-October 1, 2006
on Mackinac Island, Michigan. This meeting will bring together researchers of
all career stages and graduate students, mainly from the Midwestern area, who
work in quantitative biological sciences. The conference will greatly contribute
to the advancement of research and teaching in the area of mathematical modeling
and scientific computing in the biological sciences. The conference will serve
as a forum to foster research exchange and collaboration between mathematical
scientists and biological scientists who are addressing fundamental problems in
biology from gene regulation, cellular structure and processes to systems and
macroscopic phenomena.

In addition to the cross-fertilization between biological and mathematical
scientists at first tier research institutions, this conference will influence
and invigorate the educational developments in many Midwestern regional colleges
and teaching universities. Special efforts will be made to ensure a broad
participation by students, junior researchers, college faculties, especially
women, under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities.
