This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to study the gas phase energy transfer between translationally, vibrationally,
or electronically excited simple prototypical chemical species and unexcited
molecules. Experiments, using high resolution infrared laser techniques enabling
quantum state resolution, will be performed to study energy transfer collisions
between atoms with high translational energy and unexcited molecules. Energy
flow mechanisms between electronically or highly vibrationally excited molecules
and a "solvent" bath of small gas phase molecules will be studied. Chemical
reactions between high energy atoms and small molecules will be studied with
emphasis on the determination of the final vibrational, rotational and
translational energies of the product species. Excimer and dye lasers will be
used to produce the energetically excited species used in these studies.
