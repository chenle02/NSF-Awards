The objective of this project is to introduce the concepts of environmental
analysis, monitoring, and management through remote sensing (RS) and geographic
information system (GIS) techniques. The project is also incorporating mapping
concepts from digital images which serve as the spatial foundation for RS and
GIS. Applications and student projects that are developing under this project
stress special settings in an urban area such as Newark, New Jersey. An example
of a student project is to identify and map potential hazardous waste sites
within the metropolitan area. For these objectives, there is a need for new RS
software and equipment that is being installed in, and is expanding, the
capabilities of the newly established PC-Laboratory. The results of this project
will directly affect the Civil and Environmental Engineering, Environmental
Science, and Surveying Engineering Technology Departments. The laboratory will
also serve students from neighboring Rutgers-Newark University and Essex County
College. These higher education institutions have a cross-registration policy to
minimize duplication of courses and to share resources. A substantial number of
students at all of these institutions are inner city, first generation students.
