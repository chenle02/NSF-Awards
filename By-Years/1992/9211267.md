This project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry Program is for exploratory research on temperature-hypersensitive
photostationary states and photooscillating systems. The basis of the proposed
investigation is the observation that the photostationary state for certain
diacidobisbipyridylruthenium(II) complexes switched from Ru(II) to Ru(III) over
a remarkably small temperature interval when irradiated in chloroform solution.
There was also evidence for a photooscillation between the two oxidation states
under certain conditions. Elucidation of the mechanism of the photochemical
behavior is a primary objective of the research although plans are outlined to
examine other chemical systems that may behave in a similar fashion. %%% This
research, which deals with photochemically initiated inorganic reactions, if
successful could have very significant technological applications for "smart
glass", i.e., changes color with temperature, various types of sensors and
switches, and possibly for mass storage applications.
