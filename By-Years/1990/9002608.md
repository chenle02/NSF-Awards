The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) program
is very much concerned with multi-station campaigns for acquisition of data on
the polar region atmosphere. The topic of this program involves the operation of
an optical observatory at Thule, Greenland. The observations made with high
sensitivity electronic imaging systems, Fabry-Perot interferometers and
spectrometers will be used to study the optical emissions from the airglow and
the aurora as applied to the understanding of plasma convection across the polar
cap and the motion of the thermospheric neutral atmosphere.
