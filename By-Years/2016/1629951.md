Historically,when designing the security of a system, operating systems have
been considered a part of the trusted computing base (TCB).&lt;br/&gt;However,
with the recent shift to cloud computing, there is a pressing need to exclude
the OS from the TCB. The Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a promising
new technology that has a great potential to solve this problem. However, its
infrastructure, tools, and development ecosystems are developed in a closed
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to initiate a community effort in
developing an open research infrastructure and support for Intel SGX. In
particular, the work will initiate a long-term plan to develop, enhance, and
maintain an open source project, OpenSGX, focusing on developing a system
emulator, SGX-enabled applications, libraries, kernel drivers, etc., to support
its ecosystem. Being an open source research infrastructure, all of the code and
documentation will be publicly shared and maintained.
