Nielsen 9724755 This award supports a nine month Science and Technology Agency
of Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. James Nielsen at the Mechanical
Engineering Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Nielsen will work with Dr. Tamio
Tanikawa, research scientist in the Department of Robotics, on a research
project entitled, "Structural Design Optimization of an Ultra Micro
Manipulator." The proposed research seeks to optimize both the design and
function of an ultra-micro manipulator, a device which has the precision
necessary to manipulate biological cells, micro-machined parts, and other small-
scale objects. Specifically, the analysis will focus on developing the structure
of an "in-parallel" mechanism used to actuate the fingers of a robotic micro
hand. The choice of an in parallel manipulator, which uses six parallel legs to
perform prescribed activities, is natural for this application in that the
design possesses a high degree of both stiffness and precision and the required
range of motion needed for the fingers is comparatively limited. The primary
goal of the project will be to optimize the structural arrangement for use in
biotechnological, micro machine, and micro-surgery techniques. ***
