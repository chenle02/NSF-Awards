Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project takes the innovative and highly
successful interdisciplinary science education Web portal Visionlearning
(http://www.visionlearning.com) from prototype to full implementation.
Visionlearning has been proven through classroom evaluation to provide effective
learning strategies for students and it has received outstanding peer reviews
that have praised its effective use of creative and timely teaching methods. The
Visionlearning portal efficiently leverages the inherent strengths of the
Internet to make interdisciplinary teaching materials freely available to all
students and instructors. Visionlearning has successfully integrated strategies
to specifically benefit low income and minority science students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is:&lt;br/&gt;a) adding 72 new lessons to Our
Library, a group of novel teaching modules proven to enhance
learning;&lt;br/&gt;b) fully developing MyClassroom, an imaginative system that
allows faculty to fully customize the Visionlearning interface to their own
curricular objectives;&lt;br/&gt;c) enhancing the Teaching &amp; Technology
area, a valuable clearinghouse for faculty development;&lt;br/&gt;d) expanding
the robust evaluation of the project to three additional diverse
institutions;&lt;br/&gt;e) further disseminating the project to add at least 20
instructors to the Visionlearning faculty list; and&lt;br/&gt;f) broadening the
publishing partnership to ensure the project's long-term
sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;
