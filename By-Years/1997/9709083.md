9709083 Rogoff How can one reconcile the apparently very slow rate at which real
exchange rate shocks damp out over time, with the extremely high volatility of
real exchange rates? On the one hand, it would seem hard to explain short-term
exchange rate volatility without assuming that monetary and financial market
shocks are predominant. On the other hand, it is also hard to explain the
apparently very long typical half life of deviations from Purchasing Power
Parity - the consensus estimate is now roughly 2.5 to 5 years - unless real
shocks predominate. This time frame seems far beyond anything that can be
attributed to the conventional sources of nominal wage or price rigidity. This
profound empirical puzzle plagues older models used in most policy research. In
their previous NSF project, the investigators developed an alternative
integrative approach to sticky-price dynamic open-economy models, based on
dynamic maximization subject to intertemporal budget constraints, and on price-
setting behavior by firms. The goal of this project is to develop variants of
sticky-price intertemporal models that can explain this "purchasing power parity
puzzle." The approach taken will consider a variety of possible frictions,
including trade restrictions and a broad array of possible commodity arbitrage
costs. One approach will involve a monetary version of a dynamic Ricardian model
developed under the previous NSF grant. Another will involve incorporating
pricing-to-market factors with endogenous markups. These models will be used to
re-examine a provocative empirical literature arguing that real exchange rate
volatility is largely benign.
