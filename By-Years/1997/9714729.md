9714729 This project is a collaborative between George Washington University and
Gallaudet. In addition, several HBCUs and a woman's college will serve as
cooperating partners. The goal of the project is to increase the participation
of women in SEM educational and career pathways. FORWARD has additional foci:
Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing women, women at traditionally Black universities.
Guidance counselors and teachers are targeted in order to reach high school deaf
women contemplating SEM career paths. The project provides mentors,
interpreters, undergraduate and graduate research experiences for the targeted
student populations, and a variety of model and experimental pedagogical
strategies to provide skills and awareness of issues and concerns to teachers
and counselors of deaf women and women of color.
