EIA-0137098&lt;br/&gt;Bennett, Beth Anne V&lt;br/&gt;Yale
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ADVANCE Fellow: Local Rectangular
Refinement Solution-Adaptive Gridding Method&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This
proposal, extending previous work, pursues two lines of research. &lt;br/&gt;1
Expansion of the Local Rectangular Refinement (LRR) adaptive gridding to 3D and
&lt;br/&gt;2 Numerical Modeling of Solidification of Aluminum Alloy. The former,
an adaptive grid method for simultaneous, fully implicit solution of coupled
systems of nonlinear partial differential equations arises from the modeling of
complex 2-dimensional (2D) physical systems, such as those encountered in fluid
flow, heat transfer, and combustion applications. The LRR method will be
expanded to 3D, making it a viable tool for simulating real-world 3D systems,
including solidification and combustion processes. The completed adaptive code
on 3D thermofluids applications will be tested, quantifying its accuracy and
efficiency by comparison with a structured-grid code. The latter, a new
application for the LRR method, involves collaboration with WU, an expert in
nucleation theory. His work will be embedded within the existing LRR-2D code and
later with the 3D code. Because microscopic material properties such as strength
and hardness depend strongly upon microscopic quantities (e.g., grain size
distribution), the ultimate goal is a numerical model which will predict the
grain size distribution in an aluminum alloy part of simple 3D geometry, under
various processing conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
