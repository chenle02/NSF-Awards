In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Magid will use light scattering and small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS) to investigate polyelectrolytes and the formation of giant
micelles that are self-assembled in aqueous solutions from surfactants. In
selected cases the micellar solutions will be studied in flow fields similar to
those found in some of the applications for which these solutions are used. Both
self-organizing and covalent polyelectrolytes are to be studied, providing a
valuable bridge between what are often considered two different fields of study.
The SANS experiments proposed here will provide data on chain conformations as a
function of intrinsic stiffness of the polyelectrolyte chains. Of special
interest are the changes in micellar length and in spatial organization
(conformation) that occur with changes in surfactant concentration. This work
will produce the first quantitative numbers concerning the concentration
dependence of micellar growth parameters in dilute solutions. Micelles and
polyelectrolytes are broadly found in biological systems, where they have a
variety of structural and functional roles. They are also ubiquitous in consumer
and industrial applications such as personal-care products, drug-delivery
systems, viscosity modifiers in foods and in processing of polymers, drag
reduction and shear-thinning in heat-exchanger fluids, paints, and surface
modification of materials. Several recent theoretical advances have pointed to
the need for new experimental data such as Magid will gather in her studies of
thread-like micelles and the influence of polyelectrolytes on them.
