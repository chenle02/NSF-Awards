This award supports a program of continued studies using the vacuum ultraviolet
high-resolution spectrometer facility (HRSF) at the SURF II storage ring of the
National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). After more than two
years of intensive work under the previous grant, by the University of the
District of Columbia's faculty and students and NIST personnel, the spectrometer
facility is ready for its intended purpose of measuring useful EUV cross-
sections of interest in Aeronomy: intensity is up by a factor of 120 over two
years ago and the resolution has improved from 0.014 A to , 0.009 A. Experiments
will be performed to measure absolute absorption in N2. The high resolution
measurements near 83.4 nm will provide new information needed to accurately
model the interaction of solar EUV radiation with the terrestrial upper
atmosphere.
