9513661 Senear Sequence specific binding of regulatory proteins to unique DNA
sites is the basis for regulation of transcriptional initiation. These studies
are involved with the roles of protein-protein interactions in mediating these
processes. One aim is to determine how dimer self-assembly and coupled
interactions mediate DNA binding cooperativity. Dimers can self-assemble in
solution to form octamers as the immediate product. Tetramers, the species long
believed to mediate pairwise cooperativity, are minor intermediates in a
concerted reaction. Therefore, coupled interactions are responsible for
selecting a minor component of the solution species distribution as a major
component of the DNA-bound distribution, hence as critical to regulation. By
investigating the thermodynamic cycles that couple repressor self-assembly to
operator binding, one can determine what solution assembly contributes to
cooperativity and what protein and DNA mediated coupling contribute. A second
aim addresses how protein-protein interactions contribute to differential
affinity of repressor dimers for the three OR operator sites. It is now well
established that the separate subunits that bind the two halves of the pseudo-
palindromic operators do not interact independently with DNA. Coupling between
the individual subunit-half site interactions involves both repressor and DNA
conformational changes. Correlating structural and chemical changes resulting in
the dimer interface with effects on dimer stability and operator binding
specificity will lead to an understanding of the mechanisms of inter-subunit
communication and protein structural changes that contribute to differential
operator affinity. ***
