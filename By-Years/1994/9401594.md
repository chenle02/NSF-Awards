9401594 Palmer Holonomic fields are quantum field theories with an intimate
connection to elliptic operators with isolated singularities. The correlation
function or tau-function of such fields have appeared in a wide variety of
contexts including, the scaling limit of the two dimensional Ising model, the
Riemann-Hilbert problem on the complex sphere, level spacing distributions for
random matrices, the KdV hierarchy and its relatives, the asymptotics of
Toeplitz determinants, and recently intersection theory on the moduli space of
Riemann surfaces. A reformulation of the original Sato, Miwa and Jimbo theory
that has been worked out by Professor Palmer makes it possible to consider a
variety of generalizations. The proposal here is to complete the analysis of the
Dirac operators on the hyperbolic disk and to make the field theory connection
by developing an analytic version of the theory of vertex operators. These
vertex operators should also prove useful in simplifying (and generalizing) some
of the algebraic analysis that goes into the theory of vertex operator algebras.
Quantum field theories are mathematical models for quantum mechanics. In
addition the use in mathematical physics in these theories often represent the
beginning of new developments in mathematics. The proposal here involves
explicit description of invariants of earlier quantum field theories. These
descriptions lead to surprising connections with important recent mathematical
developments in algebra and geometry. ***
