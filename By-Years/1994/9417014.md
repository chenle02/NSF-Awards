9417014 Stone This is a proposal for 36 months of support from five faculty at
Syracuse University to investigate the physics of b-quark and the c-quark with
the CLEOIII collaboration at the Cornell electron-positron storage ring, CESR.
The group has a long history of doing physics at CESR, participating in both
construction of the CLEO detector and the analysis. They were leaders in the
important analysis of b-&gt; sy presented at the 27th International Conference
on High Energy Physics in Glasgow, they built the muon system for CLEO and Prof.
Stone was a leader in the development and construction of the CsI calorimeter.
Most recently they have been carrying out extensive tests on a RICH particle
identification device (PID) for installation into CLEOIII. In the next three
year period, in addition to continuing their interest in the analysis, the
Syracuse group will build the PID and develop the data acquisition components
necessary to read the information from it. ***
