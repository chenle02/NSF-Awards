Efficient learning algorithms that use additional information in the form of
queries to a teacher will be studied, with particular emphasis on the
capabilities and limitations of algorithms that use equivalence and membership
queries. Techniques from computational complexity, the analysis of algorithms,
and cryptography will be applied to narrow the gap between provably efficiently
learnable and provably not efficiently learnable classes of concepts. The
problem of missing or incorrect answers to queries and their effects on the
learnability of various concrete hypothesis classes will be studied. The problem
of approximating a distribution by sampling will be studied as a method of
extending Valiant's paradigm of "probably approximately correct" identification
to problems in which negative examples are absent.
