Constraint Databases (CDBs) are an extension of relational databases that enrich
both the relational data model and the relational query primitives with
constraints. For data-intensive applications over non-traditional data, CDBs
hold the promise to combine the versatility of constraints with the commercial
success of the relational approach. This project focuses on the internal query
representation of CDBs queries, i.e., Constraint Query Algebra (CQA). CQA forms
the "middle layer" of CDBs, underneath the user interface layer and above the
disk access layer, providing a homogenous set of operators for expressing
queries over any data. The following challenges related to CQAs are addressed,
both from a theoretical and a practical perspective, leading to an
implementation of CQA: (1) efficient data representation and algebraic operator
implementation; (2) novel indexing and query optimization techniques; (3) safe
use of additional operators and; and (4) integration with front-end query
languages. This project involves collaboration with researchers in other
disciplines, such as Geography and Environmental Sciences, where the research
involves large quantities of spatio-temporal data. This research is expected to
revolutionize the spatio-temporal systems that will enable researchers and
practitioners in the areas of Geography and Environmental Sciences to store and
query their data more efficiently.
