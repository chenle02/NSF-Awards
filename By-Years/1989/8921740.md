The purpose of this award is to assist foreign scientists, academic scholars
and engineers to attend and contribute to Manufacturing International 1990 (MI
1990). This conference is being organized by the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ASME) together with the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineer (IEEE) and the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE). The purpose of
MI 1990 is to provide an international forum for the presentation and exchange
of information, experience, and concerns dealing with the modern manufacturing
enterprise. The purpose of the project will be accomplished by awarding a
monetary honorarium to invited international participants to help defray a
portion of their travel cost to the conference and living expenses while in
attendance. This international participation is both necessary and vital to the
success of such a conference because modern manufacturing and its goal of
successful product competition in the world marketplace has evolved into a
global enterprise.
