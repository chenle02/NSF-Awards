The accurate, efficient and reliable prediction of quantities in turbulent flows
(the focus of the proposed research) forces systematic and integrated
confrontation of basic issues in the modeling, analysis, numerical analysis and
computation of turbulent flows, many of which are linked to basic issues in
other flow problems and other areas of mathematics. Interconnected research sub-
projects include: (i) Eduction of large coherent vortices and detection of false
vortices created by models or numerics, (ii) Development and numerical analysis
of high accuracy and efficiently solvable regularizations of fluid flow
equations, (iii) New algorithms for ill-posed problems and applications, (iv)
Development of LES models for compressible turbulence and analysis of their
acoustic noise predictions, (v) Mathematical foundation for time-averaged large
eddy simulation: continuous transitioning between direct numerical simulation,
large eddy simulation and Reynolds averaged turbulence models, (vi) Uncoupling
multi-physics fluid flow problems in fluid-structure interaction, groundwater-
surface water models and fluid-fluid problems motivated by atmosphere-ocean
coupling, and (v) Precise numerical analysis of time relaxation regularizations.
The accurate, efficient and reliable prediction of quantities in turbulent flows
is a problem of fundamental importance in many applications ranging from global
climate change, homeland security (dispersion of biological or chemical agents),
pollution dispersal, energy efficiency and biomedical device design. Large eddy
simulation is an approach to turbulent flows in which the large features are
separated from the fine details of a flow for a numerical simulation. Hard-won
experience and understanding has grown in large eddy simulation so that the
methods can now successfully simulate benchmark turbulent flows efficiency and
reliably. Scientific and industrial applications are systems of fluid flow
equations coupled to other physical effects. These require even greater
efficiency and accuracy than benchmark turbulent flow problems. To make progress
into these industrial and scientific applications, large eddy simulation now
requires systematic methods for assessing sensitivity and uncertainty as well as
methods for interrogating the large amounts of data coming out of the finer
meshes on faster computers with larger memories. These issues are the focus of
the proposed research. Training PhD students to contribute to this important,
difficult, interdisciplinary, fascinating and beautiful area is a large part of
the proposed effort.
