Title: CAREER: Scalable and Maximal Concurrency
Debugging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concurrency related software defects are among
the most expensive and dangerous in practice, and have become a major threat to
the reliability and security of safety-critical systems and the nation's
critical infrastructure. The intellectual merits of this project are to develop
new theoretical and algorithmic advances, and to build practical automated tools
for debugging concurrent software, which will enable more concurrency bugs
easier to detect and understand, and safer and faster to fix. The project's
broader significance and importance are to help produce more reliable, secure,
and economical software systems and infrastructure, remove concurrency related
vulnerabilities, and strengthen STEM education on software debugging, which is a
critical, but lacking aspect of today's software engineering
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate solutions to four
major research questions on concurrency debugging. (1) Reproduction: How to
reproduce failures in long running concurrent programs with minimal runtime
perturbation and overhead? How to reproduce failures in concurrent programs
running on commodity hardware exhibiting relaxed-memory behaviors? (2)
Detection: How to detect concurrency bugs at the maximum ability and with no
false alarm, even under limited observation, e.g., when missing log events? (3)
Understanding: How to accurately identify the failure's root cause? How to
effectively simplify concurrency bugs and speed up their reproduction? (4)
Fixing &amp; Validation: How to fix concurrency bugs without introducing
deadlocks or unnecessary performance degradation? How to effectively validate
the correctness of fixes?
