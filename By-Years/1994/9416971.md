OCE-9416971 Funding is provided for wireline drilling on drowned reefs in the
tropical Pacific atolls (Christmas and Kanton) to determine whether tropical
Pacific sea surface temperatures were significantly cooler in the past, as well
as provide information about the behavior El Nino Southern Oscillation. In
global change framework, the response of tropical sea surface temperatures to
increasing atmospheric CO2 and other radiatively important trace gases is hard
to predict accurately. Fundamental to these predictions is an understanding of
whether tropical sea surface temperatures have been constant throughout the past
or varied up to 5 degrees C in less than 5000 years.
