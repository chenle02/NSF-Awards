This proposal supports the 2007 Conference on Stochastic Processes and their
Applications, to be held August 5-11, 2007, at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. The SPA meetings, held under the auspices of the Bernoulli
Society for Mathematical Statistics, are one of the premiere international
forums for dissemination of new results in probability and stochastic processes.
These meetings are an important part of the continued development of the
probability community, and present an invaluable opportunity for the development
of young scientists.

The conference features 17 invited speakers from most major areas of stochastic
processes. The conference also hosts the annual Levy Lecture (sponsored by
Elsevier), which will be given this year by Martin Barlow, and two IMS Medallion
Lectures (supported by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics), given this
year by Victor de la Pena and Russell Lyons. The conference will also host the
inaugural Doob Lecture, supported by the Illinois Journal of Mathematics, which
will be given by Marc Yor.
