This award supports travel for keynote speakers and young researchers attending
the 33rd Ohio State-Denison Mathematics Conference, May 13-15, 2016, at the Ohio
State University, Columbus, Ohio. The meeting is focused on the theory of groups
and rings and will attract top mathematicians from around the world, in addition
to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers from all parts of the US. The
conference will foster new collaborations, introduce graduate students to
established researchers and cutting-edge techniques, provide young
mathematicians with opportunities to present their work, and encourage
participation by researchers belonging to under-represented groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year the Ohio State-Denison Mathematics Conference
features keynote talks devoted to GK-dimension of algebras, universal
constructions in rings, and embedding results in groups. There will also be
contributed talks on a wide range of other currently active areas of research,
including clean rings, Leavitt path algebras, projective and injective modules,
and solvable groups.
