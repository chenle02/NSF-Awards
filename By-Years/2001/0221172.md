This project proposes an investigation of the performance and continued
viability of BGP system, including development of new techniques for correlating
massive volumes of routing and topology data and tools to support modeling and
prediction of routing behavior. The research will include evaluation of
incongruity between topology and articulated routing policy, and modeling of
peering policy dynamics.
