The project addresses the enhancement of the first chemical engineering
undergraduate laboratory. This junior-level course is intended to involve
several relatively simple bench-scale experiments related to the material
covered in the introductory chemical engineering. However, the current
laboratory has experiments that are too few for proper illustration of the
curriculum that has not moved with the times and does not involve sufficient
data-acquisition and processing by microcomputers. In order to remedy these
deficiencies, a virtually new start is taken, based on ten experiments, each of
which has been selected so that it illustrates several specific physical
phenomena and principles. It is also likely to stimulate further inquiry on the
part of the students.
