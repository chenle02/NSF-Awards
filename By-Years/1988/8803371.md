This project studied the magnetic effects associated with microstress in
magnetites and titanomagnetites. It continued to extend domain structure
calculations by including defects. In addition, theories were developed to
relate macroscopic parameters (e.g., bulk coercivity) to microscopic ones (e.g.,
microscopic coercivity) to microscopic ones (e.g., microscopic coercivity).
