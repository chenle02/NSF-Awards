This project addresses the topic of dexterity enhancement by macro/micro
bilateral manipulation. Macro/micro bilateral manipulation refers to the use of
a force interpreting master-slave manipulator to provide a human operator the
capacity for dexterous micromanipulation. Micromanipulation refers to any manual
task requiring control of motions and forces well below normal physiological
resolution. The most obvious applications for macro- micro bilateral
manipulators (MMBM) are as assistive devices for microsurgery and microassembly.
This project addresses both theoretical and experimental aspects of MMBM. Its
goal is to understand and describe the features of MMBM behavior that lead to
optimal dexterity enhancement. This is accomplished by examining a class of
tasks in which the MMBM behaves as a hand tool. Specifically, this project
studies the effects of using the tool to match operator and environment
impedances, and of using it to reshape the the environment's impedance,
compensating for the effects of physical scaling laws. A high performance MMBM
will be developed which will be characterized by four degrees of freedom, direct
drive, master and slave manipulators, a multi-processor real time control
system, and a microscope, camera, and monitor for observation of the slave
manipulator and microenvironment. The apparatus will be used to perform a series
of psychophysical experiments to assesss dexterity.
