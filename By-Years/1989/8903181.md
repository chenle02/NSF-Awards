The effect of the clumping of matter on the form that Einstein's equations
should take on various scales (e.g. those including stars, galaxies, and
clusters of galaxies) will be explored. It is already clear from work done on
the first two of these scales, that such parameters as the rate of expansion of
the universe, as estimated from observations, will be affected. Before
quantitative estimates of such effects can be made, it will be necessary to
refine the procedures used for averaging quantities in the Einstein's equations
over a discrete matter distribution. A Swiss-cheese model will be used for the
galaxies, rather than the almost-point model used so far, and this can be
extended to clusters of galaxies. Such clustering must obviously be taken into
account. Filament-void structure may also be investigated eventually, using
computer simulation to find an appropriate probability distribution. The other
refinement needed is finding a more realistic stress-energy tensor for a galaxy,
and afterwards for a cluster. The zero-pressure dust model used so far was
sufficient to establish the general nature of the results, but not to allow
evaluation of constants in the expression for the rate of expansion of the
universe.
