In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program, Hynes will formulate
theoretical descriptions of and perform numerical calculations on several
important types of chemical reactions in solution. The particular focus is on
determining, understanding and predicting how the surrounding liquid solvent can
alter the rates of these reactions. Computer simulations of electron transfer
reactions, of the type important in electrochemistry, will be carried out to
determine the role played by the motion of the solvent molecules in determining
the reaction rates. Related simulations of fluorescent radiation emitted after
laser excitation will further elucidate this role. Theoretical and numerical
studies will be undertaken for proton transfer reactions of the type important
in acid-base chemistry and catalysis. An important feature here is determination
of the role played by quantum mechanical tunneling in the reactions and how this
could be affected by the solvent. Theoretical studies will also be performed to
understand and predict the fundamental mechanism of ionic dissociation reactions
in solution and how the solvent can drastically alter the reaction behavior
compared to the gas phase. A final set of theoretical studies will determine how
a solvent might sufficiently alter the flow of energy inside a highly
vibrationally excited and reactive molecule to enhance the rate of the reaction.
