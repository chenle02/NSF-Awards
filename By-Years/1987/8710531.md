The objectives of this Engineering Initiation Award research project are to
evaluate the performance of grinding of superalloys and aerospace alloys with
superabrasives, to quantify the surface integrity of the ground components, to
obtain limit charts for work- burn, power and surface finish, and to obtain an
off-line optimization strategy which would meet the surface integrity
requirements dictated by work-burn, surface finish and machine tool limitation
in terms of power. The plan is to conduct grinding experiments while measuring
the grinding forces, spindle power, grinding wheel wear, surface roughness and
depth of the heat affected zone, and to analyze and model the results. Limit
charts will be developed for workpiece speed, wheel speed and feed rate by
keeping work-burn, power and surface finish as constraints. Such limit charts
will be used in developing simple off-line optimization strategies for
maximizing the material removal rate by avoiding thermal damage and maintaining
necessary surface finish.
