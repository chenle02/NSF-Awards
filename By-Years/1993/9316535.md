Abstract 9316535 Meyer This project will lead to the development, for flight on
a long- duration Antarctic circum-polar balloon, of a telescope to measure the
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) anisotropy. The instrument will be
mounted on the upper surface of the balloon in order to eliminate interference
from radiation being scattered into the aperture by the balloon and connecting
structures such as cables and it is expected that the systematic errors will be
less than one millionth of a kelvin. The CMBR will be measured at five
frequencies from 150 to 630 GHz and on angular scales from 0.5 to 3 degrees. The
instrument will not be flown in Antarctica until after it has been tested in the
U.S. The project will be partially supported by NASA and will be funded by the
Office of Polar Programs and the Division of Astronomical Sciences at NSF. The
collaboration includes investigators from four US universities, NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center and the Danish Space Research Institute. ***
