In the Western United States, Australia and many other parts of the world,
wildfires are now a seasonal occurrence. Wildfires emit pollutants into the air
creating poor air quality that is hazardous to people?s health and the
environment. Communities use results from high resolution global scale
simulations of wildfire smoke to prepare for poor air quality. This project will
quantify the uncertainty in operational smoke forecasts due to incomplete
knowledge of the smoke plume, wind and other weather conditions. Uncertainty
estimates provide a more complete understanding of smoke forecasts, and can be
communicated along with the predictions. These estimates have the potential to
improve weather prediction models that are affected by smoke, and planning
efforts by rural and downstream communities. This project will support two
graduate students and one undergraduate student per year for each year of the
three year project.

Weak constraint four dimensional data assimilation (4DVAR) will be implemented
to combine wind field, emission and concentration data with a partial
differential equation that describes transport of PM2.5 concentrations generated
by wildfire smoke. Data from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models,
including NCEP and EMCWF, smoke emission models from NOAA and US Forest service,
and concentration data from EPA will be used. The representer method will be
developed for 4DVAR to reduce the search space for the optimal estimates from
the state space to the data space. The computational cost of 4DVAR will be
further improved by developing algorithmic advances for adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) in parallel with storage and checkpointing of adjoints. Approximation of
the Dirac delta distributions, appearing in the adjoint method, will be improved
with a new formulation inspired by the Immersed Boundary Method. Estimates of
PM2.5 concentration, wind field and emission estimates arising in the transport
model will fit observations within specified error covariances. This data
assimilation procedure will quantify the uncertainty in operational smoke
forecasts from historical wildfire events which can be used to estimate
uncertainty in smoke forecasts for future wildfire events.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
