Gessel This award supports the investigations of Gessel on problems in several
areas of enumerative combinatorics. All involve applications of the method of
generating functions, either to solve counting problems or to study sequence of
rational numbers. The topics to be studied are binary trees, noncommutative
symmetric functions, rook theory, rational functions with nonnegative power
series coefficients, and generalized Dedekind sums. This research is in the
general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find
efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be
arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern
communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those
occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science
deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial
research.
