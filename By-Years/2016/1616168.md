The goal of this program is to advance our understanding of cosmology by
studying the physics of black holes and quasars via theoretical simulations. The
PI and Co-I plan to give public talks on topics related to the science of this
proposal, and will develop an interactive GigaPan panoramic imaging program for
the public with simulation data and Sloan Digital Sky Survey images. Broader
impacts of the work also include training of graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will compare state-of-the-art
simulations with observational data on the quasar luminosity function and
correlation function. This information will be used to estimate cosmological
parameters such as primordial non-Gaussianity and normalized growth rate of
structure based on the quasar correlation functions.
