Present techniques of examining recrystallized silicon, including SOI material,
include a wet (acid) etch and examination with an optical microscope, X-ray
diffraction, SEM or TEM microscopes. These techniques are slow, and usually the
sample is destroyed. The PI propose investigating angle-resolved light scatter
techniques as a technique to examine recrystallized silicon as well as other
microelectronics materials. The technique would be nonperturbing, could be
applied in situ, would be fast, and could be adapted for automation.
