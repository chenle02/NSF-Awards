The objective of this research is to answer as directly as possible three
closely related questions: (1) What is the cosmic origin of lithium? (2)
Beginning soon after the big bang, how has the Galactic lithium abundance
varied? (3a) During the main sequence lifetimes of stars with less than one
Solar mass, what mechanism progressively and strongly destroys the atmospheric
lithium which is initially present? and (3b) What presumably distinct mechanism
similarly destroys lithium in a very narrow stellar mass range. Dr. Hobbs will
measure a lithium line from stars in open stellar clusters, from hot, metal.poor
dwarf stars, and from stars in the very young cluster NGC 2264. The origin and
evolution of the element lithium has in recent years reemerged as an important
and challenging problem in astrophysics. The problem impacts the discipline of
cosmology through its connection to the process of nucleosynthesis in the big
bang formation of the Universe. It has now become imperative to obtain, from
observational data, information on the evolution of the abundance of lithium
over the history of our Galaxy.
