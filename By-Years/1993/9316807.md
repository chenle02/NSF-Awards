9316807 Raymond This award is for support for a program of glaciological studies
of Siple Dome and its surroundings between Ice Streams C and D. The purpose of
the work is to characterize the dynamic environment and ice stratigraphy to aid
in the assessment of Siple Dome as a potential deep ice core site, and to
determine whether the configuration of ice stream flow in the region was
different in the past than now. The work involves measurements of the
configuration and continuity of internal layers in the ice, using radar echo
sounding and determination of velocity field, based on standard GPS surveying.
The goals of the work are relevant to understanding the dynamics of the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), its past history and its potential future behavior,
including possible effects on global sea level. This work is a collaborative
project between the University of Washington, the University of Colorado and St.
Olaf College. ***
