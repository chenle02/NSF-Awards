This award is supporting participation by students and early-career researchers
in the Mountain Climate (MtnClim) conference to be held September 12-16, 2022.
The MtnClim conference is focused on mountain climate sciences and the effects
of climate variability on ecosystems and natural resources. The conference
features invited and contributed talks, poster sessions, and working-group
sessions on various aspects of mountain climate science including hydrology,
ecology, and glaciology. Every MtnClim meeting includes sessions or workshops of
value to natural-resource managers addressing implications of climate
variability and climate change in conservation and resource management.
Conference attendees span a range of participants including land managers from
agencies and tribes, natural resource practitioners from non-governmental
organizations, and academics. The theme of this yearâ€™s conference is Science for
Decision-Making in Mountains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is facilitating
access to the conference and increasing the opportunity for student and early-
career participants. The participant support is focused on communities
traditionally under-represented in the mountain science community as well as
early career scientists. In addition to funding students, events will be
included at the meeting to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion for
students and early career participants. These include panels on diversity,
equity, and inclusion, partnering with mentors, peer meetings of student and
early career participants, and professional development opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and
Arctic Natural Sciences programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
