Collective phenomena in solids arising from the interaction between electrons
and between electrons and ions will be studied. Numerical simulation techniques
will be used as well as other more standard techniques. One important area of
study will be models for high temperature superconductors. Close attention will
be paid to clues provided by experimental results. Other areas of study will
include models for low-dimensional quantum magnetism, magnetic impurity systems
and heavy fermion systems. Methodological questions concerning Monte Carlo
methods will also be addressed. Comparison of Monte Carlo results with
predictions of various approximate analytic methods in use will provide
information about the range of validity of these methods.
