It is proposed to study the fluid physics of an actively forced jet in cross
flow, or the transverse jet, for the eventual goal of developing control
methodologies to optimize mixing of such jets. Preliminary experimental and
computational studies made by the PI and her colleagues have shown enhanced
mixing characteristics of transverse jets by acoustic excitation. A more
detailed study is planned for the present proposal.
