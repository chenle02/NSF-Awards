This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Hugo Steinfink,
University of Texas at Austin and Professor Jean-Pierre Wignacourt, Laboratoire
de Cristallochimie et Physicochimie du Solide, Ecole Nationale Superieure de
Chimie de Lille, France. The objective of the project is the synthesis and
characterization of high temperature superconducting materials. In addition to
ceramic preparative techniques, molten oxide chemistry will be used to prepare
compounds with unusual oxidation states. Dr. Wignacourt's expertise in molten
oxide systems will be a unique contribution to the synthesis and single crystal
growth of new phases. The highly oxidizing conditions achievable in such a
medium should yield new compounds of potentially great fundamental interest.
When the compounds are synthesized, their crystal structures and physical
properties will be evaluated. This project will utilize the expertise of both
investigators in the areas of solid state chemistry, crystal structure
determination and physical property evaluation.
