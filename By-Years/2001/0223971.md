The goal for this MUSES exploratory project is to integrate life cycle-based
environmental, social and economic design criteria and ECC microstructure
tailoring to enhance the sustainability of infrastructure systems. Worldwide
construction of concrete infrastructure such as roads, bridges and pipes exceeds
6 billion tons/yr. The resulting impacts are dramatic and include greenhouse gas
emissions, land disturbances, air pollution, and construction-related traffic
congestion and vehicle damage. Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) are a
new class of materials being developed to improve the performance of
infrastructure systems. ECC formulations are designed through microstructure
tailoring of inputs including matrix (cement and fly ash), fiber (virgin and
recycled polymers, and interface elements. While ECC strain capacity is far
superior to normal concrete, overall life cycle costs and benefits have not yet
been evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing these criteria is complex due to
widely varying scales of analysis (nanometers in materials science to kilometers
in the geological sciences), the long-term nature and consequences of
infrastructure systems, and the need to optimize the scheduling of large capital
investments. To address this complexity, this research will draw upon a multi-
disciplinary team from the University of Michigan's Advanced Civil Engineering
Material Research Lab, Center for Sustainable Systems, College of Engineering,
School of Public Health, School of Natural Resources and Environment, and
Department of Geological Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
emphasize student education and research training through two graduate student
research assistantships; specialized industrial ecology curriculum; a field
component at a local cement manufacturer; a MUSES seminar series; and monthly
research team workshops&lt;br/&gt;
