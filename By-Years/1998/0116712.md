This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow the
University of Arkansas to acquire an atomic probe microscope (AFM). The
instrument will enhance research capability at the institution. It will be used
in research (1)on charging effects on surfaces of individual powder particles
and nanoaerosols, (2) in biological specimen analysis, and (3) in surface
characterization of thin films. The management plan will allow efficient use of
the instrument by faculty and students from several departments at the
University of Arkansas. This is an important addition to the infrastructure at
the institution.
