This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will enable an investigation of the
referendum to be held in Canada on October 26, 1992. This referendum involves a
series of constitutional arrangements intended to maintain the country's
geographic and political integrity. Of particular importance is the status of
Quebec. The investigators have gained space on a telephone survey to be
conducted of a national sample of two thousand Canadian respondents. The survey
involves a study of institutionalism and political democracy in Canada with
particular focus on the sociopolitical, economic and cultural values of the
Canadian electorate. The telephone survey will be undertaken with a split- half
sample immediately before and immediately after the October 26th referendum. The
data obtained from this investigation will be archived for use by other social
scientists interested in political behavior and political participation. The
study will provide a unique opportunity to gather data in a timely and cost-
effective fashion on this extremely important referendum issue.
