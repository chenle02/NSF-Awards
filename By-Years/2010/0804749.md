This project will study ophiolites (fragments of oceanic lithosphere) in the
South Eastern Desert of Egypt and use this information to better understand
economically significant mineral deposits. Previous efforts have shown that
application of the fore-arc ophiolite mode to be very useful for understanding
the ophiolitic assemblages in the Central Eastern Desert, and the PIs propose to
similarly study ophiolitic rocks in the southern Eastern Desert. Emphasis will
be placed on understanding ophiolites associated with the best defined suture
zone in Egypt, the Allaqi-Heiani-Gerf suture, which can be continuously traced
from Lake Nasser to the Red Sea just north of the Sudanese border.
&lt;br/&gt;The Broader impacts include societal relevance since the scientific
objective supports an economic objective of understanding what if any controls
the ophiolite exerted on the type and location of economic mineral deposits.
Additionally there will be a diverse scientific benefit to the broader MARGINS
community.&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the NSF Office of
International Science and Engineering.
