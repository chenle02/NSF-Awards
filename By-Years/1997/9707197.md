9707197 BARBER The HATTERAS is a 135' general purpose research vessel
constructed in 1981. The ship is owned by the National Science Foundation and
operated by Duke University under a Charter Party Agreement. In February 1997
the vessel returns to active service after being in lay-up status during 1996.
The vessel is scheduled for 235 days in 1997, of which 120 days are in support
of NSF- funded programs. The Navy will use the vessel for 99 days in support of
programs for ONR, NRL and NAVO. In addition the vessel will provide 16 days
support for DOE, Sea Grant, State of North Carolina and Virginia Institute of
Marine Science oceanographic programs. The HATTERAS is part of a fleet of ships
used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.
Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment be permanently
installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships. The HATTERAS
will operate off the New England and mid-Atlantic coast. ***
