The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has requested several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the three
research vessels the institution operates. A substantial part of the ships'
operating schedule during 1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.
The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of the
institution to support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation
includes: -A disk drive system and other peripheral equipment for increasing
shared-use computing capabilities, -hull-mounted 12-kHz transducers for
obtaining profiles of the seafloor, -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for
continuous measurements of subsurface circulation features, -Precision acoustic
pingers for determining position of an instrument package relative to the
surface or seafloor, -incubation chambers for maintaining and growing plankton
and other biological samples, and -a fume hood for removing chemical fumes from
the ship's laboratory. The instrumentation described above will increase the
capability of the Institution to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering
projects.
