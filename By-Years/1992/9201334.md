In this project in the Chemistry Division, Rodriguez will explore, quantify, and
document the effect of a liquid or solid medium on the static and dynamic
optical properties of porphyrins as well as on other comparable large molecules
such as laser dyes. In this study, the dynamic and static optical properties of
porphyrins in the vapor phase will be compared with those measured in the
condensed phase using static and time-resolved methods that span the
femtosecond- to second-time scales. Properties of interest include vibrational
dynamics, charge-transfer processes, and van der Waals interactions with
condensed-phase media. %%% Much of our present understanding of the behavior of
large molecular systems is based on experimental data acquired on these
molecules in liquid or solid hosts. However, the interaction of the molecules
with the host can modify their behavior, and little effort has been devoted to
document the magnitude of these effects. The results of these investigations
under this Minority Initiation project will provide a framework for judging the
effects of these media on various systems, including biologically important
processes.
