Recent years have seen the loss of massive amounts of multi-year sea ice from
the Arctic Ocean and its replacement by first year sea ice. As first year ice
freezes, a crystalline structure known as frost flowers forms on its surface.
Frost flowers are delicate structures, high in brine content, and susceptible to
wind-driven dispersion unless rapidly buried by snow. Funds are provided to
contribute to a test of the hypothesis that frost flowers are a suitable habitat
for microbes and viruses, advecting them upward with brine and concentrating
them in the frost flowers as these form. Previous research has included
laboratory studies of frost flower formation and isolated field sampling of
these structures. This effort will allow the principal investigator access to a
polynya for a period of time sufficient to sample and study the temporal
evolution of frost flowers and their associated microbial communities.

This award will bring microbial expertise and a US presence to an international
collaboration in Greenland. Results of this project will be incorporated
immediately into a college course on Arctic Change. While in Greenland, the
international team will engage in outreach to local communities. The results of
this research will shed light on potential mechanisms for the air-sea exchange
and subsequent aeolian transport of microbes and viruses.
