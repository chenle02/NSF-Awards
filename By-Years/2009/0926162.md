Using DNA sequences to study population history is growing in popularity, but
many methods assume the DNA studied is not influenced by natural selection.
Thus, scientists often focus on DNA that does not code for proteins and is
assumed to be free from selection. However, this assumption may be faulty. This
project will examine the influence of selection on non-coding DNA and will
evaluate the sensitivity of various methods to this problem. Sequences from
twenty independent regions of DNA sampled from six co-distributed species of
Holarctic ducks will be compared to data simulated without selection.

Results from this study will be broadly applicable, as non-coding DNA is often
used for setting conservation and management priorities, studying species'
responses to climate change, and understanding ecology and natural history.
Also, the six species have a circumpolar distribution, and our project includes
many birds from Arctic Alaska and Russia. Results will provide baseline data for
examining responses to changing environments; for example, climate change may be
contributing to the decline of one species and the expansion of two. Finally,
this project will provide opportunities for postdoctoral training, undergraduate
research, secondary education outreach, and expansion of a long-term
collaboration between US and Russian scientists.
