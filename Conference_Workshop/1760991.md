The Seventh International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis (ICCHA7)
will take place at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN during May 14-18,
2018, in conjunction with the 33rd Annual Shanks Conference and Lecture. The
conference website https://my.vanderbilt.edu/iccha7 contains a list of the
conference plenary speakers and other conference information. Computational
harmonic analysis is a fundamental tool for analyzing and representing
information, and is especially motivated by modern applications where data has
complex structure and massively high dimension. Applications of computational
harmonic analysis include many areas of national technological interest such as
data science, neural networks and artificial intelligence, medical imaging,
radar signal processing, coding theory, and quantum computing. The conference
will discuss the most recent theoretical breakthroughs, practical advances, and
emerging directions in computational harmonic analysis. The plenary speakers
include a diverse assortment of experts, and female and early career scientists
are well-represented. An important broader impact of the conference is to
support the participation of students, early career scientists, and
underrepresented minorities; the conference will make a particular effort to
invite and provide travel support to members of these groups. Travel support
will be strongly prioritized to those without other sources of travel funding,
so as to make the conference accessible those who would not otherwise be able to
attend. This will contribute to expanding and diversifying the nation's talent
pool and workforce in the mathematical sciences by contributing to the training
of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

Specific technical topics addressed at the conference will include, but are not
limited to: compressed sensing, phase retrieval, convolutional neural networks,
wavelets and multiscale transforms, frame theory, graph-based signal processing,
time-frequency analysis, analog-to-digital conversion, signal and image
processing, quantum computation, and mathematical learning theory. A main
intellectual merit of the conference is to provide a venue to disseminate recent
advances in computational harmonic analysis. The conference will consist of
plenary talks, as well as shorter talks and minisymposia in parallel sessions.
There will be numerous opportunities for mathematical interaction and
collaboration among the participants. The conference will provide an
interdisciplinary link between mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from
other fields who are working on computational harmonic analysis.
