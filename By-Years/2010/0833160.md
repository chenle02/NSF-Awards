Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests
funding to support the travel-related costs of 20 graduate students from the
U.S. to attend the Eighth Symposium on Operating Systems Design and
Implementation (OSDI) to be held in San Diego, December 8-10, 2008. OSDI is co-
sponsored by USENIX and ACM SIGOPS. The eighth OSDI seeks to present innovative,
exciting work in the systems area, and will include the 'Women and Minorities in
Systems Research' Workshop on December 6-7,
2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention will be paid to directing
support towards under-represented minorities including women, African-Americans,
Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. The proposal will
allow students to be exposed to a premier conference in systems area that
otherwise they will not have a chance to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
