The three week workshop for twenty undergraduate Physical Chemistry Faculty,
introduces the participants to modern computational chemistry, state to state
reaction dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, physical chemistry of surfaces, and
the principles and applications of superconductors, by a series of lectures and
laboratory experiments provided by experts in each field. Each participant is
committed to implementing aspects of the summer workshop during the academic
year following the workshop, and in reporting on the implementation to their
fellow participants and the project director. The home institutions of the
participants are contributing travel funds for the participation of their
faculty.
