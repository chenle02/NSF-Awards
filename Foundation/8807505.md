The principal investigator will continue research in model theory that falls
under the two general headings of model theory for ordered structures and
monadic second-order logic. In research begun several years ago, he studied the
notion of an o-minimal structure. This work has unified the model theory for
several specific classes of linearly ordered structures, and has yielded general
results known before only in special cases. He wishes to consider several
questions concerning o-minimal structures. Most importantly, he plans to attempt
to develop an analogue to stability theory for linearly ordered structures, and
to investigate the possibilities for a general model theory for classes of
structures whose natural topology is given in a first-order way. The principal
investigator also is currently engaged in writing a monograph with Y. Gurevich
on monadic second-order logic for the "Perspectives in Mathematical Logic"
series. This book will survey both the rich variety of methods that have been
employed to prove the decidability or undecidability of the monadic second-order
theory of various structures, and also the results that have been obtained using
these methods. The book will be written so as to be of interest to both
logicians and theoretical computer scientists.
