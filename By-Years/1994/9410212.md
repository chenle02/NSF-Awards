9410212 Ellis Development of multicellular organisms requires individual cells,
or groups of cells, to adopt fates that differ from their neighbors. These
highly reproducible cell fate decisions must be executed in a spatially and
temporally specific manner. The goal of this work is to understand, at a
molecular and cellular level, how cell fate decisions are regulated during
development. Several consistent themes emerge from the study of cell fate
decisions in both vertebrates and invertebrates: Cell fates are often arrived at
by a process of gradual or sequential restriction of developmental potential.
This restriction of potential is due to specific gene expression or activity.
Cell-cell communication is a critical component of developmental decisions in
all organisms in which the process can be studied. Finally, proteins identified
by genetic analysis of simple organisms as being critical for specific events in
development often play similar roles in higher organisms. Development of insect
sensory organs requires that cells make a spatially specific choice between two
alternative fates, epidermoblast or sensory organ precursor. This study will use
genetic, cellular and molecular approaches to determine the role of a specific
gene in this cell fate choice. In mutants lacking normal gene function,
inappropriate cell fate choices are made resulting in the presence of extra
sensory organs. Thus, this gene must be an important component of the mechanisms
that regulate formation of sensory organ precursors. This work will provide
fundamental information about gene regulation and cell-cell communication.
