The PI's long term research goal is to investigate the properties of high
dimensional probability measures and understand the geometry that lies
underneath. In pursuit of this goal the PI plans to quantify the concentration
phenomena that appears, by further investigating the structure and geometry of
the family of centroid bodies that is generated by the measure. This leads to
several research directions that explore the connections of the theory of high-
dimensional measures with Convex geometry (and local theory of Banach spaces),
classical Analysis (PDE's and isoperimetric inequalities) and Probability theory
(including generic chaining).

The general principle in high dimensional systems is that they have the tendency
to congregate around typical forms. For general measures this is a relatively
new discovery. The proposal is dedicated to the investigation of these
phenomena. This theory has already found significant applications in
probability, combinatorics, mathematical physics and informatics, with the
recurrent theme being that of extending known results to a much broader setting
without any assumptions on "randomness". Any progress in the direction of this
proposal will be of great importance to every field interested in high
dimensional phenomena.
