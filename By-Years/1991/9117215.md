The principal investigator will study the thermodynamic mixing properties of
felsic silicate melts, utilizing experimental and theoretical techniques. The
chemical systems to be studied are feldspar-quartz-iron silicate. The long-range
goal is to further our understanding of the role of phase equilibria in
dictating the genesis and evolution of felsic magmas.
