Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research projects on the
Juneau Icefield, Alaska. For more than 40 years, research emphasizing geology,
glaciology, geophysics, glacio- meteorology, geobotany, and surveying, has been
conducted on this icefield. With cooperation between the University of Idaho's
Glaciological and Arctic Environmental Sciences Institute and the Foundation for
Glacier and Environmental Research, this research/educational activity aims at a
total systems study of one of North America's largest icefields. Under
supervision of professors of unique experience, drawn from the University of
Idaho and other universities, each undergraduate will select a research project
and be encouraged to exercise as much independent judgment and initiative as
possible in its development. Undergraduates selected will be earth science
students who demonstrate scholarly aptitude, motivation, and research potential.
The staff will be available throughout the season for advice and help, including
lectures, seminars and site specific instructions in methodologies to insure and
effective research experience.
