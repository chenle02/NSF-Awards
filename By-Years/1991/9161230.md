In the next decade indium phosphide based lasers are expected to be critically
important in integrated electrooptic devices and fiber optics communication due
to their high speed and bandgap in the near infrared spectral region. Semi-
insulating titanium doped indium phosphide is required for fabrication of high
speed, high power, low threshold, long lasting lasers with low leakage currents.
This material cannot currently be fabricated by MOCVD, which is a preferred
method of manufacture, due to the low volatility and instability of the
available titanium source reagents. In Phase I five new titanium source reagents
specifically engineered for high volatility will be synthesized and tested as
InP dopants.
