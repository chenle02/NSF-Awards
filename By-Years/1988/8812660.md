The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
structural and earthquake engineering between Jure Banovec of the University of
Ljubljana's Department of Civil Engineering and Helmuth Krawinkler of Stanford
University is to investigate the inelastic response of reinforced concrete
buildings subjected to earthquakes. The investigators are part of four person
team led by Peter Fajfar of the University of Ljubljana and Stephen Mahin of the
University of California, Berkeley. The Fajfar-Mahin project is also supported
by the U.S.-Yugoslavia Program. All four investigators will address the same
problem using an analytical model developed by the Yugoslav engineers. This
research has the potential to advance seismic design requirements of buildings
and is particularly suitable for U.S. and Yugoslav joint research. It involves
the leading U.S. and Yugoslav research groups in the field. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal
Yugoslav institute. Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and
a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
