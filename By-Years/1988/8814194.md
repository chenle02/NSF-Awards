The work is in the field of astrophysics. The origins and structure of the
universe will be investigated by studying cosmic rays impinging on the earth
from outer space. Measurements of cosmic ray showers will be made to establish
and determine the properties of point sources of these rays. A novel detector
will be developed and constructed made up, primarily, of 64 tracking stations.
Each station consists of eight proportional wire chambers each with an area of
1.25 square meters. The directions of individual tracks in the stations will be
used to reconstruct the incident cosmic ray direction to 1/4 deg. This technique
has the potential to increase the sensitivity, per area covered, by a factor of
16 compared to cosmic ray arrays of conventional design.
