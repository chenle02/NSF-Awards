The research is aimed at understanding the failure of ceramic materials as a
result of applied mechanical loads over a wide range of ambient temperature.
Failure in the low to moderate temperature range is typically the result of slow
crack growth where mechanical creep alters the driving forces for the crack
growth. Failure in the intermediate temperature region results from slow crack
growth, but the major effect of the mechanical creep is to alter the
microstructure of the material in the vicinity of the crack tip. The high
temperature range is characterized by failure which is dominated by mechanical
creep, e.g., creep-induced microcrack nucleation, coalescence, and finally
rupture. Digital Image Correlation will be used to map the creep deformations in
crack tip regions, and to identify possible inhomogeneities in the overall
deformation and damage. The research will build upon the advances made during
the last three years of support by the National Science Foundation under grant
number DMR-8311699. The results will be used to develop models which predict
reliability and lifetime for ceramics in high temperature applications.
