The CEDAR program is a multi-instrument coordinated effort to study some of the
fundamental aeronomic science problems. In order to take full advantage of the
total data obtained it was recognized at an early stage in this program that a
combined data base would be necessary. Plans have been laid to set up this
photometric, spectroscopic, Lidar, radar and imaging data base at NCAR. The
program under this award will provide the data handling and analysis software
for this data base. The plan is to adapt an already proven, highly reliable and
well regarded software structure to the new CEDAR computer facility data base at
NCAR.
