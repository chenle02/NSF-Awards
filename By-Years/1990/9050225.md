The St. Louis Science Center plans to design and develop a 2400-square-foot
permanent exhibit dealing with the fields of cellular and molecular biology,
including biotechnology and genetic engineering. The primary goal of the exhibit
is to affect the attitudes of millions of visitors, with the secondary goal
being to serve as a model for other science museums and science centers.
