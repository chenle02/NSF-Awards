The project is 1) improving advanced courses in the Building Science
undergraduate program through the use of whole-systems thinking; 2) using
innovative tools and teaching methodologies to reinforce the current changes in
the building industry from traditional design-bid-build project delivery to
integrative design project delivery; and 3) having students experience a
collaborative, project-based learning environment as a two-semester capstone
program within their degree curriculum. The project replaces lecture-format
courses with a project-based Integrative Design Experience Laboratory (IDEXlab)
- an integrative design-fabrication-and-assembly studio with the objective of
more profound learning as well as more effective and creative teaching. The
pilot program seeks to bridge the gap between the traditional classroom and
professions within the design and construction industry by promoting: 1) peer
discussion and instruction; 2) effective collaboration between architectural and
construction management concentration students; 3) critical thinking; 4) an
interest in design and research in Building Science; and 5) the celebration of
breakthroughs and discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the
building design and construction needs of rural Appalachia by providing a
service-learning platform for students to engage while simultaneously offering
real-world problems (which include physical sites, clients, and budgets) for
students to solve creatively. Effective implementation of an innovative
curriculum at Appalachian State University can serve as a model for other large
institutions to consider the adoption of the IDEXlab curriculum as a replacement
for traditional architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) science
curricula.
