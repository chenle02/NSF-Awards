This regional consortium of two- and four-year colleges will conduct a week-long
professional development seminar for college mathematics teachers in the East
Tennessee area during the summer of 1992 followed by three week-end seminars in
the 1992-93 academic year. The seminars are laboratory-based and are designed to
introduce participants to discrete dynamical analysis, provide them with
extensive opportunities on the use of calculators and computers for exploration
and problem solving, and lead them to a continued interest in collaborative
research and professional development. In addition, these seminars will provide
opportunity and stimulation for cooperative development of new curricular
materials and instructional techniques for the use of calculators and computers
in the teaching of mathematics in post-secondary classes from the beginning
levels through calculus.
