0304043 Fenske Partial support is provided to a conference on boundary
lubrication to be held under the auspices of Engineering Conferences
International. The conference will make an in-depth evaluation of the state of
research in the area of boundary lubrication, including input from a number of
fields - design, mechanics, chemistry, surface reactions, lubricant composition,
and others. It will bring together industrial practitioners, university
researchers and graduate students for informal discussions.

The broader impact of the conference will eventually be felt in lower energy
losses in a variety of transportation systems, resulting in significant energy
conservation and decrease in CO2 release. ***
