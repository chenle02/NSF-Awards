The objective of this project is to investigate the role of segment-solvent and
segment-cosolvent hydrogen bonding on the phase behavior of ethylene-based
copolymer solutions. The approach used to reach this objective is to
experimentally investigate the phase behavior of solutions which consist of
polar/nonpolar, statistically random copolymers with polar and nonpolar solvents
and cosolvents. The polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities of the copolymers
will be systematically varied by controlling the concentration of nonpolar and
polar groups in the polymer backbone. The solvents will vary from the low-
molecular-weight, nonpolar hydrocarbons to highly polar, hydrogen bonding
hydrocarbons. Cosolvents such as dimethyl ether and ethanol will be used with
the nonpolar solvents to determine the importance of hydrogen bonding and
polarity on the phase behavior. Cloud-point curves and binary and ternary phase
diagrams will be constructed at temperatures up to 448 K and at pressures up to
275 MPa--conditions which also bracket the free-radical polymerization process
that is used for ethylene-based copolymers. The data will be modeled using the
Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state in its present form and in a form revised to
explicitly account for hydrogen bonding.
