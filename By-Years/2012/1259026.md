The Transylvania University (TU) STEM Scholars Program provides four years of
support to two cohorts of freshmen entering in successive years, with up to 15
students comprising each cohort. Participants in the TU STEM Scholars Program
are recruited from students who are intended majors in biology, chemistry,
computer science, mathematics, physics, neuroscience or environmental science.
In addition to the financial support from the S-STEM scholarships, program
activities to recruit and retain students include personalized mentoring and
advising by STEM faculty members, workshops on quantitative reasoning and
learning habits, scientific lectures, a science and math journal club, summer
research experiences, and presentations on STEM career opportunities.

Intellectual Merit: Through the various cohort-building activities and other
support mechanisms provided the students selected to participate in the TU STEM
Scholars Program, this project contributes to the knowledge base of effective
recruitment and retention strategies for undergraduate STEM students. The fusion
of existing TU student services with those developed through this project
provides a model for other similar institutions.

Broader Impacts: The S-STEM scholarships allow students from disadvantaged
socioeconomic backgrounds to pursue an education as a major in a STEM discipline
at a private liberal arts university. More than one-third of recent incoming
students to Transylvania are first generation college students. Thus, the TU
STEM Scholars Program is broadening participation to individuals who otherwise
may not have had opportunities to become STEM professionals.
