0853825&lt;br/&gt;Tewksbury&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research
conducted by Ms. Kimberly Sheldon under the direction of Dr. Joshua Tewksbury of
the University of Washington, will investigate how temperature variation
influences the thermal physiology of beetle species across a broad latitudinal
gradient. Research will be conducted in Argentina in collaboration with Dr.
Federico Ocampo, a researcher at the Instituto Argentino de Investigaciones de
Zonas Aridas (IAIZA). Dr. Ocampo is an expert in South American beetles and will
expand Ms. Sheldon?s knowledge of this system as her current advisory committee
does not have expertise in the proposed taxa of study. Quantifying the
relationship between temperature and latitude is critical for modeling impacts
of climate change in tropical and temperate regions. Furthermore the research
will investigate how temperature shapes altitudinal distributions and thereby
will improve understanding on the impact of warming temperatures on current
distributions of organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will add thousands
of specimens to beetle collections in Argentina, Ecuador, and the US, collected
explicitly to provide a specimen-based record of community structure up tropical
and temperate mountains. Currently there are few such collections, and most of
these are local or regional, making broad comparisons across latitude
impossible. This work will provide a comparative collection for teaching and
scientific research into the future. Additionally this proposal will support
international dissertation research for one U.S. graduate student and will also
provide a research opportunity for an undergraduate student in Argentina.
