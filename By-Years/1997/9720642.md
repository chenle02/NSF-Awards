9720642 Benfield The three South Dakota research universities, South Dakota
State University, the University of South Dakota, and South Dakota School of
Mines and Technology, will collaborate to develop infrastructure that promotes
competitiveness on the part of individual investigators. Another partner in this
project is the Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center, a federal
facility located in the state. Infrastructure development and co-funding
endorsement will be in the context of three scientific areas and one supporting
area, all chosen for their relationship to the South Dakota economy, for the
existence of scientific talent in the state, and for the inherent potential for
independent fundability. The scientific focus areas are: (1) Biological Response
to Stress; (2) Geophysical Processes of the Northern Plains; and (3) Materials
and Processes for the 21st Century. The supporting technical area is
telecommunications and information technology. In addition, infrastructure
development activities will be carried out. Such activities will include: (1)
new faculty start- up costs to assist new faculty members in establishing
laboratories for their research and for purchasing scientific equipment; (2)
investigator special travel awards provided specifically for faculty to travel
to funding agencies in Washington to discuss grant opportunities and procedures;
(3) Rushmore Conferences to host a national conference in South Dakota in each
of the three primary focus areas as well as two special conferences on "Native
Americans in Science," and "The Scientist as Entrepreneur;" (4) graduate
fellowships, nine special fellowships each year to attract the best students to
South Dakota; (5) undergraduate research fellowships, to support a total of 30
undergraduates every year in summer research involvement; (6) a joint industry
program with North Dakota to place students in industrial internships; (7) an
annual state EPSCoR conference held in the st ate, including a joint conference
with North Dakota in 1999; (8) a seminar series, enabling each primary focus
group to host two national speakers per year by bringing them to one campus and
broadcasting their visit interactively to the other schools; (9) a proposal
enhancement program to provide small grants to faculty who submit proposals to
major external funding agencies, coupled with proposal-writing workshops; and
(10) equipment funds to purchase state-of-the-art research instrumentation
related to the above focus areas, which will permit South Dakota faculty to
carry out competitive research.
