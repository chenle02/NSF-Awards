This project will continue theoretical studies and associated computer
simulation and modeling of a range of basic solar wind properties and their
interactions with cosmic rays. The PI will study the structure of the
interplanetary magnetic field and plasma, emphasizing the effect of the field's
structure on cosmic ray and energetic particle acceleration, propagation and
anisotropies. In addition, the PI will observe the effect fluid flows such as
the solar wind can help accelerate the solar wind near the sun. This
understanding can then be used to probe distant, unexplored regions of the solar
wind using cosmic ray observations.
