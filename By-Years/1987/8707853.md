Low-heat-rejection combustion engines show promise of higher efficiencies than
their conventionally cooled counterparts. To place the potential improvements in
efficiency on firmer ground, experiments will be performed to measure the
instantaneous surface temperatures and heat fluxes at several locations in the
combustion chamber of a single-cylinder diesel engine. These results will yield
realistic estimates of the heat transfer coefficients at the interfaces between
engine components and their surroundings. Further, the results will be used to
assess and further develop analytical models of the in-cylinder heat transfer
processes.
