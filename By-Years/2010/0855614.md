The research that the PIs intend to perform consists of several projects
involving both formal and phenomenological aspects of String Theory and related
theories of gravity, and supersymmetric gauge theories. The purpose of the
proposed activity will be to extend our knowledge of fundamental physics,
including but not limited to the structure of cosmic singularities like the Big
Bang, the quantum nature of black holes, critical properties of gauge theories,
and the relation between physics at very short distance scales characteristic of
string theory and physics at scales observable in experiments. More
specifically, the PI will conduct research aimed at understanding space-like
singularities using holographic correspondences involving non-critical string
theory, Matrix theory, and the AdS/CFT correspondence. He will also use
scattering techniques to decode microstates of black holes. The co-PI will
investigate the properties of strongly-coupled scaling limits of SUSY gauge
theories, applying new techniques that he recently helped to develop. He will
also study the structure of magnetically charged particles in SUSY gauge
theories and the flows of a class of string-inspired gauge theories from high to
low energies. Part of the funds will be used to invite leading workers in the
field to visit the University of Kentucky to give seminars and to engage in
detailed discussions, which could lead to future collaborations. A few
distinguished visitors will be invited to deliver popular lectures aimed at
encouraging young undergraduates to choose physics as a career and to
disseminate frontier results in physics among a broad cross-section of the
community.
