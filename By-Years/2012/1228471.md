Maintaining the security of one's systems and devices in a way that ensures the
right balance between functionality, security, and convenience remains
complicated for most people. For example, people are routinely asked by their
systems whether to accept a security certificate, install an application, heed
security warnings, or reconfigure operating-system security settings. While
these examples represent situations in which people regularly find themselves,
people rarely have any basis to make an informed decision or to establish one
conveniently. This research examines the concept of 'crowdsourced security'
where the solution lies in people leveraging members of their community to
secure their systems and devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this
research is to determine the potential of crowdsourcing as a complementary
strategy for enhancing security. An example challenge addressed in this research
pertains to the security of one's personal data. Specifically the research seeks
to develop security mechanisms that can exploit naturally occurring social
relationships and utilize 'human computation' to shift the burden of security
via authentication from machines to humans. Within this framework, the research
investigates both questions about the technical effectiveness of crowdsourced
security solutions, as well as socio-behavioral questions about users'
preferences, motivations, and privacy concerns about such systems. This research
will benefit society by producing a deeper understanding of how systems can be
better secured through human participation and collaboration, moving beyond the
status quo of current security mechanisms.
