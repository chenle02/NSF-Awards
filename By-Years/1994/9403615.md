DMS-9403615 Kuperberg, W. The proposed research is in the area of Discrete
Geometry and involves the packing and covering of space with congruent replicas
of a convex body. The PI will extend his work in two dimensions to dimension 3
and higher. Some of the PI's earlier work has been applied in Computational
Geometry for creating geometric algorithms and estimating their computational
complexity; the proposed work should be equally applicable. ??
