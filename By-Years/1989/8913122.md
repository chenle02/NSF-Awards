The contractor will carry out the 1990 Survey of Academic Research Facilities,
a sample survey of higher education institutions that collects data on the
status and condition of science and engineering research facilities. A "Quick
Response Survey" was conducted in 1986 followed by a more detailed full- scale
facilities survey in 1988. Tasks involved in the 1990 followup study include
conduct of data collection activities, tabulation of data results, provision of
technical support as required for the National Science Foundation's own
analytical uses of the data, and production of a final analytical report
summarizing the results of the study, for submission to Congress in September
1990. A second analytical report on the biomedical sciences will be prepared for
the National Institutes of Health, co-sponsors of the study. The Authorization
Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-159) directed NSF to "...design, establish, and
maintain a data collection and analysis capability in the Foundation for the
purpose of identifying and assessing research facilities needs of universities."
This study, initiated in response to the above mandate, provides quantitative
and qualitative information on the amount, cost, and condition of existing
research facilities as well as current and planned construction and
repair/renovation activities, including the sources of funding for these capital
projects.
