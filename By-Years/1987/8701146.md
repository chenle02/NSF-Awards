Each year the Division of Cross.Disciplinary Research sponsors a symposium to
inform the engineering community of the activities of the Engineering Research
Centers. The purpose of this symposium is to show how the Centers are meeting
the goals of the ERC program in the areas of cross.disciplinary research and
education, and in the promotion of industrial interaction with academic
engineering programs. This year the symposium will be conducted in conjunction
with the annual meeting of the American Society for Engineering Education. This
meeting normally attracts about 2,000 engineering educators from all engineering
disciplines. Since part of the purpose of the ERC program is to change the
"culture" of engineering education and research, it is expected that the ERC
sarellite symposium will be attended by representatives of large and small
universities and will provide a forum to implement this change.
