Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a large, but poorly understood, family of
proteins. In vertebrates and many invertebrates, sHsps are constitutively found
in muscle cells where they may play roles in homeostasis and injury repair.
Preliminary results obtained in the Shelden laboratory have revealed striking,
stress-dependent recruitment of the ubiquitous small heat shock protein, Hsp27,
to muscle myofibrils. This research focuses on defining the mechanism and
functional significance of this recruitment and specifically addresses the
following questions: 1) How is Hsp27 regulated when it associates with
myofibrils, and what is the effect of regulation on its function?, 2) What are
the kinetics of association between Hsp27 and myofibrils during injury? and, 3)
What is the target for Hsp27 within myofibrils? The project will employ
immunolocalization as well as ulltrastructural and biochemical approaches to
examine stress-induced redistribution of Hsp27 and phosphoserine mutants of
Hsp27 in zebrafish embryos. Completion of this work will substantially advance
the understanding of Hsp27 regulation and function in muscle cells. These
studies are also expected to advance general understanding of sHsp functions and
response of muscle cells to stress and injury, especially in vivo. Such
knowledge may ultimately be used to enhance muscle growth, or ameliorate injury
and age-dependent muscle dysfunction in commercial or clinical settings, and
permit a better understanding of adaptations to environmental stress in
poikilotherm (cold blooded) animals. In addition, the project will support
outreach and educational activities to students in area elementary schools and
junior and senior high school students at a local summer science camp program.
