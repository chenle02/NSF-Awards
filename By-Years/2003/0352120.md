4th International Workshop on Structural Control
(4IWSC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;(PI: Andrew
Smyth)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4th International Workshop on Structural Control
(4IWSC) will be held in June 10-11, 2004 at Columbia University in New York.
This workshop will serve as a focused working meeting to chart new directions in
research, international collaboration and highlight newly available research
infrastructure available to the structural control and monitoring research
community. NSF funding supports a special session on "Distributed Sensing for
Structural Systems" to highlight developments in sensing and sensor networking,
and also supports graduate student participation with a particular emphasis on
involvement in Working Group activities which have specific research objectives.
