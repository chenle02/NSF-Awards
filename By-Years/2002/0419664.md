A. PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most critical phases in the
life of a new organism is embryonic cleavage, a series of rapid, synchronous
cell divisions that populates the fertilized egg's volume with zygotic nuclei,
clonally segregates its developmental potential, and reduces cell volume to that
of somatic cells. Cleavage differs in several ways from somatic-cell mitosis,
particularly by its synchrony, rapidity, and reliance on maternally synthesized
components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective of the proposed
research is to understand the morphogenetic role of embryonic cleavage in the
development of the frog Xenopus laevis. During cleavage, a large amount of new
basolateral membrane is laid down along the early cleavage planes by localized
exocytosis. As it expands, this new membrane carries out a number of integrated
activities that are important for embryonic development, including establishment
of tight junctions along the apical-basolateral boundaries, maintenance of cell-
cell adhesion, and formation of the blastocoel. Recent work reveals a burst of
protrusive activity along the expanding cleavage furrow, including the extension
of filopodia that form attachment sites across the furrow gap. The aims of the
proposed research are to test the idea that the protrusive activity is important
for cadherin-dependent blastomere adhesion, and that the newly established
apical and basolateral membrane domains are maintained by flow of membrane and
underlying cortex from the furrow base outward to the apical-basolateral
boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed experiments will advance our
understanding of the respective developmental roles of specific cell-biological
functions, including cell-cell adhesion, protrusive activity, and cortical flow
in a key early morphogenetic process. In a broader context, the research
activities will provide a useful training ground for graduate students,
undergraduates and high school students interested in the basic cell biology of
early amphibian development.&lt;br/&gt;
