A series of experiments are being developed by the Geology Department at Colgate
University to introduce undergraduates to modern analytical methods using the
scanning electron microscope and the EDAX X-ray Analysis System. These
experiments are being introduced into existing departmental courses with
increasing levels of sophistication. The project also involves activities
directed at larger audiences consisting of non-science students, faculty and
secondary school students. In addition, the instrumentation is being used to
enhance the existing program of cooperative student-faculty research, consistent
with the departmental philosophy that problem-oriented research efforts are an
essential part of undergraduate science education.
