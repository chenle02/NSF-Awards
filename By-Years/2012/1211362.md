This grant renewal will support high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic
studies of comets in order to test theories about the early formation of the
solar system. Comets are remnants from the early solar system that retain the
volatiles (ices) from the cold outer protoplanetary disk where they formed. The
proposing team will characterize the cometary volatile composition in the near-
infrared spectral domain, simultaneously searching for a number of parent
molecules via multiple spectral lines of each species; these parent molecules
include water, oxidized carbon compounds, symmetric hydrocarbons, and nitriles.
They will also conduct complementary searches for deuterated water and
deuterated methane in order to constrain the deutrerium-to-hydrogen ratio. The
observations will help constrain chemical formation pathways for water and pre-
biotic organic molecules in cometary ices, the evolution of volatile matter in
the early Solar System, and exogenous delivery of water and pre-biotic molecules
to Earth. The project will support undergraduate research and enable student
participation in professional astronomical observing runs and in local and
national conferences. Also, the team will contribute to the professional
development of high-school science teachers in the Washington, DC and Saint
Louis, MO metropolitan areas, by conducting a 45-hour workshop on "Comets,
Origins, and Life: Interdisciplinary Science in the Secondary Classroom".
