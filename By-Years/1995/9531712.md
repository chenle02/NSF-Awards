9531712 Silcox This REU-Site award presents an outstanding opportunity for
fifteen undergraduates to engage in a materials research and educational
activity over a ten-week summer period with faculty, students and staff in six
interdisciplinary research groups in the Materials Science Center. The groups
are pursuing an u understanding and control of materials at the nanoscopic
scale. More specifically, the groups: (1) use creative chemical synthesis to
understand and enhance the properties of polymer phase boundaries; (2) prepare
and characterize polymer nanocomposites of metallic molecular clusters in
polymer matrixes and layered intercalation composites; (3) explore the
properties of optically active composite materials; (4) develop understanding
and control of then film deposition on glass and (95) develop understanding of
film deposition using energetic supersonic neutral and hyperthermal ion beam;
and exploit uniquely structured nanoscale materials to elucidate fundamental
issues of defects and impurities in quantum systems and quantum transport. %%%
The goals of this program include: (1) enabling students to experience the
thrill of carrying out their own research; and (2) encouraging students to use
several world central facilities to perform their research and obtain marketable
technical skills for their future careers. Students will be required to prepare
a written report and present their research results orally at the end of the
Summer research forum. ***
