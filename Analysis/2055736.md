Algebra, analysis, geometry, and dynamics are some of the major branches of
modern mathematics. Algebra studies the rules to work with mathematical symbols
in ways that generalize addition and multiplication. Analysis deals with
approximations of numbers, functions and other mathematical objects. Geometry
concerns itself with notions such as shape, distance, angle, etc. Dynamics
studies motions and in particular their long-term behaviors. This research
project lies in the area of operator algebras and noncommutative geometry, which
uses advanced techniques from algebra and analysis to study mathematical
problems that are often geometrically and dynamically motivated. Outreach
activities to foster communication and collaboration, especially among early-
stage mathematicians will also be carried out.

This project focuses on regularity properties and K-theory of operator algebras
of dynamical nature, in particular, crossed product C*-algebras. It is motivated
by applications in several areas of mathematical research. On the one hand, to
further advance the (already spectacular) applications of noncommutative
geometry to the celebrated Novikov conjecture in differential topology, the PI
aims to study the K-theory of group C*-algebras of groups of diffeomorphisms on
smooth manifolds. On the other hand, the classification program for simple
separable nuclear C*-algebras has spawned and highlighted a number of regularity
properties of C*-algebras, and the PI is working on transporting these
properties to the dynamical setting, so as to aid future applications to the
classification and structure theory of topological dynamical systems.
