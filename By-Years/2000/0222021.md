This proposal is for the purpose of planning and carrying out a series of 5
workshops between SRS/NSF and scientific and technical professional societies.
This activity had been conducted in the past as a way for the professional
societies and NSF to use their data in complementary fashion. The purpose of the
workshops is to continue to build these relationships.
