Abstract for the proposal DMS-0700030 of Mao

This work concerns some problems in the theory of automorphic forms. The PI
will use the theory of automorphic representations to study problems in half
integral weight forms, including algorithm for L-values based on a relation
between L-values and Fourier coefficients of half integral weight forms. The PI
and others will investigate the generalization of this relation to L-values of
automorphic forms on higher ranked groups. The PI will also look at Gindikin-
Karpelevich type formulas and investigate their application in relative trace
formula.

This research is in the area of number theory. Number theory has its historical
roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
