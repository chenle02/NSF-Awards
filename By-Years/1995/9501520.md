9501520 Feng The primary focus of the research over the past few years has been
to develop new models and to utilize existing models which are physically
reasonable and computationally feasible in order to correlate the multi-faceted
aspects of the structure of medium and heavy nuclei. The aim is to gain a
comprehensive and profound understanding of nuclei in regions of the N-Z
landscape which are vital to our understanding the evolution of the universe and
which have yet proven inaccessible to laboratories on earth. The common thread
is to build from the fundamental shell model, the "standard model" in nuclear
structure physics. Specific research directions include the development of the
Drexel University Shell-Model (DUSM) code as a numerical implementation of the
shell model; the Fermion Dynamical Symmetry Model (FDSM) to study the collective
aspects of larger nuclei; a pseudo-spin pseudo-orbit model which aims at a
"grand unification" of low- and high-spin spectroscopy; the projected shell-
model, as well as a generalized pair shell-model, to enhance our understanding
of high-spin physics and the collective behavior of nuclei; and the mean- field
Hartree-Fock approach, which addresses the global properties of nuclei. ***
