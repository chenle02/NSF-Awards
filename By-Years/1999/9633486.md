Previous work indicates that the particulate organic matter (POM) in sea ice of
the Weddell Sea is strongly enriched in 13C and 15N relative to seawater POM.
This project will test the hypothesis that stable isotopic values in Southern
Ocean sediments are significantly affected by ice-algal input, which may have
been misinterpreted as variations in nutrient utilization and productivity. The
project will examine transects of surface sediments to determine if a north-
south gradient exists consistent with the hypothesis, and will also determine
stable isotope variations in several cores spanning the last glacial to track
possible changes in ice-algal input.
