Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0403096&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Selman Akbulut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gokova Geometry-Topology
Conferences are a series of annual&lt;br/&gt;conferences held in Gokova, Turkey
since 1992. The international&lt;br/&gt;scientific committee selects topics over
a wide range of geometry&lt;br/&gt;and topology. Many of the participants are
junior researchers or&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, often making their first
international&lt;br/&gt;presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports
U.S. participants in three years of meetings.&lt;br/&gt;Up to date information
on Gokova Conference programs and&lt;br/&gt;schedules is available at
