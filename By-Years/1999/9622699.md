9622699 Goldburg This award provides support for the acquisition of a laser
Doppler velocimeter for the purpose of studying turbulence in soap films. The
goal of this project is to better understand two-dimensional turbulence as well
as the physics of a soap film under shear. We have demonstrated that a laser
Doppler velocimeter is a powerful instrument for exploring turbulence in soap
films and for studying their unexpected rheological properties. %%% It follows
from the basic laws that govern fluid flow, that two-dimensional (2D) turbulence
differs qualitatively from its three-dimensional (3D) counterpart. Soap films
are so thin relative to their lateral dimensions that, to a very good
approximation, they should behave like a 2D fluid. Nevertheless there are very
few experiments to support this claim. In our laboratory we have produced strong
enough turbulence in a soap film that its two dimensional character becomes
apparent. The instrument is one of general utility and will be used in ordinary
three-dimensional turbulence as well. ***
