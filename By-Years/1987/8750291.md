This project is to add four Sun 3/110C microcomputers to the imaging and
operating systems laboratory. The courses associated with the laboratory will be
radically changed to allow the teaching and experimentation in advanced
graphics. Student research in the area of Lyndenmayer Systems will be conducted.
In the area of operating systems, experiments in process scheduling, device
handling, multiple asynchronous processes and paged virtual memory systems are
planned.
