9450042 Honey This project, Telementoring Young Women in Engineering and
Computing, is a collaboration between the Center for Children and Technology
(CCT), the Department of Energy's Office of Scientific Computing, and Bolt,
Beranek, and Newman's NSF-funded National Testbed Project. The project develops
a telementoring environment to encourage young women in secondary schools to
pursue careers in engineering and computing. CCT will develop telecommunications
environments that enable high school girls in technical courses to communicate
on an ongoing basis with successful women professionals and college students.
These environments will be designed to provide girls with the validation and
advice that may not be available in traditional educational settings. CCT will
also develop informational parent forums and an electronic archive of existing
exemplar equity materials to assist parents and teachers in supporting girls'
pursuits in engineering and computing. Following the research and development
phase, the telementoring project will be implemented nationally through the
Department of Energy's Adventures in Supercomputing program. ***
