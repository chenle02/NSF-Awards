9503234 Stanback The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a six-month postdoctoral
research visit by Dr. Mark Stanback with Dr. Robert Simmons at the Namibia
National Veterinary Laboratory in Windhoek, Namibia. The goal of this project is
to study sperm storage and sperm competition in Tockus hornbills. The focus will
be on the red-billed (T.erythrorhynchus) and Monteiro's hornbills (T. monteiri).
Using a population of Tockus hornbills breeding in nestboxes, the PI will
combine a field experimental approach with laboratory analyses, thus bridging
the gap that presently exists between lab studies of sperm storage in domestic
species and field studies of behavior and paternity. ***
