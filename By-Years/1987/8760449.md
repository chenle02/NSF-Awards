Artificial Neural Systems (ANS) are extremely promising as a way of achieving
"true intelligence." The Japanese have challenged the U.S. to a multibillion
dollar 10 year cooperative effort in this field which they call the Sixth
Generation Computer. The essence is to use many simple processors multiply and
complexly interconnected. Optics offers a three dimensionality for interconnects
unapproachable by electronics. In particular, the technique proposed here can
make 10E + 12 weighted interconnects in parallel. In addition, it allows
continuous time operation, fast response, low power consumption, low cost, and
all optical. The Phase I effort is an exploration of the potentials and
limitations of the all optical ANS. Issues such as accuracy, speed, stability,
size, and ability to accommodate various ANS paradigms will be studied. In Phase
II a generic ANS will be designed using commericial parts and its performance
propertied will be predicted. The contract will be with a Nodal Systems
Corporation, a Company created solely to exploit the optical ANS. One of its
Principals, Dr. H. J. Caufield, is well known in all fields of optical
computing. A subcontract to the Center for Applied Optics of UAH provides
further academic support.
