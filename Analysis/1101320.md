This project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and their applications to
number theory. It has been observed for a long time that many problems
concerning diophantine approximation, that is, various phenomena related to the
theory of integer equations or inequalities, can be cast in terms of the
behavior of trajectories of a suitable homogeneous flow. The principal
investigator plans to continue his study of those trajectories, aiming at new
applications to number theory. Dynamical tools to be used are: quantitative
nondivergence on the space of lattices, Schmidt games and their modifications,
recurrence of random walks, measure rigidity, mixing and equidistribution
properties. A dynamical system here stands for an abstract set of points
together with an evolution law which governs the way points move over time. It
turns out that many problems concerning simultaneous approximation of real
numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of
certain orbits. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic
nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for
their investigation. The educational aspect of the proposal involves exposing
graduate and undergraduate students to new methods and techniques in number
theory and dynamical systems, and supervising research projects of high school
students within the framework of the PRIMES program.
