This CAREER project develops a systematic worst-case evaluation methodology
which addresses the problem of evaluating mission critical dynamic systems,
including automatic control systems. Major research approaches include:
categorizing the problems into meaningful subgroups according to input and
information structure; developing algorithms to obtain analytical and numerical
solutions for linear and nonlinear systems; and applying developed algorithms to
the rollover of an articulated vehicle example, and worst-case evaluation of a
vehicle stability control system. The education plan includes the development of
an automotive engineering curriculum; development of an `Intelligent
Transportation Systems` course; active mentoring of undergraduate and graduate
students; design of advanced computer simulation tools for automatic control and
vehicle control courses; and incorporation of strong industry participation
teaching and research.
