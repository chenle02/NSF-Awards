The objective of this research is to integrate simulation, learning, and
optimization to form an Adaptive and Interactive Modeling System (AIMS) to
support multiple perspectives at different stages for design and concurrent
engineering. Given a database of examples collected from simulations or
experiments, and a set of modeling objectives and design objectives, AIMS
performs multi-objective optimization at both model formation and utilization
phases. By varying modeling objectives, such as speed, accuracy, and
comprehensibility, AIMS can produce layered models to meet the changing needs at
different stages of design. By treating different life-cycle concerns as
competing design objectives, AIMS can support systematic incorporation of
multiple perspectives for concurrent engineering. This research represents a
significant and meaningful integration between artificial intelligence based
techniques and conventional engineering methods to further advance the basic
research in design automation.
