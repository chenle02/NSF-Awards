The metal casting industry is one of the most important in the country. It could
be strengthened significantly if it were possible to start with a finish-
machined casting as it exists in the mind's eye of the designer and, using
computer-aided design (CAD) modules and numerically controlled machine tools, to
design and fabricate the pattern required to make the casting. Development of
this capability is undertaken in a two-phase approach: development of a CAD
system to design patterns, and development of a CAD system to design molds,
complete with the channels (gates and risers) required for flow of the molten
metal. The CAD systems will be based on a geometric modeling system known as
ROMULUS. An "expert system" will be created, based on rules of thumb well known
to foundrymen.
