The East Coast Nerve Net is a small conference that encourages interaction
among graduate students, post-doctoral scientists and faculty in an intensive
weekend. The conference utilizes the facilities of the Marine Biological
Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, an outstanding institution for
biological research, which provides an informal setting. The presentations
emphasize participation by young scientists who have not yet presented their
work at major national or international meetings. This award helps defray
participant costs to encourage a few undergraduate students of under-represented
groups to present their work in talk or poster form. This conference
participation will allow a few outstanding undergraduates to gain experience and
information from their peers and mentors that will be important for their career
development.
