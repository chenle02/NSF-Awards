This grant will support a workshop entitled "Mechanisms for Tropospheric
Effects of Solar Variability and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation" to be held on
June 20,21, 1989 in Boulder, Colorado preceding the annual CEDAR* meeting. The
workshop objectives are to search for and evaluate hypotheses for mechanisms
that might account for the solar variability/quasi-biennial oscillation/weather
correlation as first discussed by Labizke (Free University, W. Berlin) and Van
Loon (NCAR). This topic is part of the CEDAR and STEP** initiatives. The
workshop format will have invited tutorials covering the possible range of
topics that will be important for understanding and evaluating possible
mechanisms and poster papers that will present recent data analysis and model
results. The outcome of the workshop will be a narrowing of the most likely
scenario for mechanisms and a set of recommendations for future research. *
