9406969 Amero The project is directed towards understanding the mechanism of
action of a unique transcription factor, PEP, isolated from Drosophila. The
protein is associated with RNA in the nucleus and therefore termed an hnRNP,
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Biochemical characterization of the
protein suggests that it may play a role in activating transcription while
associated with RNA. This is a very unusual function for an hnRNP and will be
investigated more thoroughly. Genetic studies and in vivo analysis of PEP
function are difficult in Drosophila. The award will be used to identify and
characterize a comparable gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A colleague, Dr.
Johns Lopes, has agreed to assist the PI in learning the appropriate yeast
manipulations. %%% The project deals with a very unusual protein isolated from
fruit flies. The protein is found tightly bound to RNA but seems to also affect
the expression of information from DNA. The preliminary characterization of the
protein has been carried as far as is reasonably possible using the insect
system. To more completely understand the mechanism of action of the protein,
the yeast homologue will be characterized and the corresponding gene cloned and
mutated. Studies of mutant forms of the protein will greatly facilitate the
identification of protein affects gene expression in living cells. ***
