Form 10 Abstract Proposal: AST 97-14369 PI: Saul Perlmutter Institution:
University of California, Berkeley This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
(SGER) is for a rapid response search for gamma ray burst (GRB) optical
emission, using the 0.5 m Automated Patrol Telescope in Australia. Searches are
triggered by an alert from the BACODINE network, which receives signals from the
BATSE experiment on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory spacecraft when a GRB is
detected. The telescope is already under Internet and computer control, but
further work is necessary to automate the search fully, by automating the roof,
lens cover, etc. Observations already made of the GRBs of 970326.6, 970329, and
970616 will be published, as well as a study of background optical transient
rates in large-area, very deep images taken as part of a Supernova Cosmology
Project.
