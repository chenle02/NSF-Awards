9626958 Claiborne The Franklin Institute will develop a 6000 sq. ft. traveling
exhibit about "The Powers of Nature". Focusing on earthquakes, severe storms,
and volcanoes, the exhibit will promote a greater understanding of the
meteorological and geological forces that underlie these phenomena. Visitors
will also learn about how scientists monitor and predict natural events, more
about how these natural events affect our lives, and critical safety measures
that people should take during these dangerous events. The exhibit will include
a rich array of immersion experiences, hands-on interactive activities,
historical photographs, modern data and imagery, artifacts, and personal
stories. An Educator's Guide containing background information and classroom
activities will be developed and circulated in a printed publication as well as
electronically on the Franklin's WWW home page (Http:\\sln.fi.edu). The exhibit
will open at the Franklin Institute in October, 1997 and will circulate among
the seven other science museums that are part of the Science Museum Exhibit
Collaborative. It is estimated that 2.5 million people will see the exhibit
during its 42-month tour.
