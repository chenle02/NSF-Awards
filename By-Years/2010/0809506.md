Eitan Geva of the University of Michigan is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on the
development of theoretical methods to model vibrational energy flow in complex
systems using mixed quantum-classical methods. Included in this study are
systems with extensive hydrogen bonding. An additional project is to develop
methods to simulate 2DIR spectroscopic studies and this study is being carried
in collaboration with Kevin Kubarych and Barry Dunietz, colleagues in Geva's
department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is having a broader impact through
the training of students and the development of new methods that will have
application in a wide area of science.&lt;br/&gt;
