This research will investigate developing a machine diagnostics system based on
sensors that are typically found in a machine tool. This approach will be
applied to machine tool drive systems. The signals that are readily available
are motor voltage, current, velocity, and position; these signals will be
employed in this technique. The research is concerned with detecting either a
change in the load imposed on the drive system (e.g. load caused by a failed
bearing, gear, or belt or a slide/weighs fault) or a change in the dynamic
behavior of the drive system (e.g. caused by motor characteristics or
slide/weighs changes). The research will concentrate on mechanical component
faults. The major tasks of the research include development of a dynamic
mathematical model of the system to quantify the relation between the load and
the remotely measured load signal, identification of the number of sensors
required to detect machine faults, and off-line algorithms to detect and
identify faults.
