DMS-0401128 Michael Thaddeus This project encompasses several variations on the
theme of quantum cohomology, aiming to construct interesting moduli spaces and
study their enumerative geometry. The bulk of the project concerns the space of
holomorphic maps from a curve to a loop group. This is finite-dimensional and
can be compactified like a space of stable maps, allowing Gromov-Witten
invariants of loop groups to be defined and calculated. This should allow a
fruitful generalization of the very active field of quantum cohomology of
homogeneous spaces to the infinite-dimensional setting of affine Lie groups.
Another variation of quantum cohomology is the stringy or orbifold cohomology of
Chen-Ruan: a version of the Weil conjectures for this theory will be sought, and
the role of a B-field or grebe investigated. Yet another is the quantum Riemann-
Roch theory recently developed by Coates, which will be applied to symmetric
products of curves.

This is research in algebraic geometry, one of the most classical parts of
mathematics, concerned with finding solutions of polynomial equations. But it is
informed by some of the latest ideas in the theory of holomorphic curves, and
especially the Gromov-Witten theory, which seeks to count the numbers of curves
on a given surface (or a space of higher dimension) of a given shape or
position. This in turn is largely motivated by quantum field theory, and it is
hoped that the project will ultimately make contact with ideas from physics.
