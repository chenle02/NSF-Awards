This award supports research on the Asian monsoon entitled US-India Cooperative
Research: International Wavelet Analysis of Frequency Spectra for Monsoon
Rainfall.&lt;br/&gt;US PI T.N. Krishnamurti, Florida State University (FSU) and
Indian meteorologist C.K. Rajan, Cochin University of Science and Technology
will study the intraseasonal variability of the Asian monsoon rainfall using a
novel observational analysis approach (wavelet analysis) and modeling.
Understanding the mechanisms that regulate monsoon life cycles formed by active
and break periods in the Asian summer monsoon is a major research challenge and
one with broad impacts. Improved predictions of monsoon precipitation for the
South Asian regions are critical to issues of water resources, agriculture,
health, and economic well being for the billions living in these regions.
&lt;br/&gt;This research will extend previous work completed by the PI for one
region of India to the entire area affected by the Asian Monsoon. The award
supports exchange visits to the collaborating institution by a postdoc and
graduate student from FSU. Cofunding for the collaboration is provided by the
Indian Department of Science &amp; Technology under the NSF/DST joint program.
