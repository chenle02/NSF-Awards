This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a Micro-
Force Test Apparatus inside a Scanning Electron Microscope to better learn the
micromechanical properties of materials and MEMS devices. The project will
explore mechanical properties of MEMS devices as well as individual phases in
metals. The properties to be explored are compressive strength, shear strength,
tensile strength, flex, and peel. In addition, microgrippers will be added to
the end of the linear motion feed though. This addition will allow for assembly
of other components using various attachment techniques including thermoset
polymer adhesives, solders and brazes. &lt;br/&gt; The potential commercial
application for the Microforce Testing System and fixtures will be to
characterize materials such as metals and ceramics and MEMS-type devices.
