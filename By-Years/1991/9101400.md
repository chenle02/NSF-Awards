This project will study H-infinity control theory. The topics to be emphasized
are linear time-invariant finite- dimensional plants, Wiener-Hopf factorization
and interpolation for rational matrix functions, distributed parameter systems,
and H-infinity optimization for nonlinear systems. Morse theory, operator and
function theory are expected to play a central role. The problems to be studied
are motivated by the need of controlling engineering systems. This project
includes nonlinear cases where the known theory for a narrow band of frequencies
does not apply. Computer codes will be developed upon successful understanding
of the underlying mathematical theory.
