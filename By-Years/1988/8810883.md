A NATO advanced Research Workshop (ARW) on Climate-Ocean Interaction will be
held during 26-30 September 1988 at Oxford University, United Kingdom. The
objective of the ARW is to assess the current status of research on climate-
ocean interaction, with a major focus on the development of coupled atmosphere-
ocean models and their application in the study of past, present and possible
future climates. The Proceedings of the Advanced Research Workshop, consisting
of 18 formal lectures and their subsequent discussion by the participants, will
be edited by the Director and published by Reidel in the NATO Advanced Study
Institute series.
