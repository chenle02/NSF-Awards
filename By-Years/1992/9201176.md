Research from the mid-1980s has indicated that academic-industry relations in
fields closely allied to genetics may have significant effects on research
activities, including the academic and commercial productivity of involved
industries and scientists, as well as levels of secrecy, openness of
communication and the direction of research in academic labs. Much remains to be
learned about the long-term significance of these potential effects. This grant
provides funds to permit the development of an ethics component in a large scale
study of academic-industry relationships in genetics and life sciences, being
supported through the National Institutes of Health. This support allows a
philosopher and a sociologist to collaborate in developing the ethics component,
and in conducting and analysing results from case studies and surveys of
researchers who have received awards from the Human Genome Research program as
well as other academic life scientists. The ethical topics deserving exploration
include traditional scientific norms and counternorms, and also new areas of
concern including research, organizational, and interpersonal misconduct.
Project results will be disseminated through books, articles, and presentations
at professional associations and relevant meetings.
