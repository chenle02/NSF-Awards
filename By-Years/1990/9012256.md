The objective of this research is to describe the effect of ions on the
segmental and local motions of polymers in the presence and absence of low-
molecular-weight solvent molecules. The polymers and salts of interest are those
that exhibit high ionic conduction such as poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium
perchlorate. Multifield, multinuclear, and variable temperature nuclear spin
lattice relaxation experiments will be performed on different polymer/salt
systems. The resulting T1 data will be analyzed using dynamic models for the
segmental and local motions of the polymer. The relationship between polymer
motion and ionic conduction will be investigated by this technique. Segmental
motion of the polymer contributes to high ionic conduction in polymer/salt
systems according to dynamic bond percolation theory;. The interaction between
certain polymers and salts is an example of the importance of site-specific
interactions in determining the properties of polymer-based materials. This
study investigates site-specific interactions by a dynamic rather than static
approach to reveal the impact of these interactions. Ultimately, the results of
this research will provide the basis for a comprehensive analysis of the present
state of theory and encourage further theoretical development.
