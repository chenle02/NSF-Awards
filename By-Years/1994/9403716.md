Mittelman The main emphasis of the project is the development of computational
techniques, their implementation on advanced computer architectures, and their
verification and utilization on nontrivial application problems of current
interest. The area of research is capillary flows and surfaces. The investigator
analyzes in detail static capillary surfaces in singular cases and searches for
new surfaces with certain properties such as symmetry. A sophisticated computer
code for partial differential equations, to which he has contributed (PLTMG), is
generalized to the Navier-Stokes equations. Flows in which capillary effects are
prominent are analyzed, including mixed buoyant-thermocapillary convection as it
occurs in crystal growth and welding. The force that shapes waterdrops, lets
nutrients rise to treetops, and is governing the flow of contaminated
groundwater is called capillarity. While it is important in our terrestrial
environment, it becomes dominant in the microgravity regime of space. Many
environmental but also manufacturing issues, such as crystal growth and welding,
will greatly benefit from a better understanding of the effects of capillarity.
With state- of-the-art computational techniques and resources the investigator
studies both the shape of liquid surfaces and the flow inside liquids.
Challenging problems of current interest serve as paradigms and applications for
the work.
