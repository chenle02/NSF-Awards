This award will support an observational project to investigate the progenitor
stars of supernova explosions. Theory and observations currently suggest two
possibilities: close binaries with two white dwarfs that merge through the loss
of angular momentum, or close binaries with one white dwarf gathering mass from
a companion star. The latter are observationally detected as recurrent novae,
symbiotic stars, or supersoft X-ray sources. This project has two parts. The
first part will search supernovae remnants in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud
(a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way) for remnants that survived after the
supernova explosion; in the scenario involving two white dwarfs, no remnant star
would be detected. The second part of this project is to test whether recurrent
novae could be supernova progenitors by studying these novae during and after
their eruptions, especially to detect orbital period
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of supernova progenitors is important
as a test for stellar evolution theory and for the use of supernovae to explore
the evolution of the universe's expansion through time.
