The project is supporting workshop to disseminate active learning methods for
engineering mechanics developed in an earlier NSF project (Award 0442614 ). In
previous workshops the investigators have found that providing demonstration
materials that the participants can take back to their own institutions greatly
enhances the effectiveness of the workshop,. The current project is providing 30
participant with a kit containing a set of low-cost, off-the-shelf, hand-held
devices (e. g., spring powered toys, hand tools, foam stress elements, torsion
devices and so on). The workshop is being held at the ASEE Annual Conference and
widely advertised through the conference publications.
