The PI will employ a new numerical approach for studying how the generation of
Langmuir waves by the HF heater is influence by altitude variation in the heater
intensity profile, and - on longer hydrodynamical time scales - by heater-
induced spatial distortions in the plasma density. In order to quantify the
effects ionospheric inhomogeneity has on Langmuir wave energy, the PI will
numerically determine modified thresholds for driving absolute instabilities for
density and heater-intensity profiles based on observations and theoretical
models. Together, these two components of the research will answer: (1) where
and how is heater energy conve3rted to Langmuir waves in the ionosphere (before
and after preconditioning)? (2) what is the self-consistent kinetic nonlinear
evolution of Langmuir waves and electrons? And (3) what is the distribution of
accelerated electrons observed outside the heated region?
