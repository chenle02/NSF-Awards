9617986 Rossby In this project, the PI will collaborate in a cooperative
research effort to study the mid-depth circulation around South Africa and in
the Southeastern Atlantic. Other collaborators are from the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory, NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorology Laboratory, the
Institute fur Meerskunde, in Kiel, Germany, and the University of Capetown,
South Africa. The first objective is to use isopycnal RAFOS floats to determine
pathways of dispersal from the Agulhas Current as it approaches the region where
the current retroflects, and to determine the conditions under which waters
recycle to the east. The second objective is to start a program of direct
measurements of mass transport of the Agulhas Current off Durban, using a
combination of velocity measurement (Global Positioning System with POGO) and
hydrographic casts. POGO is a modern version of the dropsonde, used some two
decades ago. This project will provide 50 RAFOS floats in the first year, and 4
POGO instruments in the second year.
