Software development is a complex socio-technical activity typically occurring
concurrently, in distributed teams, and within the larger organizational goals
and context. Current development tools are overwhelmed by the scale of software-
intensive systems, and often end up contributing to, rather than minimizing,
information overload, and coordination breakdowns, which ultimately lead to
software conflicts and project delays. This research seeks to establish an
understanding of how past development data and team practices can be used to
proactively identify dependencies and constraints across tasks, and schedule
tasks so as to minimize conflicting changes in parallel, distributed
development. This work will contribute: (1) conflict typology formalizing
software conflicts and their interplay with organizational context, (2)
knowledge about how to achieve improvements in productivity, quality, and
development speed, (3) a suite of analysis techniques, design principles, tool
prototypes, and interaction methods for conflict minimization in distributed,
parallel development. Evaluation includes deployment to real software
development teams and controlled experiments of the efficacy of the resulting
tools. The broader impacts of the work are ultimately to enable software teams
to develop software in a conflict-free environment and train students on
critical processes associated with collaboration competency.
