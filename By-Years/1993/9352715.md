atomic absorption spectrometry for metal ion analysis. The experience will
extend to general chemistry, analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis,
physical chemistry, and environmental science. Environmental projects will focus
on local sites. Undergraduate research as well as teacher inservice classes will
also benefit from this new direction emphasis. ***
