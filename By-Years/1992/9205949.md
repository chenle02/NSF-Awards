Professor William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study organic reactions and host/guest
chemistry in solution. Ab initio quantum mechanical calculations will be
performed to obtain minimum energy reaction paths in the gas phase as well as
energetic and structural data on gas-phase complexes that contribute to the
development of solute-solvent intermolecular potential functions. Solvent
effects will be examined through Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations
for the reactions in solution. Diels-Alder reactions with various dienophiles
and under high pressure conditions as well as Claisen rearrangement reactions
will be studied. Host/guest interactions will also be studied in an effort to
compute the relative and absolute free energies of binding in solution. %%% Most
important chemical reactions take place in solution, yet most of the theoretical
knowledge regarding the molecular details of chemical reactions has been
obtained for reactions in the gas phase. Professor Jorgensen's theoretical
research deals with the effects of solvation on important synthetic organic
reactions. He is using statistical mechanics and computer simulations to study
the effects which various solvents have on the rates of these reactions.
