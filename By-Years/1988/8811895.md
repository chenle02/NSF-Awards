Statistics, one of the founders of the discipline, Francis Galton, argued, "are
the only tools by which an opening can be cut through the formidable thicket of
difficulties that bare the path of those who pursue the science of man and
society." Despite the value of statistics for modern governments, the discipline
of statistics in the Soviet Union has followed a history of wide swings in
official acceptance, following, in its way, the checkered history of genetics in
the Soviet Union. Professor Kotz, under this grant, will examine these dramatic
events in order to gain a better understanding not only of the turbulent history
of this discipline and the difficulties it encounters in absorbing and
harnessing modern technologies but also of how the Soviet Union uses science in
the pursuit of governmental policies. The history Soviet statistics has gone
through essentially five periods: a "Golden Age" (1919-1930) when Soviet
statisticians were at the forefront of the discipline in the world and provided
important information for the Soviet State; Stalinist repression (1931-1952),
including the disastrous War years and an imposition of a rigid, ideological
suffocation and isolation for statistics; a period of slow, erratic recovery
under Khrushchev (1953-1964); stagnation under Brezhnev (1964-83); and a current
period of substantial reassessment and even upheaval under Gorbachev (1985-
1988). Professor Kotz will trace the developments through these periods by
following the careers of four prominent Soviet statisticians. He will carry this
research out through analysis and synthesis of the existing scattered,
fragmentary publications (in both Russian and English) available at the Library
of Congress.
