This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I propose to combine the
technologies of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) manufacture with strain-inducing
wafer bonding to produce Strained-Si On Insulator (SSOI) wafers. Silicon-based
devices with silicon/germanium (Si/Ge) heterostructures have been extensively
researched and this has lead to the discovery that tensile strained silicon
exhibits superior electronic properties. Bi axially strained-silicon devices are
currently strained via expensive which is a highly technical heterostructure
fabrication process. Tensile strain can be introduced by growing silicon
pseudomorphically on to a lattice of larger unit cell, usually an alloy of
Ge/Si. In this work, it is hoped that by optimizing Strained-Silicon-on-
Insulator will increase carrier mobilities by more than 3 times&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated benefits of this technology would yield ultra-fast,
mainstream silicon-based electronics, which would effectively be new host
materials with speed, and performance would surpass Gallium Arsenate (GaAs). The
multi-billion dollar chips industry would benefit would benefit by reducing the
costs for a new plant to design technology.&lt;br/&gt;
