The purpose of this interdisciplinary project is to devise a new generation of
computational methods based on the combination of finite element methods and
polynomial optimization to analyze problems in nonlinear mechanics, which often
exhibit a complex evolution over time and space. Some examples include fluid
flows, convection, and nonlinear elasticity. Computing these systems? equilibria
and producing a detailed diagnosis of their stability can be of notorious
difficulty, but are of profound importance for elucidating the underlying
physical mechanisms involved. These novel algorithms and rigorous analysis will
allow the improvement of longstanding results in fluid mechanics related to the
stability and dynamics of canonical shear flows. The results may lead to a
deeper knowledge of turbulent losses in fluid systems, which could play a
critical role in engineering problems within the transport and energy sectors.

The project has two parts. The first part focuses on rigorously establishing the
nonlinear stability of fluid flows with the goal of sharpening the lower bounds
on the global stability threshold of shear flows (the largest Reynolds number
under which any initial velocity field eventually converges to the laminar
flow), such as plane Couette and plane Poiseuille flows. This will be achieved
by carefully constructing Lyapunov functionals with the computer using
polynomial sum-of-squares constraints and a special framework to pose the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The second part proposes the first
connection between finite element analysis and sparse polynomial optimization.
The combination has some nice theoretical implications, since finite element
error analysis is deeply rooted in functional analysis and approximation theory,
while the nascent field of polynomial optimization is closely tied to results in
real algebraic geometry. From the practical standpoint, the computational
methods developed will form a general framework to directly solve nonlinear
partial differential equations (PDEs) in general domains while concurrently
globally optimizing relevant quantities of interest (e.g. energy, heat
transport, etc.). The resulting numerical methods provide a systematic pathway
to compute exact coherent states of physical systems without using homotopic
continuation. This is essential in problems where non-unique solutions do not
bifurcate from a trivial state, like in plane Couette and pipe flows.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
