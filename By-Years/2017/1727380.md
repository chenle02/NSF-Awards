This award is to assist approximately 15 US-based graduate students to attend
the 15th USENIX and ACM SIGOPS Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST
2017) in Santa Clara, CA. Participation in FAST 2017 and similar conferences is
a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides
students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and
exposes students to leading work and practical industry practices in this
important area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past grant recipients have gone
on to run their own research labs and organize conferences including FAST, and
the long term merits of this program's impact on storage research is well
established.
