Summary: This proposal requests support for an international conference on
Cretaceous climate-ocean dynamics. The conference will bring together a
multidisciplinary group of established scientists and students to assess the
state of knowledge of the nature and mechanics of Cretaceous atmospheric and
oceanic circulation and identify critical research issues for the next
decade.&lt;br/&gt;
