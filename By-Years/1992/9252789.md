The City University of New York (CUNY) is an academic network of nine senior
colleges, seven community colleges, a 4-year technical college, a graduate
school, a law school and two medical schools. The network is geographically
distributed throughout the entire city, with a total residential population of
more than seven million. The New York City Alliance will consist of twelve
campuses within CUNY, comprising bother 2 year and 4-year colleges, working
together with private colleges, members of the business community and national
laboratories. The initial CUNY college partners will be four senior colleges
(Brooklyn College, City College, Hunter College and Lehman College), a 4-year
technical college (New York City Technical College) and seven community colleges
(borough of Manhattan Community College, Bronx Community College, Hostos
Community College, Kinsgborough Community College, La Guardia Community College,
Medgar Evers College Ä±which has both 2- and 4-year programs! and Queensborough
Community College). The principal project activities will involve undergraduate
science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) education, focusing on the points in
students' undergraduate experience which are most likely, without intervention,
to precipitate a decision to drop out of the science and engineering pipeline.
The transitions from 2- year to 4-year colleges and into graduate school will be
specifically addressed by AMP project activities. Although not included in the
seven proposed AMP activities, the transition rom high school to college is
currently served by as number of existing programs involving the partner
colleges and will be coordinated under AMP auspices. The AMP activities will
bring about wide-scale deployment of programs proved in pilot projects;
complement related activities funded by state, private and other federal
sources' produce a significantly greater degree of coordination among the CUNY
partners; and bring greater involvement of outside partners, private colleges,
government laboratories and industry. Our goal will be to create a "seamless
whole" of interventions at the undergraduate level that respond to each of the
factors that impled minority student success.
