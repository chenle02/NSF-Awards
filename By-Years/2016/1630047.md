This grant is to provide partial support for U.S.-based graduate and
undergraduate students to attend the Ninth Symposium on Combinatorial Search
(SoCS-2016), a scientific conference to be held at Tarrytown, NY from July 6-8,
2016. Combinatorial search is an area of artificial intelligence that deals with
systematic trial-and-error exploration of a very large number of alternative
solutions to a problem. NSF funding is crucial to support students who would
otherwise not be able to attend the symposium. Attending such meetings and
presenting their research is an important part of the professional development
of students, addressing a critical shortage of highly-skilled computer
scientists in the U.S.

SOCS brings together researchers in heuristic search and combinatorial
optimization from all areas of artificial intelligence, planning, robotics,
constraint programming, operations research, and bioinformatics. The
intellectual merit of this activity stems from bringing together in one place at
one time researchers from otherwise diverse areas of computer science that both
advance the state of the art in heuristic search and/or combinatorial
optimization, and also use these tools in their research. The broader impacts
come from cross-fertilization of different fields that advance and/or use these
tools, by promoting research in this area by providing a small intimate meeting
on these topics, a forum for presenting such work, and archival proceedings for
publishing work in this area. These latter goals are instrumental to training
new researchers in this area.
