physics courses or who may be considering the development of such a course. The
program facilitates the exchange of ideas about advanced physics experiments.
There is be ample opportunity to discuss and perform the CSUH upper- division
laboratory experiments. Equipment lists, data, and helpful hints are provided to
assist in the development of similar experiments at the participants' home
institutions.
