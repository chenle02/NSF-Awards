A wide-scale biogeographic pattern shows that a house gecko, Hemidactylus
frenatus, upon introduction to islands throughout the Pacific, replaces at least
three other species. This trajectory has been replicated in at least three
archipelagoes: Vanuatu, Hawaii and Fiji. Two of the species that are displaced
are asexual parthenogens: Hemidactylus garnotii and Lepidodactylus lugubris.
This research will determine the ecological mechanism responsible for the
displacement and the role played by the mode of reproduction. Potential
mechanisms fall into two categories: competition and "apparent competition".
Under the heading of competition, the project will examine hypotheses concerning
exploitation and interference competition with a combination of manipulative
field experiments and captive experiments. In the "apparent competition"
category, the potential role of parasites in the community dynamics will be
examined by screening each species for gut, lung and blood parasites. Along
those same lines, the clonal diversity of the asexual species will be both in
Fiji and across the Pacific, with an immunological technique known as the mixed
lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Distributional ranges of different clones will be
mapped and associated with clonal differences in parasite burdens. Several
models attributing ecological reasons for the maintenance of sexual reproduction
hinge critically on the number of ecologically significant clones in the asexual
species.
