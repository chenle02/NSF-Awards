The goal of this project is to apply the methods of Hodge theory, Galois theory
and representation theory to study the geometry and topology of moduli spaces of
curves and abelian varieties, and to use geometry and topology to study the
absolute Galois group (i.e., the Galois group of the algebraic numbers) via its
action on completions of mapping class groups. Specifically, Hain has three main
projects: (1) resolving certain fundamental questions in the topology of moduli
spaces of hyperelliptic curves that are arise in the study of Galois actions on
fundamental groups of hyperelliptic curves; (2) resolving certain problems in
the intersection theory of the universal jacobian over the Deligne-Mumford
moduli spaces of stable, n-pointed curves, which arise in symplectic geometry
and physics; (3) studying the action of an appropriate completion of the
absolute Galois group on pro-unipotent and pro-ell completions of fundamental
groups of curves defined over number fields. The third problem is part of a
joint project with Makoto Matsumoto of Hiroshima University whose goal is to
determine whether this action is faithful, a fundamental question in the theory
of motives. Mapping class groups and their cohomology play a central role in
each of the projects.

Topology is the study of those geometrical properties of surfaces and their
generalizations that remain unchanged under stretching (short of tearing) and
other continuous deformations. Geometry is the study of those properties of
surfaces and their generalizations that preserve geometric properties such as
distances and/or angles. There is a profound connection between the topological
symmetries of a surface (called the mapping class group of the surface), the
geometry of all of the different ways of measuring angles on such a surface (the
moduli space of conformal structures on the surface) and the arithmetical
properties of the surface when viewed as the graph of a polynomial function.
Questions about mapping class groups and moduli spaces of conformal structures
on surfaces arise in many areas of mathematics (such as the study of numbers,
and algebraic geometry), and have applications to particle physics through
string theory and conformal field theory. There are also potential significant
applications to cryptography. The goal of this proposal is to further explore
and understand the intricate and deep connections between these topological,
geometrical and arithmetical aspects of surface theory, especially those aspects
with connections to number theory.
