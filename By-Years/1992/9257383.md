The author will study the kinetics of pulsed glow discharges related to
semiconductor processing. There are several important differences between pulsed
and continuous discharges which have yet to be thoroughly investigated. First,
the modulated excitation source causes the electron energy distribution function
(EEDF) to become time dependent. As a consequence, modulated excitation sources
should make it possible to control the time averaged EEDF even though it is
difficult to control in continuous glows. The author will study power deposition
mechanisms at discharge initiation as well as discharge decay mechanisms in
order to determine whether an appropriately modulated excitation source can be
used to optimize the kinetics of a particular process. Second, the transport of
negative ions to surfaces can be controlled in pulsed discharges and may allow
for a study of the interactions of negative ions with surfaces as well as the
transport of particulates. Finally, pulsed discharges offer a technique for
positive ion energy control in reactive ion etching, since the dc self bias
voltage can be controlled. The author will combine plasma state measurements
with wafer state measurements, and modeling in the course of this research.
