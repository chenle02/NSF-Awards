The PI requests funding to provide partial support for the 2023 Gordon Research
Conference on Polar Marine Science (GRC-PMS) and the associated Gordon Research
Seminar (GRS). The 2023 GRC “Integrating Ocean Physics and Biogeochemistry to
Assess Polar Ecosystem Sensitivity to Rapid Change” will provide powerful
insights into the present and future states of polar marine ecosystems,
including the local and regional aspects of ocean circulation, sea ice dynamics,
biogeochemical fluxes, biodiversity, ecosystem health and human well-being. The
2023 GRC-PMS, with the title “Integrating Ocean Physics and Biogeochemistry to
Assess Polar Ecosystem Sensitivity to Rapid Change”, will provide powerful
insights into the present and future states of polar marine ecosystems,
including the local and regional aspects of ocean circulation, sea ice dynamics,
biogeochemical fluxes, biodiversity, ecosystem health and human well-being as
well as technological advances in sampling approaches in these harsh
environments. These key facets will be addressed through the presentation and
discussion of new observations and findings, conceptual frameworks and numerical
simulations during the nine sessions of the conference. Partial travel support
and full registration are requested for 10 invited speakers / discussion leaders
and 10 early career participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research
Conference (GRC; March 5-10, 2023) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS; March 4-5,
2023) on Polar Marine Science will be held at the Four Points Sheraton / Holiday
Inn Express in Ventura, California, USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
