Jolly The investigator and his colleague test approximate inertial manifolds
(AIMs) on nonlinear dissipative evolution equations, including the Kuramoto-
Sivashinsky, Navier-Stokes, and Lorenz equations. The emphasis is on capturing
elements of the global attractor, and not on solving the initial value problem
over short time intervals. The phase space dimension reduction offered by AIMs
is exploited to visualize global bifurcations involving two-dimensional stable
manifolds, which would be of higher dimension in traditional Galerkin
discretizations. Of particular interest is an algebraic AIM, which offers
arbitrary accuracy, at a fixed dimension. Increased accuracy in this case is
achieved by increasing the degree of a polynomial that implicitly defines the
AIM. The investigators explore various time discretizations that take advantage
of the particular features of the associated differential-algebraic system. This
research has an impact on how the long term behavior of physical systems is
determined by computers. Part of the work is devoted to comparing the efficiency
of alternative algorithms to standard ones used in high performance computing.
Another is to visualize certain critical phenomena, which could not be seen with
traditional methods, regardless of the computational effort. While the various
methods will be tested on particular mathematical models of combustion, fluid
flow, and the weather, they are applicable to a wide range of problems that fit
into a general framework.
