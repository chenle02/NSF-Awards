Astronomy (11)

The objectives of this project are to combine the School of Galactic Radio
Astronomy (SGRA) and Stellar Classification Online Public Exploration (SCOPE)
with NSDL; to organize four 2-day workshops for teachers, homeschoolers?
parents, and informal learners; and to support distance learning via webinars
and podcasts. Working with the NSDL Resource Center, the project creates the
publishing and harvesting tools for SCOPE and SGRA through NSDL. A high-speed,
reliable and secure networking and storage services provide a productive user
experience. The use of the PLONE Content Management System built on top of the
open source application server ZOPE means content automatically applies Dublin
Core metadata adapted by NSDL.

This project is conducted by the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI)
and available for national use through the NSDL infrastructure. It enhances STEM
education by combining research with education where learners study as Staff
Scientists at PARI. Users can remotely access a 4.6-m radio telescope to study
physics and methods of research. Learners control, in real-time, the radio
telescope through a web-browser, pointing the telescope at targets, and with a
neutral hydrogen detector either map or take spectra taken of radio sources. In
SCOPE, learners, as citizen scientists, explore the visible stellar sky.
Digitized images of archived astronomical photographic data taken over three
decades are available through a user-friendly web interface and designed for
classification of stars.

This project advances the competence of formal and informal STEM learners
through PARI?s digital resources. The resources place a stimulating environment
of research and education within the reach of a computer. Outcomes are
disseminated to broad audience to energize K-12 professional development
opportunities such as NSTA conferences, webinars, and published articles.
Research outcomes are reported through a peer-reviewed journal published by the
International Astronomical Union.
