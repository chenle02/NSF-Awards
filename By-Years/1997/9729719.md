Ultra-High-Speed Optical Networks This research instrumentation grant enables
the utilization of the requested BER test set in studies which include:- optical
packet switching,- fiber nonlinearities, and- high-speed communication
integrated circuits. The objective of proposed research is to explore the multi-
TeraHertz bandwidth potential of optical fibers to support ultra-high-speed,
wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) optical links and networks. That objective
will be achieved via construction and experimental investigation of novel ultra-
high-speed experimental links and networks operating in the 10 - 100 Gb/s range.
The requested instrument, a 12 Gb/s bit error rate (BER) test set, is vitally
important for the proposed research as it provides a means to (a) generate data
at extremely high data rates and(b) test BER performance of experimental links
and networks at such high data rates. The BER test set will be used in our
experiments in conjunction with external time-division and wavelength-division
multiplexing to measure the performance of our experimental systems in the 10 -
100 Gb/s range. Thus, the proposed instrument will have a strong positive impact
on our research as it will allow us to move toward much higher bit rates
previously inaccessible with older equipment. Specifically, the new BER test set
will be used in our 84 km WDM experimental ring network interconnecting Stanford
University with Sprint ATL. The network currently operates at 2.5 Gb/s per
wavelength. The proposed BER test set will help to increase the bit rate to 40
Gb/s per wavelength by allowing us to time-division-multiplex four 10 Gb/s bit
streams into a 40 Gb/s data stream. Several additional research projects in the
laboratory and elsewhere at Stanford will utilize the requested BER test set.
