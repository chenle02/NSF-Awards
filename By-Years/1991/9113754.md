This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will evaluate the magnitude and spacial-temporal variation of
phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and taxa, primary and new productivity and
its environmental controls, as well as associated parameters related to the
impact NEW on water masses and shelf processes.
