This project is in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program. A long-range goal of the project is to unify the solid-state and
solution chemistries of metal oxides, which have traditionally been treated as
independent research areas. The project is concerned specifically with
transferring chemistry usually associated with solid oxides to the solution
state through the investigation of soluble polyoxoanions and organometal oxides,
and transferring chemistry usually associated with inorganic complexes in
solution to the solid state through the synthesis and study of solid oxide
supported organic and organometallic complexes. In the first area, specific
objectives include the selective oxidation of organic molecules in solution by
polyoxoanions, the synthesis of polyoxoanion-supported metal clusters, the
determination of surface protonation sites in complex isopolyoxoanions, and the
photochemical oxidation of organic molecules by polyoxoanions. In the latter
area, techniques developed for the synthesis of clathrasils and zeosils will be
extended to the synthesis of crystalline silica-supported organic and
organometallic complexes. The results are expected to be useful in the design of
better catalysts for oxidation of organic compounds and in the rational
synthesis of oxidic materials with predetermined chemical and physical
properties.
