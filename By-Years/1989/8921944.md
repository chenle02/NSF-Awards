This research program is being funded by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry
Program. Dr. Pearson will develop new synthetic reagents based upon transition
metal-olefin complexes. These complexes facilitate the construction of
complicated ring systems found in the materials used by modern agriculture. This
research revolves around the use of polyolefin-transition metal complexes as
reactive intermediates for the construction of quaternary carbon centers. The
methodology developed during these studies is to be applied in total synthesis
of a number of biologically active terpenoid natural products.
Cyclohexadienyliron complexes are to be used in the synthesis of trichothecenes
such as trichodermol and verrucarol, and in synthesis of the diterpenoids
stemodinone and aphidicolin. Each of these classes of compound show
antibacterial, antifungal and/or antiviral activity. Newly discovered reactions
of dienyl- and diene iron complexes, in which a pendant olefin is coupled to the
organometallic unit in a carbon-carbon bond forming process are to be studied in
detail. The scope and synthetic applications of these and related reactions will
be investigated. A new approach to the synthesis of taxane derivatives will be
investigated. These compounds, in particular taxol, show exceptional promise as
antitumor agents. The synthetic approach described in this proposal aims to set
in place the major part of the carbon skeleton via the reaction of a highly
substituted tin enolate with
tricarbonyl(l,3-dimethyl-4-methoxycyclohexadienyl)iron hexafluorophosphate,
followed by an internal pinacol reaction to set in place the eight-membered
ring.
