The sheer magnitude of the number of chemicals in use (over 60,000) and the rate
at which new chemicals are commercially introduced (200-1000 per year) requires
that screening assays be developed to predict environmental toxicity. This
research proposes to assay the environmental toxicity of five classes of
hazardous chemicals on three classes of microorganisms which are environmentally
significant. The hazardous chemicals investigated will be 1) the congeneric
chlorinated phenols, 2) the congeneric chlorinated benzenes, 3) the congeneric
chlorinated aliphatics, 4) an additional selection of chemicals in the
U.S.E.P.A. Priority Pollutant list and 5) selected inorganic ions. The
environmentally significant microorganisms will be: 1) Heterotrophs/activated
sludge, 2) Nitrites and 3) Methanogens. The principal investigator has an
excellent research record and he is highly qualified to perform the proposed
work. A two year continuing grant is highly recommended. This is an award of
$106,440 for the first year.
