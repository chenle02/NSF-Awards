The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry
Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Charles L. Perrin
of the University of California, San Diego, who will perform research to
elucidate the relation between molecular structure and chemical reactivity. The
research covers a wide range of topics, including symmetry of hydrogen bonds;
isotope effects, conformational effects, the reactivity of a p-benzyne diradical
toward nucleophiles, and the reactivity of malonic anhydrides. The success of
these studies will rely on powerful and informative nuclear magnetic resonance
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is all curiosity-driven basic research. The
projects are excellent for training students to formulate and test hypotheses,
to ask and answer questions, to solve problems, to use modern instrumentation,
to analyze data, and to exercise critical thinking. The eventual utility of
these studies remains long-range, inasmuch as they are not aimed at practical
application but at developing a thorough understanding that will guide further
research. Professor Perrin has been appointed as Chair of an international task
force charged with revising the online IUPAC Glossary of Terms Used in Physical
Organic Chemistry, which provides a major service to students and researchers.
