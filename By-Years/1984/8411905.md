The earthquake resistance of highway bridges has been identified as an important
research topic in many places in the world. In fact, international cooperation
in this important subject has been identified as a top-priority recommendation
of a recent National Science Foundation sponsored workshop. This project is the
second meeting of bridge research engineers in the U.S. and New Zealand. The
workshop will consist of an exchange of research results completed during the
interval of time from the first meeting, a discussion of progress on the general
research topics previously recommended, and a field trip to inspect new
installations of bridges in the U.S. Proceedings of the meeting will be
published and distributed.
