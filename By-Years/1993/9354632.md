9354632 Reisert To enhance the science preparation of future teachers and
encourage science majors to become teachers, the Department of natural Sciences
and the Department of Education at Assumption College are developing an
education laboratory section for the one semester introductory biology
course,Concepts in Biology. This laboratory section will be designed for
students who take the course to complete the laboratory science requirement for
Massachusetts elementary school certification. Three weeks will be spent on each
of the following topics: the cell, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis and
genetics. In the first week of the course the students will do the college
-level exercises planned for all sections on these topics. In week two, with the
assistance of science and education faculty, students select and design
exercises for a particular elementary level. The students are graded on the
portfolios they develop. Elementary school children will visit the College in
the third week, through a collaboration with a local elementary school. The
students will evaluate the exercise they have taught. By including an elementary
school visit to each of the traditional labs science majors will also have an
opportunity to teach.
