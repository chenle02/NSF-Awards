9317945 ZINK The arid lands or deserts of southwestern North America provide an
exciting context for phylogenetic and historical biogeographic studies. Many
sedentary taxa are endemic or restricted to desert regions, providing
opportunities to explore patterns of isolation by past geologic events or
climatic changes among various vertebrate lineages. This research project will
utilize molecular methods to explore relationships and biogeography of four
groups of birds (thrashers, towhees, gnat catchers and quail) in these desert
regions. Molecular variation among populations within the same species will also
be discovered. For each group of bird species, patterns of relationship will be
derived from restriction site and direct sequence data from mitochondrial DNA.
Those patterns will then be compared with each other to find any shared patterns
suggesting a common geologic/climatic history for isolation of groups. %%%
Studies such as this shed light on the subject of long term climate change and
its effects in fragmenting populations that may lead to the origin of new
species. Information may also be obtained that bears on conservation efforts for
these birds. ***
