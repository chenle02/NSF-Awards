This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from University of Arizona and his
Ph.D. research was in the area of environmental stress on plants. He plans to
carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. David
Meinke at Oklahoma State University. The proposed research entitled "Embryo-
defective T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana" will broaden the
training of the Fellow into plant genetics and developmental biology.
