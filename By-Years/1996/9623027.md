This grant supports the work of Professor Y. Zarhin to work in arithmetic
geometry specifically problems in l-adic cohomology. He will study how the
weights of an l-adic representation can restrict the Lie algebra representations
arising from Galois actions on Abelian varieties. He will also study the
eigenvalues of the Frobenius action on Abelian varieties over finite fields. He
also intends to study complex Abelian varieties where the rank of the Hodge
group is close to the dimension. This project falls into the general area of
arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
