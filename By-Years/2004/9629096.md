ABSTRACT EEC-9629096 Moore The proposed activity comprises the planning for and
dissemination of information about the establishment of an affiliate Center to
the Center for Glass Research at Alfred University, an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center currently in its first renewal period and supported
by twenty-six companies. The University of Missouri-Rolla affiliate is projected
to have 5-10 corporate partners supporting research into glass-contact
refractory materials, specifically research focused on corrosion and creep
processes in glasstank and regenerator refractories and on-line monitoring of
glass melter wall refractories. The planning activity is to culminate in a
research planning meeting of prospective corporate members who will review a
proposed array of products (summarized in this proposal) and then be invited to
join the UMR site affiliate tot he CGR at Alfred University.
