This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of electrochemistry and spectroscopy. Two spectroscopic techniques
will be employed to probe electrode surfaces and nearby solutions. Spatially
resolved absorption spectroscopy will be employed to examine reactions of
electrochemically generated species, particularly those undergoing catalytic
oxidation-reduction reactions. In addition, this technique will be employed to
study diffusion to cylindrical microelectrodes and to electrodes of unusual
geometry. Generation of optical gain in electro- chemiluminescent systems will
be attempted. Raman spectroscopy will be employed to obtain structural
information about electrogenerated species and to probe the surface of carbon
electrodes. The carbon surface spectrum will be correlated with the
electrochemical behavior of the material. The structure of surface oxides on
modified carbon electrodes also will be examined. Spectroelectrochemical
investigations of the electrode-solution interface will enable correlation of
the molecular surface states of electrodes with their electron transfer
characteristics and thereby lead to a better understanding of heterogeneous
electron transfer reactions at the molecular level. Spatially resolved
spectroelectrochemical studies will provide an experimental test of computer
simulations of complex electrochemical reaction mechanisms and of diffusion at
electrodes with unusual geometries.
