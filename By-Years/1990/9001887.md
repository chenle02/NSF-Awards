This award will provide support to a group from Johns Hopkins University for a
research program on the physics of elementary particles. The research will be
conducted at the Tevatron proton antiproton collider at Fermilab, CDF. The
primary responsibility of the group will be to work on the upgrade of the vertex
detector at CDF using silicon strips for high precision tracking of the
particles. The aim is to be able to tag B mesons and study their properties and
to pursue the search for the existence of the top quark. The use of silicon
strip detectors will also serve as test for their future use at very high energy
and high luminosity colliders like the SSC.
