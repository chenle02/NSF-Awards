An award is made to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to develop a
far-field super resolution photothermal nanoscope (PTN) for three-dimensional,
label-free imaging of weakly fluorescent cellular nanostructures and
nanoparticles that is currently not possible. Applications of PTN will include
high-resolution imaging of molecules in live cells as well as investigating
protein misfolding, degradation, and aggregation. PTN can provide control and
optimization of biological applications of lasers such as tissue dissection and
ablation. PTN would be a valuable alternative or supplement to existing
microscopic techniques and, in combination with them, could provide a powerful
and versatile tool for biological research with a focus on cells. The project
will benefit variety of biological research communities and scientific areas
including cell biology, proteomics, neuroscience, nanotechnology, plasmonic
nanosensing, gerontology, and cancer therapy. This interdisciplinary research
involving physicists, biologists, and computer engineers includes a training
program on advanced optical imaging that will train and educate undergraduate
and graduate students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project has the following goals: 1) develop a photothermal confocal nanosocopy
platform with enhanced sensitivity; 2) explore nonlinear and photoswitching
phenomena to improve both spatial and spectral resolution; and 3) explore the
unique applications of PTN including label-free and targeted imaging of
different nanostructures, protein aggregates and image-guided disaggregation.
The intellectual merit of the project lies in the new concept of a far-field
microscopy integrating a confocal design, high pulse-rate lasers, high-speed
scanning, and time-resolved detection, to significantly improve on current
diffraction and spectral limitations. Because many cellular components in the
native state have low fluorescence, and are nano-scale in size, there is a clear
need for an imaging technique to study them with high resolution, high
absorption sensitivity, temporal resolution and fast acquisition time. The
proposed PTN will provide unprecedented resolution with enhanced absorption
sensitivity, thus opening new windows into unexplored areas of biological
research associated with cell metabolic activity, oxidization, endocytosis,
phagocytosis, melanogenesis, and apoptosis.
