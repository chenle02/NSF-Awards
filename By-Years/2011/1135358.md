This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering project will build capacity for
faculty to educate graduate students about research ethics in the context of the
research environment. This approach is grounded in and flows from extensive
empirical evidence that standards of conduct depend as much or more on the work
environment than on participation in isolated courses or online tutorials.
&lt;br/&gt;The four project objectives include: 1. Consensus Conference to
develop a framework to build a curriculum for Capacity-Building Workshops. 2.
Curriculum Development for the Workshops. 3. Capacity-Building Workshops. 4.
Outcome Assessments: Revise and finalize the Workshop curriculum based on
feedback from faculty participants and their graduate student trainees.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will pilot the proposed workshops in 8 public
and 7 private graduate institutions, including 3 Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs). To foster approaches responsive to the globalization of
the research community, the proposed Expert Panel includes a member with
extensive academic connections in China, and Chinese graduate students will be
among those assisting with key aspects of curriculum development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will derive from the activities, outputs
and outcomes of this project and will enhance graduate ethics education for STEM
graduate students while promoting the development of a diverse community of
researchers better prepared to model the highest standards of scientific
conduct. Results of the project will be promptly and widely disseminated through
workshops conducted by participating faculty, established research ethics
websites as well as the new National Center for Professional and Research
Ethics.
