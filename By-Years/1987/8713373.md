The purpose of this action is to provide funds to partially support invited,
non-North American participants and selected graduate students to attend a
Geological Society of America Penrose Conference entitled "Cordilleran
metamorphic core complexes, revisited: implications for crustal extension and
shortening in the North American Cordillera." The conference will be held
September 14-17, 1987, in Elko, Nevada. A two- day field trip (9/12 - 13) will
precede the conference and begin from Salt Lake City, Utah. The convenors for
the conference are Arthur W. Snoke, University of Wyoming; Gordon S. Lister,
Monash University, Australia; and Charles H. Thorman, U.S. Geological Survey.
