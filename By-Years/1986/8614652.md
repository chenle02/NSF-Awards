At the recent 4th International Conference on Megagauss Magnetic Field
Generation, Dr. Choe presented a paper on Conceptual Design Studies of a
Magnetic Field Generator Driven by Laser Light Forces that is incorporated in
the current proposal for a Novel Research grant. Contributors at this conference
were predominatly from highly supported facilities at major national
laboratories in the US, Soviet Union and Japan. The basis of Dr. Choe's proposal
comes from recent experimental observations in Japan of giant laser plasma
return currents from small target irradiation. Dr. Choe plans to study the use
of such return current mechanisms in the conceptual design of an optimal target
geometry and coil configuration for ultrahigh magnetic field generation. One of
the principal benefits of NSF support to the PI for these initial studies may be
to stimulate his interaction with national facilities such as at Los Alamos
where realistic experiments could be carried out.
