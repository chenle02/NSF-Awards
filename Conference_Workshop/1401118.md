This project provides travel support for the 12th World Meeting of the
International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA), to be held in Cancun,
Mexico, July 14-18, 2014. The theme of the conference will be on theory,
modeling, and applications of Bayesian statistics. It is anticipated that the
conference will be attended by an international group of academics, researchers,
professionals, government employees and students, from countries around the
world. The main focus of this project is on funding for junior researchers that
reside in the U.S.

Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework that facilitates blending
information from different sources and communicating findings and conclusions
using probabilities. ISBA-2014 is a scholarly conference where new Bayesian
statistics ideas will be exchanged. It is a truly international meeting for the
dissemination of state of the art statistical methods that use the Bayesian
approach. The meeting will promote the development of statistical theory and its
applications to engineering and the sciences. It will provide participants with
the opportunity to interact with colleagues from different countries, working in
a variety of fields of application of statistical methods.
