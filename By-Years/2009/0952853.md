This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) plans
to develop a Geospace Science Center which will provide control, operation, and
science integration of the Millstone Hill Upper Atmosphere Facilities (UAF)
program, which include the existing onsite radar as well as providing facility
space for development of distributed arrays of small instruments, and small
satellite missions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This center will provide a modernized
control and receiver area for the Millstone UHF radar, a set of display consoles
and computers suitable for the simultaneous operation of multiple instruments, a
radio frequency interference (RFI) screened receiver room, an electronics
laboratory, and a computing facility capable of supporting a significant grid
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgrades to the Millstone NSF funded Upper
Atmosphere Research Facility are designed to provide improved support for
science observations and research, by modernizing and enhancing existing
equipment and services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Millstone Observatory provides
vital measurements of the Earth?s upper atmosphere, and the Geospace Center site
upgrades will significantly improve onsite support equipment and data servers,
as well as allow space for teaching and large workshops, which is not possible
with the current accommodation. Enhancements to the Millstone teaching
facilities will offer tremendous benefits for training and outreach to young
scientists in the fields of Upper Atmosphere Science and Space Weather.
