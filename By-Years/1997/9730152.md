9730152 MOUDGIL This award provides funding for an Engineering Research Centers
(ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST)
Program Partnership between the Engineering Research Center for Particle Science
and Technology at the University of Florida and the CREST Center for Advanced
Materials and Smart Structures at NC A&T State University. This partnership will
also involve collaboration with North Carolina State University and Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. The vision and goal of this partnership are to develop
novel particulate synthesis and processing techniques for cutting tools
materials so that their mechanical properties can be suitably enhanced.
Specifically, new methods will be explored which can result in the fabrication
of cutting tools possessing high strength, high toughness and are capable of
operating in high-speed machining environments. This joint effort enhances and
integrates the expertise of the key research personnel in the areas of synthesis
of engineered particulates, microstructural and mechanical property
characterization, nanoparticle science and technology, and processing of
intermetallic materials.
