The PI will continue to investigate processes involving heat and mass transfer
concentrating on hotspots and on mid-oceanic ridge axes. He will investigate the
mid-plate swells associated with the Hawaiian, the Crozet, and the Cape Verde
hotspots, and use the shape of the swells to determine the total flux from the
underlying plumes and geoid anomalies to find the hot asthenosphere which
transfers heat laterally from the plume. He will investigate the kinematics of
the Iceland hotspot which are complicated by the spreading ridge, and search for
an explanation of hotspots on ridge-axes that are too small to be associated
with plumes. He will investigate the source region of plumes (presumable the
base of the mantle), and consider the chemically more dense region at the base
of the mantle including its entrainment in upwellings and its effects on the
thermal history of the earth.
