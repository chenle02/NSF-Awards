This research in the laboratory of Professor Jeff C. Curtis at the University
of San Francisco is funded under the RUI program by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
and Organometallic Chemistry Program. Proton-coupled electron transfer reactions
with low driving forces will be studied in order to determine whether H-bonded
intermediates accelerate the movement of the electron from reductant to oxidant.
Details of other effects including isotopic substitution, driving force and
solvent will be determined in order to learn more about the mechanism of proton
coupled electron transfer. Theoretical calculations will also be performed to
establish the electronic structure of the H-bonded intermediates. Proton-coupled
redox reactions are important in catalytic transformations and in biological
electron transfer. A simple reaction of this type will be studied in order to
determine its major features.
