Despite being one of the key driving forces behind scientific discovery and
playing a critical role for the well-being of our society as a whole, scientific
data sharing remains an issue fraught with security and integrity risks. This is
because certain restrictions on data usage (e.g., maintaining appropriate audit
logs for the data modifications) must be enforced rigorously, which is difficult
to accomplish with existing technologies in a seamless manner. The need to share
scientific data while honoring usage restrictions, protecting data integrity,
and capturing provenance for scientific repeatability requires development of
new software tools that can support these capabilities across multiple
organizationsâ€™ boundaries. The novel blockchain based data sharing system built
as a part of this project may result in advancing the knowledge base on how to
automatically balance the conflicting goals of security and integrity
requirements and information sharing in the context of open scientific discovery
process. This system in return can significantly increase volume and variety of
data shared for research purposes across a broad range of disciplines, thereby
directly addressing the NSF Big Idea on Harnessing the Data Revolution, by
further advancing capabilities of modern cyberinfrastructure and fostering novel
opportunities for interdisciplinary data-intensive research. Furthermore, by
actively incorporating our research results into the curriculum development, at
both undergraduate and graduate levels, we foster the next generation of
interdisciplinary scientists in a new era for open data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
achieve the above stated goals, this project builds an innovative system where
blockchain techniques are leveraged for assured scientific data sharing. First,
the project develops a policy specification framework tailored for open science
data sharing. Using this framework, scientists may easily specify any usage
restriction (e.g., do not re-identify human subjects, do not modify data, notify
us if the data is lost due to hacking). Later on, using the blockchain
framework, these restrictions will be captured, and stored via smart contracts.
One novel aspect of the proposed framework is that, using machine learning
techniques, it can analyze the smart contract based provenance information to
automatically detect potentially anomalous data modifications. To test the
capabilities of our framework, the project uses a multi-sensor based data
collection and data sharing project for understanding the impact of urban
pollution as a case study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
