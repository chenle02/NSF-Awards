This research project continues the work of the principal investigators in the
area of fluid dynamic performance of heart valves and flow through curved
vessels such as the aorta. The investigators plan to continue their theoretical
and experimental work to complete a model of flow in curved tubes and to examine
the turbulent flow through heart valves. The latter will be done using
ultrasound Doppler measurements.
