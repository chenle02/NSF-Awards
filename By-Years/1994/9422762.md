ABSTRACT CTS-9422762 RAAD SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY The proposed research
seeks to develop an experimentally verified, three-dimensional, finite volume
method to simulate fluid flows whose free surface is undergoing severe
deformations. The computational effort will be complemented by experimental work
using an open channel flow apparatus and a high speed video camera to
experimentally determine the shape of the free surface during transient and
steady-state flows in an open channel containing obstructions. Simulations of
water sloshing and waves breaking in a tank will be used to investigate the
important mechanisms of the decay of turbulent vorticity on a very active
surface and the penetration of turbulence into the main body of water below
breaking and spilling waves. To complement the qualitative data obtained by use
of the high speed camera, a digital particle imaging velocimeter will be used to
obtain quantitative velocity data. The proposed simulation method will represent
a significant advance in free surface fluid dynamics. From a practical
standpoint, the extension to three dimensions is most important, since the
simulation must be three-dimensional to enable it to realize its potential as a
manufacturing productivity tool in, say, die casting, or as a realistic
simulator of violent fluid interactions such as in water rushing over and around
dikes and bridge pillars.
