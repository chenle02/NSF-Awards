A calculus curriculum is being developed that stresses understanding rather than
techniques, contains realistic applications, and promotes the ability to write
coherent arguments. This development is being carried out with the participation
of twenty-six liberal arts colleges in the Midwest and takes the form of five
Resource Collections containing fundamental materials that can be used in part
or in total for curriculum development in calculus at any institution. These
collections are to be published as five separate volumes.
