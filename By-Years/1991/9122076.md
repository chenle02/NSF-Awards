The propagation of intense laser light in plasmas is studied theoretically in
this US/USSR collaboration. Of paramount importance is the investigation of
physical conditions in which the electric field large compared to the atomic
interactions and where relativistic motions are prominent. Present theoretical
understanding of this regime is primitive and the computational tools required
for the analysis are just beginning to be developed. Parallel experimental
efforts will allow a direct comparison of theory and experiment and should
result in a significant advance in our understanding of laser-matter
interactions in ultra-intense fields.
