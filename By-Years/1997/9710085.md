The Origins of Udi Syntax Udi is an endangered language which belongs to the
North East Caucasian language family. It has been selected as an object of study
because (a) the structures of the languages of this family are different in many
ways from those of more familiar languages and therefore can contribute
significantly to our understanding of language universals, (b) Udi has a complex
morphology, which supplies ready evidence of syntactic relations, and (c) Udi
has undergone significant syntactic and morphological change. The project
centers on the development of a construction for marking the focus of attention
and on the development of moveable agreement (which occurs on a host of any one
of many types, including verbs, nouns, pronouns, and adverbs). The project
involves study of both syntax and the morphology that is most relevant to that
syntax, including agreement and case marking. The objectives of the project
include the description and explanation of (a) agreement and complex verb
formation as they function in Udi today, (b) the origins of moveable agreement
in Udi, (c) origins of complex verbs in Udi and North East Caucasian languages
generally, (d) development of the focus construction in Udi and other North East
Caucasian languages, (e) origins of changes in case marking patterns. The
significance of the project is not limited to the explanation of phenomena
particular to Udi and other languages of the North East Caucasian family;
rather, these changes will be related to the universals of syntactic change. It
is expected that the project will provide (a) an explanation of how word-
internal agreement originates, (b) an increased understanding of how case system
undergo change, (c) testing of claims made in the recent literature on syntactic
change regarding the simplification complex constructions and regarding changes
in case marking and agreement patterns, (d) testing of claims regarding the use
in syntax of historical methods originally design ed for use in reconstructing
phonology.
