The project addresses a critical need in the symbolic algebraic computation
(SAC) community: the easy and speedy dissemination and access of research
information on the Internet. The Institute for Computational Mathematics (ICM)
at Kent State University has been operating a gateway (symbolic@mcs.kent.edu) to
the Internet electronic bulletin board for the SAC community for a number of
years. This project expands this service with a World-Wide Web server to form an
organizational framework for SymbolicNet---a facility to be established that,
through the use of WWW, Gopher, FTP, WAIS, automated subscription, and e-mail
distribution, will provide a rang of useful information services for the SAC
community. Cooperation with appropriate information services at other sites will
also be important.
