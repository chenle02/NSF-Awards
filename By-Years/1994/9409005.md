9409005 McFadden This project designs, sets up, and supports an on-line software
library for theoretical economic, econometric, and statistical computation. This
service will complement existing electronic working paper series, which at this
time do not support computational algorithms, and have not solved the problem of
indexing, documenting, and providing test harnesses for these algorithms. The
library will serve as an NSF repository for research results related to
computation, as well as a central location for software exchange among
researchers throughout the world. In the course of this project, the
investigators will work with developers of algorithms at Berkeley and elsewhere
to produce standards for documentation and testing that will facilitate exchange
of scientific software. Computational software developed through the Berkeley
Econometrics Laboratory, including software developed by the principal
investigators, will be used as a testing ground for development of standards
that are feasible and useful for both developers and users. Authors of software
that have potential applicability in economics will be encouraged to submit
algorithms that conform to documentation and testing standards.
