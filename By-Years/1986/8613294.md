This project analyzes the dynamic response of mechanical systems modeled by
nonlinear equations of motion. The systems have two degrees of freedom where
nonlinearities are produced by impacts and from qeometric sources. This class of
systems is typified by dynamic vibration absorbers with limiting stops. The
stops are used to limit excursions of absorber devices and are not intended to
act during normal operation. A study of motions involving impacts with the stops
must be carried out to ensure that such motions do not occur. This project
implements that study for both translational and rotational dynamic vibration
absorbers. It determines the parameter range for nonlinear behavior and for
stability of motion.
