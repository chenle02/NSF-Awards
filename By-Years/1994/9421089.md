CTS-9421089 David Cahill U/Ill, Urbana ABSTRACT Experimental measurements of
thermal conductivity will be carried out on thin-film amorphous oxide layers.
These layers are typical of coatings used to protect high-temperature components
such as turbine blades. The work seeks to understand the role of various
proposed mechanisms for heat transfer in these films. Improved understanding
potentially will be used to produce novel systems with improved properties.
