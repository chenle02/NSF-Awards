The Biochemistry Division in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
the University of Colorado, Boulder will purchase a state-of-the-art four
channel 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with partial support from the NSF Multi-User
Biological Equipment program. This instrument is required to perform multi-
nuclear multi-dimensional NMR experiments used in the solution structure
determinations of isotopically labeled proteins and RNAs. Triple-resonance
multi-dimensional NMR techniques now allow complete through bond resonance
assignment of proteins which means that the primary bottleneck in solution
structure determinations of the proteins (the assignment of the resonances) can
now be made much more unambiguously and in much less time than previous
techniques. The modern NM R solution structure determinations of a protein
requires isotopically labeled protein and access to a triple-resonance
instrument that has pulse shaping and pulqe-field gradient capabilities. The
multi-nuclear and multi-dimensional NMR techniques that have proved so
successful in solution structure determinations of proteins can now be applied
to structural studies of RNAs and protein-RNA interactions. This additional NMR
instrumentation is required to meet the demand for NMR time arising from the
recent expansion of the faculty (Dr. Wuttke) in the Biochemistry Division. The
requested instrumentation will vastly improve the NMR capabilities and will
accelerate research in the following areas: - Solution Structural Studies of RNA
and Protein-RNA Systems (Pardi) - Development of NMR Techniques for Solution
Structure Determinations of RNA (Pardi) - NMR Structural Studies of Cardiac
Troponin C (Falke) - Structural Studies of the Active Site of the Group I
Ribozyme (Cech) - Structure and Function of Catalytic RNAs (Uhlenbeck) -
Solution Structural Studies of the trans Acting Viral Proteins Tax, pX and Their
Complexes (Wuttke)
