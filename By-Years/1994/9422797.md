9422797 Snyder This research involves three projects designed to measure the
relative importance of party in the U.S. Congress and the U.S. state
legislatures, and to test hypotheses about some of the factors that may
determine the importance of party. The research builds on the investigator's
earlier work on legislative politics and representation. The first project
develops and applies a procedure for distinguishing between "party voting" in
legislatures that is due solely to similarity in legislators' preferences, and
party voting that is due to pressure from party leaders or party caucuses. The
second project extends a previously developed model of spatial party competition
that treats political parties as groups of self-interested individuals, not as
monolithic decision makers. Finally, the third project investigates initiatives
and referenda that appear on state ballots. This research has three goals: to
implement a new test of the median voter hypothesis against the hypothesis that
political parties enact different policies; to test for the importance of
factors such as factionalism and "professionalism" in state legislative decision
making; and, to test other hypotheses about political agenda formation in the
states, such as the importance of "spillovers" across states. ***
