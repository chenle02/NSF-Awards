This award provides one-half the funds needed for the acquisition of an X-ray
diffractometer system that will be installed and operated in the Department of
Marine Geology and Geophysics at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric
Sciences in the University of Miami. The University of Miami is committed to
providing the remaining funds required for the purchase. A modern X-ray
diffractometer system is needed at this institution as an integral part of many
of its research projects in carbonate sedimentation, analysis of samples from
the Ocean Drilling Program, hydrology, paleoclimatology, and paleontology.
