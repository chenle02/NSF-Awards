9614730 Garver Rates of tectonic uplift and erosion rates determine the
topographic expression of an area undergoing deformation, but are difficult
parameters to measure. This study will determine the rates of erosion of active,
rapidly eroding mountains by studying the sediments that are shed from these
mountains. In particular, apatite and zircon crystals will be collected from
recent and relatively recent sediments. Because of their uranium content, the
crystals preserve the ages of their cooling which occurred during uplift of the
mountains and exhumation of the rocks. The study area is the Southern Alps of
New Zealand, where recent uplift is relatively well known, and sediments are
readily sampled. Results are expected to help understand the role of erosion
rates during orogensis in general.
