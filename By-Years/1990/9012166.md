Economists have long used overlapping generations and neoclassical growth models
to explore important empirical and theoretical issues in public finance,
development, international trade, savings and monetary policy. Recently, some
researchers have attacked the way these models characterize the long run
tendency of the economy. This project will study the mathematical equations
which economists use to codify and apply these models and investigate the
relationship between the empirically determined parameters and the corresponding
long run properties of the models. Since the equations which codify the
assumptions of the models can lead to bizarre behavior when these models are
used in practice, the models could give misleading forecasts of the behavior of
the economy. By applying state of the art computer programming techniques,
formulae for characterizing the plausible ranges of parameters of interest will
be developed. The concept of determinacy developed by Laitner and Anderson-
Moore will be applied to identify fixed-point and limit cycles which possess
stability properties that imply unique convergent trajectories from nearby
points. The project will focus on discrete time models. Analytic expressions for
specific utility and production functions will be developed when general
formulae are unattainable. The asymptotic stability of these models will be
investigated for empirically relevant ranges of model parameters in order to
characterize the plausibility and relevance of the potentially complex
asymptotic behavior when confronting real world data. The project will begin an
investigation of the global convergence properties of these models with the
objective of developing "higher order" turnpike theorems characterizing
conditions guaranteeing convergence to limit cycles of a given periodicity.
