9417938 Freedman This award supports a planning visit for joint research between
Dr. Guoan Yue, Professor of Sociology (and Psychology) at Nankai University,
Tianjin, Peoples Republic of China, and a research group headed by the Principal
Investigator, Daniel Freedman, at the University of Chicago. It is a study of
social attachment in early childhood across two generations, and it uses current
observation (via videotape) and recollections via an interview and
questionnaire. It is a cross-cultural study in that comparable data have been
previously obtained from Icelanders, Korean-Americans and Bengali-Americans. The
purpose of the study is to address the issue of cultural relativity versus
cultural universals with regard to mother-child attachments. The study will
address a series of questions: Are there recognizable, culture-specific patterns
of mother-child attachments? Are cultural patterns of mother-child relationships
resistant to change across generations? Are historically based societal shifts
sufficient to change such patterns? If mother- child relational patterns prove
resistant to change, or if they do not, which theoretical framework best
accounts for the facts?
