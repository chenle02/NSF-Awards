The Accessible Retired Computers in Biology (ARCiB) project will build an
archiving facility to preserve previous but still very useful versions of
computer software for processing biological data. There is also a component for
maintaining particularly important, but now outdated, pieces of hardware to act
as a testbed for backward compatibility of new programs and a source of
information on the performance aspects of these now low-end systems. The project
will provide low cost computing resources to the community and reduce long-term
costs for the community by making upgrades a choice not a requirement. It will
make accessibility of legacy data easier, thus allowing preservation of data
that would have been lost. The existing website is already very popular. The
project also has involvement by undergrads throughout and will provide a
resource that will disproportionately help smaller schools and programs with low
or intermittent funding for new equipment and software.
