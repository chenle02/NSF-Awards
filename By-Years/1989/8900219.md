The principal investigator will study the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian
operator on complete Riemannian manifolds. When the space is compact, he will
provide upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff measure of the nodal set of
these eigenfunctions. In the noncompact situation, he will derive lower bounds
for the decay of these eigenfunctions. Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator
are the mathematical representations of harmonics of bells and musical
instruments. Peculiar shaped bells can have an intricate assortment of
harmonics; often the third or seventh harmonics dominate. In higher dimensions,
the shapes of these bells are represented mathematically by Riemannian
manifolds. Were these bells to flare out to infinity, the Riemannian manifold
would have to be noncompact. The principal investigator will study the decay or
damping out of such harmonics.
