This symposium will focus on recent advances in nanostructured and nanophase
materials and their application. Nanostructured materials consist of domains of
less than 100 nm and include atom clusters and cluster assemblies, one- and two-
dimensionally modulated layers and three-dimensional structures. The term
"nanophase" refers to nanoscale structures that are typically less than 100 nm
and particles of one phase, whereas the term "nanocomposite" refers to a
composite of more than one nanophase. Numerous studies have been conducted on
these materials over the last two decades or so, and industrial applications are
in sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the explosive growth of the field of
nanotechnology, there is a need to develop meeting programs that focus on
specific elements of the field. This symposium was once the only nanotechnology
symposium at the Materials Research Society meeting; and over time, has become
more focused on continuous phases of nanomaterials including nanophase materials
and nanocomposites.
