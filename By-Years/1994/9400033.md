This project involves the measurement of particle velocities in a rotating
filter system by the Pulsed Light Velocimetry technique. Particular emphasis
will be on the role of secondary flows (e.g. Taylor vortices) in preventing
plugging, the effects of particle sedimentation in the separation, and the
influence of particles on flow stability. Overcoming plugging should greatly
improve the performance of filters, which are important to many industrial
processes.
