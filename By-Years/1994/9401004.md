Benson This award supports work on representations and cohomology of finite and
compact Lie groups. There are three areas which will be investigated. The first
is an investigation of the representation theory and cohomology of finite
groups, primarily over fields of prime characteristic. The second involves
understanding the cohomology of compact Lie groups, by extending current methods
from the finite case. The third is aimed at constructing maps between
classifying spaces of finite and compact Lie groups. The research supported
concerns the representation theory of finite groups. A group is an algebraic
object used to study transformations. Because of this, groups are a fundamental
tool in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as mathematics.
Representation theory is an important method for determining the structure of
groups. ***
