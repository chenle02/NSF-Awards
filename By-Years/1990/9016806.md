ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to develop and explore a new conception of
the phonological component in generative grammar. On this view, the basic
universal principles of phonology measure the well-formedness of phonological
representations; individual grammars are constructed by weighting the universal
principles and computing their interaction via the principles of Harmony Theory.
The representation assigned to a given form is that which rates most highly in
the harmony-theoretic combination of well-formedness along its various
dimensions of phonological organization; that which optimally satisfies the
various (sometimes contradictory) constraints placed upon it. The approach
promises to anchor phonology directly upon a set of universal principles, a goal
which has proved elusive in standard generative phonology. The key is replacing
the familiar derivational, rule-based computational format with one directly
based upon the idea of optimization. The main object of study will be systems of
stress and syllable structure.
