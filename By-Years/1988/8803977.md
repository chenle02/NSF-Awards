The University of Notre Dame Department of Physics will recruit nine or ten
undergraduate students from academic institutions within a 300 mile radius of
South Bend, Indiana, to participate in new and on-going research within the
Department. The students will participate in research programs in astrophysics,
atomic physics, elementary particle physics, solid state and condensed matter
physics, and theoretical physics. The program will be under the direct
supervision of participating faculty. It will include weekly research seminars,
student seminars with the project coordinator, development of a research
logbook, contact with various research groups, and social gatherings with the
faculty. A formal follow-up program will be implemented to monitor short and
long term progress of the REU students. This project is supported under the
Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate
supply of scientists for the future.
