9309574 Azizoglu The Principal Investigator is addressing the research issues in
designing mulitiple access schemes for wide area all-optical networks. The
objective is to produce an analytical framework that provides efficient channel
access taking the optical device constraints into consideration. Such
constraints include the physical characteristics and limitations of optical
devices, such as the tuning speed of lasers and filters, laser phase noise, and
fiber dispersion. Frequency and Code Division Multiple Access schemes are
considered as two special cases of a general access scheme where both frequency
and code concurrency are employed. The analytical methodology being developed
will evaluate the performance of the general scheme and find the optimal scheme
for a given network design goal. The award provides support for three years.
