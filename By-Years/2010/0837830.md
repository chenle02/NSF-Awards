INTERDISCIPLINARY (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project sustains and expands a
fundamentals of neuroscience course for non-science students while
simultaneously growing the previously successful outreach to underserved pre-
college students. In addition, the project aids faculty to incorporate
neuroscience as a means of promoting science literacy into their course
offerings. The project develops a series of diverse laboratory experiences
spanning increasing degrees of complexity, from dissection of sheep brain, to
electroencephalograms, to real-time assessment of language comprehension. The
laboratory exercises guide students toward reading and understanding primary
literature, devising experiments, reflecting upon experimental results and
presenting findings.&lt;br/&gt;
