Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. G.
Thomas Strickland, Director, International Health Program at the University of
Maryland, in Baltimore, MD, and Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Hamid, Director of the
Virology Laboratory at the Liver Institute in Menoufia University, Shebin El
Kom, Egypt. The objective of this joint research is to investigate the
relationship between specific biomarkers of environmental exposures to the
development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Techniques have recently been
developed to determine whether hepatic cancers frequently occur in people with
specific acquired genetic mutations. The hypothesis to be tested is: exposure to
chemicals that damage the p53 gene will increase risk of HCC, especially in
persons with concurrent viral exposures. Scope: This project will involve two
laboratories with complementary capabilities to conduct research in an important
field for both countries. This proposal meets INT objective of supporting
U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit. The project was generated
as a result of a workshop on biotechnology organized by the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) and the Egyptian Government. NIH was involved in the evaluation
of the project and in recommending its support. This project is being supported
under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, administered by the US Department of
State, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to
carry out cooperative activities.
