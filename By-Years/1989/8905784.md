This award will allow librarians at the Human Relations Area Files, a not-for-
profit institution specializing in distributing databases of ethnographic data
to libraries and universities, to issue the fifth edition of the Ethnographic
Bibliography of North America. This is the standard bibliographic resource on
Eskimos and North American Indians for scholars and students in anthropology and
related disciplines. The fifth edition will contain about 60,000 citations and
will be distributed to libraries on compact disks. Since the bibliography will
be indexed by author, title, region, ethnic group and subject other more
specialized bibliographies may be produced in the future. This project is
important because bibliographies are the standard primary reference tool for
scholars, and they must be periodically updated to contain the full
representation of knowledge on the subject.
