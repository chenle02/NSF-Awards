The most important crops in the U.S. for food and biofuel are all closely
related, members of a plant group known as Andropogoneae. Corn (maize), the crop
with the highest dollar value, is related to sorghum and sugarcane, the
potential biofuel Miscanthus and about 1000 other wild species. Because the
entire genomes of corn and sorghum have been sequenced, we can translate
information from these crops to wild species and conversely, we can study wild
species to help develop better crops. This project will use DNA sequences to
determine how members of the group are related to each other, and then will use
that information to assess how their genomes have evolved. Genome doubling is
very common in this group, and may have allowed the species to colonize new
habitats and to develop new growth forms. This work will illuminate untapped
genetic resources that crop breeders desperately need to feed the planet.

Data from this project can be used for crop improvement, for identifying new
sources of biofuels, and for understanding the response of American and African
grasslands to climate change. Training of undergraduate and graduate students in
grass taxonomy, analysis of DNA data, and plant genome evolution is another part
of this project. Education components of the project include involvement of
undergraduate lab assistants, participation in the summer program for high
school students at UMSL, and involvement in the Botanical Society's
PlantingScience program. In addition, we will develop a graduate computational
course built around the analytical components of this project, so that beginning
graduate students can contribute directly to the analysis of sequence data.
