The object of this research is a systematic evaluation of sources and sinks of
turbulent kinetic energy in the atmospheric surface layer. Effects of stability
on the normalized terms of the turbulent energy equation (the so-called "phi
functions") are being investigated in a graduated series of comparatively small
field experiments. The particular forms of and the empirical constants in
relations for these functions now commonly used to parameterize the lower
boundary layer remain uncertain because of contradictory results of subsequent
experiments and incomplete investigation of the effects of stability. This
experiment will measure wind profiles, turbulence spectra, surface thermal
energy balances, and Bowen ratios in order to evaluate the effects of moderate
departures from neutrality upon (1) the rates at which turbulence is produced by
wind shear and buoyancy, (2) the turbulence dissipation rate, (3) the net rate
at which energy is locally gained or lost by the sum of the divergence terms. To
obtain this budget data, additional measurements will be added: the depth of the
mixed layer will be monitored acoustically and the vertical turbulent flux of
turbulent energy will be measured by two levels by eddy correlation. All field
experiments will be conducted over extensive cropped surfaces of uniform
roughness. Professor Frenzen is well qualified to make these measurements; he
has considerable experience in previous field measurements especially in the use
of his unique low-inertia anemometers.
