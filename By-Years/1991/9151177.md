This Computer-Aided Design laboratory provides students with improved career
potential through the utilization of AutoCAD. The project enhances the existing
Engineering Science Computer Lab and establishes a comprehensive CAD training
facility that is representative of actual industrial CAD practices for the
foreseeable future. This project enables students to acquire hands-on experience
in understanding traditional graphics and drafting topics. Material taught
primarily on CAD provides the following curriculum improvements: grids and
coordinates, 3-D, computer graphics, design principles, and electronic drafting.
