9733660 Heineman This research focuses on novel techniques for designing
software components that provide a mechanism for adapting their behavior.
Traditional approaches to component reuse are limited in that a component must
exactly meet the needs of an application builder before it can be reused. This
research proposes a new direction by suggesting that component-based software
development will only occur when application builders can adapt software
components to suit their needs. The first objective is to aid component
designers in designing and implementing highly reusable components. The
language-independent solution proposed by this research applies equally well to
components written in C, C++, or Java. The second objective is to provide an
architectural description language for specifying adaptations to individual
components as needed for a target application. The third objective is to
construct a design tool that helps users compose applications from adaptable
components. A fourth objective is to define a reengineering methodology for
retrofitting existing legacy code into adaptable components. A final objective
is to train our students in designing highly reusable software components and
building applications from software components. This research will greatly
increase the ability to create large, complex systems from independently
implemented software components. ***
