Estrogen receptors were originally characterized as intracellular receptors,
acting only in brain regions that regulate reproductive behaviors. Recent
discoveries have identified that various neurons throughout the nervous system
exhibit responses to estradiol through the activation of surface membrane
receptors. These membrane estrogen receptors are now known to lead to
alterations in learning and memory, sexual receptivity, motor control and pain.
The nervous system is not unique in this regard, as membrane estrogen receptors
affect the reproductive organs, the cardiovascular system and bone. The goal of
this project is to determine how estrogen receptors are adapted to act as
surface membrane signaling molecules. The project willl test the hypothesis that
palmitoylation of the estrogen receptor is the essential regulatory step in
converting intracellular receptors into membrane signaling proteins. There are
23 different enzymes known to palmitoylate proteins. The principal goal is to
identify which of the 23 enzymes is responsible for estrogen receptor
palmitoylation, and then to determine the physiological and behavioral impact of
manipulating estrogen receptor palmitoylation within brain. Identifying the
proteins that palmitoylate steroid receptors provides an innovative experimental
system that will challenge dogma and train personnel to integrate various in
vivo and in vitro model systems. State-of-the-art cellular/molecular methods
will be integrated with established behavioral approaches. Using specific
assessment tools, Dr. Mermelstein will monitor the technical, intellectual and
instructional development of his trainees. Dr. Mermelstein and his students will
also participate in multiple outreach activities, including the development of a
Neuroscience Minor as part of the undergraduate curriculum at the University of
Minnesota.
