9358052 Ferrari Research will be conducted in the area of Micromechanics, that
is the stress and failure analysis of inhomogeneous materials, including
composites, polycrystals, granular and defective media. The research will
establish relationships between the microstructure and the macroscopic
properties of materials, their application to the stress and failure analyses of
engineering materials and structures, and the design of advanced materials
tailored for specific engineering applications. These general objectives will be
pursued by the joint use of analytical, computational, and experimental methods,
applied to various materials of technological relevance. The poly-inclusion
method proposed earlier by the PI will be tested against further exact results.
The development of additional exact and numerical results, respectively for
periodic and locally non- periodic media will be undertaken. On the experimental
side, ultrasonics will be used to determine simultaneously the effect
elasticities and the interaction function for specific composite types, and to
perform controlled-microstructure experiments. The ideas will be extended to
other inhomogeneous engineering materials, including porous and damaged media,
and polycrystals. Research in the area of Functionally-Graded Composites will be
conducted extending previous studies on the optimal distribution of micron-size
alumina particles in aluminum-based materials. Micro- Electro-Mechanical Systems
(MEMS) will be also studied. A crucial characterization technique is the
Micromechanical Diffraction Method, as this yields multi-scale residual
stresses, the mechanically relevant portion of the texture function, the local
effective properties, and various microdistributional data.
