With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh will acquire a computer
cluster for molecular and materials simulations. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) modeling of proton and electron
localization in water clusters; b) electron transport through molecular "wires";
c) ion transport through biological channels; d) design of composite thin films
with desired mechanical and optical properties; e) modeling of particulate
transport; and f) design of novel membranes for carbon dioxide and hydrogen
separation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast, modern computer
workstations is vital to serving the computing needs of active research
departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and
visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications
of parallel processing. These studies will have a significant impact in a wide
number of areas, including biochemistry and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;
