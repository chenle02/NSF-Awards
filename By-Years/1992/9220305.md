The central question addressed in this proposal is the effect of pesticides on
the ground water system, beyond the unsaturated zone horizon. This will
accomplished by formally linking the PRZM model with a 3-D ground water model,
and will involve a spatial integration of the 1-D PRZM results to the horizontal
spatial dimensions, using the PC-based GWT-Platform. This is a prototype
integrated groundwater simulation environment, written for the MS Windows-3. It
manages the collection and use of all geographic, physical, and chemical
information of the application, which is entered in graphical mode on the
screen. Relational data bases are formed and, automatically used for actual
simulation, monitored on the screen in real time, with quasi-instantaneous
graphical output.
