Professor Barbara is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in
an experimental investigation in "real time" of the dynamics of motion along the
reaction coordinate for chemical reactions in solution. Systems are chosen that
are especially amenable to theoretical interpretation and that allow fundamental
insight into liquid phase reactions. The research directly impacts on the
understanding of metal-metal charge transfer reactions and low temperature
electron transfer mechanisms relevant to photosynthesis. Professor Barbara is
developing various novel pump-probe techniques for ultrafast spectroscopy and
applying them to electron transfer reactions in both ground and excited states.
Resonant electronic excitation by an ultrashort laser pulse is used to prepare a
reaction system in a distribution of geometries near the transition state. The
subsequent evolution of the system along the reaction coordinate is then
monitored by femtosecond spectroscopy. Various theoretical models and
simulations are used to aid in interpreting the experimental results.
