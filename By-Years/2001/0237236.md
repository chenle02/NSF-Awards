This research especially focuses on homopalladium and bimetallic Pd-Ni, Pd-Pt,
Pd-M (where M is Cu, Ag, Au), and Pt-Au carbonyl clusters, because they are of
potential technological importance as ideal precursors in the design of new
materials with useful catalytic, electronic, magnetic, and/or optical behavior.
A major goal is to devise preparative pathways under controlled conditions to
produce new, nanosized metal clusters in reasonably good yields to enable
physical/chemical studies. Clusters under study include homopalladium ones with
35, 39, 52, 54, 59, 66, and 145 metal atoms in their cores and similarly large
heterometallic ones with a number of other metals.

Collaborations have been established to carry out particular state-of-the-art
measurements and high-level theoretical calculations on a number of the
unprecedented nanostructured materials, including comparative analyses of
physical properties and electronic structures of these normally well-defined,
homogeneous ligated clusters (of which at least several should possibly possess
mesometallic behavior) with those of naked. and ligated nanoparticles of the
same metals with narrow size distributions.

This research capitalizes on synthetic breakthroughs to make new materials
involving large nanoscaled metal complexes. The research has possible relevance
to commercial catalysts widely used in many organic reactions. Students will be
trained in the synthesis and physical measurements of nanosized materials.
