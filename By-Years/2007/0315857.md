Professor Zhan Chen of the University of Michigan is supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program to study polymer surfaces utilizing the nonlinear
optical method sum frequency generation (SFG). Surface structures of poly(alkyl
methacrylate) (PAMA) will be studied in water and in protein solutions. The
study of polymer surface structures while in contact with protein molecules will
elucidate how such surfaces mediate interactions between polymers and biological
systems. Atomic force microscopy and contact angle methods will also be used to
study the structures. For the students involved, the project combines training
in analytical, material, surface and polymer sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will aid in establishing detailed relations between polymer surface
structures and biocompatibility. The understanding can prove valuable to those
designing materials that can reside and function in the body for long periods
without fouling. Other applications include anticorrosion coatings and sensor
development.&lt;br/&gt;
