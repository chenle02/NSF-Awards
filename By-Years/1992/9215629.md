The thermal and mechanical aspects of grinding introduce locked-in stresses
into finished parts; these residual stresses have been suspected of
significantly affecting service life. Through an interdisciplinary examination
of the cam grinding process, the project will develop the base science and
engineering technology that will allow an engineer to predict and control
residual stresses in ground components, and understand the role of residual
stresses in the wear and fatigue of ground components. The research team will
comprise of engineers and scientists from universities and American industries,
with expertise in residual stress analysis and modeling, depth profiling of
stresses, thermal analysis and modeling, statistics, tribology, mechanical
metallurgy, fatigue, and failure analysis. Major producers of testing equipment,
of abrasives and grinding equipment, and of automobile engines and their related
components, have committed financial support, materials, equipment and
facilities, as well as the unique capabilities of their engineers, to gain an
understanding of how machine grinding alters a part's properties and durability.
The results should provide a significant competitive advantage for American
machine tool manufacturers in the development of uniquely instrumented grinding
machines, and will have immediate applicability to manufactures of products
involving precision ground components.
