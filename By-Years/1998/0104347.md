Dr. Winn is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. His research program will apply the
phenomenon of gravitational lensing and the techniques of radio and optical
interferometry to problems in cosmology and galactic structure. Using
gravitationally lensed quasars, he will measure the current expansion rate of
the Universe, and will test whether this expansion rate is accelerating. In a
third project, he will attempt to find and study central black holes in distant
galaxies. He also plans to contribute to the technical development of optical
interferometry and its application to study gravitational lensing by compact
dark objects in our Galaxy. His educational and public outreach program includes
teaching several undergraduate courses and continuing to write articles about
science and science policy for the public.
