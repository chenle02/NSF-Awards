Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that plays a very important role in
the communication between nerve and muscle, by breaking down acetylcholine, the
chemical neurotransmitter released by the motor nerve, and terminating its
action. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is a very closely related enzyme whose
function is still unknown. Both of these enzymes are present in higher chordates
(vertebrates). The principal investigator found that the cholinesterase (ChE) of
amphioxus, a primitive chordate, has properties intermediate to AChE and BuChE.
The principal investigator suggests that this ChE resembles the ancestral
esterase and that AChE and BuChE have appeared as a result of a gene duplication
event early in chordate evolution, with subsequent structural and functional
divergence of the two enzymes. The principal investigator plans to investigate
this hypothesis by using biochemical and pharmacological techniques to study the
ChE activity of three primitive organisms -- the agnathan vertebrate Petromyzon,
the cephalochordate amphioxus, and the urochordate Ciona, and by using the
techniques of recombinant DNA technology to investigate the genes coding for
these enzymes, and their sequence similarities to the genes for AChE and BuChE
from higher organisms. These studies will provide a detailed picture of the
cholinesterases from these organisms at the protein and nucleic acid levels, and
should provide information about the evolution, structure/function
relationships, and genetic regulation of the enzyme.
