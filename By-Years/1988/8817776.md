This project will develop perspective-based aspect graphs for visual
recognition of 3-D objects. Algorithms will be developed to create aspect graphs
for planar-faced objects and for curved-surface objects used in CSG solid
modeling. Techniques for reducing the complexity of these aspect graphs will
also be studied, possibly leading to reduced storage or faster object
recognition.
