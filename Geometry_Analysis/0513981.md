Abstract

Award: DMS-0513981 Principal Investigator: Krishnan Shankar

The study of non-negatively curved Riemannian manifolds is a rich subject with
many open problems. The PI proposes two research projects in this area. The
first project in collaboration with R. Spatzier is continuation of recent work
with R. Spatzier and B. Wilking; we showed that a manifold with upper curvature
bound 1 and spherical Jacobi fields along every geodesic must be locally
isometric to a compact, rank one symmetric space. This has led to further
interesting questions. The second project proposes to find obstructions on the
fundamental group of positively curved manifolds in the presence of continuous
symmetry; other than the classical Synge theorem, there are no known
obstructions. The third project is in the area of geometric group theory. In
collaboration with N. Brady, M. Bridson and M. Forester we constructed many new
examples of first and second order Dehn functions by constructing the so called
snowflake groups. We hope to pursue further questions about Dehn functions for
other classes of finitely presented groups (like CAT(0) groups, higher Dehn
functions etc.)

Most of us have an intuitive understanding of the term curvature. Tabletops and
desktops are flat while basketballs and saddles are curved. My research concerns
the study of objects in higher dimensions that admit non-negative curvature.
This falls under the umbrella of differential geometry which is the language
Einstein used to express the general theory of relativity, our best theoretical
description of gravity and its effects on the universe. Intuitively a positively
curved object has the property that all triangles drawn on it are fatter than
triangles drawn on a tabletop. Similarly, negative curvature corresponds to thin
or skinny triangles. So (the surface of) a basketball has positive curvature
while a saddle has negative curvature where the rider sits. In higher
dimensions, matters being much less visually apparent, one uses equations and
sophisticated geometrical techniques to study the curvature of manifolds which
are, roughly speaking, objects with no sharp edges. One of the great mysteries
in differential geometry is the dearth of examples of non-negatively curved
manifolds, and not many structure theorems either. My work deals with trying to
understand the structure of manifolds in the presence of certain constraints
like non-negative curvature or symmetry.
