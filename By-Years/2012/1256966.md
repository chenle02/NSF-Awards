This is a study of historical study of a new form of listening that evolved in
the twentieth century, threshold listening, which grew out of turn-of-the
century field and laboratory studies in Europe and the United States on the
physical and emotional effects of music. This study will explore how this new
understanding of the bodily effects of listening despite inattention fueled the
development of new consumer products and has come to be one of the main
processes by which we navigate our daily environments. Research methods include
archival research on internal memoranda, correspondence, and advertising
development in the William Maxwell Files of the Edison Papers at the Edison
National Historic Park and interviews with musicologists, composers, and
recording company executives that were involved in the development of background
music products.

Background music is a ubiquitous part of our lives that is, by design, given
little attention by those who passively consume it. Yet, those who study, design
and produce it understand the ways can affect people?s moods and behavior, for
example, increasing work place efficiency or stimulating consumption. This
research will provide new knowledge and understanding of the central role that
science played in the development of background music and the ways in which
music consumption and emotions are intertwined.
