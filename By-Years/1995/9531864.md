9531864 Smethie This project provides a contribution to the hydrographic work to
be done in the Western North Atlantic during the Atlantic Climate Change
Experiment (ACCE) of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Two
meridional lines will be surveyed along 52 degrees West and 66 degrees West,
from boundary to boundary. The PI on this project will oversee the collection,
processing, and analysis of Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) data on these surveys,
which will provide information on the spreading and transport of water masses at
various levels in the water column. These lines represent a major part of the US
contribution to the WOCE hydrographic program and ACCE.
