The principal investigator will work a variety of problems dealing with the
control of nonlinear systems. In particular, the large time behavior of the
filtering diffusion, the uniqueness of viscosity solutions of Bellman's
equation, and adaptive control treated as a Bayesian problem will be considered.
Control theory deals with the theoretical aspects of understanding how complex
systems learn about its environment, process the information to reduce
uncertainty, plan, generate and execute control actions. It has played a major
role in many areas of science and engineering.
