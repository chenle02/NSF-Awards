9303728 Fath This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Plant Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from Harvard
University. His Ph.D. research was in the area of molecular biology using E.
coli as the experimental system. He plans to carry out his postdoctoral
fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Haselkorn at University of
Chicago. The proposed research entitled "The identification of genes controlling
heterocyst differentiation in Anabaena" will broaden the training of the Fellow
into plant biology in general and plant developmental biology and biological
nitrogen fixation in particular. ***
