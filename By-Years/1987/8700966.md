Alternative hypotheses for the ancestor-descendant relationships among the
orders of the winged insects will be tested using 18s ribosomal RNA analysis.
Mapping, sequencing and development of a gene library using six species
representing several orders will provide data for cladisitc analysis. The
proposed research will be an independent test of insect relationships formerly
interpreted using only morphology, thereby clarifying a long-standing and
important evolutionary question. The research will also contribute to the
growing database in molecular systematics.
