1445921&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop
(August 2-3, 2014) will be held at the Sandia National Laboratory campus with
experts from around the world and the country to address the research needs for
basic combustion kinetics for soot formation and sooting flames. The dates have
been selected to be in advance of the bi-annual 35th International Combustion
Symposium, to be held in San Francisco, August 4-8, 2014, when experts from
around the world will be congregate in the Bay area. The workshop's schedule
takes advantage of the larger event resulting in cost reduction.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's key results have the potential of gaining
knowledge that would make utilization of fossil fuels in energy production
cleaner and more sustainable. The workshop also provides students a unique
opportunity to be exposed to multidisciplinary science and the leading issues in
sooting emission from combustion processes. Graduate students from US
educational institutions are encouraged to attend the workshop, with NSF support
to defray lodging costs.
