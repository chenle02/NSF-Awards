This research improves the theoretical foundations for structural optimization
and clarifies controversies on existing solutions available for multimodel
optimization. The research develops a new and simpler solution for the optimal
design of a doubly clamped column and re-examines other optimization problems in
which multiple Eigen values occur such as vibrating shafts and beams. Multimodel
optimization is an effective approach to improve the reliability in the design
of structures, such as columns, frames, and arches. This research will help to
validate and assess the theoretical disparities, if any, of the approaches
currently used for multimodel optimization. The results has a good potential to
increase the confidence of the theoretical approaches that are used for
structural optimization.
