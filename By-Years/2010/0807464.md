Aldroubi&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807464&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops a
mathematical framework together&lt;br/&gt;with fast computational schemes for
nonlinear signal&lt;br/&gt;representations that are "optimally" compatible with
observed&lt;br/&gt;data (e.g., a set of signals, images, or videos). The data
can&lt;br/&gt;be finite or infinite and the models can live in finite-
or&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional Hilbert or Banach spaces. The framework
can&lt;br/&gt;be viewed as an extension of the standard least squares to
a&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear setting. The investigator uses this framework
to&lt;br/&gt;unify, extend, and complement some of the techniques used
in&lt;br/&gt;compressed sampling theory, the generalized principal
components&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and the dictionary design problem. He applies
the&lt;br/&gt;results to several problems in engineering and
biomedicine&lt;br/&gt;including data classification and segmentation (e.g.,
face&lt;br/&gt;recognition, brain morphology, DNA sequence comparison,
movement&lt;br/&gt;tracking), and signal modeling (e.g., for signals with
finite&lt;br/&gt;rate of innovation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many of the new
technologies use digital signal processing&lt;br/&gt;techniques in their
functioning, e.g., telephone and computer&lt;br/&gt;networks, medical imaging
devices, audio equipment, etc. These&lt;br/&gt;technologies, which are producing
greater and greater volumes of&lt;br/&gt;data, gave rise to new nonlinear
techniques and paradigms for&lt;br/&gt;acquiring, processing, analyzing, and
transmitting the data. In&lt;br/&gt;order to take advantage of these novel
techniques, a thorough&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the structure of the
underlying signals and data&lt;br/&gt;is fundamental. This project develops
techniques for learning&lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear data structure from a set of
observations. It has&lt;br/&gt;direct applications in data mining, data
classification,&lt;br/&gt;segmentation, and tracking moving objects in video
sequences. It&lt;br/&gt;also has direct applications in data compression, noise
removal,&lt;br/&gt;and data transmission.
