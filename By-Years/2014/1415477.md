This award funds a CISE REU program entitled Research on Biomedical Informatics
at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The objectives of this program are to
expose students to the concepts, techniques, applications, excitement and
rewards of Computer Science (CS) and Biomedical Informatics research, to
stimulate the students interests in these fields, to improve students research
and communication skills, and to encourage them to pursue a career in Computer
Science. This program also allows a diverse group of talented undergraduates to
gain valuable research and communication skills and improve self-confidence,
creative thinking, and independent problem solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU
Site program supports the research activities of ten undergraduate students per
year for a nine week period. Each student project is derived from on-going
faculty-led research projects. The research activities in this proposal will
contribute to the understanding of the fundamental theory, principles, and
techniques in data mining, information retrieval, networking, security, and
privacy. Immediate impacts of these research activities include: (1) enhanced
and supported decision making and data mining for clinicians and biomedical
researchers; (2) new computing resources for the biomedical network platform and
telemedicine; and (3) new protections against potential security breaches
leading to improved patient privacy and safety. The research areas in this REU
Site program cover some of the most challenging research questions in Biomedical
Informatics, and each project has the long-term potential to improve the quality
of health care, reduce medical errors, provide safer care at a lower cost, and
advanced biomedical research.
