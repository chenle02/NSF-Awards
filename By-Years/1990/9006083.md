Comparative studies form a major part of modern biology. Typically, several
species are compared with regard to two or more traits, such as brain size and
body size, limb length and running speed, or dentition and diet. Significant
associations between traits generally are inferred by applying standard
statistical tests. Unfortunately, standard tests are not appropriate for
comparative studies. This is so because species do not represent statistically
independent data points. Recently, several methodologies have been proposed
which take the non-independence of species values into account and hence allow
appropriate statistical tests for evolutionary relationships between continuous
traits. These methods make explicit use of the known evolutionary (phylogenetic)
relationships among species. The proposed research compares the statistical
efficacy of several such methods by determining how well they perform in the
analysis of computer-simulated data with known properties.
