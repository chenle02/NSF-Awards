This work will focus on mathematical problems arising in the theory of
quasiconformal maps and harmonic analysis. Quasiconformal maps are smooth
univalent transformations of planar (or higher dimensional) domains in which the
distortion - called the dilatation - is controlled. Such maps occur as solutions
of a partial differential equation called the Beltrami equation. One goal of the
research will be to find new characterizations for quasiconformality in terms of
oscillation functions, maximal functions and doubling measures. These are
concepts taken from other parts of mathematical analysis in which certain
analytic hypotheses are usually assumed. Part of this effort will be to consider
how the geometry of quasiconformal maps can be used to reduce the requirements
of analyticity. A second line of investigation will continue research on the
problem of describing domains which can be the image of a disk under a
quasiconformal transformation. Such domains, quasidisks, cannot be arbitrary.
Their boundaries cannot have cusps, for instance. Insight into the structure of
quasidisks, will provide important information into the nature of any image
domain under quasiconformal mapping.
