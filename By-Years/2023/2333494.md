The long-term burden of COVID-19 may vary across races and ethnicities. To
address this variaiton this project will extend a current model to account for
race and ethnicity. The availability of outcomes and vaccine uptake data by
race/ethnicity in the US creates an opportunity to explicitly model these
variables across the groups and evaluate the results from real-world data. The
project will help us understand the inequities of COVID-19 outcomes and
vaccination uptake and prepare the US for the future of COVID-19 and other
outbreaks. The project has the potential to be applicable wherever relevant data
on ethnicity and race is available, and can be extended to other types of
groups. The project will integrate the lessons learned in an undergraduate
course on programming and a graduate-level class on Machine Learning for health.
The project will also provide research opportunities through a senior capstone
program and minority-serving programs such as the USC JumpStart program and the
Viterbi Summer Institute.

The proposed project will integrate data on race and ethnicity along with
various other datasets to account for population health. The key innovation in
the integration is the ability to learn contact matrices from data. The project
will use a novel approach, where the n√ón contact matrix is generated by n hidden
parameters that indicate the likelihood of contact of a group with a randomly
selected individual. The learned contact matrix will be integrated with an
epidemiological model currently being used by the PI in the US Scenario Modeling
Hub to generate long-term projections of cases, deaths, and hospitalization. The
appoach will compare learning contact matrices with other approaches that derive
those matrices from survey data and high-resolution mobility data. The new
approach will enable the modeling of sub-population interactions when such
mobility data is not available. The model will be evaluated with ground truth
data observed over the last three years in collaboration with the COVID-19
Scenario Modeling Hub.
