The objective of the project is to develop the physiological psychology program
at Kalamazoo College to a level that allows students to: (1) have access to a
laboratory course in physiological psychology, (2) participate in group research
projects, and (3) conduct supervised, but independent research projects. At
present, insufficient equipment for animal care and the lack of some basic
laboratory equipment have precluded the expansion of the physiological
psychology program. The acquisition of cage washing equipment and animal housing
will allow the expansion of the animal care facility, thereby increasing the
research capacity. The acquisition of equipment necessary for brain surgery
(drills, stereotaxics, cryostat, microscope) will greatly expand the surgical
techniques that can be used in research and, when combined with the equipment
already possessed by the College, will provide students with enormous
flexibility in the type of research they can conduct. Increased research
capacity and complexity will significantly improve the departments ability to
train students in the techniques and theories of physiological psychology and
related fields.
