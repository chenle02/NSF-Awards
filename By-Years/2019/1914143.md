The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from bringing AI-driven decision
making to the fingertips of anyone who can use Excel. In particular, through
Excel Macros, this product enables the following capabilities: Predictive
Analytics, What-If Scenario Analysis, and Optimized Decision Recommendations.
This enables teams of all sizes and capabilities to utilize data-driven decision
making without the need for expensive infrastructure or highly skilled data
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project aims to bring together Graphical Model driven prediction and
optimization to solve generic reinforcement learning. This will be an important
innovation since a decision-making framework that uses Graphical Models as the
substrate to solve generic reinforcement learning / AI problems at scale is non-
existent and very challenging. To this end, the innovation is twofold: in
efficiently representing Excel data as Graphical Models, and in the data
substrate to compute over Graphical Models in a scalable and seamless manner, on
a single machine (e.g. a laptop), as well as multiple
machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
