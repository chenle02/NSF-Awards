This research is concerned with the development of self-validating algorithms
for computing probabilities in selected continuous univariate and multivariate
probability distributions. Self-validating numerical methods are needed because
of the difficulty in assessing the accuracy of results obtained in large-scale
computing from standard methods. Toward this end, interval analysis will be used
in the development of these algorithms as well as rounded interval arithmetic in
an IBM compatible microcomputer.
