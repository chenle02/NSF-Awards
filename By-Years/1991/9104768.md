Arc-continent collisions are a relatively common phenomena in earth history,
but the style and especially rates of deformation associated with such
collisions are poorly known. This project will utilize the active oblique arc-
continent collision of the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates to attempt to
quantify these parameters. Uplift rates will be determined by tectonic
geomorphologic methods applied to uplifted marine strand lines and river
terraces and, combined with existing structural information, will be used to
resolve how and at what rate oblique convergence is translated into reverse and
strike-slip deformation.
