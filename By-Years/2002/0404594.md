In the past 10-15 years there have been significant developments in
the&lt;br/&gt;areas of applied regression and classification. Much of the
impetus&lt;br/&gt;originally came from outside of the field of statistics, from
areas&lt;br/&gt;such as computer science, machine learning and neural networks.
In some&lt;br/&gt;cases, statisticians have helped to synthesize these
innovations, often by&lt;br/&gt;reinterpreting them from the point of view of
standard statistical models.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, we now have at our disposal
a very powerful collection of&lt;br/&gt;techniques for adaptive regression and
classification. These are now&lt;br/&gt;being applied to medical diagnosis,
bioinformatics and genetic modeling,&lt;br/&gt;chemical process control, shape,
handwriting, speech and face recognition,&lt;br/&gt;financial modeling, and a
wide range of other important practical&lt;br/&gt;problems. In this proposal,
the investigator develops new methods for&lt;br/&gt; adaptive regression and
classification, with particular application&lt;br/&gt;to problems in
bioinformatics and genomics. One such method is the&lt;br/&gt;"fused lasso", a
technique which seeks solutions which are both sparse&lt;br/&gt;and and smooth.
It is designed for problems in which the features have&lt;br/&gt;a natural
ordering, e.g. in time or space. Protein mass spectometry&lt;br/&gt;represents
one such area of application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the
investigator develops new statistical algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for analyzing data
from biological and human experiments. This work&lt;br/&gt;is part of the
exploding field of "bioinformatics", which seeks to make&lt;br/&gt;sense of the
huge volume of data produced by new technologies in biology&lt;br/&gt;and
medicine. This kind of work represents the next step after
the&lt;br/&gt;sequencing of the human genome, and has enormous potential for
societal&lt;br/&gt;impact through disease prevention and treatment.&lt;br/&gt;
