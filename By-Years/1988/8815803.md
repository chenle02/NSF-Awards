The major thrust of this proposal is in two separate experimental areas: 1) the
flow of helium 2 between rotating concentric cylinders (Couette flow) and 2) the
thermal expansion of liquid helium (which is closely related to the specific
heat) near the lambda transition in a well-defined confined geometry. Questions
concerning helium 2 Couette flow will be investigated: first the appearance of
quantized vortices in the general case (both cylinders rotating), for which a
new prediction exists; second, the stability of this array of quantized
vortices, also a subject of recent theoretical work. The experiment for
determining the thermal expansion of liquid helium consists of measuring the
dielectric constant of helium confined between plates in a high Q
superconducting LC cavity. Large scale computer simulations of vortex motion in
helium 2 will be pursued. Experimental work suggests that ions may excite
solitons on vortices in rotating helium 2. Simulation of a tangle of vortex
lines, a subject of recent controversy, will also be made.
