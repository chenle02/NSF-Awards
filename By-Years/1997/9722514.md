9722514 Ashtekar This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research collaboration
between Prof. Abhay Ashtekar, Prof. Jorge Pullin, and Prof. Pablo Laguna of Penn
State University and a group of researchers at four Mexican institutions, headed
by Prof. Michael Ryan of the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares (ICN) of the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). Other Mexican institutions
involved in the research collaboration are the Instituto de Fisica of the
Universidad de Guanajuato, the Centro de Investigaciones y de Estudios Avanzados
(CINVESTAV), and the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana. The researchers propose
to cover a broad range of topics, among them: black hole evolution and
structure, numerical relativity, inhomogeneous cosmological models, canonical
gravity, new variables, loops, and supergravity. The project will serve to
consolidate several separate collaborations between top researchers in both
countries. It has the potential to increase our understanding of black holes,
both their formation and their dynamics, as well as making important
contributions in numerical relativity and the numerical analysis of black hole
collisions. ***
