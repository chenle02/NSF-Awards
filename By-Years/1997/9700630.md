Abstract Proposal No: 9700630 Proposal Type: Conference Support Principal
Investigator: Spiro D. Alexandratos Affiliation: Gordon Research Center This
grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of
the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division. The principal investigator is Spiro D. Alexandratos. The grant
is to be used for travel support to the 1997 Gordon Conference on Reactive
Polymers, Ion Exchangers and Adsorbents. This Gordon Conference will address the
theme of polymer supported reagents, their synthesis and use in a number of
separations technologies. The design of polymer supported reagents for molecular
recognition systems is a central theme of the conference. The conference is very
pertinent to emerging areas of separations technology. The precise design of
molecular recognition ligands, their attachment onto polymer backbones for use
in environmental remediation, chromatography, biochemical separations,
adsorption etc. are new interdisciplinary forefront areas for separations. The
conference will bring together academic and industrial participants, engineers
and physical scientists, and a mix of mature researchers and new researchers
including students. The focus in discussions, an integral part of the Gordon
Conference format will aid information dissemination and enhance the educational
component of the conference.
