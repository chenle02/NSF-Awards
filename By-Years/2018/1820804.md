The Phenome 2018 Conference will be held February 14-17, 2018 in Tucson,
Arizona. The conference aims to accelerate U.S. research activity in the
emerging field of plant phenomics, which is an approach that allows for the
rapid analysis of plant traits at a massive scale. The conference will highlight
cutting-edge engineering, sensing and robotic technologies that help plant
scientists understand how genome sequences and environmental influences interact
to give rise to plant traits of interest. The four-day meeting will feature
plenary talks, technical and networking sessions, and it will provide
opportunities for meaningful engagement among plant and crop scientists,
engineers and computational scientists. The interdisciplinary meeting is a joint
effort of the National Plant Science Council (NPSC), the American Society of
Plant Biologists (ASPB) and the North American Plant Phenotyping Network
(NAPPN). With NSF support, the conference will continue to attract early career
researchers and participants from groups underrepresented in science. These
efforts build a critical interdisciplinary community around a research area that
increases U.S. agricultural competitiveness and ensures food security now and
into the future.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
