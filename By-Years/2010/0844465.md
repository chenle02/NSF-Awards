This is a 12-month standard award to support a Doctoral Colloquium program at
the American Medical Informatics (AMIA) 2008 Annual Symposium to be held in
Washington, DC (November 8-12, 2008). This will bring together approximately 10
dissertation-stage doctoral students in the field of Health Care Informatics for
one day of talks and interaction with 5 distinguished senior faculty
mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although doctoral consortiums are common
activities in other domains such as computer science, information sciences, and
engineering, they are not well-known in the medical informatics community. Yet,
there is a growing need to provide a forum for doctoral students to share their
work and also network with other doctoral students and researchers. The goal of
the consortium is to support the doctoral students through constructive remarks
and feedback on their research from prominent researchers and interaction with
other students. The consortium is interested in student participants from a
broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform medical informatics,
including computer science, information science, and engineering.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The consortium provides a forum for
students engaged in inter- and multi-disciplinary scholarship focusing on
organizational and social issues surrounding healthcare technologies. It
functions as a forum for expert and peer critique of the students' doctoral work
with the goal of improving their dissertations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: The consortium brings together people who might not engage with one
another otherwise which exposes them to different scientific disciplinary
research approaches and questions, fosters a supportive mentoring network for
young researchers, and ultimately helps develop the next generation of
scientists and educators in fields related to the development and use of
technology in healthcare related fields.
