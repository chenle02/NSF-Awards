Abstract

Award: DMS-0505610 Principal Investigator: Bruce A. Kleiner

The first part of the project concerns two geometric evolution equations: mean
curvature flow and Hamilton's Ricci flow. The main objective is to understand
the structure of the singular set and the geometry of the solutions near the
singular set. The second part of the research program is motivated by geometric
group theory and rigidity questions, specifically the asymptotic structure of
negatively curved (or Gromov hyperbolic) spaces. This leads to an investigation
of spaces which have a self-similar character using analytic tools that have
been developed in the last few years. Here the goal is to quasisymmetrically
deform the space into an optimal form, if possible, in order to reveal hidden
symmetries; show that no hidden symmetries exist; or show that the original
space was really a deformation of something familiar. This is directly related
to group theoretic rigidity problems.

The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation: the
evolution of surfaces by their mean curvature, and Hamilton's Ricci flow. Mean
curvature flow is a standard (idealized) model for many physical process which
involve an evolving surface, or interface, between two regions in space. The
Ricci flow -- an equation governing a curved space geometry which evolves with
time -- has made headlines lately due to its prominent role in the spectacular
work of Perelman on the 100 year old Poincare conjecture. Much is known about
the solutions of these two equations, but many basic open questions remain,
especially those tied with the formation of singularities, which play a central
role in Perelman's work. The project will address some of these questions.
Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which
have a self-similar, or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been
developed in the last few years. Here the goal is to deform the space into an
optimal form, if possible, in order to reveal hidden symmetries, show that no
hidden symmetries exist, or show that the original space was really a
deformation of something familiar. This is very useful for understanding the
asymptotic shape of infinite groups of symmetries.
