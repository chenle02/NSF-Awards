Chronic combined nitrogen deficiencies characterize vast segments of the
world's oceans. Microbial nitrogen fixation helps to alleviate these
deficiencies. The role of eubacteria as nitrogen fixers has received less
attention than cyanobacteria. This project focuses on the role of eubacteria in
N-depleted North Carolina coastal waters using recently developed immunological
and molecular techniques to provide a cell specific set of fluorescence and
isotopic assays of bacterial population and community dynamics in benthic and
planktonic habitats. Such techniques and assays allow for identification of
cells competent and induced to fix N, and provide a means to detect the presence
of nitrogenase genes in total population DNA. These techniques will allow (1)
direct, quantitative information on microbial N fixation potentials and sites
thereof, (2) assessment of environmental conditions that regulate nitrogenase
gene expression, and (3) evaluation of recently described, numerically and
trophically important picoplanktonic cyanobacteria for their N fixing
capabilities.
