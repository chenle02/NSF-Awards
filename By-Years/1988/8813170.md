Reaction kinetic models to which cybernetic variables (calculated using simple
macroeconomic principles) have been added to represent the internal regulation
of the syntheses and activities of key enzymes for competing metabolic processes
are shown to successfully describe a variety of growth situations in mixed
(substitutable) substrate systems. A dynamically evolving cybernetic framework
is presented for modeling metabolic regulation in which transport, reaction, and
product formation compete for cellular material and energy resources with
evidence that observations on abrupt switches in metabolic pathways, metabolic
lags, exotic (oscillatory) dynamics, etc., can all be accommodated by these
models. A program is on-going which will provide detailed observations of enzyme
levels, cell mass, biotic and abiotic substrate, and product concentrations,
etc., which will be compared with model predictions under various situations.
These situations include different patterned changes in the abiotic phase in fed
batch and continuous cultures. Microorganisms respond to their environment in
ways that are controlled by a very elaborate and complex internal mechanism
mediated by important molecules of the cell, such as DNA, RNA, and many others.
In modeling microbial processes responsible for the many products of
biotechnology, account must be made of such metabolic regulation. Evidence is
present from past work that metabolic regulation can be described simply using
macroeconomic principles. An extensive research program is now developing
various aspects of this idea in modeling processes important to modern
biotechnology.
