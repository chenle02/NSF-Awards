9451005 Tsai An intensive laboratory course for undergraduates in advanced
techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology -Advanced Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology Laboratory (Chem 5362)-is a senior level course, required by
the new Bachelor of Science program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. A key
feature of the lab is that the students perform all procedures themselves
without involving any "demonstration" exercises. Exercises used will include
state-of-the-art techniques that the students are likely to encounter later in
their careers in this field. These include computer-assisted DNA sequence
analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA electroporation, homologous
recombination, in vitro mutagenesis, reporter gene fusions, production of
eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, automated low pressure liquid chromatography,
and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of biological molecules. A
"hands-on" experience with techniques such as these gives students a competitive
edge in their future endeavors.
