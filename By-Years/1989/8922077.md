Finite elements and structural reliability into a comprehensive methodology for
safety and reliability assessment of non-linear structures with uncertain
characteristics and subjected to random loads with spatial and/or temporal
stochasticity. Reliability and safety assessment of flexible offshore and
aerospace structures, mechanical components in ground and space vehicles, and
large- deformation base-isolated systems.
