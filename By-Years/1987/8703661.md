The West Virginia University Herbarium contains over 150,000 plant specimens.
The collection was started in 1889 and has steadily increased since then. It has
the most complete collection in the world of West Virginia vascular plants. The
collection is stored in metal cabinets that were not designed as herbarium
cases, resulting over the years in consistent and continuing damage to the
specimens. This, in addition to heavy use in research, in preparation of the
Flora of West Virginia and in extensive loan activity, leaves the collection
badly in need of renovation. This project will provide funds to purchase modern
herbarium specimens to re-house the collection. The University of West Virginia
will provide salary support for recuration of the collection as cost sharing on
the project.
