The acquisition of equipment for gravity surveying, magnetic surveying,
electromagnetic surveying and seismic surveying has significantly improved
undergraduate laboratory experiences in geophysics at Norwich University. These
equipment systems take advantage of naturally occurring variations in density
(gravity studies), conductivity (electromagnetic studies), and velocity of sound
propagation (seismic studies). Gravity studies of near-surface density contrasts
as well as regional changes in gradients are carried out. Buried geologic units
and their contacts are mapped using the magnetic and electromagnetic equipment.
Seismic studies focus primarily on refraction methods and mapping glacial
deposits. The addition of this equipment has opened "windows" for students to
see relationships inside the earth.
