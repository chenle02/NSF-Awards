This project focuses on determining complexity bounds for algorithms that
compute with polynomials. The first part of this project deals with polynomials
with sparse encodings which can be much shorter than those encodings
traditionally used in computer algebra. Two problems are examined: (1) How to
find a sparse representation of a polynomial; (2) How to design algorithms that
manipulate sparse polynomial representations. The method of operator eigen-
functions, used in the interpolation problem for sparse polynomials, is
exploited. The second objective of this research project is to obtain a lower
bound for an algebraic decision tree algorithm which tests the membership of a
point in a polyhedron. This test is a technique which is used in linear
programming. The previous techniques, for determining lower bounds for such
algebraic decision trees, are based on the topological invariants of a tested
set. These topological methods cannot be used in this case, because each
polyhedron has trivial topological invariants. The new methods explored, are
based on the singularities of a set given by a system of polynomial
inequalities. Applications of these techniques to complexity of systems of
polynomial inequalities are examined.
