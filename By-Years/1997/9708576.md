9708576 Gose This grant provides $76,350 as one-half support of the cost of
acquiring a new superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) for the Paleomagnetics
Laboratory at the University of Texas. The requested instrument will replace an
antiquated (vintage 1976) and increasingly unreliable ScT instruments SRM that
has been in continuous service at UT for over 20 years. The 2-G model 755R SRM
that will be purchased is equipped with DC SQUIDS which provide over an order of
magnitude greater sensitivity and greater dynamic range than their current
instrument allowing analysis of weakly magnetized sediments and rocks. This new
instrument will support a diverse range of scientific investigations including
paleomagnetic studies of plate motions and paleoanthropological and
archaeological studies that take advantage of magnetostratigraphy to date fossil
localities. This facility will also serve as an educational tool for multiple
graduate students and as a regional resource for investigators requiring
magnetic analyses of samples. ***
