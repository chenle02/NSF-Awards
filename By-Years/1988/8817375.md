This MRI Planning proposal will examine state and local government relations in
the area of privatization of mandated services and application of privatization
to the provision of home health services, the accountability that goes along
with this relationship, and the public's knowledge of and satisfaction with
privatized home health services. For each of the one hundred countries in North
Carolina, information will be obtained about the current provision of home
health services. The information will include surveys conducted with directors
of county health departments, directors of private home health agencies, and a
representative sample of the counties population. Data will be obtained from
county health services as to how the issue has been addressed by their county
governments and what type of financial arrangement are made with regards to
privatized services.
