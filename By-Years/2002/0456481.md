The proposal is for partial support of a 3 day conference on New Developments in
Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations to be held in conjunction with the
annual Barrett Lectures of the University of Tennessee.

The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together graduate students,
young investigators, and more senior researchers. The program features a series
of lectures by Sergiu Kleinerman and plenary talks by 8 or more senior
mathematicians. The funding will be used for the travel support of graduate
students, post docs and young researchers.
