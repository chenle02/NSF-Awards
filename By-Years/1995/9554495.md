9554495 Karnawat Turtle Mountain Community College, on the Turtle Mountain
Indian Reservation in North Dakota, is to conduct a four-week summer commuter
project in mathematics for Native American high school girls. The primary
objective of the MEGA program is to ensure that a cadre of promising young
Native American women is prepared for, and matriculates into mathematics and
mathematics-based disciplines, including engineering, at the college level. The
girls in the program will be involved in the problem solving activities. The
emphasis will be on applications, and much of the data for this study will be
collected from field trips to cultural sites on the reservation. A field trip to
the North Dakota State University will be offered at the end of the summer
component of the program. The girls will be kept actively engaged during the
academic year through their participation in Sunday academies. The MEGA project
is designed to stimulate interest, increase participation, improve achievement,
increase visibility, and accelerate career advancement and success in
mathematics and related areas for young women on the Turtle Mountain
Reservation, and to provide a model which might be replicated on other
reservations. ***
