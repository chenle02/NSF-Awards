Associative learning is one of the basic processes of knowledge acquisition and
one that has historically been held to be central to human cognition (as it is
in current "connectionist" or "adaptive-network" models). One approach to
understanding the fundamental theoretical and neurobiological mechanisms
involved is through investigation of classical conditioning with animal
subjects, where the pairing of a conditonal stimulus (CS) and unconditional
stimulus (US) causes the CS to take on behavioral effects related to those
originally produced by the US. Dr. Wagner's research, which makes use of
classical conditioning in the rabbit, is in this general vein. The particular
focus of this project is on a question that has equal implications for pursuing
the neurobiological substrates of conditioning and for the development of
abstract computational models. Dr. Wagner and his associates will investigate
the possibility that associations that involve the "emotional" consequences of a
US are categorically distinguishable from associations involving specific
sensory-motor consequences. At issue is whether or not the two classes of
association are differentially influenced by the conditions of training and have
different forms of behavioral consequence (notably, with sensory-motor
association being identified with the elicitation of specific conditional
responses while emotional associations have modulating effects on otherwise-
elicited conditional and unconditional responses). If upheld by the results of
Dr. Wagner's research, the distinction would encourage a hierarchical, adaptive-
network extension of existing models of associative learning.
