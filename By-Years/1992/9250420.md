The Biological Computing Laboratory is used by students during classes, biology
laboratories, and undergraduate student research projects to gather data from
physiological instruments, to manipulate and analyze data, to retrieve
information, to test biomathematical concepts such as population dynamics and
biomechanics, and to prepare presentation graphics. Equipment includes permanent
computer workstations and a movable station for demonstrations purposes.
