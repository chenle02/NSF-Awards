&lt;br/&gt;Parole boards must ask themselves a crucial question: should the
prisoner before them be released, or is he or she likely to commit another
crime? While statistical prediction rules (SPRs) have been shown to be the best
way of combining information about such prisoners to predict recidivism, parole
officers tend to rely on their own intuition for combining the information to
make their decisions. College admissions officers make similar sorts of errors
each year, by basing admissions on criteria such as one-on-one interviews,
instead of statistical models that can predict success in college based on past
performance, often incremented by tests that have been specifically designed to
predict performance. Nothing predicts without any inaccuracy, but the conclusion
that SPRs are more accurate than intuition is well established, by over 150
studies comparing the two prediction modes. The proposed project asks a related
question, one with important public policy implications: Why do people believe
that they can make better decisions than can statistical models? One hypothesis
to be investigated is that while SPRs automatically specify how poorly they
predict when they specify how well, people overestimate their own ability to
predict outcomes and hence reject the statistical models. Moreover, such
overestimation may be based in part at least on the cognitive factor that our
belief in our ability to predict is partially based on our ability to "explain"
("fit") situations in retrospect ("I could have told you he'd kill again, given
his behavior as a child"). By understanding these biases of overestimation and
retrospection, we can begin to devise effective methods for convincing people to
rely more on statistical prediction rules and less on their own judgment,
thereby befitting clients to whom accuracy of prediction is important, often
vital.&lt;br/&gt;
