A Workshop and Conference is being held at the University of Melbourne,
Australia, to bring together active, leading, international experts and emerging
researchers to report on recent results and explore future directions in the
field of Geometry and Topology. Particular emphasis will be placed on one of its
most active branches, the study of 3-manifolds. Geometric structures on
3-manifolds are known to exist by Perelman's work on the Ricci flow, but
relatively little is known about the interplay between analysis and geometry,
and how to construct geometric structures directly. The Workshop will be
targeted at early career researchers and will feature short courses covering a
broad range of materials and techniques being used at the frontier of research
in dynamical and probabilistic methods in geometric group theory, invariants of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and new methods in distinguishing knots and links. The
Conference will highlight ongoing research focused on finding direct connections
between analysis, geometry, and topology of 3-manifolds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable Early Research Career
mathematicians from the United States to attend a Workshop and Conference at the
University of Melbourne, Australia, on recent results and new directions in the
geometry and topology of 3-manifolds. This is one of the most active and rapidly
changing areas of mathematical research. Participation will give these young
researchers access to short courses on new results and techniques for future
research and bring them together with leading international experts in the area.
The Workshop and Conference will have broad appeal to group theorists, analysts,
differential geometers, and low-dimensional topologists. It will bring about
interaction between emerging researchers and experts and expose the potential
for future collaborations.
