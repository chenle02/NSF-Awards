As general-purpose computing moves into the age of pervasive parallelism,
programmability becomes the key hurdle limiting the effective use of available
computing resources. Transactional memory promises to simplify parallel
programming for application programmers. However, research in Transactional
Memory is being seriously hampered by the lack of a reusable open source
infrastructure. The project will develop the key pieces necessary to overcome
this situation: A transactional memory library built out of highly decomposed
pieces will provide reusable and replaceable parts suitable for investigating
tradeoffs in software TM implementations. Standardized interfaces will allow
libraries conforming to the interfaces to be used in a variety of environments.
TM-aware run-time analysis tools, particularly profilers and debuggers, will
provide the necessary tool support for TM implementors and application
programmers to understand and improve the performance of software using
transactions. Interesting benchmarks, in a variety of high-level languages, will
move forward our understanding of TM performance
characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
