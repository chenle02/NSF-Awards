Dissertation Research: Cognition and Environmental
Noise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study investigates the social construction of
sound or "noise" in the environment through analysis of how people interpret
sound. This is a topic of theoretical interest to cognitive science, social
psychology, and the arts. Given the cultural emphasis on vision in our society,
less research has been done on the importance of the cognitive interpretation of
sound and its consequences for urban life, the social environment, and mental
health. This study examines what figures into how people listen and how the
concept of noise is evaluated by personnel in a sound engineering firm. The
debates and conflicts among such personnel come to define what is considered
problematic noise as they aim to develop technology that focuses on improving
the listening experience in modern society. Using ethnographic observation and
discourse analysis, the investigator looks at perceptions which ultimately come
to define the concept of noise. In the process, the study contributes to debates
about constructivism and realism in social science by showing the way in which
opinions compete to create facts. It also addresses concerns related to
environmental stress and the utility of hearing and listening for enhanced
social well-being. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This study
should impact knowledge about hearing, an important component in understanding
such diverse issues as the effect of noise in the environment on social stress
and the utility of music in well-being and mental health. It should impact
knowledge about listening, and consequently, point to how to improve social life
through language, technology, and environment.
