This award supports cooperative research between Dr. Frederick Tsuji of the
University of Southern California and Dr. Kwang-Tsao Shao, Institute of Zoology,
Taiwan Academia Sinica, on the phylogenetic relationships among bioluminescent
fish and other marine organisms through studies of their bioluminescent
reactions. Under this project, the mechanisms of bioluminescence in Taiwan's
apogonid fish will be investigated to determine what similarities may exist
between those fish and other bioluminescent fish. This project is jointly
sponsored by NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council under the cooperative
science program between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Coordination
Council for North American Affairs.
