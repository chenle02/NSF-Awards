This proposal seeks to contribute to the conceptualization of vulnerability in
hazards and to an enlarged view of hazard management through the examination of
shifts in vulnerability through management efforts, resource development, and
local ability to manage consequences of oil spills along the Strait of Malacca.
Through interviews with members of a fishing community, the factors and linkages
between the biophysical vulnerability and the economic and social dimensions of
vulnerability and potential coping strategies will be investigated in depth. The
results should contribute to an enhanced understanding of how vulnerability can
be systematically analyzed and incorporated into an integrated assessment of
risk and risk management opportunities.
