The investigator analyzes large systems of coupled oscillators that arise in
various branches of biology and condensed-matter physics. A common theme is the
spontaneous emergence of synchronization due to cooperative interactions among
the oscillators. The systems of ordinary differential equations that constitute
the models will be investigated analytically and numerically. Techniques to be
used include methods of dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, statistical
mechanics, and numerical simulation. Real-time computer visualization of the
many-oscillator dynamics plays a crucial heuristic role in the research. Several
of the tasks are expected to generate experimentally testable predictions. The
mathematical problems studied here are models of behavior as varied as the
beating of a heart, the patterned flashing of groups of fireflies, or the
circadian rhythm. Specific areas to be studied include: phase models with a
large but finite number of oscillators; pulse-coupled oscillators with
distributed frequencies or local coupling; phase-locking and invariant 2-tori in
arrays of Josephson junctions; arrays of electronic relaxation oscillators;
coupled oscillator models of the Drosophila circadian system; and delayed
switching of charge-density waves.
