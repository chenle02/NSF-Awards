This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Glenn Radice of
Columbia University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Masatoshi
Takeichi of Kyoto University, Japan. Dr. Radice will spend one year working at
Dr. Takeichi's lab in Japan, investigating the role of N-cadherin in
embryogenesis. The cadherins are cell- surface proteins responsible for cell-
cell adhesions. Spatial segregation of cells differentiating into distinct
lineages during embryonic development requires selective intercellular
adhesions. This study will investigate the molecular basis for selective cell
adhesion during embryogenesis. Dr. Radice's background is in mammalian
developmental genetics and Dr. Takeichi is a recognized leader in the field of
cellular adhesion. This work should provide critical information for the
understanding of mammalian morphogenesis.
