The frequent and conventional use of non-literal language has been a major
stumbling block for natural languages processing systems since the early machine
translator efforts. Metaphor, metonymy and indirect speech acts are among the
most troublesome phenomena, Recent computational efforts addressing these
problems have taken an approach that emphasizes the use of systematic knowledge
about non-literal language convention. This work will construct the MetaBank,:
an empirically derived and theoretically motivated knowledge-base of English
metaphorical conventions. More generally, this effort can be seen as an attempt
to develop methodologies for empirically capturing language conventions in
usable knowledge-base forms.
