9320369 Goldberg Ever since World War II, the United States has endeavored to
find a "quick scientific fix" for the problems confronting this nation.
Previously, it was the "War on Cancer" that would find a cure within a
relatively short period of time. Currently, activists are calling for a
"Manhattan Project" for AIDS to find an immediate cure for that dreaded disease.
When these projects fail, the public which has been led to foot the massive
costs of these "Manhattan-like" projects rightly becomes skeptical of science--
even if it is the case that it was the politicians who cynically made these
promises. Given these problems, it is critically important for the public to
understand why and how the Manhattan Project succeeded and how current projects
may or may not fit the model that that war-time effort presents. It is this task
which Dr. Goldberg is continuing with this grant. Dr. Goldberg is completing his
study of General Leslie R. Groves, Commanding General of the Manhattan Engineer
District. Dr. Goldberg aims to provide a context of understanding who General
Groves was, why he was picked to head the atomic bomb project, and the
characteristics that made his administration of the project so effective. He is
also exploring the reasons why these very same characteristics served him so
poorly after the war. Most treatments of the Manhattan Project focus on the
technical puzzles which were solved in record time or on the impact of the
development of the bomb on end-of-the-war and post-war diplomatic history. By
examining the Manhattan Project in the context of a study of General Groves, one
is immediately confronted with the need to assess his philosophy of organization
and the importance to the success of the project of Groves' administrative style
and the administrative machinery he created. ***
