Solovay plans to investigate various questions in mathematical logic, including
questions concerning models of inductive inference, exotic Boolean algebras, and
the consistency of Quine's system of set-theory, "New Foundations." In addition,
work is planned on the following topics: reconstructing Godel's proof of the
independence of the axiom of choice; cutting down his backlog of unpublished
papers; learning more about neural nets and neurobiology; and learning more
about random graphs with hopes that it has applications to complexity theory.
