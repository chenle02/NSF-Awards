Proposal Number: 0331343 Title: Software Engineering Pioneers Symposium: On
Doing Work of Lasting Value PI: Stuart R. Faulk

The Pioneers Symposium will explore the question "What does it take to do
Software Engineering research of enduring value?" Of the many works published in
Software Engineering over the past 25 years, relatively few of them remain
important today. Those few works that continue to be worth reading have met the
test of time, demonstrating lasting value to both researchers and practitioners
in the field.

The Pioneers' Symposium will provide a forum in which Software Engineering's
next generation has the opportunity to learn from some of the field's preeminent
contributors what it takes to recognize and to do work that exhibits this kind
of lasting value. The Symposium is primarily targeted to graduate students and
new faculty beginning their research or careers. Funding under this proposal
will be used to support attendance by students and faculty who, for economic
reasons, might otherwise not be able to attend.
