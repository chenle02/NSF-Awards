0313742&lt;br/&gt;Deering&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year award to University of Delaware
provides support for technical services during NSF-funded programs on R/V Cape
Henlopen, a 120' general purpose research vessel operated as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. University
of Delaware will provide one or two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V
Cape Henlopen to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate
and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research
instrumentation. In addition to these basic support functions, the technical
support group will maintain and provide multibeam sonar and undulating vehicle
systems to qualified users requiring those services in support of their funded
research programs on R/V Cape Henlopen or other UNOLS vessels, as schedules
allow. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
