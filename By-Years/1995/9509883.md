The focus of this research is the dearomatization of aromatics by use of
n2-arene complexes of osmium(II). The osmium(II) activates the aromatic system
to electrophilic addition and provides a powerful new synthetic approach to
dearomatization and the use of aromatic systems for the preparation of
polycyclic organic compounds.With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. W. Dean Harman of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Virginia. Professor Harman will focus his work on
determining the role of transition metals, specifically osmium(II) complexes of
arenes, as dearomatizing agents for organic synthesis.
