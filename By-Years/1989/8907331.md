The goal of this research is to use both a biochemical and genetic approach to
study how bacteriophage QB synthesized RNA and stores the information that
promotes its own transmission and multiplication. Using a cloned cDNA of the QB
replicase cistron, experimental systems have been developed that uncouple
replicase function from replicase synthesis. Using these systems, site- directed
linker insertion mutations have been put in the replicase coding sequences and
then these were assayed for the effect of each mutation on replicase activity
and also QB genome function. Previous results have enabled the separation of the
RNA sequences that code for activity replicase from the sequences that are
required for template recognition, chain elongation, and translational
regulation. More recently phylogenetic sequence comparisons between two
different bacteriophage RNAs have located several conserved regions of RNA and
amino acid sequence that may have functional significance. These sites will be
targeted for site-directed mutation and delection analysis. The mutant
replicases and genomic viral RNAs that carry the different alterations will be
studied both in vivo and in vitro to determine the effect(s) of each change.
This library of mutants will provide important information about the different
functional domains of the replicase genes coding sequences as well as the active
sites contained within. Why study an RNA virus Replicase? Since RNA viruses are
one of the few self-reproducing units that use a genetic material other than
DNA, the survival problems faced by these genomes have few parallels elsewhere
in biology. They infect representatives from all known life forms including
prokaryotes, fungi, animals, and plants; and because of the high error rate
exhibited by their polymerases during multiple cycles of replication, RNA
genomes can diverge rapidly.
