This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project, co-funded by the
Atmospheric Chemistry Program and the Environmental Chemical Science Program, is
focused on laboratory experiments to measure important physical and chemical
properties of selected chemical species that mimic the behavior of small
particles and aerosol found in atmosphere. These properties are important for
modeling cloud and ice formation and are needed for improving weather and
climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurements are being made of the
temperature dependent solubilities and glass transition temperatures as a
function of concentration for aqueous organic acid/metals/ammonium sulfate
solutions that contain solutes relevant for understanding the behavior of upper
tropospheric aerosols. Properties of glassy organic acid salts and their
mixtures with ammonium sulfate are of special interest because recent research
suggests that glassy organic aerosol particles are effective at forming ice
nuclei. The results of this effort will be used in climate models to make better
predictions of how clouds and ice in the atmosphere influence climate.
