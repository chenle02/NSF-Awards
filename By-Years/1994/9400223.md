9400223 Bank The objective of the project is to continuously monitor and
evaluate the performance of a demonstration project to be constructed in the
District of Columbia. The demonstration project will utilize state-of-the-art
advanced composite material reinforcements in the form of fiber-reinforced
plastic (FRP) gratings to reinforce a full-scale highway bridge deck. It is the
first full-size demonstration project of this type to be conducted in the United
States. This award will support the necessary data acquisition equipment and
student support to monitor the long-term deformation and durability of the
demonstration project. ***
