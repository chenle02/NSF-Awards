Simplicity: Ideals of Practice in Mathematics and the Arts

The conference will take place April 3 - April 5, 2013, at the Graduate Center
of The City University of New York. Each day of the conference will feature
talks and roundtable discussions interspersed with arts program events.

The recommendation to "find a criterion of simplicity in mathematics," Hilbert's
recently discovered 24th question on his renowned list of open problems given at
the meeting of the International Congress of Mathematics in Paris in 1900,
places the aesthetic of simplicity at the heart of mathematical practice. At the
same time, simplicity and economy of means are powerful impulses in the creation
of artworks. Recognizing the aesthetic nature of Hilbert's question, this
conference aims to focus on criteria of simplicity in mathematics that are
informed by perspectives from the arts, the philosophy and history of
mathematics, and, most of all, current mathematical practice. The conference
will focus on the questions: Is simplicity in mathematics truth conducive? How
did simplicity come to represent such an important ideal in mathematical
practice? Is there such a thing as the simplest proof of a theorem, and is this
always its best proof?
