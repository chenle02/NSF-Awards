This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of organic electrochemistry. The thrust of this research program is
to find how conformational change and isomerization affect or are affected by
electron transfer reactions. The studies will focus upon organic and
organometallic molecules for which conformational change and/or isomerization
reactions are expected to be important. The project will also assess the
importance of structural and environmental factors in governing the energetics
and kinetics of electron transfer reactions, both at the electrode surface and
in solution. Some of the research effort will be directed to the improvement of
measurement techniques and the development of new methods. The results of these
investigations will aid in understanding biological electron transfer processes
and electrochemical energy storage and conversion.
