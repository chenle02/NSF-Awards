This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to discuss
recent progress in the study of Quantum Turbulence and to explore future
directions. The development of new imaging techniques, such as the use of tracer
particles or metastable He, coupled with more powerful visualization techniques
has lead to much recent progress. Accompanying this, the development of more
powerful computational resources have lead to comparable advances in modeling.
This workshop will allow researchers in both quantum and classical turbulence to
share ideas and explore new research directions. A significant fraction of the
attendees will be young researchers (graduate students, postdocs and new
faculty) and the workshop will provide an opportunity for them to interact with
more seasoned researchers.
