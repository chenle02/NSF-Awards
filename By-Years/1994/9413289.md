Abstract ATM-9413289 Raymond, David J. Blyth, Alan M. New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology Title: Thermodynamic and Microphysical Characterization of
Moist Convection in TOGA COARE The award aims at characterizing the
thermodynamics of convection over the western Pacific warm pol. The incloud
thermodynamic data collected by aircraft NCAR Electra and NOAA P3, will be
utilized to calculate accurately the parcel buoyancies, temperatures, and
condensed water content. An attempt will be made to systematically relate this
information to the subcloud layer characteristics. This type of analysis is
important for cumulus parameterization in climate models.
