This research addresses the concept of using multi-stable equilibria (MSE)
devices as a type of adaptive system. MSE systems are those that have more than
one configuration at which their potential energy is at a minimum such that no
power is required to maintain the equilibrium position. As opposed to adaptive
structures that use active materials such as piezoelectrics and shape memory
alloys, the adaptive states of MSE systems are passive and need only actuation
to move among the stable states. Because of this focus on passive and
nondissipative aspects of energetic systems, the impact of MSE systems is in
improving system performance in terms of operating range, accuracy, reliability,
and energy efficiency.&lt;br/&gt; The approach of the research is to synthesize
MSE systems for specific engineering tasks such as designing devices to have
specific stable geometrical configurations and/or natural frequencies at each
equilibrium position. Although some analysis has been done on a few bistable
structures, the significance of this research is in providing insight into the
MSE design process by creating a synthetic, rather than analytic, approach to a
more general class of systems. Some areas of application for MSE devices are
those in which single operating points limit system efficiency, actuator
characteristics inhibit a large range of adaptability, and where the
minimization of dissipative effects are important.&lt;br/&gt; Fully compliant
structures when combined with magnetic actuation lead to smooth nonlinear
systems, which are amenable to accurate modeling. They also possess ultra-high
precision and repeatability, and long system life due to wear-free operation.
Such systems also have several advantages when scaled down to the micro-systems
domain. The results of the proposed research should have broad impact on design
and analysis of multi-state precision mechanical systems, adaptive transducers,
passive human augmentation systems, and adaptive structures. &lt;br/&gt;
