9314913 Steimle This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Timothy Steimle, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry,
Arizona State University, and Professor Shuji Saito, Institute for Molecular
Science, Okazaki National Research Institutes, Okazaki, Japan. In addition, two
graduate students from Arizona State University and several scientists from
Tokyo University and Shizuoka University will participate in the project. This
collaborative effort is motivated by both practical and fundamental scientific
interests. Transient metal containing compounds are important elements in
processes such as rf- induced chemical etching and chemical vapor deposition.
The proposed millimeter wave and optical spectroscopic detection schemes will be
sensitive, non-invasive means of monitoring and controlling the chemistry of
such systems. In addition, there are many fundamental scientific problems
associated with metal containing radicals, not the least of which is their
electronic and structural characterization (i.e. bond lengths and angles,
electronic state distribution, m.o. description, etc.) The U.S. and Japanese
teams have complementary theoretical and experimental expertise. The scientists
at Okazaki have diode laser spectroscopic capabilities; the Tokyo University
scientists have Fourier transform microwave capabilities, and the Shizuoka
University group has millimeter wave capabilities. Cw-dye laser optical
spectroscopy and pump/probe microwave optical double resonances of molecular
beam samples will be performed at Arizona State University. ***
