9355857 Lewis The proposal reflects a rich conceptual underpinning that suits
the embedded cases study approach to be used. The goals and justification of the
study are well conceived and should yield a contextually rich substantive and
well-interpreted report. The research design is creative and has important
implications for several audiences in the United States. The project's design
will make it possible to sample a broad range of interventions such as notional
schools and their role in teacher development, teacher study groups, research
networks, etc.
