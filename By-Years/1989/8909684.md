The evidence documenting the course of human change over past time is primarily
a collection of unique hominid fossils. Their uniqueness precludes replacement
in case of damage or loss. Fossils should also be available for study to
qualified investigators, but most museums justifiably will not allow unique
original specimens out of the museum. The solution to this problem is to make
available extremely accurate casts--a difficult problem given the minute details
of importance on most fossils. One researcher has spent many years perfecting
the process of making such casts and he is well known in the profession for
doing so. This project is to allow him to make casts of important human fossils
currently housed in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Germany, that are currently
not available for study in this country. The molds of these important specimens
will be used to produce highly accurate positive replicas that will be
incorporated into the University Museum repository of more than 2200 fossil
hominid and primate reproductions. There, they are available to investigators
for study or for loan. Their inclusion in this collection significantly enhances
its value to the scientific community.
