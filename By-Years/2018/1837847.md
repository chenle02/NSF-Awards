Creating a robust system for public access to research data and findings
requires the active engagement of researchers and their institutions, research
sponsors, community data repositories, disciplinary societies, and others.
Building on a widely recognized AAU/APLU Public Access Working Group report,
this workshop will convene 20-30 teams of university leaders and researchers to
learn about current data sharing practices and emerging tools, evaluate options
for supporting and promoting public access to research data on their campuses,
and begin cross-institutional discussions to create an interoperable system that
accelerates progress in supporting public access to research
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
