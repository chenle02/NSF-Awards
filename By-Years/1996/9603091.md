*** 9603091 Stahl This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
cellular biology involves Phillip Stahl at Washington University and Michel
Vidal at the University of Montpellier II. The award provides travel support and
living expenses to Dr. Stahl and a postdoctoral researcher. The objective of the
research is to investigate the mechanism by which rab5, a low molecular weight
GTPase (enzyme) regulates endocytosis and phagocytosis. These are processes by
which cells bind and internalize nutrients, biologically active peptides and
toxins, substances and particles. The U.S. investigators bring to this
collaboration expertise in in vitro endosome and phagosome fusion. This is
complemented by the French investigator's experience with exotoxins. ***
