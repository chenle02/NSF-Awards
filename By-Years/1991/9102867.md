Probability models can be used to distinguish naturally occurring clusters of
observations even when these observations are intermixed and unlabelled.
Established theory draws on mixture models, modal models, and, for evolutionary
classification, generalized Markov models. This research introduces and
investigates a new class of probability models: product partition models. These
will have wide application in determining classifications and in predicting
based on partial or complete classifications. Applications for these
classification algorithms include the construction of evolutionary trees,
recognition of change-points for modelled processes, image reconstruction, and
failure prediction for complex cases like the space shuttle.
