The National Research Council's Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public
Policy (COSEPUP) proposal describes a study of the process by which NSF reviews
research proposals, particulary with reference to large projects. This study
responds to a directive in the Congressional conference report accompanying the
NSF appropriation for fiscal year 1991 for such a study. COSEPUP, which has for
30 years served as a source of high level advice to science advisors and other
senior government officials, has the broad experience required to undertake a
study of the criteria and procedures used by NSF in reviewing and awarding major
grants. The study will be conducted over a period of 15 months under the
direction of a panel of experts and result in a report that assesses the current
system and makes recommendations for improvements, as appropriate.
