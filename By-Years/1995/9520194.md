This dissertation research will examine a novel legislative strategy for
environmental policy. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, federal
legislation mandated two Citizen Advisory Councils (CACs) to help prevent
accidental releases of oil into Alaskan waters by providing a citizen oversight
and advisory function. Soon thereafter state legislation in Maine and California
mandated two more advisory councils with similar functions. These four CACs are
a novel collaborative effort between citizens, government, and industry to help
prevent coastal oil spills and pollution. The objective of the proposed research
is to evaluate the effectiveness of the advisory councils in achieving these
preventive goals and to identify the factors which contribute to their
successful operation. The research methods consist of structured interviews with
selected CAC participants (citizen members, industry representatives, and public
officials), a mail survey administered to all the CAC participants, and analysis
of relevant documents. This research project is intended to provide a much-
needed empirical contribution to the study of CACs that work with government and
industry in the area of environmental risk management.
