The objectives of this project (SISMAT) are to combine research, training, and
outreach to help further the understanding of the complex information security
problems and to nurture the expertise and talent of students capable of
confronting these challenges. The team proposes to create a structured, in-
depth, and hands-on course material in real-world information security problems
like penetration testing and real-time intrusion analysis, defense, and
recovery.

The project plans to eliminate a gap between the types of active learning
environments needed to help undergraduates understand complex attacks and the
static trace captures used in current labs. The team plans to investigate the
network, systems, and management aspects of a standard for describing and
encoding high-interaction hands-on information security training scenarios, and
of a simulated network environment capable of supporting simulations of complex
enterprise-class networks.

SISMAT contains a comprehensive outreach program. It creates a repository of
projects undertaken by SISMAT participants that is freely shared with the
public. It also directly engages security researchers and industry experts as
faculty mentors. Project personnel and student participants help forming a
community of academics, professionals, and practitioners by supporting
conferences like Annual Conference on Education in Information Security.
