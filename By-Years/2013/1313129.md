This program will study particle energization and radiation in relativistic jets
and accretion flows. It will apply particle-in-cell (PIC) kinematic simulations
to astrophysics, in particular to the shear flow boundary layer in gamma ray
bursts and quasar jets, and to the magneto-rotational instabilities in low-
luminosity active galactic nuclei. The goal is to enhance magneto-hydrodynamic
computer codes to include `subgrid physics'.

Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate
students, and development of advanced simulation methods that will be useful
across many disciplines, from astrophysics to laser plasma interactions and
fusion. High school students will be mentored during the summer.
