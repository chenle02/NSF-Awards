SoundVision Productions is developing and distributing a series of ten, hour-
long public radio documentaries that will explore the turbulent boundary between
science and the humanities, capturing the present moment of tremendous
scientific and scholarly ferment with the unique and intimate power of radio. By
introducing the radio audience to the thoughts and voices of some of the world's
most accomplished scientists, in conversations with the counterparts in the
humanities, the series will look at recent developments in science including
physics, molecular and cell biology, environmental science, cognitive psychology
and neuroscience, and the multiple disciplines of the life sciences reflecting
the increasingly subtle and widespread application of evolutionary theory. In
each program, a careful account of new scientific ideas and discoveries will be
placed within the context of historical and contemporary thought about the human
and natural worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barinetta Scott, the Executive
Producer, has most recently been the Executive Producer for the highly regarded
NSF funded NPR series, "The DNA Files." In developing this project, she will
