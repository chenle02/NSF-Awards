Measurements will be undertaken of absolute electron and ion impact cross
sections of technologically important gases, with the aim of developing the
comprehensive data bases needed for modeling processes. Such data bases are
important in laser technology, radiation physics and chemistry, and
astrophysics, but the primary emphasis here will be on the data bases needed for
modeling low temperature plasmas such as are used in surface processing.
