This project of the State University of New York at Oswego is entitled, "Kids
at Work: School Science and Mathematics in the Workplace." The program involves
a partnership involving the Oswego County Schools, SUNY Oswego, and several
local businesses. This program builds on the base of Oswego's Project SMART
(Science/Mathematics Resources for Teaching), which has implemented portions of
a staff development program and has established a resource center. As part of
the teacher enhancement activities, the "Kids at Work" industrial field
excursions were developed. Local businesses host field trips for children from
neighboring elementary schools. Teachers, college staff, and private sector
partners work together to develop classroom activities for the children to do
before and after the excursions; these activities are based upon exemplary
materials developed through NSF-supported curriculum projects. The project will
be extended into the Syracuse area in its second year.
