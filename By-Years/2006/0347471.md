Professor Dennis Evans and his research group will investigate two-electron
transfer reactions focusing on phenomena associated with the second electron
transfer step. Reactions that involve concerted electron and proton transfer
(CEPT) will be of special interest. Requirements for the CEPT mechanism
including kinetic barriers and the acid-base properties of reactants and
products will be investigated. Dioxygen reduction, which has great relevance to
life processes and technological importance through its role in corrosion and
fuel cell function, will be among the systems selected for detailed study.
Reactions that involve potential inversion, the phenomenon where the insertion
or removal of the second electron in a two electron process occurs more easily
than does removal of the first electron, will also be studied as part of the
major thrust of the project. Related applied work involving electrochemical
generation of bases for use as reagents in base-catalyzed synthetic reactions is
also being undertaken. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop
fundamental understanding of multi-electron-transfer reactions. Modern
electrochemical methodology will be employed. Outcomes will be highly relevant
to a wide range of areas. Processes that affect biological systems, energy
production, and synthesis of high value chemicals are a few examples.
