The University of Miami requests funding for additional and back-up
instrumentation on the R/V Walton Smith, a 96 foot, general purpose regional
vessel operated by the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V WALTON
SMITH conducts a substantial portion of her operations in the near shore waters
of South Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, providing scientific information
relevant to major environmental initiatives. The operations include oil spill
monitoring, water management changes, municipal waste disposal, and storm water
discharge among others which are deemed critical to the sustainable development
of the South Florida and Gulf economy. In 2013, R/V Walton Smith completed 115
days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 19% of the total sailing schedule
(22 days). In 2014, R/V Walton Smith is scheduled for 102 days with NSF days
(20) accounting for 20% of the total sailing
schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this
proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; 1) 600 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
$39,912 &lt;br/&gt; 2) Niskin Bottles $13,116 &lt;br/&gt; 3) Upgrade of 75 kHz
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler $47,150 &lt;br/&gt; Total $100,178
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present
proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF
13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and
its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
