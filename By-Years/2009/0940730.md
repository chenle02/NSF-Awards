The research objective of this EAGER award is to develop an intelligent
optimization search strategy to design the configuration of alternative energy
infrastructure such as wind farms and solar farms. The goal is to determine
where generators should be located in an environment and what attributes should
be associated with each generator, while readily allowing for the inclusion of
developing generator and electricity grid technologies. This exploratory
research differs from current approaches that are based off of a regular pattern
or lattice that also use fixed generator configurations. There is opportunity to
significantly improve energy farm design by identifying new patterns of
generator locations based on search strategies that combine continuous global
and local approaches to configuration. In addition to location, more attributes
of each generator (e.g., the type and capability of a wind turbine or the size
and capacity of a solar panel) can be considered and varied to further improve
overall performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, deliverables will
include a software system that takes as input thorough and realistic information
about the environment (terrain, wind speeds and directions, etc.) and outputs a
layout of generators that most effectively and efficiently produce energy. This
exploratory grant will provide the basis to investigate novel approaches for
placement and design of alternative energy generators, and effective ways to use
such a software system. The work will contribute to the fields of energy
generation design, optimization, and design methods.&lt;br/&gt;
