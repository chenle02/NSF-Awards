As internetworked computing becomes pervasive, common services will be accessed
by a large number of widely distributed clients. Thus, scalable implementations
of such services must deal with (1) large number of clients, and (2) high
latencies that will be common among widely distributed nodes. One approach for
reducing server load and communication costs is to create multiple instances of
a service close to client groups that frequently access it. Also, when possible,
resource rich clients can cache service state to avoid communication latency for
common accesses. Service state replication and caching both lead to multiple
copies of the service state and lead to the problem of consistency maintenance
across copies when service state can be updated (e.g., to support interactions
across clients). The focus of this project is on the characterizations of
consistency levels that are appropriate in large scale systems with diverse sets
of applications. In addition, scalable protocols will be developed to provide
both read and write access to service state without requiring communication with
all nodes that may have copies of the service state. A distributed object based
middleware will be implemented to support scalable service and it will employ
object caching and replication to enhance service access performance and
scalability. This middleware will be used in the development and evaluation of
services targeted to the home that are reached via a variety of communication
media such as POTS and cable networks.
