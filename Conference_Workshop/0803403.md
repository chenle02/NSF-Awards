The investigators and their colleagues propose to organize an International
Conference on Modeling and Simulation, which will be held from July 9-12, 2008
in Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China. In the last two
decades, the rapid development of computer power and sophisticated computational
methodology has permitted the application of high performance computing to
simulation and modeling of unprecedented accuracy and scope applied to a wide
range of important problems. These applications have had profound implications
and applications in mathematics, science, engineering and industry. Scientific
computing is in fact the only feasible tool for analyzing many different types
of critical important phenomena such as flow and transport, weather prediction,
wave propagation, novel material design, computational chemistry, genome
sequencing and analysis. The proposed conference will bring prominent
researchers from U.S. and Europe working in these active areas to Asia, as to
enhance and facilitate contacts and dialogs between specialists of different
fields dealing with modeling and simulation so that new concepts can be
discovered and new methodologies can express their power.

In the past quarter of a century, along with rapid economical developments and
advancements in the Far East Asian countries, particularly the phenomenal growth
in China, there has been ever increasing collaborations between U.S.- and Asia-
based (also between Europe- and Asia-based) researchers in all fields of
scientific research. Such a phenomenon and trend is clearly exemplified by what
has taken place in mathematical sciences latterly (thanks to the effort and
initiatives of the NSF). These cross-continental research collaborations have
already made a large impact on many fields of scientific research, most
noticeably, on the human genome sequencing project in biological sciences and on
the proof of the Poincare Conjecture in mathematical sciences. The proposed
conference will be a contribution to promoting, enhancing, and stimulating such
cross-continental research interactions and collaborations in mathematical
sciences, more specifically, in applied and computational mathematics,
