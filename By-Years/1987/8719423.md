Antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics) used to treat human psychiatric patients have
long been known to suppress rewarded behaviours in laboratory animals.
Controversy exists, however, over whether these behavioural disruptions result
from reductions in pleasure/reward ("limbic system" effects), or from an
interruption of the brain's control of movement ("extrapyramidal" effects). In
previous work, Dr. Ettenberg has developed laboratory tests which clearly
distinguish between the reward-attenuating and performance- debilitating actions
of these drugs. His results suggest that neuroleptics can attenuate the
rewarding properties of a number of positive reinforcers, such as the taste of
sugar. Dr. Ettenberg will conduct experiments to extend these results, testing
the generality with which neuroleptics attenuate the rewarding effects of
several different positive reinforcing rewards, and also, to identify those
critical brain regions responsible for the drugs' actions. This work will
provide scientifically relevant information about the mood-altering or pleasure-
diminishing consequences of antipsychotic drugs, and also help in the
identification of brain mechanisms responsible for positive affective states.
