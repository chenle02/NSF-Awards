In nature, social insects have shown how mobility and multiplicity can be
dramatically exploited: small ants effectively forage large areas, while tiny
termites construct structures a million times their own size. Yet engineering a
robotic swarm of similar complexity remains a significant challenge; we lack a
fundamental understanding of how to effectively implement and leverage swarm
behaviors. In this research we will design and implement a programmable
microrobot swarm capable of robust collective intelligence in complex
environments. Our project will focus on mobility and multiplicity: we seek to
understand how scaling the agent size down and the swarm size up impacts the
ability of collective networked systems. Our proposed work has two key threads:
1) the development of highly mobile insect-scale microrobots with biologically-
derived locomotion principles and 2) the design and mathematical analysis of
robust decentralized control paradigms which are broadly applicable to many
self-organizing complex networks. To validate our approach, we will integrate
the mechanical study of mobility and the algorithmic study of collectives
through a set of annual demonstrations of microrobot swarms, which will enable
continuous feedback between theory and engineering.
