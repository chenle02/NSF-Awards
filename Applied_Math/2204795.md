This project aims to study mathematical techniques for machine learning methods
to enhance data privacy and fairness. The project will focus on mean field
control, introduced originally for physical sciences, and adapted to social
sciences under the nomenclature of mean field games. Stochastic control theory
and its enhancement, mean field control theory, also allow the systematic
incorporation of noise and uncertainty while simultaneously providing
satisfactory performance. Mean field control theory is ideally suited for
studying deep neural networks of machine learning because it is designed to
handle large numbers of agents, neurons, or complex data. In addition, the
machine learning rules provided by it are expected to be easier to implement and
interpret than would be the case with other methods. The project will provide
new applications of machine learning and data science to situations wherein
classical machine learning would be prohibitively expensive to apply. The main
tool of the project naturally lends itself to study the impact of adversaries
and is thus well suited to ensuring privacy. The project will also provide
training opportunities to several Ph.D. students and the workforce in this area
by developing courses and educational materials.

This project aims to investigate mean field games and mean field control in the
context of supervised learning and deep learning. The project includes three
specific cases: first, the situation when the empirical distribution of data is
replaced with a joint probability between inputs and outputs; second, the
situation when a large number of layers of a deep network is replaced by an
infinite number of layers and neurons; third, federated learning with an
infinite number of agents. The project will develop novel methods of using the
Hilbert space control instead of the classical Wasserstein metric for
probability measures. This will allow handling the gradients more efficiently.
The investigators will analyze how a stochastic gradient algorithm is replaced
by a mean field control or a mean field game. Another direction of the project
will be to use control of partial differential equations instead of control of
ordinary differential equations when data contain a spatial element. Finally,
the project will analyze new algorithms to solve the mean field games and
related control problems.
