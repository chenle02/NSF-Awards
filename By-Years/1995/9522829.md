9522829 Man The objective of this project is to develop theories for the
separation of "texture induced" from "stress induced" anisotropy. The results
will be implemented in experiments that employ ultrasonic measurements and the
birefringence method. Two cases will be considered: (a) the initial deformations
of the crystallites are elastic, and (b) those deformations are elastic-
plastic. By using the language and methods of quantitative texture analysis, the
effect of texture on birefringence will be made explicit. In addition, a
parallel to the acoustoelastic theory of Man and Lu will be developed for
viscoelastic materials. ***
