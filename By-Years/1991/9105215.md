The primary purpose for this High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
system is an investigation of the stability of monoclonal antibody (MAb)
production by hybridomas and quadromas, the fusion product of two hybridomas,
during long-term continuous culture in suspension and immobilized systems. Using
an optimized HPLC process, the number and concentrations of antibodies for both
parent hybridomas, and the quadroma, will be monitored during long-term
continuous culture. Results will be integrated with concurrent flow cytometry
and metabolic studies in an effort to elucidate mechanisms for improving the
stability of MAb production by hybridomas and quadromas.
