Using the human estrogen receptor (ER) as a model system, the proposed CAREER
project focuses on three specific aims: (1) To develop a novel directed
evolution strategy - in vitro co-evolution to create novel ER ligand
specificity. (2) To engineer an orthogonal ligand-receptor pair based on the ER
ligand binding domain and a synthetic chemical using a combined directed
evolution and rational design approach and subsequently construct a genetic
switch. (3) To use various biochemical and biophysical methods including DNA
sequencing, transactivation assay, ligand binding affinity assay, molecular
modeling and molecular docking to characterize all the evolved ER mutants
resulting from the above two specific aims in an effort to uncover the molecular
bases for ER ligand specificity and the molecular evolution mechanisms of
nuclear receptors. Such studies will provide insights into the pharmacology of
the ER and assist in the development of estrogen pharmaceuticals for
applications such as menopausal hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer
treatment. The resulting findings will also be invaluable for the studies of
other types of nuclear receptors, most of which are linked to various diseases
and represent major drug targets. The proposed educational development plan
comprises two components: an on-campus research and education program in
biomolecular engineering, and a biotechnology outreach program.
