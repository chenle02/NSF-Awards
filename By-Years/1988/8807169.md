Fractal geometry is a mathematical treatment of the geometry of rough surfaces
that has been applied recently to describe a generic turbulent flame. The
proposers believe this method may provide a mechanism for a modeling
breakthrough for the 4-stroke homogeneous charge spark-ignition (SI) piston
engine application. Unlike the burning rate models used in previous quasi-
dimensional engine codes, the proposed model for the turbulent burning rate will
not require experimental calibration of adjustable modeling constants. The
sensitivity of the model predictions to various modeling parameters, such as the
fractal dimension and the scale of the large eddies, will be investigated. The
model predictions will be tested against available experimental data. The
availability of a fractal based turbulent diffusion model would enable designers
to predict combustion phenomena with a model both simpler and more generic than
the current ones. The current need for guessing and experimental checking would
be largely eliminated, and computer performance could be dedicated to other
aspects of engine combustion (e.g. geometrical aspects) not currently manageable
with the existing unwieldy turbulence models.
