Harvey Mudd College is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The Program will support 10 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost
half will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will include
the following: o Activation and Reactions of Small Molecules as Ligands in
Transition Metal Complexes o Studies of Reactive Intermediates o Thermodynamics
of Binary Liquid Crystalline Phases o Electrochemical Kinetics of Polymer Thin
Films
