Birch, willow, and other shrubs in the Arctic are increasing in response to
warming at the expense of grasses and sedges. This increased shrub cover may
enhance winter snow capture, increase winter soil temperatures, deepen summer
soil thawing, and increase the release of old carbon and nitrogen. The increased
flux of sugars from shrubs to shrub-associated symbiotic fungi (termed
mycorrhizal fungi) could stimulate decomposition of thawing organic matter and
release organic nitrogen for plant uptake previously locked up for millennia.
This mycorrhizally-mediated priming of decomposition may influence carbon
balances and nutrient availability for further shrub growth. To test this,
researchers will use long-running experiments in Arctic Alaska that are
examining plant responses to warming in different tundra types. Researchers will
use natural levels of carbon and nitrogen isotopes to track the incorporation of
new soil-derived organic nitrogen into shrubs and associated mycorrhizal fungi.
&lt;br/&gt; With the new methodologies developed, organic nitrogen use can be
assessed across ecosystems. Models derived from planned measurements can then
predict consequences of shrub expansion for ecosystem processes, such as soil
energy balances, permafrost melting, and the release and cycling of old soil
organic matter. Archived samples of fungi and plants from Alaska and across the
Arctic will expand the temporal and geographic relevance of the studies. The
project will provide education and research opportunities to undergraduate and
graduate students. Researchers will also work with local high school teachers to
use fungi as a tool to teach biology and to expand their work in outdoor
classrooms.
