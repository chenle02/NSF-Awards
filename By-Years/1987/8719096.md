This award is to support a three day workshop for review of research results
based on measurements of strong ground motion made by the SMART 1 array in
Taiwan. SMART 1, installed in northeast Taiwan, with joint support from NSF and
from Taiwan's National Science Council (NSC), is the first large digital array
of strong motion seismographs specially designed for engineering and
seismological studies of the generation and near-field properties of
earthquakes. The high quality, digital ground motion measurements recorded by
SMART 1 provide a useful resource for earthquake engineering research. Under
this award, eight U.S. scientists will travel to Taiwan to review research
results relevant to structural siting and geotechnical systems. Participation of
scientists from Taiwan will be funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan.
This workshop was approved at the 1987 annual joint staff meeting under the
cooperative science program between the American Institute in Taiwan and the
Coordination Council for North American Affairs.
