During their approach to the main sequence in the Hertzsprung- Russel diagram,
newly formed low mass stars pass through the T Tauri phase, which is
characterized by mass loss, extreme emission lines in their spectra, and rapid
variability. The Principal Investigators propose to continue with their
observational study of the so-called "naked" T Tauri stars, which distinguish
themselves from the classical T Tauri stars by not having any circumstellar
disks (hence, the term "naked") and by the emission of X-rays. They plan to get
information about the initial mass function of low mass stars, the rate of loss
of circumstellar material from newly formed stars, and the formation of
planetary systems.
