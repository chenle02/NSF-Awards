The Science Challenge Program of Columbus College is designed to expose
promising precollege science students (9-12 grades) to scientists in a variety
of disciplines and to join them in making observation provide opportunities for,
questioning, experimental design, sampling, management of data, analysis of
results, drawing inferences and presentation of findings. Using stream
ecosystems as an operational milieu, participants will take measurements, use
instrumentation, and topographic maps, exercise personal leadership, employ
personal computers as research tools, design studies, collect and process
samples, manage results, design tables and graphs, draw inferences, and report
findings. Three faculty will provide careful, individualized guidance throughout
the project. Ideas regarding scientific ethics and career opportunities in
science will be woven into the fabric of the 6-week program. Faculty, who
possess a record of effective work with female and minority students will make
an assertive effort to maximize participation by these populations which are
poorly represented in scientific professions.
