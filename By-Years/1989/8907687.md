This project will support a workshop on computer cataloguing at the November
1989 annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, to be held in
Austin, Texas. Computerization of vertebrate paleontological records has rapidly
increased in recent years, but there have been no broad-scale efforts to
coordinate the projects for the long-range purpose of exchanging information.
The workshop will address this problem and will also investigate priorities for
hardware and software implementation, development of ethics and standards,
standardization of data input formats, and logistics of networking. The ultimate
goal of the workshop is to develop an explicit set of guidelines and
recommendations for institutions initiating or maintaining computerized database
management of vertebrate paleontology specimens.
