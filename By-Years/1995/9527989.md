The long-term goals of this research are to reconstruct the changes in
vegetation, lake conditions, and climate that occurred over the past 20,000
years on islands of the eastern Caribbean. Sediment deposited in two volcanic
lakes on Dominca will be analyzed for physical characteristics, chemical
contents, and biological remains. The first phase of this project will test a
new method for detecting prehistoric hurricanes in lake sediment based on the
large amounts of debris from vegetation that is washed into the lakes. These
layers will be dated by lead-210 and compared with historical records of
hurricanes in the same area. It has been proposed that hurricane intensity and
frequency will increase in response to climate change that warms tropical sea
surface temperatures. An understanding of the nature, ranges, and timing of past
hurricanes and the responses of the plant communities to hurricanes will provide
a guide to responses that are possible in the future.
