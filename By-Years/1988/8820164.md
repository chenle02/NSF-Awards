The objective of the research supported under this award is to develop a simple
three-dimensional, nonlinear, numerical model of atmospheric fronts and use it
to study the process of frontogenesis, focusing on the evolution of a frontal
zone into a steady state front. The model incorporates both baroclinic
instability and viscous dissipation in the boundary layer and their interaction.
Using this model, the PI will predict the time required for the front to reach a
steady state, the modification of the basic flow, the secondary circulations
that maintain the frontal contrasts, and the scale of the front. The model
results will then be compared with observed frontal characteristics. The
development and evolution of atmospheric fronts is one of the challenging
problems in dynamic meteorology. The PI has examined a number of aspects of
frontal behavior over the last several years and his research has contributed
significantly to our understanding of them.
