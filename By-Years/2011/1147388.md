Heterogeneous multicores/Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) are envisioned to be a key
design paradigm to combat the challenges of power, memory, and reliability walls
that are impeding chip design using deep sub-micron technology. There are so
many dimensions to creating heterogeneous architectures, with the issues
spanning multiple devices, technology platforms and software stacks. Further,
despite the promise that heterogeneity offers, it is not clear (I) what are the
most salient forms of heterogeneity that will be really needed, and (ii) how do
all these forms interacting in non-intuitive ways at the entire system level.
These issues make this topic a high-risk high-reward proposition.
&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide preliminary results to gauge the potential
and feasibility of heterogeneous architectures, and develop strategies for
systematically evaluating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The semiconductor industry
is vital to the national security and economy of the United States. With all
major chip vendors projecting increased number of cores as the key to their
future road maps, innovations in chip multiprocessors is critical. Enabling
heterogeneous computing can largely reduce energy costs of computing, while
making it more powerful and dependable. Collaboration with industry partners
would facilitate &lt;br/&gt;direct transfer of many ideas to industry. The tools
and techniques &lt;br/&gt;developed in this research will be made publicly
available.
