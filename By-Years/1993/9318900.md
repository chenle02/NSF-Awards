9318900 James Dietz During its lifetime, an individual primate faces an array
of critical life history decisions, such as mate choice and timing of dispersal
and reproduction. The outcome of each of these decisions impacts directly on
survivorship and fecundity, and natural selection should favor those individuals
that make appropriate choices. Primate research has rarely been at the forefront
in evolutionary biological work, because of a) their longevity, b) their complex
social behavior, and c) their relatively low population numbers. This study, by
contrast, on the golden lion tamarins in Brazil, has developed a research system
that permits circumvention of these obstacles. The investigators have identified
the critical life history junctures for this species, and have documented a good
many rare variations. They believe that it is the exceptions to common patterns
that hold the key to understanding the factors that shaped the evolution of life
history traits. During the next three years, they will intensify the study of
variation in choice for several critical life history decisions, and test them
with strict hypothesis tests. The long term goal of the research is to construct
a model based on evolutionary and ecological theory that will allow us to
predict individual choice at these decision junctures.
