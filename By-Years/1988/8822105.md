This proposal is for travel subsidies for attendees at the "Third International
Conference on Separations Technology," sponsored by the Engineering Foundation.
The second conference on this topic was sponsored by the Engineering Foundation
in 1987. European workers are making progress in this important area of
technology at least as fast as are US workers; thus, by exposing the US to the
European work, the US community can benefit from it more quickly. Separations
technologies are critical to the commercialization of several emerging
engineering technologies, biotechnology being the most notable. Several European
countries have made significant research efforts in these areas, and are
somewhat ahead of the US community in the commercialization of large scale
bioseparations technology and in commercial supercritical extraction processes.
European workers have also made recent important innovations in distillation
technology and countercurrent absorption in packed bed. They are making major
efforts in advanced membrane technology as well. The US community should benefit
greatly from more extensive exposure to their work.
