This award supports research in algebraic geometry, a central area of
mathematics. The investigator will study certain geometric properties of spaces
that parameterize mathematical objects characterized by algebraic properties.
One such space parameterizes one-complex-dimensional sub-objects in an algebraic
space; the other space parameterizes fields on an algebraic space. These are
important constructions to study in mathematics, in part due to their
intrinsically beautiful structures and the applications of these structural
results to geometry, topology, and representation theories, and in part due to
the fact that these spaces are mathematical analogues of objects (fields,
strings) in theoretical physics. The completion of this project will improve our
understanding of mathematics and of theoretical physics in general. This
research project addresses the long-term goal of broadening mathematical
research by understanding new ideas from theoretical physics, and contributing
to the development of theoretical physics by providing the mathematical
foundations vital to its advancement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project will develop a new theory to study all genus Gromov-Witten invariants of
the quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds. This theory is a geometric realization of
that envisioned in superstring theories. It will provide new avenues to study
similar moduli spaces in algebraic geometry. The investigator will further
develop a theory to understand the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants of
Calabi-Yau threefolds through the angle of Kirwan desingularizations, and to
make an inroad to understand the recently constructed perverse sheaves on the
moduli of sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.
