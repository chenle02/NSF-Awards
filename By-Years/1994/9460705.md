The objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a Photogrammetric Laser
System (PLS) to significantly reduce the cost of rapidly measuring three-
dimensional surfaces for civil engineering purposes; to monitor potential
landslides, seismological measurements, and other ground failures; to rapidly
assess the results of disasters; and other similar surface measurement
applications. The reduction in costs is achieved through an integration of
Global Positioning System (GPS) devices with an approach of performing automated
stereoscopic measurements using conventional terrestrial photogrammetric
methods. The unique characteristic of this system is the use of a laser to
illuminate a small area on the surface being measured to form a target. The
laser is programmed to scan the surface in a variety of patterns, depending upon
the type and density of surface information desired. The position of the target
is automatically determined by the modified stereo cameras and recorded
simultaneously with a digital image of the scene. The PLS produces data that are
directly compatible with most three-dimensional data processing systems such as:
Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and others.
This system greatly increases the speed and accuracy of remotely measuring
surface data, reduces costs through automatic measurements, and does not deviate
from conventional photogrammetric processes.
