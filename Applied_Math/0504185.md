Inverse problem is interdisciplinary research field that is at the heart of many
scientific inquiry and engineering development. In inverse problems, one is
interested in determining quantitative information about a system from measured
data. This proposal focuses on a set of inverse problems that arise in
industrial applications. These problems not only offer mathematicians with
opportunities to make an impact in important technological development, but also
research directions that are certain to enrich mathematical sciences.

Four research areas to be investigated are (i) determination of core profile of
an fiber optic cable, (ii) nondestructive evaluation of spot-welds, (iii) bar
code imaging and interpretation, (iv) imaging the electrical activity of the
heart. The proposed work involves modeling and analysis of the problem. We will
also develop effective computational strategies that exploits a priori
information about the unknown and incorporates them in the solution strategy.
Because this research program is of interest to several of the companies with
which the PI has collaborated, it is anticipated that some technology transfer
will occur.
