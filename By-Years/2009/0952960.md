Advances in computing power over the past two decades have driven successive
generations of powerful supercomputers. Petascale systems have recently emerged
that contain tens of thousands of processors. At this scale, frequent component
and software faults cause parallel applications to fail often, forcing users to
save critical program data (checkpoint) repeatedly at an unsustainable scale and
pace, wasting resources and triggering additional faults. This has created a
crisis: recent experience with petascale systems reveal that increased
checkpoint frequency is inducing additional faults, and the excessive overhead
required for checkpointing on&lt;br/&gt;peta- and exascale systems is reaching
theoretical scaling limits. These problems represent a petascale reliability
barrier that prevents the effective use of these
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this problem, the investigator is
pursuing a research and education program to improve the reliability and
efficiency of high performance computing systems through a comprehensive
approach to fault detection, prediction, response, and recovery. The effort
involves work on four fronts: i) investigation of new methods for fault
detection and prediction; ii) creation of new algorithms, techniques, and tools
to avoid faults by proactively responding to potential faults, and to
efficiently recover from faults when they occur; iii) creation of a fault
injection framework and architecture testbed to assess and validate fault
prediction, detection, and proactive and reactive response mechanisms; and iv)
development of a education and training program to disseminate fault-aware
practices for systems administrators and application developers. The expected
results are: more reliable HPC systems and parallel applications; new fault
prediction, detection, and response algorithms, software libraries, and tools;
and the establishment of a cohort of students and researchers trained to use
fault prediction and response technologies.
