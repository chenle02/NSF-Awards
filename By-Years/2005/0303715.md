In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Marcus will do research on Fourier Correlation Imaging
Spectroscopy (FCIS) of polymers and super-cooled molecular liquids. The work
consists of four tasks: 1) to improve the sensitivity of the technique to detect
density fluctuations from molecular ensembles over time scales ranging from one
hundred thousandths of a second to 1000 seconds; 2) to develop a polarization
sensitive version of FCIS; 3) to combine FCIS with two-color and electronic
energy transfer (EET) measurements; and 4) to extend the FCIS technique to study
fluctuations of transition dipole relaxations on sub-nanosecond time scales.
These developments will be applied to several carefully selected molecules and
polymers to answer critical questions about the molecular shape, polymer
backbone flexibility, intermolecular cohesive forces, and other critical
problems of flexible polymers and super-cooled molecular liquids.

This is an interdisciplinary project that builds bridges between physical
chemistry, materials science, and biology. Graduate as well as undergraduate
students will participate in the research and will acquire skills and knowledge
of advanced, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical techniques.
