The researcher is an internationally known authority in the subject of Finite
Element Methods for Nonlinear Problems and is invited to present a paper and
actively participate in the discussions of the group on the broad aspects of the
topic at the International Workshop to be held at Trondheim, Norway, August
12-15, 1985. The proceedings will be published and distributed on a world basis.
Therefore, it is highly desirable that the United States be represented in the
proceedings. In addition to the formal presentation, the participant will
actively contribute to the more informal and informative sessions following the
presentations.
