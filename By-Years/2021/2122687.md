COVID-19 continues to pose a daunting challenge that requires effective use of
science to manage community response and recovery. The goals of this project are
to apply community engagement principles in a series of virtual workshops hosted
in partnership with local communities around Washington State that will respond
directly to local needs for scientific discourse about COVID-19. These workshops
will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and sharing of experiences in science-
informed decision making and help local scientists understand how to apply their
expertise to inform decisionmakers. The outcomes of this project will increase
the understanding of how to use local-level science-for-policy discourse to
address critical issues within and beyond the current pandemic management and
recovery across the state and the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
centers around a series of virtual workshops co-designed and co-created with
local decisionmakers, community leaders, and participating scientists in diverse
parts of Washington State. These workshops will be designed to cultivate cross-
sector and multidisciplinary dialogues with scientists and local communities
about key issues identified by community leaders related to the COVID-19
pandemic response and recovery. This project will advance knowledge in
participatory design and public engagement around science for policy. The
projectâ€™s co-design and engagement processes will create a replicable approach
for providing greater science-for-policy discourse and innovation at the state
and local levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
