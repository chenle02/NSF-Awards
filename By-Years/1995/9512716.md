*** 9512715 Johnson This grant supports research in particle physics by a
faculty member, a graduate student and an undergraduate student. They are
members of a team studying neutrino- nucleon interactions at the Fermilab
Tevatron accelerator. The goals sought are precision determination of basic
electroweak interaction parameters, tests of certain predictions of strong-
interaction quantum chromodynamics and extended information on the structure of
nucleons. ***
