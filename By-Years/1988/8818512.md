Bryozoans are a widespread and important group of colonial invertebrates. They
have a long evolutionary history and inhabit nearly all types of aquatic
environments. Graduate student Michael Temkin proposes a study of the
reproductive biology of roughly twenty species of bryozoans, in order to
establish their modes of fertilization and development. Temkin proposes to
establish whether fertilization and the activation of development are internal
or external to the coelomic cavity. The project will use flourescence microscopy
and a DNA-specific stain on representatives of 12 families from five suborders.
These results will improve our understanding of the evolutionary relationships
among different bryozoan groups, as well as the relationship of bryozoans to
other lophophorate phyla (phoronids and brachiopods). Little is currently known
of the reproductive biology of the bryozoans, and the proposed research will
take an important first step towards establishing the value of a new class of
data. The results of this project may open a new and valuable tool for
unravelling bryozoan evolution.
