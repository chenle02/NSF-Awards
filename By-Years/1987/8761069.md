Narrative: Research on a novel means of processing frozen aqueous based foods
and beverages, based on Advanced Energy Dynamics' state of the art experience in
dry electrostatic separation, is being conducted to concentrate orange juice and
a wide variety of other juices and foods. The process is based on the difference
in work function of ice crystals compared to glucose and other juice
constitutents. It represents a major advance in energy savings in the order of
one fifth the energy input to achieve results comparable to conventional
evaporative processes while at the same time retaining taste and other quality
features. In addition, the process has the potential of concentrating both
hazardous and nonhazardous aqueous wastes.
