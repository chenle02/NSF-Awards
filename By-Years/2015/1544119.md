This set of studies will examine the role of advanced, computer-based
simulations in managerial and policy-making decisions by comparing the work of
scientists, engineers, managers and policymakers in three different disciplines:
automotive engineering, atmospheric research, and urban planning. Research
suggests that if the outputs of computer simulations appear to have high visual
fidelity with the physical systems they represent, lay users are likely to
believe that simulations make accurate predictions. This project will examine
the use of simulation-based evidence by both technical and non-technical users
during the search, generation and persuasion phases of decisions. The project
will employ ethnographic methods to identify and assess representations and
understandings of simulation products, patterns in acceptance and use, and
associated changes in organizations' formal and informal influence structures.

The results from these studies will give managers and policy makers insight into
the consequences that new simulation technologies have for decision-making and,
by association, decision-related organizational structures. By improving our
understanding of how simulation models become persuasive communication devices,
the results of this study will also provide policymakers with the appropriate
questions to ask to determine the assumptions underlying simulation models and
will give them a more general understanding of when and how simulations can be
misleading or helpful.
