9401693 Duren This work will continue mathematical research on problems arising
in the theory of analytic functions and related questions involving harmonic
mappings. To a large degree, the effort continues several lines of research
which have opened new directions of investigation. Work will be done extending
recent results on zero-divisors for functions in Bergman spaces defined in a
disc. These are spaces of analytic functions whose norms are defined with
respect to area integration of their powers. The long-sought solution to the
zero divisor problem was obtained by Hedenmalm; it opens the door to
investigations into the classification of invariant subspaces analogous to the
classical result of Beurling for the Hardy spaces. Considerable work still
remains, almost nothing has been established about these spaces to date,
especially on the question of existence of extremal functions. Work will also be
done investigating plane harmonic mappings, i.e. mappings for which each
component is harmonic. Such mappings are directly related to solutions of
minimal surface problems. Questions of concern center on finding good estimates
for the Gaussian curvature of a nonparametric minimal surface above the disc in
terms of the so-called dilatation of a harmonic map and on determining the shape
of images of extremal harmonic maps. Classical function theory has introduced
geometric techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than
first imagined. The subject exploits the interplay between geometric
interpretation with powerful analytic techniques to yield some of the most
complete mathematical results in the field of analysis.In this project,
variational techniques and geometric reasoning are expected to lead to results
of valuable physical significance. ***
