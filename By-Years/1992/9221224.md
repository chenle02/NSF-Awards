This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Dearden at the University of Texas at Arlington. The study will investigate the
intrinsic molecular recognition properties of crown ethers and related ligands
for metal and molecular ions in the gas phase using ion cyclotron resonance and
tandem mass spectrometric techniques. The specific areas concern (a) the
identification of chemical systems which exhibit recognition effects, (b) the
measurement of host-guest affinities, and (c) the investigation of the rates and
mechanisms of gas phase recognition reactions. Subtopics that will be studied
are (a) the effects of varying the cavity size and the number and types of
ligand donor atoms, (b) intrinsic reactivity of naturally occurring ionophores,
and (c) chiral recognition in ion-molecule reactions. %%% The results from
Professor David D. Dearden's gas phase study on the interaction between crown
ethers and metal/molecular ions will complement data available on molecular
recognition in solution and will thereby enable the differentiation between
intrinsic and solvent effects. The study also addresses chiral recognition and
includes naturally-occurring, biologically-active ionophores (molecules
facilitating ion transport through membranes). The outcome of this research will
enable an identification and characterization of cage-type reagents which react
selectively on the basis of size and shape.
