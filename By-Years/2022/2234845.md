Bilinguals dynamically adapt their language use in response to social context.
Their perception of a conversation partner’s language knowledge, for example,
can influence their expectations for what language(s) are needed or appropriate
in an interaction. Theories of bilingual language control, which consider how
bilinguals engage and switch between their languages, postulate a role for
social information in these processes but have not determined what aspects are
relevant. Furthermore, where studies have considered the role of social context
on bilinguals’ language control mechanisms, they have traditionally utilized
measures that are not locally situated and, therefore, do not capture the ways
in which localized social meanings may impact bilingual language processing and
control. To better reflect how bilinguals communicate, however, theories of
bilingual language control must account for the social meanings that bilinguals
associate with the use of their languages within a local context.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through semi-structured interviews, social evaluation
tasks, and perception tasks with Mexican American, Spanish-English bilinguals,
this doctoral dissertation project will investigate how local social meanings
shape bilinguals’ expectations of what language(s) someone will speak and,
consequently, their perception of that person’s speech. This work contributes to
the understanding of how detailed, community-grounded social information is
engaged in bilingual language perception and control processes, expanding our
knowledge of what aspects of social context matter for bilinguals when
perceiving and producing language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
