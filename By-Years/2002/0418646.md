The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Center
(URC) planning grant. The PI is James R. Ford assisted by co-PIs Thomas A.
Newton and Caryn Prudente. The second semester first-year chemistry laboratory
course will be redesigned to focus on team-based participation in projects
derived from the local research community. A summer research internship program
will be created to provide students the opportunity to continue their initial
investigations. The organic chemistry laboratory will be expanded to include two
additional research-based projects. The partners in this pilot project include
faculty in Chemistry, Biology, Psychology, Environmental Science and Policy, the
School of Applied Science, Engineering, and Technology, and research scientists
from the Bioscience Research Institute of Southern Maine and from two
biotechnology companies and an environmental monitoring laboratory. The
partnerships will be strengthened through project planning and progress
meetings. Additional partners will be investigated. Evaluation of the
undergraduate research experience will consist of pre- and post-surveys to
assess skill development, knowledge of the project and worker characteristics.
