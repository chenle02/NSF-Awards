9509718 This proposal is to formulate an evaluation for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program. The project calls for
the design, structuring, and coordination of a new kind of evaluation - one in
which the evaluation staff, program officers, project staffs, and participating
classrooms work cooperatively to provide the kinds of information that can
support improvement of their activities and answer the questions of founders and
policy-makers. Surveys will be designed to seek the impact of GLOBE on attitudes
(toward science and the earth), skills, and knowledge of both students and
teachers. Questions are to address different grade levels, schools with
different kinds of network connections, in more- and less- industrialized
settings, in English-speaking and non-English speaking classes and to address
these issues in multi-part, on line student and teacher surveys. The evaluation
design has both formative and summative aspects and seeks to provide information
about a wide range of outcomes for students, teachers, and the scientific
community. The documentation and evaluation role is a working partnership with
the various GLOBE constituencies to support the activities of the program.
