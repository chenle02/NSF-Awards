A classical way to study 3-manifolds is to begin with an embedded surface in it
that satisfies some useful property. For example, Haken solved many important
problems by building hierarchies of incompressible surfaces that decompose large
classes of 3-manifolds into balls. Casson and Gordon introduced the idea of
strongly irreducible surfaces to study Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds. This
proposal concerns the further development and application of the PI's theory of
topologically minimal surfaces, which generalize both incompressible and
strongly irreducible surfaces. Such surfaces have been used by the PI to solve
several long standing conjectures, "Gordon's Conjecture" and the "Stabilization
Conjecture." The specific goals of this proposal are to: (1) Further explore the
relationships between topologically minimal, PL minimal, and geometrically
minimal surfaces; (2) Use topologically minimal surfaces to explore what happens
to the set of Heegaard surfaces under Dehn filling; and (3) Understand the
behavior of topologically minimal surfaces under finite coverings.

Just as the surface of the Earth seems like a plane to those confined to local
observations, a 3-manifold is an object that is locally indistinguishable from
3-dimensional Euclidean space, such as our universe. A classical way to study
3-manifolds is to utilize surfaces they contain that are non-trivial in some
suitable sense. "Topological minimality" is a very general notion of non-
triviality for such surfaces that was introduced by the PI to solve several
problems in topology. These surfaces are the analogue of more classical objects,
the so-called "geometrically minimal" surfaces. Familiar examples of such
surfaces include soap films. Conjecturally, topologically minimal surfaces have
all of the same properties as geometrically minimal surfaces. The goal of the
present work is to elucidate those properties that are shared by these two kinds
of surfaces.
