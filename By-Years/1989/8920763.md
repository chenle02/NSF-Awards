This proposal is entitled A Workshop in Statistical Education. The workshop
will be held on June 18-20 in the Iowa House in Iowa City, Iowa. The workshop
will address the following items: the basic statistics course; integration of
statistical methods in other courses; collections of projects and case studies;
reasonable balance among teaching, consulting, and research for faculty; and
long range efforts in attracting more students to science and mathematics
through statistical thinking. The work shop will produce a document consisting
of recommendations; this document will appear in the American Statistician, and
its existence will be mentioned in publications of the MAA and the NCTM. The
members of the workshop will be made-up of a large cross section of people from
academia, industry, and government interested in statistics education.
