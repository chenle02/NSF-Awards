This is a special project that proposes to organize and conduct a series of NSF
support activities at two successive ACM SIGCSE Symposia (1997 and 1998). This
annual gathering of Computer Science educators is the premier of its type in
that nation, and to which many aspiring awardees gather. This proposal is
directed at providing this group with an understanding of the programs and
processes of DUE within the Foundation, and to provide specific guidance on
successful proposal preparation. Prior activities in this area have been highly
successful resulting in higher quality proposals, and a larger quantity. It is
an excellent outreach to the Computing community.
