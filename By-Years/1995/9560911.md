9560911 Pirzada This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will investigate and develop fire suppression technology. The focus will be on
structures located in environments where water can be as damaging as the fire,
and typical chemical suppression systems is hazardous to occupant health or is
polluting to the environment Phase I will demonstrate the proof-of-concept. If
approved, Phase II will optimize and field test the novel technology, while
Phase III will commercialize the technology. The proposed innovation can lead to
fire suppression technology for structures where water and conventional
chernical suppressants are unsuitable. Furthermore, the proposed technology can
help reduce billions of dollars that is lost every year in fire and intangibles
associated with the property. The technology also has applications in growing
applications such as fire suppression for microelectronics products.
