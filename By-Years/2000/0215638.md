Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0215638&lt;br/&gt;W. Kendall Melville, University of
California San Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to carry out
experimental investigation of the dynamics of breaking
waves.&lt;br/&gt;Experiments will be carried out in wave channels at Scripps
Institution of Oceanography to achieve the following objectives. (1) Evaluation
of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget under breaking waves. (2)
Examination of the scaling of the total dissipation due to breaking as a
function of Reynolds and Bond numbers. And (3) study of the initial stages of
breaking and impact using high-speed video technique. The broader impacts of the
proposed research include applications of the results to the practice of coastal
and ocean engineering, naval architecture, and air-sea interactions, and
training of Ph.D. student. The PI will continue to support K-12 education by
hosting class visits to Scripps Institution of Oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;
