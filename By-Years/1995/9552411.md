This project provides the Computer Science Department with the funds to equip
laboratory rooms with modern computing equipment essential for carrying out
experiments and exercises in computer science. The Department has implemented an
innovative set of laboratory courses that span the undergraduate curriculum. The
cornerstone of this set of laboratory courses is a unique, breadth-first
sequence of four courses required of all majors, minors, and preservice teachers
of computer science, entitled CS I-IV. This sequence incorporateq all of the
traditional lower- division topics in advanced programming, data structures,
algorithms, and discrete math--along with a strong ethics component and
introductions to the major subject areas of computer science (artificial
intelligence, compilers, networks, operating systems, and so forth)--into a
seamless presentation. The laboratory sections accompanying CS I-IV allow
students to explore and experiment with these topics in weekly 2-hour meetings.
An innovative program animation system (DYNALAB) has been developed locally with
NSF funds in support of these labs; algorithm and concept animators from other
sources are also being incorporated. Students in upper-division undergraduate
laboratory courses use professional software and hardware tools for their
experiments.
