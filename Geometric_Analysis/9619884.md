Lian 9619884 This research is concerned with work on mirror symmetry and modular
functions. The principal investigator will work on extending known results for
toric hypersurfaces to the case of toric complete intersections. He will try to
construct all large radius limit points. He will also work on extending work on
modularity of the mirror map for K3 surfaces to arbitrary 1-parameter families
and to multiparameter families. Finally, he will study S-duality for K3-fibered
threefolds. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic
geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had
a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
