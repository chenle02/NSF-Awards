This project will design, implement and experiment with an operating system
that satisfies the requirements of emerging applications such as multimedia,
parallel computing, and distributed information retrieval. These performance
critical applications can be characterized by their intense use of
communication, and by their need for tight control of the machine's resources.
Existing operating systems often limit the performance of such applications,
thereby preventing users from reaping the power of high-performance computer
systems. As a result, lagging operating system technology threatens to delay the
acceptance of parallel computing, multimedia, and other services in the emerging
national information infrastructure. The major themes of the project are (1)
designing OS communications support that delivers performance close to that
provided by the network; (2) achieving OS performance that scales with the
underlying computer system's performance; and, (3) investigating open service
implementations that allow customization of OS services to match precisely an
application's requirements. The goal is to deliver the resources provided by
high-performance computer systems to applications, without sacrificing
functionality, fairness, safety, and portability. Methods include the re-
evaluation of current operating systems in light of changing application
requirements and hardware performance characteristics; design, implementation,
and experimentation with appropriate solutions; and, dissemination of results
through publication and distpibution of software artifacts. Education plans of
this CAREER project include the development of an interactive teaching style,
introduction of a hands-on course in parallel programming using networks of
workstations, and the organization of a summer program designed to expose junior
high students to computer and information technology.
