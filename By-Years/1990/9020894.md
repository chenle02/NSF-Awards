International cooperative research is very beneficial in the stimulation of
research program ideas as well as in the sharing of costs and research results.
In addition, duplication of research is avoided, saving time and money. A
meeting held in December 1989 in England, between representatives of the
Department of Technology and Industry in the United Kingdom and the National
Science Foundation indicated a strong interest on both sides to conduct
cooperative research projects in ocean engineering. Workshops conducted in
selected research areas would then lead to cooperative proposals in these ocean
engineering areas. The subject area for possible cooperation include, Autonomous
underwater vehicles and subsea robotics technology. It is proposed that a
workshop be held at Florida Atlantic University in the United States in the
Spring of 1990. The workshop will be four days long plus one or two days for
faculty visits. Invited papers on selected topics would be presented on the
first day of the workshop.
