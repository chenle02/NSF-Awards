The main thermocline in the region east of Barbados shows a quasi-permanent
vertical structure in the temperature and salinity profiles characterized by
well mixed layers about 50m thick separated by thin layers of 1 to 10m with very
strong gradients in these properties. This produces a staircase effect in the
vertical profiles with horizontal coherent scales on the order of several
hundred kilometers. Salt fingering and double diffusion are believed to be the
dominant mixing mechanisms in this region. Schmitt will analyze the data
collected in this region during the Caribbean Sheets and Layers Transects
(CSALT) program. Salt fingers have been identified with optical microstructure
instru- ments but certain details differ considerably from theoretical
predictions. Analytical and numerical models of microstructure, fine scale and
large scale properties will be used. This study will be a valuable contribution
towards our understanding of mixing in the ocean and formation of water masses.
