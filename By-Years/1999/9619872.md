9619872 ASKEW This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment
for the research vessel SEWARD JOHNSON operated by the Harbor Branch
Oceanographic Institution and dedicated to use in support of ocean science
research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for
ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Tim Askew, is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to overhaul a
radioisotope van, and acquire a new winch, two uninterruptable power supplies
and improve the SEWARD JOHNSON's habitability. ***
