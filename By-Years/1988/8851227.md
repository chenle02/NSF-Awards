This project enhances the curriculum of an electrical engineering technology
program by providing a laboratory environment for the study of analog circuits
using Computer Aided Engineering techniques. The laboratory equipment includes
Rapid Systems spectrum analyzer/digital storage oscilloscopes connected to
personal computers. These systems provide significant spectral analysis digital
sampling capability at low cost. Students using the lab are able for example, to
sample transients, save waveforms and later compare these to new waveforms. This
award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
