The geospace environment is complex. Changes in the solar wind affect the
magnetosphere, the outer layer of the atmosphere that consists of relativistic
particles influenced by the geomagnetic field. This in turn leads to changes
further down in the ionosphere. This solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system
is the crucial set of regions where space weather occurs. This work will model
the energetics of the geospace environment to understand important plasma
physics processes that lead to quantifiable effects of space weather.
Additionally, the project supports junior scientists (a graduate student and
post-doctoral researcher) in a diverse international collaboration, creates
animations of the geospace environment for public presentations, and develops
improved risk metrics for space weather processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work
will quantitatively assess the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere energetics
including effects of solar wind and magnetosheath fluctuations to resolve the
energy dissipation processes and paths under a variety of solar wind and
interplanetary magnetic field conditions. The Space Weather Modeling Framework
Geospace model, Geospace with local particle in cell code, and the Vlasiator
global Vlasov simulation codes will be used. Methods will be developed to
evaluate the energy flux through plasma boundaries, assess energy entry to and
exit from the magnetosphere, and energy dissipation in the ionosphere and
magnetosphere. The kinetic effects are assessed by model
comparisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
