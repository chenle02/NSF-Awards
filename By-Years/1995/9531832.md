9531832 Smithson This grant provides $55,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring computational equipment to be used for processing, analysis and
interpretation of seismic data in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at
the University of Wyoming. Specifically, the equipment to be purchased will
include a multiprocessor Silicon Graphics Power Challenge L Server with 34 GB of
hard drive space and PROMAX 3-D seismic processing software. This equipment will
be used by faculty and graduate students at Wyoming to conduct research
utilizing seismic refraction and reflection data for investigations including,
but not limited to, lithospheric structure and continental assemblages in SE
Alaska, 3-D crustal structure in West Antarctica, high resolution profiles of
the upper crust to study fluid migration and monitoring of underground nuclear
tests. ***
