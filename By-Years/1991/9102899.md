This project will conduct two ocean-bottom seismometer tomography experiments in
conjunction with an already funded two-ship mucti- channel seismic experiment on
the East Pacific Rise south of the Garrett fracture zone. The ocean-bottom
seismometer deployment in the first area will be used to constrain the cross-
axis structure including the axial low-velocity zone and the pattern of upper
crustal velocity variation. The second deployment will determine the continuity
of the axial low-velocity zone across the overlapping spreading center at 15.9
degrees south.
