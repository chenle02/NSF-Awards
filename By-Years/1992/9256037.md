This proposal seeks to provide a six week summer Young Scholars program in
engineering at the University of Maryland Systems Research Center. The
participants will include 20 top Maryland students entering the twelfth grade.
By providing a balanced exposure to class, laboratory, and field activities, the
goal is to introduce Young Scholars to a cross-disciplinary spectrum of
engineering and scientific fields. First-hand experiences in research will be
provided to encourage and stimulate students to pursue advanced education and to
discover the vast career opportunities in science and engineering.
