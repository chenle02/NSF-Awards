Brian White plans to investigate mean-curvature flow, particularly singularity
formation and the non-uniqueness known as "fattening''. He also plans to study
how minimal surfaces depend on the total curvature of their boundaries, to
investigate density bounds for singularities in minimal hypersurfaces, and to
search for new examples of helicoid-like minimal surfaces.

Brian White plans to investigate the behavior of surfaces that move by the
process called "mean curvature flow". In mathematics, mean curvature flow and
similar flows have proved to be very important: in particular, the closely
related "Ricci flow" has been very much in the news because of its central role
in the recent solution of the long-standing Poincare conjecture. Mean curvature
flow also arises in nature. For example, grain boundaries in annealing metals
move by the mean curvature flow. White will also investigate surfaces that are
in equilibrium for the mean curvature flow. In nature, soap films are examples
of such equilibria.
