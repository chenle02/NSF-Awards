Five highly versatile microcomputer-assisted laboratory stations being used in
nine different courses within three academic departments to modernize
undergraduate instruction in physiology. The instrumentation includes Apple II
GS microcomputers, Apple Imagewriter II printers, Harvard/SRI stimulators, and
six different physiological data acquisition systems for each station. Stations
thus equipped collect, display and print the data from a variety of
physiological experiments including those in spirometry, cardiography, muscle
contraction, reflex function, skin responses, and biofeedback. The use of these
microcomputer-aided instruments permits a wide range of laboratory activities at
approximately 60% of the cost of traditional recording devices. In addition,
relatively inexpensive programs can be added for simulations and autotutorials
dealing with such specific processes as intermediary metabolism, cardiovascular
fitness, nutrition and renal function. The completed stations providing the
students with a unique opportunity to further their understanding of the methods
of obtaining experimental data. It also allows them to develop skills involved
in the analysis and interpretation of such data. Finally, it exposes them to
wide variety of experiences at a reasonable cost.
