00439224&lt;br/&gt;Sah&lt;br/&gt;This investigation addresses an important
feature of cartilage lubrication, impacting not only our understanding of normal
tissue function but also other tissue-engineered approaches that should consider
this issue. The research is (1) to determine and compare the molecular basis for
lubrication properties of bovine fetal and calf articular cartilage, and (2) to
determine if mechanical loading modulates the content of adherent
Lubricin/Superficial Zone Protein (Lub/SZP) at the articular surface of fetal
and calf cartilage by affecting Lub/SZP synthesis, adhesion, or
loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the biological and engineering
mechanisms underlying the development of the low-friction surface of normal
articular cartilage through a combination of biological, molecular, and
biomechanical analyses. The experimental design is based on compelling
preliminary data from prior research supported by NSF award BES 9987353. The
educational component provides training to undergraduate and graduate students,
and, through outreach activities, to students in grades
7-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work activities will enhance an existing liaison
between academia (University of California San Diego) and industry (BREG, Inc.),
drawing on the resources of both partners. The project integrates research,
education, and industry in science, math, and engineering by directly engaging
undergraduate and graduate students as well as industry engineers in this GOALI
research project. The work plan provides a bridge of opportunity for early
transfer of knowledge and technologies between academia and industry in the
rapidly developing field of tissue engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
