The need for accurate and unforgeable identity recognition techniques has become
an issue of increasing urgency. Biometric approaches such as iris recognition
hold huge promise but still have significant limitations, including
susceptibility to 'spoofing'. This project seeks to advance our knowledge of
security and accuracy of multibiometric systems by inventing, evaluating, and
applying innovative methods and tools to combine highly accurate static traits,
such as iris patterns, with novel traits based on the dynamics of eye movements.
The strategy is to use existing iris recognition hardware to combine three
different biometrics approaches related to the eye: measurement of iris
patterns, unique characteristics of the eye globe and its muscles, and the
brain's strategies for guiding visual attention. This multimodal ocular
biometrics approach has the potential to improve liveness detection and
resistance to sophisticated counterfeiting techniques and coercion attacks,
while improving identification accuracy. This research tackles important
questions related to the individuality, variability, scalability, and longevity
of these ocular traits, building a foundation for security and accuracy
improvement when those traits are combined with iris recognition. This project
aims to benefit efforts such as the Unique Identification project in India,
which seeks to use biometric information of 1.2 billion individuals to fight
fraud.

Educational activities include three initiatives: 1) creation of a strong
outreach activity to K-12 students, 2) expansion of an interdisciplinary
research-oriented educational program previously created by the PI for
undergraduate and graduate students, and 3) mentoring and guidance to interest
undergraduate students in scientific careers and encourage more students from
diverse backgrounds to pursue graduate study.
