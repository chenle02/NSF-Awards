This award will fund work in game theory. The major goal is to develop
alternatives to the widely-used concept of Nash equilibrium. This concept and
its refinements are the basis for most applications of game theory, yet it is
still not clear what predictions to make in games with multiple Nash
equilibriua, nor just what equilibrium concept is appropriate in games whose
strategies correspond to contingent plans, as opposed to an uncontingent choice
of an action. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting point for this project is that
equilibria in games arise as the long-run outcome of a non-equilibrium dynamic
process of learning, imitation, or evolution. The project has two components. In
the first, the PI will model rational learning by patient, long-lived
individuals and will analyze what happens when these individuals interact with a
succession of anonymous opponents. The second part will fous on the role of
evolution or imitation as a dynamic process. Here individuals will imitate the
behavior of successful players (or animals genetically programmed to play a
successful strategy will have higher reproductive success). The major goal is to
determine what will happen in a large but finite population of these
individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine recent advances in
economics with work in mathematical biology. The results will be of interest to
scholars in many fields that use game theory, including political science,
sociology, computer science, and psychology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
made as part of the FY 2004 Human and Social Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;(HSD) portfolio,
following a competition that involved participation&lt;br/&gt;from all NSF
Directorates and Offices. HSD awards are administered&lt;br/&gt;through specific
programs that may change during the award period;&lt;br/&gt;management of all
HSD awards is coordinated on an NSF-wide basis.
