9404111 Mulase The research covers topics in the geometric theory of infinite
dimensional integrable systems with particular focus on the KP heirachy.
Techniques involve relating certain differential operators defined on Abelian
varities. Matrix integral methods and the geometry of the tau function will also
be studied. The research has potential applications to algebraic geometry and
mathematical physics, particularly to aspects of soliton theory. ***
