The focus of this research is the development of methods for the synthesis of
unsymmetrically substituted dihydroporphyrins in a regioselective and
stereoselective manner. The dihydroporphyrins (chlorins) will be constructed in
step-by-step fashion from linear tetrapyrroles. With this new award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dennis H. Burns of
the Department of Chemistry of Wichita State University. Professor Burns will
focus his work on developing synthetic methods for the preparations of the
chlorin class of natural products. These compounds serve as prosthetic groups
for proteins that perform a diverse set of biological functions
