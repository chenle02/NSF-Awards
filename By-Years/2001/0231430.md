0231430&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI, from New Mexico
State University, in a collaboration with Michael Thoss of the Department of
Theoretical Chemistry at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Through
the collaboration, the research will develop theoretical methods and
computational techniques for studying ultrafast Photo-induced electron transfer
reactions in condensed. Specifically, the project aims at development of a self-
consistent hybrid method to allow non-perturbative simulations of time-resolved
nonlinear spectroscopic signals for dynamical processes in the condensed phase.
The collaboration will also make detailed studies of electron transfer dynamics
in model systems as well as tests and improvements of commonly used
approximation methods and will compare theoretical results with experimental
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major focus of the work for the current grant
period is the integration of the complementary expertise of the German and US
PIs in developing the new methodology and applying it to transfer processes in
chemical, biological, and material systems. Novel applications of the new method
will be carried out to provide rigorous theoretical interpretations of results
of experimental femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;
