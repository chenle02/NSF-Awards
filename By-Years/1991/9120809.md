Students of architecture, in collaboration with engineering and other students,
at U.S. universities will be invited to enter two competitions, staged serially,
to develop conceptual designs for McMurdo Station, Antarctica, and for
comparative studies of the two extreme environments of Antarctica and space. The
competitions are educational--they are intended to develop capabilities in the
design and engineering of structures that support science and human existence in
extreme environments. The project follows on an earlier "Environment 1"
competition managed by AIAS to develop a conceptual design for a research
station at the geographic South Pole. That competition attracted 167 projects
from 71 schools.
