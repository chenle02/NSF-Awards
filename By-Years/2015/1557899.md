Plants respond to touch stimulation such as the wind, rain or the brushing by of
animals by switching on a series of responses that make them sturdier and more
resistant to damage. This research seeks to discover the genes that allow plants
to trigger these responses. Results from this research will help define how
plants defend themselves against environmental stresses with potential practical
applications in the breeding or engineering of more resistant crops. The work
will also involve the training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students
and undergraduate students in plant science. The program will help promote an
understanding of plant research to the general public thorough a series of
presentations and practical demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its key
role in determining their form and function, the molecular machinery underlying
plant mechanical sensing and response remains very poorly defined. In addition,
the mechanisms behind the known crosstalk between the mechanical and defense
response systems remains largely uncharacterized. Changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+
are known to be some of the earliest signals generated by both mechanical
stimuli and defense elicitors. This research program therefore seeks to define
the role of the Ca2+-responsive calmodulin and calmodulin-like gene families in
these processes. Bioinformatics will first be used to define the calmodulin and
calmodulin-like protein-related mechanical response network. Analysis of gene
expression, plant development, Ca2+ dynamics and pathogen sensitivity in mutants
in these network genes will then be made to test their functional roles in touch
and pathogen responses. These analyses will help to define the roles of these
network elements in: (1) mechanical signaling and, (2) the crosstalk between
mechanical and defense responses.
