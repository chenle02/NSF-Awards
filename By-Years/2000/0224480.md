Recent declines in oceanic fisheries have occurred despite extensive scientific
investigation of the impacts of commercial harvest on marine ecosystems. This
research utilizes interviews to investigate the impact of scientific research on
the normative ethics of fishers from declining, stable, and healthy or
recovering fisheries. The interview protocol allows fishers to determine their
own ethical priorities, and to report their concepts of right and wrong action
by utilizing their own language and rationale. The POWRE grant will fund visits
to maritime library collections and to the University of California for the
purpose of discussing sampling design and ethical and social sciences
professionals. The investigator will conduct a field test of new methodologies
for determining why fishers accept or reject scientific findings and for
evaluating the influence of increasing legislative and external, professional
control of fisheries on the communal ethos of the fishers.

This research is significant for the future of environmental ethics and of
social science inquiry into environmental issues. It has clear relevance to
wildlife preservation policy. The results of this project will help to improve
understanding and communication between academic environmental ethics and
communities economically dependent on maritime resources, as well as developing
a more accurate view of how scientific information may influence the ethics of
fishers.

The project is appropriate to the POWRE program because the investigator's
career has been interrupted by work-related injuries and by a job change from a
federal agency to an educational institution. The POWRE grant will accelerate
the investigator's transition into research in ethics at a critical career
phase, and will allow her to develop a new line of investigation.
