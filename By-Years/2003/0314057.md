The focus of this research is to establish the range of reactions that can be
accomplished on a chip-based platform. First, a protocol for moving known
mediated electrochemical reactions to the chips will be developed. Second,
electrochemically cleavable linkers will be developed for connecting molecules
to the chips so that individual molecules in the library can be isolated. Third,
strategies for spatially confining transition metal catalyzed reactions to
specific locations on the chips will be developed.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller in the Department of Chemistry at
Washington University. Professor Moeller will focus his research efforts using
electrochemistry to build molecular libraries on chips. The research has broader
impact for the pharmaceutical industry and for the agricultural industry.
Further, the project will provide an excellent venue for the training of
undergraduate and graduate students.
