This award supports the travel for early career scientists to the AGU Chapman
Conference on "Particle Dynamics in the Earth's Radiation Belts" in Cascias,
Portugal March 4-9, 2018. This meeting brings together world leaders in space
plasma phenomena from South Korea, Japan, Europe and the USA and provides
significant opportunity for students to participate in sessions. The meeting is
largely focused on the variability of the space plasma environment and enables a
collaborative, workshop-style environment for discussions. This is timely and
relevant to the nation's space weather efforts. Understanding of the environment
is important for understanding how space weather events
evolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
