This project is an integration of mathematical modeling and experimental
analysis of an invertebrate predator-prey system to explore the effects of
habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, predation, and interspecific
competition on herbivore population dynamics from the patch level to the
landscape level. It represents a unique collaboration between two
mathematicians, and ecologist, and undergraduate and PhD students. This project
is expected to provide much-needed information in population ecology on the
consequences of conditional dispersal to population dynamics of species in
fragmented landscapes. Results from this project will answer several key
ecological questions such as will the presence of density dependent dispersal
help to moderate potentially detrimental factors as habitat fragmentation or
worse, exacerbate their effects. The project will also provide a significant
contribution towards the analysis of elliptic boundary value problems with
nonlinear boundary conditions, as new mathematical tools will be developed to
better understand the dynamics of these population models. Finally, the project
will provide clear guidelines for how empirical studies should be constructed to
evaluate the presence and consequences of density dependent dispersal in light
of the predictions of these theoretical models. The investigators will
disseminate the results of this project to both the ecological and mathematical
communities through various media including peer-reviewed mathematical and
ecological journals, talks at national and international conferences, and a
user-friendly website showcasing the research. An important aspect of this
project will involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students through
workshops hosted by the investigators and mentorship of independent research
projects. Moreover, a population dynamics curriculum covering basic population
ecology through mathematical tools and interesting examples for exploring
population models related to density dependent dispersal will be developed
targeting undergraduate and advanced level high school students and freely
available to the public via the project's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
purpose of this collaborative project between will be an integration of modeling
of population dynamics via reaction diffusion models, mathematical analysis, and
experimental analysis of an invertebrate system to explore the effects of
habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, predation, and interspecific
competition on herbivore population dynamics from the patch level to the
landscape level. This study will help answer important biological questions such
as 1) what patch level effects can be expected from density dependent dispersal,
specifically of positive, negative or U-shaped density dependent dispersal, 2)
does density dependent dispersal moderate or even exacerbate the effects of
habitat fragmentation, Allee effects, interspecific competition, or predation on
local or regional stability/persistence of a population, and 3) how should
empirical studies be constructed to evaluate the presence and consequences of
density dependent dispersal in light of the predictions of these theoretical
models. A more comprehensive understanding of the patch and landscape level
consequences of density dependent dispersal in the presence of such complicating
factors as predation, interspecific competition, and habitat fragmentation is
important by itself, but may also lead to the development of better population
management strategies, especially in an environment where populations face
diverse ecological challenges due to predation, habitat fragmentation, and
global climate change. This project is expected to be significant by providing
much-needed information in population ecology on the consequences of conditional
dispersal (i.e., as a function of the density of conspecifics, interspecific
competitors, and predators) to population dynamics of species in fragmented
landscapes. The research is novel because, to date, theoretical and empirical
studies in fragmented systems have ignored other forms of density dependent
dispersal (negative or U-shaped) that are commonly found in nature. Results from
this project will answer several key ecological questions as to whether the
presence of negative or U-shaped density dependent dispersal helps to moderate
potentially detrimental factors as habitat fragmentation or worse, exacerbate
their effects. The project will also provide a significant contribution towards
the analysis of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary
conditions, as new mathematical tools will be developed to better understand the
dynamics of these population models. Further, development of a true landscape
level modeling framework built on reaction diffusion equations will serve as a
foundation for enhanced study of landscape dynamics in theoretical models. The
investigators plan to disseminate the results of this project to both the
ecological and mathematical communities through various media including: the
ArXiv, peer-reviewed mathematics, mathematical biology, and ecology journals,
and in talks at mathematical biology and ecological conferences.
