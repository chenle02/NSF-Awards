This project will explore the development of quantitative models to describe
the critical parameters that govern damage in drilling of laminated composites
and will develop intelligent control strategies for machining of composites
coupling these models. The delamination based drilling models will be validated
by using instrumented tools and workpiece fixtures and applying acoustic
emission techniques to detect the onset of this damage. An intelligent
controller will be developed to learn key parameters in the process and select
the optimal operating conditions for maintaining both a high production rate and
superior quality of the finished workpiece. The project has a high potential to
significantly impact machining of composites. If the delamination problem in
composite machining is solved, the application of composites can be
substantially widened.
