9730782 Latz This interdisciplinary project is to examine the shear sensitivity
of marine dinoflagellates, one of the most shear-sensitive organisms known.
Luminescent dinoflagellates respond essentially instantaneously to mechanical
stimulation via a unique and easily monitored bioluminescent effector system.
These plant-like cells will be used as a model system for investigating
fundamental questions in sensory biology with important engineering
applications. The main questions relating to the mechanosensory signal
transduction pathway are: (1) what is the role of G proteins in signal
transduction; (2) how is applied mechanical stress related to fluid shear stress
and cell strain; and (3) how is shear sensitivity affected by the cytoskeleton?
