This project will research the dependence of the spectrum of the mesosphere's
temperature and density fluctuations on the horizontal scale size of
disturbance. In addition, the PI will investigate longer-term and larger-scale
phenomena, such as mesocools, tidal phenomena and secular changes. The PI will
measure and analyze emission rates and derived rotational temperatures using a
combination of optical instruments, with a new wide-aperture BOMEM Fourier
Transform Interferometer. The information on wave activity gained from this
study is important to wave-heating processes in the upper mesosphere.***
