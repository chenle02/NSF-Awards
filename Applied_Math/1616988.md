Surface waves are waves that propagate along a boundary or interface. They arise
in many physical systems, such as water waves on the surface of the ocean and
seismic surface waves generated by earthquakes. They also have a wide variety of
technological applications, such as ultrasonic surface acoustic waves used in
analog filters and surface plasmons used in optical and nano-optical devices. At
lower intensities, effects of different waves add (waves superpose) and may be
described by linear theories, but at higher intensities nonlinear effects become
significant. Nonlinearity leads to qualitatively new phenomena, including wave
interactions and the formation of singularities (such as shock waves). This
project addresses the fundamental nonlinear dynamics of surface waves and their
applications, especially nondispersive surface waves whose phase speed or
frequency is independent of their wavelength. As a part of the project, graduate
and undergraduate students will be trained through involvement in the research.

The project will carry out an asymptotic analysis of nonlinear surface waves in
a variety of physical systems. Applications will be made to electromagnetic
surface waves, or surface plasmons, waves on vorticity discontinuities and
surface quasi-geostrophic fronts, plasma waves, and Rayleigh waves in
elasticity. The resulting asymptotic equations are typically spatially nonlocal
and quasilinear. These equations will be studied analytically and numerically,
in particular with the aim of understanding the nonlinear focusing and possible
formation and propagation of singularities in these surface waves. In addition,
the project will study the diffraction and glancing Mach reflection of shock
waves, together with related problems in transonic aerodynamics.
