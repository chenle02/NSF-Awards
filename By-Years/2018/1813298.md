More than half of the stars in the night sky come with siblings. Instead of
maturing through their birth, middle age and death alone, they live their lives
with one or more companion stars. "Binary stars", where two stars progress
through their life cycle together, are the most common form of multiple star
systems. The investigators seek to understand the final stages of the binary
star life cycle, where the smaller star plunges into the atmosphere of the
larger one leading to the spectacular phenomena called Common Envelope Evolution
(CEE). The CEE stage is one of the most difficult to understand and one of the
most important stages of the binary star life cycle. It is important because
many of the Universe?s strangest and most exotic phenomena come from the Common
Envelope stage. The most famous recent example of a CEE event was the Black
Hole-Black Hole merger, which made headlines across the world after being
observed via gravitational waves with the NSF funded LIGO
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modeling CEE requires the most sophisticated
supercomputer simulations because the process is so violent and occurs so
quickly. The investigators will use a newly developed supercomputer code to
reveal new details of CEE and resolve long-standing mysteries about how the
binary stars quickly shrink their orbit and drive huge amounts of material into
space. Their work will be closely tied to observations via their codes' ability
to produce "synthetic observations" that can be directly compared with what is
seen on the sky. In addition, the investigators will bring this research to the
public through articles written for popular and on-line
magazines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
