Rock Mechanics in Extreme Environments: A Workshop to Explore Applications of
Rock Mechanics in Challenging Settings will take place on July 7, 2001, as part
of DC Rocks 2001: The 38th U.S. Rock Mechanics Symposium in Washington, DC. The
workshop will probe areas of national concern, such as resource development,
national security, scientific exploration, and building and infrastructure. An
extreme environment is one in which rock is exposed to a change in its
environment caused by the activities of humans. The workshop will consist of a
series of presentations by experts on the unique mechanical and engineering
properties of rock under extreme environmental conditions, and technologies that
make it possible to subject rocks to extreme environments. These presentations
will include research initiatives underway and the problems inherent in working
under these environmental conditions. After the presentations, workshop
participants will discuss how the many unknown characteristics of rock under
extreme conditions can be better understood. How can research and technology
development help in this quest?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Workshop topics include
rock and rock structures under high dynamic loading, caving method mining,
difficult rock conditions in the new Transalpine Tunnels, blasting in urban
environments, stone in architecture, rock as a building material, fractured
bedrock, and rock mechanics for deep drilling on Mars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All
discussion transcripts will be compiled, edited and published in a document that
will be distributed at no cost through the ARMA Foundation and its Web site.
