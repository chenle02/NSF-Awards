A chemistry course has been designed specifically to address the general
science education of students majoring in non-science fields. The focus of the
course is science literacy with the laboratory emphasizing the investigative
nature of science. An important component of the laboratory experience is an
introduction to chemical instrumentation. This project utilizes spectronic 20's
for laboratory experiments. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
