This is a study of the thermal structure of continental crations. The
investigations will comprise (i) the measurement of terrestrial heat flow in
both cratonic and rifted areas of central and southern Africa, (ii) comparative
studies of the heat flow in and around the cratonic regions of Africa, North
Amierica, Australia, and India, and (iii) numerical model studies of the effect
of cratonic structure on regional heat transfer. African heat flow measurement
program, previously focussed in Botswana and Namibia, will be extended into
Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Zaire. These countries collectively comprise both stable
Archean cratonic terrains and rifted Proterozoic mobile belts of the East
African Rift system. The new measurements will provide additional observations
with which to test the hypothesis that thick cratonic roots devert mantle heat
away from Archean terrains into younger surrounding mobile belts. Heat flow data
from the Archean terrains of North America, Australia, and India will also be
examined in the context of the cratonic diversion model. numerical models of
heat transfer beneath and within cratonic and surrounding terrains will examine
(a) the range of parameters that yield conditions consistent with observations
of surface heat flow and mantle temperatures determined from thermobarometry,
(b) the effects of cratonic scale on the diversion mechanism, and (c) the
comparison of present day conditions to those in the Archean when heat
production was 2-3 time greater, but temperatures in the cratonic root were
similar to present-day values.
