9614304 Collins A plan for the dynamic mechanical testing (DMT) of the promising
new polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA's) will be implemented. DMT provides detailed
information on polymer structure and function, but has not typically been
applied to PHA properties. A DMT investigation of the mechanical properties of
the Howard novel polyhydroxyalkanoates will be conducted to appraise their
industrial and medical suitability. Together with the promise of
polyhydroxyalkanoates as biomaterials, PHA's are tailorable biomedical polymers,
suggesting greater potential. The Howard Biomaterials Research Focus Group has
developed a novel protocol to tailor PHA properties. %%% This NSF Minority
Research Planning Grant furnishes the basis for DMT study and a later full-scale
examination of the relationship between the deformation and application of these
new polyhydroxyalkanoates. ***
