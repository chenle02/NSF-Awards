The innovation uses custom hardware and software for accurate sleep
classification in a cost-effective and durable design, as well as mobile "apps"
to achieve memory enhancement by modulated consolidation (memC). By utilizing
computer learning algorithms and models of the biological process underlying
sleep, the innovation reduces the complexity of comparable systems. The system
is tightly integrated with cloud systems to improve system performance for
memory enhancement and reduce user experience complexity.

The broader/commercial impact of the work is to develop tools and methods to
optimize learning for students and adults of all ages. Particularly of interest
is to provide a new approach for K-12 students diagnosed with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sheepdog Sciences is developing a commercial
system to be used by students during study times and during sleep. By monitoring
sleep and delivering the appropriate interventions, students using the device
will improve the efficiency of sleep and study.
