Recognizing a national science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
workforce need in the areas of data science and modeling with data, the Society
For Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will conduct a two-day workshop
pertaining to modeling across the curriculum. This will be the third SIAM
workshop pertaining to modeling across the curriculum and will have a special
focus on: (1) incorporating computational and statistical data models into
undergraduate and K-12 curricula; (2) models related to Business-Industry-
Government, including big data considerations, and (3) conducting education
research to inform the STEM community regarding best and emerging practices for
developing and implementing these curricular updates. The approximately forty
(40) participants in the workshop will include experts in STEM education and
social science research methods and computational and statistical data science
practitioners as well as mathematical sciences modeling practitioners and
department leaders. An outcome of the project will be to disseminate the
knowledge that will be gained from the workshop to help improve student learning
and success to foster a national goal of increasing the number of highly
qualified students who will enter the United States STEM workforce.

Participants at the workshop will begin examining the following research
questions: (a) Why should data science, data-enabled science, and modeling with
data, including both statistical and computational data models, be incorporated
into undergraduate and K-12 curricula, what should be included, and how should
this be implemented?, and (b) In line with the first question, what should be
the role of modeling and computation with respect to problems related to
Business-Industry-Government? Underlying goals of the workshop are to: (i) use
the expertise and diversity of participants to supplement and refine these
research questions; (ii) develop detailed plans for curricula and professional
development materials which will then be implemented in subsequent work of the
participants; (iii) promote research activities to foster a better understanding
of issues related to developing, implementing, and engaging students and faculty
in data-based statistical and computational modeling; (iv) provide a
professionally prepared, summary of conclusions document from the meeting; and
(v) use the variety of mechanisms available to SIAM to disseminate the workshop
findings and recommendations to the larger mathematics and statistics
communities.
