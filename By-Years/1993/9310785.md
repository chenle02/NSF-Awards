9310785 Tilman This study combines theory, observation, experiments, and
paleoecology methods in a comprehensive and mechanistic investigation of plant
succession in coastal Lake Michigan sand dunes. Experiments will distinguish
among potential environmental constraints limiting the distribution and
abundance of plant species along a complex gradient. The influence of water
stress, competition for water, nitrogen stress, competition for nitrogen,
competition for light, colonization constraints, sand burial, and herbivory on
seedling survival will be tested for six dominant species in a seedling
transplant experiment. %%% Knowledge derived from this research will determine
the importance of various constraints and tradeoffs during succession. The study
site is ideally suited for this research, and the attempt to address the
relative effects of several environmental factors is a unique aspect of this
project. ***
