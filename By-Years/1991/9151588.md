With the world of biotechnology changing our lives daily, it is vital to
transfer this new information to students as early in their academic careers as
possible. Three recombinant DNA labs will be added to the current Microbiology
and majors' Principles of Biology courses taught at Polk Community College to
reinforce lectures on biotechnology theory and provide students immediate
exposure to reecombinant DNA techniques.From these new labs the student will
learn the following: to prepare and run an agarose gel, perform restriction
analysis, produce competent cells, transform bacteria, perform proper
measurement techniques to confirm data, and develop the critical thinking
necessary to quantitative biology. The addition of new biotechnology laboratory
exercises will strengthen several existing undergraduate courses.
