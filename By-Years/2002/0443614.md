With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at Dartmouth College will purchase upgrades for a 300 MHz and 500 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometers. This equipment will characterize a range
of molecular systems including organic natural products, organic materials,
biological molecules, and organometallic complexes.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
