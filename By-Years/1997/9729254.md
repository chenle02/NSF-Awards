ABSTRACT EEC-9729254 KU Direct conversion receivers for wireless communication
require less components and eliminate the need for bulky image rejection IF
filters. This is joint "TIE" project linking the research capabilities of two
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) to study techniques
for on-line adaptive digital compensation of the imperfections of analog
components of mixed-mode transceiver circuits. The research site will be
conducted at Oregon State University, the research site of the I/UCRC for Design
of Analog Digital Integrated Circuits, and the University of California, San
Diego I/UCRC for Ultra-High Speed Integrated
