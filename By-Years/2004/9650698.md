The Chemistry Department has been consistent over the past 2 decades in
anticipating and addressing the needs of its chemistry students. However, the
department currently lacks sufficient molecular modeling capabilities to engage
the students throughout the curriculum. The predictive and visualization
potential of this methodology is becoming increasing important for both learning
about and working in chemistry. This project concerns the purchase of five CAChe
Worksystems running on Power Macintosh 7500 computers, which greatly increase
the hands-on access to molecular modeling for students in the chemistry program.
Students may become proficient with a wide variety of computational methods
through a series of experiments in courses at all levels of the curriculum,
including introductory chemistry, organic chemistry, advanced inorganic
chemistry, physical chemistry, advanced organic chemistry, biochemistry, and
research. In these experiments, students learn to visualize molecules in three
dimensions, determine optimum geometries of various molecules, determine
rotational energy barriers, correlate computed and observed properties, predict
thermodynamic properties of molecules and reactions, and study reaction
mechanisms by modeling intermediates, transition states, and activation
energies. These experiments start with basic skills and build progressively to
more sophisticated experiments through which the students gain an appreciation
for both the power and limitations of molecular modeling.
