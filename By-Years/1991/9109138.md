Mathematical morphology has been becoming an increasingly important and often-
used technique in image processing and machine vision applications during recent
decades. Nevertheless, the iterations of morphological operations exist a
bottleneck in implementation on a pipelined parallel architecture. The
objectives of this project are to propose a set of new morphological operators,
called back-propagation morphology, which is different from the traditionally
defined morphology for solving time-consuming iteration problems, and to develop
its underlying theorems, algorithms and architectures for various vision
applications. First-stage experiments show that the back-propagation morphology
has the advantages of deriving a root of a signal which only requires two scans
without numerous iterations and being suited for parallel architectures. It is
anticipated that the proposed research program will lead to fundamental advances
in the theoretical understanding of the new back-propagation morphological
operations. The algorithms and architectures developed and the research findings
produced by the project will also have substantial utility for industry in
advancing machine vision inspection and recognition technologies.
