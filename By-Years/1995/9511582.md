This renewal proposal for the study of, "High Intensity Laser-Atom
Interactions", calls for a joint theoretical and experimental study of atoms
irradiated by intense optical fields. The experiments will focus on high
harmonic generation (HHG) and on ionization in intense, short optical pulses.
The measurements of harmonic coherence will be extended and high-order harmonics
will be used to begin a new series of continuum saturation experiments. Recent
findings on harmonic angular distributions will be extended by re-imaging the
harmonics which emerge from the focus, measuring their spatial coherence using a
Young's two-slit interferometer, and making a high resolution study of the
angular spectral distribution. Theoretical work will continue to extract new
information about strong-field atomic behavior during MPI and high-harmonic
generation.
