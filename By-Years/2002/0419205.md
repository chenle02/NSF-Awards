This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new
preparative strategies for the peptide antibiotic Mutacin 1140 and related
derivatives. Current fermentation and synthetic routes are impractical. In-vitro
testing suggests that Mutacin and its derivatives may work on drug-resistant
bacterial strains. The peptide backbone of the antibiotic will be produced by
cloning and expressing a 22mer artificial gene. The structure will then be
modified to a range of derivatives synthetically.

The commercial application of the proposed project is in the area of antibiotics
to combat human infectious diseases. Screening has indicated effectiveness
against a wide range of gram positive and some gram-negative pathogens including
multidrug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
