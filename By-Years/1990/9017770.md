This grant supports the travel award program of the American Physiological
Society (APS) for its joint meeting with the Chinese Physiological Society
November 2-5, 1990 in Taipei. The APS travel award program gives preference to
under- represented minorities, women, and young scientists. The Division of
Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Behavioral and Neural Sciences each has
contributed $5,000 to this grant. This is the first joint meeting of the two
societies that is supported by the AIT-CCNAA Cooperative Science Program. The
joint meeting will cover important topics in the physiological and neural
sciences and will stimulate discussions and increase collaboration between
scientists in the United States and Taiwan.
