In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Prof.
Andrei Tokmakoff of the Chemistry Department of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and his graduate student colleagues will develop two dimensional
infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy of amide and water vibrations, and use these in
combination with nanosecond laser temperature-jumps to study protein and peptide
conformational variation and dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader
scientific impacts of the research being supported, the research students
working on these projects will gain experience with advanced laser techniques.
Prof. Tokmakoff also maintains a Web site(http://www.mit.edu/~tokmakof/TDQMS/)
through which his most recent quantum mechanics course materials are made
available. Additional lecture and laboratory course materials are distributed on
the MIT OpenCourseWare Web
site(http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm/).
