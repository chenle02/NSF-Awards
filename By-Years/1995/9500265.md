9500265 Messner Matching funds will support the acquisition of a laser doppler
vibrometer with signal analyzer to be used in research on the nonlinear dynamics
of rotary bearings for very rapid, high-precision positioning and tracking
systems typical of hard disk magnetic storage systems, optical pointing systems,
and semiconductor manufacturing. ***
