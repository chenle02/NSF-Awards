This grant provides support for travel and subsistence for approximately 20
graduate students and young scientists to enable them to attend the Chapman
Conference on gravity wave parameterization to be held on the Island of Hawaii
in January 2004. The organizing committee consists of aeronomers and
meteorologists who are active in the observation of gravity waves and
parameterizing their effects for use in general circulation models. The
committee will nominate candidates for awards of approximately $1,000 each.
Preference will be given to applicants who will make important scientific
contributions to the conference, to graduate students who would be unable to
attend otherwise, and to promising young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
