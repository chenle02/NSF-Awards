the largest radio telescope in the United States; called the very large array
or the VLA, and the Soviet Union's largest radio telescope, called the RATAN
600, will be used to observe the sun for ten days each year during a three-year
period. This will lead to a greater understanding of the radiative output of the
sun; it is this output that powers all global changes on the Earth. Our joint
research project will enhance the scientific return of both instruments beyond
that is expected from using either one alone. Spectra and polarization data
taken with the RATAN 600 at eleven wavelengths between 0.9 and 20.0 cm will be
combined with VLA observations of high angular resolution at 2, 3.6, 6, and 20
cm to determine radiation mechanisms and coronal magnetic field strengths for
the various sources of intense, quiescent solar radiation. *** //
