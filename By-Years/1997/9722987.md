9722987 Risley Spermatogenesis is dependent upon a poorly understood, complex
network of hormonal, paracrine, and contact-mediated cellular interactions, the
disruption of which may lead to temporary or permanent infertility. The proposed
research will investigate the roles of gap junctions in mediating intercellular
communication in the seminiferous tubules of testes. The working hypothesis is
that gap junctions, assembled from diverse connexins, provide multiple, unique
communication pathways between Sertoli and spermatogenic cells in the
seminiferous epithelium. To evaluate this overall hypothesis, connexin gene
expression, assembly, and function in the seminiferous epithelium will be
investigated. Connexin mRNA expression in spermatogenic cells, Sertoli cells,
and peritubular cells will be studied using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization.
Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting will be used to assess connexin protein
expression and assembly. The influence of reproductive hormones on connexin gene
expression and connexin assembly will also be studied using rats that have been
hypophysectomized and placed on hormone-replacement therapy regimens. Finally,
microinjection of various tracer dyes into seminiferous tubules will be employed
to define gap junction coupling pathways at different tubule stages, and to
determine if different junctions have unique permeability properties.
