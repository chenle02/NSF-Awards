9727145 Wiley This project will combine approaches of biochemical engineering,
cell biology, and molecular biology to increase the quantitative understanding
and manipulation of growth factor/receptor dynamics at both the cell and tissue
level. Work will focus on the dynamics of autocrine growth factor signaling,
particularly with respect to the spatial regulation of ligand release and
receptor occupancy. A major goal in this direction will be to determine whether
autocrine ligands provide information to cells regarding their tissue
"community" as opposed to their local microenvironment, and how physico-chemical
parameters influence this information. Work will also continue to build on
current models of receptor trafficking to include new experimental information
about the sorting compartment, and to extend these models to incorporate key
components of related signal transduction pathways. This will allow a
quantitative evaluation of the effects of altered receptor trafficking on
signaling pathways underlying previous studies of cell proliferation responses.
Understanding these sorts of integrated dynamical influences on growth factor
signaling will continue to generate a rational basis for the design of improved
pharmacological growth factor mimics or antagonists. By using the human
epidermal growth factor/receptor system transfected into defined cell lines,
tools for molecular biology such as monoclonal antibodies, site-directed
receptor mutants, and recombinant site- directed ligand variants can be used for
biochemical engineering purposes. The work for the new grant period has been
organized into three specific aims which are designed to facilitate the
understanding of receptor and ligand dynamics in growth factor regulation of
cell function. ***
