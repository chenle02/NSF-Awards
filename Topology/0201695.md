This proposal contains two programs. The first is to study a variety of homotopy
theoretic problems associated with space of smooth embeddings of one manifold in
another. Among these problems are obstruction theory for embeddings, linking
phenomena, compression problems and splitting questions. The second program is a
new approach to the study of the equivariant structure sets of topological
manifolds equipped with a tame action of a finite group. The new ingredient is
to use Poincare embeddings to analyse the difference between the equivariant
structures and the isovariant ones.

A manifold is a topological space which is locally euclidean. A fundamental
problem in topology is to enumerate the embeddings one manifold into another
one. The set of all such embeddings forms a topological space. The first part of
this proposal is to study various topological aspects of the space of
embeddings. The second part concerns the classification of manifolds equipped
with a finite group of symmetries.
