9634637 Cowen This project is a rapid response to a hydrothermal/volcanic event
on the Gorda Ridge in the northeast Pacific. On Feb. 1996 a major seismic event
was detected by the NOAA VENTS program through monitoring of the US Navy SOSUS
hydrophone arrays. NOAA dispatched the research vessel MacArthur and they
discovered a hydrothermal megaplume in the area of the seismic activity. The
availability of the research vessel Wecoma in early April allows a more detailed
response. The objectives of this cruise are to locate the source of the
magaplume, to determine whether there has been a subsurface bacterial bloom, to
determine geochemical and microbial concentrations in the plume, and if
possible, to establish patterns of crustal breakage and/or eruption.
