Among crabs, eggs are attached to the tail of the female and carried for a
length of time that varies with the species. Egg hatching is precisely timed
with respect to environmental cycles such as lunar, light-dark and tidal cycles.
It is proposed here that egg hatching is controlled by the developing embryo
rather than the female carrying the mass of embryos. Breakage of an initial few
brings about the release of certain peptides and this provides a chemical clue
inducing the female to bring about behavior which results in the synchronized
release of crab larvae. The proposed research is designed to answer questions
that will increase our understanding of the egg hatching process which is
precisely timed to enhance the larval survival and transport in estuarine and
coastal areas.
