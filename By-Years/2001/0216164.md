0216164&lt;br/&gt;Duennebier&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award
to University of Hawaii at Manoa provides funds for development of a cabled
oceanographic observatory, at the location of the existing Hawaii Ocean
Timeseries (HOT) Station ALOHA, to be known as the ANZCAN-ALOHA Ocean
Observatory. The goal of the project is to provide power and data communication
capability over the abandoned ANZCAN telecommunications cable, which will be
moved 26 kilometers to the existing site of the 13-year ALOHA time series. The
cable comes ashore on Oahu, and it will be managed from University of Hawaii's
Manoa campus. It will enable a major increase in experimental capability at and
near the site, with a kilowatt of power and 2 mbaud data rate available to
support instruments and ocean experiments in physical, chemical, biological and
geological oceanography as well as meteorology, ocean optics, biogeochemistry
and other fields. A moored profiler will provide continuous monitoring of the
physical properties of the full water column, with operator control to respond
to ocean events. An acoustic modem capability will be included to allow
deployment and communication with experiments that are not physically attached
to the cabled junction box. The cabled observatory will have Internet
connectivity, allowing researchers to observe and control their experiments, and
providing links to the observatory and to related educational sites for students
at levels from grade school to graduate school. University of Hawaii will
provide cost-share support equal to more than 30% of equipment costs, per MRI
Program guidelines for development proposals undertaken at Ph.D.-granting
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
