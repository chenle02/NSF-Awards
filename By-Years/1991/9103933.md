The matrix generalization of the Euler product has been introduced in previous
work, and it has been shown that the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the
convergence question for related products of Moebius transformations. The
present project is an estimation theory of such products which would be
sufficient to answer the question posed by Riemann. In order to accomplish this
it is proposed to construct disks that are mapped into each other by successive
Moebius transformations of the matrix product. The solution of the Riemann
Hypothesis is indeed the Holy Grail of analysis, and the principal investigator
is by most accounts the most capable person in the world to attempt a solution.
Even if a complete resolution does not result from this work the results that
are obtained will be of tremendous value.
