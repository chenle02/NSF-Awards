AST 0349360 Close&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Laird Close, at the University of
Arizona, will undertake two large surveys to directly detect extrasolar planets
around 49 young, and 51 nearby, stars with novel optical devices called quadrant
simultaneous differential imagers (SDI). The quadrant SDI has been developed by
Dr. Close to reveal the presence of an extrasolar gas giant by a double
difference of 4 images taken simultaneously. Based on current models of the
properties of extra-solar planets he expects to detect of order 3-10 extrasolar
planets by the end of these surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from this
CAREER grant will enable Dr. Close to train a new generation of young graduate
student astronomers in the field of extrasolar planetary science and adaptive
optics. The PI will also use this grant to complete the first dedicated research
quality IR telescope for public outreach and education. This new IR facility
will play a key role in giving interactive, hands-on, experience observing the
invisible infrared universe to teenagers, and in the training of adult Girl
Guide leaders in biannual workshops to be held at the Mt. Lemmon/Astronomy Camp
site as part of the Observatory's "Linking Girls with the Sky" outreach program.
