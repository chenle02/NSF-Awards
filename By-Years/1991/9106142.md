The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. John Bowman (University of
Utah), will study metamorphic rocks of the Big Maria Mountains in southeastern
California using petrologic and isotopic techniques. The investigation will help
geologists to understand fluid flow and fluid-rock interaction in rocks that
have undergone metamorphism at mid-crustal depths in the Earth.
