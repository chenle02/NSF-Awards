Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores how techniques from coding
and signal processing can be&lt;br/&gt;used to build better analog to digital
and digital to analog converters, create better half toning
algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for digital printing,and improve medical imaging. All of
these as well as many other applications use a technique called&lt;br/&gt;Sigma
Delta modulation. Sigma Delta modulation is a technique which allows high
precision&lt;br/&gt;signal to be generated from binary quantized data. This
research provides a new interpretation of Sigma Delta&lt;br/&gt;modulation by
viewing it as a greedy solution to an optimization problem instead&lt;br/&gt;of
a linear system with feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new view not only
explains how existing Sigma Delta modulators work but also&lt;br/&gt;suggests a
whole new continuum of modulator structures which can&lt;br/&gt;trade complexity
against performance. The research has two main&lt;br/&gt;thrusts, one practical
and experimental and the other theoretical.&lt;br/&gt;The practical thrust will
improve upon the existing empirical&lt;br/&gt;approaches to conventional Sigma
Delta modulator design and then&lt;br/&gt;adapt them to new modulator structures
suggested by the optimization&lt;br/&gt;approach. This research should yield
immediate benefits for the&lt;br/&gt;numerous areas where Sigma Delta modulators
are used now as well&lt;br/&gt;as new applications that will become viable
because of this&lt;br/&gt;research. The theoretical thrust will develop a
rigorous&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the quantization process.
