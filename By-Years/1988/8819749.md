ABSTRACT In the past five years it has become possible to display and print
phonetics and to manipulate phonetic data on small com- puters. The problem now
is to integrate small computer tools to take best advantage of technological
advances. This project will establish efficient methods for commercial software
to enter, manipulate, analyze, and print phonetic data on American English from
the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States (LAMSAS). The
Principal Investigator has applied commercial software to display and print
phonetic data, and has designed a data structure for phonetic data with a
commercial database program. The 1.5 million responses of the LAMSAS data-base
require fast, accurate methods to enter phonetic data, now difficult to
keyboard. Efficient methods will be developed to divide extremely variable
strings of phonetics into classes in order to correlate the classes (numerically
coded) with the characteristics of LAMSAS informants with a commercial advanced
statistics package. Finally, methods will be designed to integrate the output of
word processing, database, and statistical software to generate camera-ready
copy for publication. The methods will be of immediate use to linguists for
research on phonetics because all equipment and software is readily available at
low cost and all procedures are readily portable for database research.
