The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
award is to test the hypothesis that mechanical stretch of alveolar epithelial
cells propagates lung fibrosis. Epithelial injury is a central event in the
progression of fibrotic lung diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome,
pulmonary fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and ventilator induced lung
injury. Mechanical strain is an often underappreciated contributor to lung
epithelial injury. This project will test the hypothesis through three research
goals utilizing a multi-scale approach toward mechanotransduction from lung
tissue deformation to sub-cellular molecular signaling. These studies will
improve fundamental scientific knowledge by explaining mechanisms that are
responsible for aberrant repair and fibrosis in alveolar type II epithelial
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing a better understanding of
fibrosis in the lung, the results of these experimental studies will provide a
new understanding of the mechanotransduction of epithelial cells that may be
applicable to the epithelium of several different organs and diseases. A
learning platform with hands-on demonstrations of epithelial cell mechanobiology
will be developed as an outreach tool to teach under-represented middle school
students. As an extension of the middle school modules, this project will
develop course materials for high school education in mechanobiology.
Furthermore, this work will provide a basis for a new Undergraduate and Graduate
Course offering in Biomedical Engineering, "Cell Mechanics and Mechanobiology".
Additionally, research opportunities will be available for high school students
through the Medical Sciences Internship Program and to undergraduates through
the Honors Summer Undergraduate Research Program. The research and educational
goals will impact many under-represented students at a variety of levels and
have high impact on human fibrotic lung disease.
