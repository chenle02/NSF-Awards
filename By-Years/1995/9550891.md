Typical introductory statistics courses do not engage the attention of modern
students who come to class fresh from a world of rapid-fire TV commercials,
action movies, and dynamic video games. This project, in conjunction with two
companion projects, uses the interactive capability of computers to teach basic
statistical concepts (distribution, variability, center, spread, randomness, and
association, to name a few) through hands-on activities. Through creative use of
technology, the content, conduct, and quality of these courses are being revised
to improve the quantitative reasoning skills of all undergraduates, especially
those from traditionally nonquantitative disciplines. Students are encouraged to
learn for themselves by doing, observing, thinking and consolidating while, the
instructor becomes a catalyst and coach instead of an authoritative lecturer.
The project is also building a laboratory model that works for large sections of
introductory courses.
