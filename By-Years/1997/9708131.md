of topical meetings that explore advances in the science and technology related
to the interplay between photonics and electronics. The purpose of the meeting
is to bring together scientists and engineers who work on fundamental issues,
new materials and diagnostic tools, and device applications, to provide a forum
where state-of-the art results are presented and new directions can be
determined. Support is provided for travel for students and young faculty to
attend this meeting, who would not otherwise be able to do so. ***
