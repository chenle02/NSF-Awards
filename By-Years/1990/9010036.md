The objective of this project is to investigate grammar-based data
specifications for testing, analysis, and verification of sequential and
concurrent software. Specific research topics include: (1) To address issues,
such as the problem of expressing contextual dependencies, in the use of
grammer-based data specification for test generation. (2) To explore uses, such
as demonstrating consistency between communicating processes, of grammar-based
data specifications for analysis and verification. (3) To investigate
techniques, such as generating self-checking test cases, of exploiting grammar-
based data specifications for test result evaluation.
