The Southern Partnership in Advanced Networking (SPAN) supports the increasingly
critical role that access to distributed data/compute-intensive infrastructure,
both technical and human, is playing in research and education endeavors across
a wide range of disciplines. As campus IT groups around the country build and
expand infrastructure components to address the needs of their users,
coordination between and across campuses has become critical to create
successful, sustainable, scalable, and flexible solutions that can be
implemented in multiple settings. Tying this infrastructure together is the
network, which has become an essential piece of the cyberinfrastructure
ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPAN is a partnership between Clemson
University, South Carolina State University, Georgia State University, and the
University of Georgia that is building a regional community of practitioners
across the South that supports next-generation networking. In collaboration with
the Southern Crossroads initiative, Internet2, and ESnet, SPAN offers a program
of workshops, site visits, and best practices documentation to administrators,
campus IT groups, and researchers at institutions across the South that includes
hands-on training, expert presentations, and in situ recommendations on topics
such as network upgrades and cybersecurity to assist in the development and
deployment of their own Campus Cyberinfrastructure
Plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significantly, SPAN facilitates the creation of
distributed science communities and enables new collaborations that can leverage
advanced networking solutions to make new science discoveries. The creation of
this regional network of expertise distributed across multiple institutions in
support of faculty-led research that benefits from advanced networking
capabilities will transform the way research is done across the region.
