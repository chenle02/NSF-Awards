OCE 96-33057 Becker The project will use two types of general circulation models
to investigate effects of topography and stratification on western boundary
currents which cannot be addressed by quasi-gestrophic models. The first model
is governed by primitive equations, but constrained to be barotropic. Finite
difference solutions for the case of sidewalls which transition smoothly to zero
depth through a "continental shelf" will be compared to the standard case of
vertical sidewalls. The second model will also incorporate sloping sidewalls,
but will be stratified. Vertical modes will be used to avoid numerical
difficulties where layer interfaces intersect the boundaries. The results will
clarify dynamical processes controlling wind driven flow in numerical general
circulation models.
