9352796 Makedon Parallelism is the future of computing and computer science and
should therefore be at the heart of the CS curriculum. Instead of continuing
along the evolutionary path by introducing parallel computation "top down"
(first in special junior-senior level courses), this radical approach will
introduce parallelism at the earliest possible stages of instruction.
Specifically, a completely new freshman-level course on data structures that
integrates parallel computation naturally, and retains the emphasis on
laboratory instruction will be developed. This will help to steer the curriculum
as expeditiously as possible toward parallel computing, and provide a national
model for other schools to do the same. It will also serve to meet as directly
as possible the national need identified in the HPCC initiative to transfer
knowledge of high performance computing as quickly as possible into education.
This approach is novel in three distinct and essential ways. First, parallel
computing will be taught to freshmen in a course designed from beginning to end
to do so. Second, the course will be motivating with examples from scientific
computation. Third, multimedia and visualization will be used as instructional
aids to produce a seamless, exploratory environment. The three primary
objectives are: 1) to begin a reform of the undergraduate curriculum with an
innovative, laboratory-based, freshman course on parallel computation, 2) to
provide a model for national use, and 3) to produce tools and methodologies that
improve student understanding of the basic principles of parallel computing that
can be disseminated to other schools. ***
