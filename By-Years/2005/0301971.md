The substituted Lanthanum manganites (quasicubic and layered compounds) provide
an unusual opportunity to investigate spin-charge-lattice correlations at the
local structure level and connect the correlations with macroscopic phenomena
such as Colossal Magnetoresistance (CMR) and charge ordering (CO). Local probe
studies (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and neutron Pair
Distribution Function (PDF) analysis) show that there is a significant, polaron-
induced, structural change as the temperature is increased through the
ferromagnetic transition temperature, Tc, in zero field. In addition, there is a
large and anomalous magnetostriction that is connected with the CMR behavior.
This individual investigator award supports a project to determine for the first
time the field-induced changes in the local structure as a function of magnetic
field and extend the EXAFS measurements to several of the layered compounds. The
high field measurements will probe how the magnetization initially develops just
below Tc. The measurements on the layered materials will determine the
anisotropy of the local distortions. These are important results for developing
better models of ferromagnetism and electrical transport in these systems. The
proposed project will provide the thesis topic for a graduate student as well as
several senior thesis topics for undergraduates. The students will work as a
team under the PI. They will gain the experience of performing research at a
national facility.

Some of the substituted the Lanthanum manganites (with part of the La replaced
with Ca or Sr) show an unusual decrease in the local atomic distortions of the
Mn-O bond as the sample becomes magnetized at low temperatures. For temperatures
near the magnetic transition temperature there is also a large change in the
resistivity of the sample and a large anomalous magnetostriction (a change in
sample size when a magnetic field is applied). This individual investigator
award supports a project to investigate how the local distortion changes in a
large applied magnetic field and to correlate these results with the sample
magnetization, magnetostriction and electrical resistivity. These results should
also determine how the initial stages of the magnetization process take place in
these materials. Similar measurements will be carried out on a layered manganite
compound - but here the distortions in the layers and perpendicular to the
layers need to be determined separately. The proposed project will provide the
thesis topic for a graduate student as well as several senior thesis topics for
undergraduates. The students will work as a team under the PI. They will gain
the experience of performing research at a national facility.
