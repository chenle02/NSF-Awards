It is often desirable to produce a synthetic gene that encodes a protein of
interest and is optimized for desirable sequence properties, such as good
translation kinetics for folding and expression in a target organism. However,
most genes are far longer than the limits of accurate DNA synthesis. Thus, the
rapid creation of tailored genes has not been convenient. As preliminary results
we have developed a method for the computational optimization of DNA sequences
that encode their own correct self-assembly. Scores of short overlapping
synthetic oligonucleotides are designed to hybridize correctly with great
efficiency at a high temperature, while all competing nonproductive
hybridization events are identified and disfavored. Sequence properties are
optimized using a formal heuristic search. Based on these preliminary results
this project is developing novel methods in information technology and
biotechnology for the self-assembly of long strings of mixed coding, regulatory,
and intergenic regions. The DNA constructs that result may be hybridized into
any plasmid expression vector and transformed into cells, or used directly as
DNA templates to produce proteins in coupled in vitro transcription-translation
systems. The new methods will be accurate, enzyme-free, in solution, single
step, scalable, and high-throughput. They will have relevance to large-scale,
high-throughput crystallization and proteomics efforts and enable the facile
creation of synthetic genomes.
