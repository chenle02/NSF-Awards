This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a new
technique for rapid Karyotyping based on a "ChromArray" device, which would
allow the collection of a large number of chromosome spreads in a precise array.
By collecting the inherent spectrum of chromosomes, the addition of dye is not
necessary. Each physical coordinate within the karyotype would contain a third
axis (spectra), adding further criteria for automated karyotpying of large
number of chromosome spreads simultaneously. This project will investigate a
technique of karyotyping that permits rapid identification of chromosomal
alterations, thereby identifying chromosomal abnormalities of a large array of
chromosome samples simultaneously. Therefore a large number of cells from the
human body (of which there are 200 cell types) can be studied, to screen for
genetic disorders.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of human healthcare.
The use of chromarray technology and near field optical microscopy would impact
a variety of clinical disease assays when completely implemented.
