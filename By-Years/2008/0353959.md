Abdelguerfi Title: REU Site: REU in Spatio-Temporal Database Systems

This project establishes an REU site at the University of New Orleans (UNO)
focusing on research experiences for undergraduate students in spatio-temporal
database systems (STDS). This REU site will provide research internships to
undergraduates in a number of STDS applications, all of them involving modeling
of dynamic information in space and time. The specific projects include work on
a 3D spatio-temporal GIS at the University of New Orleans (UNO); a digital
geospatial mapping and analysis system at the Digital Mapping, Charting, and
Geodesy Analysis Program (DMAP) of the Naval Research Laboratory; and developing
management tools for different off-the-shelf GIS suites at the Army Corps of
Engineers-New Orleans District.

The site will support 10 students for a 10-week summer program of full-time
research, and the students will continue their research projects throughout the
academic year, meeting from time to time at UNO. In addition to the scientific
research, the project will provide the interns with training and orientation for
effective communication (presentation) skills; preparation of research papers;
computer ethics; and graduate school admissions processes.
