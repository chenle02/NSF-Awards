9458122 Arcese This work will address the ecological and evolutionary basis of
individual variation in reproductive and aggressive behavior using two long-term
observational and experimental studies of song sparrows (a North American
passerine) and oribi (an African antelope). The goals of this work include (1)
development of oribi and song sparrows as model species for research linking
fundamental issues in empirical and theoretical ecology with applied problems in
wildlife management and conservation; (2) the development and application of
fecal steroid assays for the non-invasive monitoring of reproductive condition
wild ungulates, and single-locus DNA fingerprinting for studies of the
demographic impacts of inbreeding in small populations; and (3) to use this and
related work in computer modelling to develop a new undergraduate course in
Applied Behavioral Ecology. Expected benefits of the work include the
development of a predictive framework for assessing the impacts of population
genetic structure and demography on vertebrate behavior, and the improved
application of molecular genetic and endocrinological techniques for non
invasive field research.
