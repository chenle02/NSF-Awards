This award will continue support for the operation and scientific use of the
Jicamarca Radio Observatory. Located outside Lima, Peru, Jicamarca is the
equatorial anchor of the Upper Atmospheric Facilities chain and is the aeronomy
community's main source of information about the equatorial ionosphere and upper
atmosphere. Jicamarca's capabilities as an incoherent and coherent scatter radar
observatory have expanded enormously and many scientists use these and other non
radar-related capabilities to conduct research in areas of aeronomy, plasma
physics, remote sensing, and signal processing. Jicamarca-related research is
focused on quantifying the chemistry, transport, energetics, and dynamics in the
equatorial ionosphere with radar and complementary observations, and then to
compare the results with theories and models. The investigations are grouped
into two areas: (1) understanding the stable ionosphere and (2) understanding
the instabilities that are often present. Plans for Jicamarca include the
following major upgrades: (1) the installation of eight new digital receivers,
(2) building additional receiving antenna modules, (3) finishing the
construction of an additional high power transmitter module, (4) installing
electronic beam switching, (5) adding receiving systems for each antenna
quarter, (6) improving the computer and network infrastructure, and (7) adding
more optical instrumentation. To better serve the scientific community will (1)
improve the observing modes of general use (especially standard incoherent
scatter modes) or special modes for visiting or remote users, (2) provide
observing time and collecting and archiving the data that result, (3) provide
access to the data through an intuitive and accessible database with suitable
graphics, (4) allow real-time access to the data to the greatest extent
possible, and (5) incorporate "heritage" data into the updated Madrigal
database. Jicamarca has been an effective educational tool throughout its long
association with Cornell. Cornell has been a major source of PhDs in the fields
of radio science and ionospheric physics. The research done at Jicamarca finds
its way into both graduate and undergraduate courses at Cornell, and many
students have done their PhD work at Jicamarca. There is also substantial
educational outreach to Peruvians via internships and traineeships. In addition,
Jicamarca has served as a steppingstone for many Peruvians to do PhD work in the
U.S. (including, but not limited to, Cornell) or Europe.
