Carbon electrodes are widely used in a broad range of technologies including
energy conversion, metals production, and analytical sensors. This research
project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, uses various
Raman spectroscopic probes to obtain information about the structure of carbon
electrode surfaces in various electrochemical environments. Resonance Raman
spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules is used to examine specific surface
sites. Unenhanced surface Raman spectroscopy is applied to the study of
adsorbate overlayers on the carbon surface. This structural information is
correlated with the activity and stability of these electrodes in various
applications, including microanalytical methods applications. In order to
understand the reactivity and stability of carbon electrodes widely used in
electrochemical technologies, surface structural information is essential. Raman
spectroscopic probing of the carbon electrode surface is the subject of this
research project. The structural information obtained from these studies helps
to design and modify electrodes for energy conversion and electrocatalytic and
sensor applications.
