In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Michael T. Ashby of the University
of Oklahoma will study the reaction mechanisms of sulfur species of fundamental
chemical interest that are implicated in biological antimicrobial processes. The
understanding of sulfur species reactivity under physiological conditions is
very limited, even though they are implicated in cellular damage processes. The
information gained from these studies will find application in
biological/medical fields, and such studies will also enhance fundamental
knowledge of sulfur chemistry. The PI will be involved in graduate student and
postdoctoral training and has a track record of broadening the participation of
underrepresented groups in chemistry.
