An existing spectroscopy system will be upgraded by the addition of a larger
magnet, a supplementary transmitter, and a frequency synthesizer to give high
resolution solid-state NMR measurements. This state-of-the-art custom fabricated
system will allow in-situ experiments of highly dispersed catalyst systems at
low metal loadings. The more sensitive system will afford new insights into
structures of intermediates on the surfaces of catalysts.
