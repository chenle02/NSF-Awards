A broad program of research in theoretical physics will include work on the
quantum mechanics of black holes, the implications of inflation for the global
structure of the universe, particle physics in the early universe, superstring
theory, supersymmetric phenomenology of unified theories, and high precision
phenomenology of the theory of the weak and electromagnetic forces. Black hole
physics, superstring theory, inflationary theory of the early universe, and
supersymmetric grand unified theories are at the center of efforts to push
physics to new frontiers at or near the Planck scale, an extremely high energy
where the standard notions of classical space-time are no longer applicable. At
the same time, the validity of the standard model of the weak and
electromagnetic interactions and its extensions such as supersymmetric theories
and technicolor must be checked through high precision analysis of current and
future experimental data.
