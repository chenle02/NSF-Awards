This award will support a group of 8-10 Mexican students coming to the United
States for a period of 2 months to visit leading American museums and
universities in Orinthology. The proposed visits have been organized by
Professor Frank B. Gill of the Academy of National Sciences of Philadelphia and
Professor Jorge E. Llorente of the Musio de Zodogia of the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico. The proposed visits will enable a group of Mexican students
to gather data from extensive collections of Mexican specimens not currently
available in their country and to meet potential sponsors for graduate programs
in biology in the United States. The ultimate goal is to develop ties between
the orinthology community in both countries that will be able to better utilize
the extensive collections of Mexican specimens currently available in the U.S.
and to promote greater efforts in biodiversity in Mexico.
