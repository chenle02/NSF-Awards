Fouque&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1409434&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Challenging nonlinear
problems arising naturally in the context of risk management under uncertain or
randomly fluctuating volatility and under liquidity constraints are addressed in
the first part of the project. This work has direct applications to problems
faced by practitioners in the financial industry, including pension funds
managers. The second part of the project is a study of systemic risk and
mathematical analysis of the stability (or instability) of our banking system.
The recent financial crisis has revealed a lack of understanding of the risk of
cascade of defaults in banking networks. To help assess measures of such
systemic risks, the investigator develops and analyzes new stochastic games
models of borrowing and lending among banks. A graduate student and a
postdoctoral researcher are engaged in the project each year. This project,
including its training component, contributes to the effort started by the
regulators in the recent creation of the Office of Financial Research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the first part of the project, the investigator
establishes new results in the theory of asymptotic analysis and homogenization
of nonlinear partial partial differential equations, with direct applications to
several important and practical problems in financial mathematics. These
problems include risk management under uncertain volatility, portfolio
optimization under stochastic volatility, and investment with co-integrated
assets. In the second part of the project, he studies stochastic games models of
inter-bank borrowing and lending with applications to measures of systemic risk.
New mathematical problems arise naturally; they include backward-forward
stochastic partial differential equations and stochastic games with delay. A
graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher are engaged in the project each
year.
