Undergraduate psychology students' science education is being improved by
providing computer controlled data collection stations, multiuser workstations
for data analysis, and file service for students involved in original research.
Students join ongoing research teams organized around specific research
problems, and make contributions to that area by conducting their own original
research experiments and continuing work of previous students using the research
team's data pool. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
