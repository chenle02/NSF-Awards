9508187 Rosenberger The Department of Statistics at the Pennsylvania State
University will acquire workstations and related equipment to augment its
existing network for research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will
be used for several research projects including: (1) Statistical Analysis of
High-Dimensional Data in Regression and Discrimination Problems (2) Robustness
in Random Effects Models (3) University Statistical Consulting (4) Multilevel
Models for Hierarchically Nested Event Histories (5) Observational Economy in
Ecological and Environmental Investigations These projects involve five faculty
members in the department including the Statistical Consulting Center, the
Center for Statistical Ecology and Environmental Statistics and the Center for
Multivariate Analysis. The research projects all involve the development of
fundamental statistical methodology and also have the potential for immediate
applications to the problems of society. All of these projects involve highly
computationally intensive methods and all expect to make these methods more
efficient; all require high resolution color graphics or ability to handle large
amounts of data; and all require high-speed transparent networking to make
optimal use of our computing resources and facilitate interaction between
researchers.
