Sputtered coatings of solid lubricating dichalcogenides such as MoS2 , TaS2,
and WS2 have received attention for space/high vacuum lubrication applications.
Conventionally sputtered films of these compounds have a short lifetime,
particularly for sliding contact applications. However, a significant
improvement in the adhesion of these compounds to surfaces can be obtained by
the bombardment of these films by heavy, high energy ions. The objective of the
proposed research is to study the improvement of adhesion of these films to
substrate such as sapphire, silicon nitride, zirconium oxide. and Mba tool steel
resulting from the bombardment of these films by ME ion beams.
