The purpose of this project is to investigate questioning processes during
science instruction. Data sources include audio-and, video-tapes of science
activities, interviews with students and teachers, journal entries, and student
written work. Analysis involves collaboration among elementary school teachers
and university researchers in producing narrative analyses of transcripts of
classroom conversations during science lessons. The analysis also includes
examining: a) forms and functions of questions asked by both students and
teachers; b) the nature of spontaneous questions by students; c) the nature of
spontaneous questions by teachers as adult learners in teacher education
workshops at the Exploratorium; d) structural patterns of classroom questioning;
e) uses of questions in implementing and monitoring instructional decisions; and
f) developmental differences in questioning among students in different grade
levels. Participating teachers are encouraged to conduct research on questioning
processes in their own classrooms and to share results at meetings at the
University of California at Berkeley during the academic year. The project also
provides research opportunities for undergraduates. Participation by minority
students and teachers is encouraged in all activities.
