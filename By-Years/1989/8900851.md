This award supports cooperative research on the magnetic properties of the new
high temperature superconductors to be conducted by Saul Oseroff of San Diego
State University and Manuel Tovar of the Centro Atomico at Bariloche, Argentina.
They will perform electron spin resonance (ESR), magnetic susceptibility and
specific heat measurements on doped and undoped barium copper oxide and copper
oxide superconductors where the dopants will be rare earths from praesodinium
through gadolinium. Dr. Oseroff has extensive institutional facilities
available, as well as several well-known colleagues, both of which will make
this productive work in an important and timely field. The group at Bariloche
already has considerable work under way on similar compounds and can contribute
experience in materials preparation and outstanding facilities in Argentina.
