New materials have been introduced to the construction industry for the repair
and strengthening of the deteriorating infrastructure system. One area of
particular interest has been the use of Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) to
repair and strengthen concrete and masonry structures. Unfortunately, there is
very little long-term field experience or basic research to indicate that FRP
materials used in combination with concrete and masonry will withstand the
elements as expected. The effectiveness of the FRP system relies completely on
the bond between the substrate and fabric. Concrete and masonry are porous
systems that typically exchange free moisture with the environment. This natural
free moisture movement can be interrupted by the application of an FRP system.
Another concern is the application of repair systems to the surface of corrosion
damaged concrete with no thought as to the effect on the corrosion process that
exist in the element. There is a need for training in basic corrosion science
and durability of civil engineering structures that is not addressed in
undergraduate or graduate programs. A new course will be created at the
University of Wyoming from Career support to provide training to students in
durability of structures. With funding from the Career award and using the data
gathered from research, develop an FRP repair/strengthening seminar series. The
short course has the added benefit of providing technology transfer of the
findings to the engineering community for comment and use.
