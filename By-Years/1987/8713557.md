The proposed research project will analyze the expressive and sociocultural
functions of narrative in Native American oral traditions. Specifically the
student will work with the Severn Ojibwe of northern Ontario and northeastern
Manitoba, Canada. Ojibwe is one of the most viable indigenous languages in North
America today. The project will look at the formal linguistic aspects of oral
tradition within the social context of an Ojibwe community. This study will
provide an empirical, discourse-based ethnography of one of the most
conservative Native American speech communities in North America as well as
linguistic information on a little studied group. It will also help
anthropologists and linguists understand the place of principals of organization
of oral narrative in comparison to other forms of discourse in cultural life.
