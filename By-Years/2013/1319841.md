If an Integrated Circuit (IC) is designed and fabricated in a foundry that is
outside the direct control of the (fab-less) design house, reverse engineering,
malicious circuit modification, and Intellectual Property (IP) piracy are all
possible. An attacker, anywhere in this design flow, can reverse engineer the
functionality of design, and steal and claim ownership of the IP. An
untrustworthy IC foundry may overbuild ICs and sell the excess parts in the gray
market. Rogue elements in the foundry may insert malicious circuits (hardware
Trojans) into the design without the designer's knowledge. Because of these and
similar hardware-based attacks, the semiconductor industry annually loses
billions of dollars. In this project, the investigators aim at leveraging
techniques proposed in the context of IC testing to cope with manufacturing
defects for developing defense techniques that help regain trust in electronic
chips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to society ensuing from successful
completion of this project include trustworthy electronics for healthcare,
defense, finance, transportation, and automotive applications. One of the
investigators received a grant from the US Department of Education to recruit
underrepresented minorities and women into the Electrical and Computer
Engineering PhD program at NYU-Poly. This applicant pool will be used to recruit
underrepresented minorities and women to work on this project. The investigators
routinely advise undergraduates as part of the NYU-Poly Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) program, and the NSF REU program. These undergraduate
students will be eligible to work on the present project as well. One of the
investigators has developed a graduate course on Introduction to Trustworthy
Hardware. The investigators will adapt some of these course modules for
inclusion in appropriate undergraduate courses at their institution.
