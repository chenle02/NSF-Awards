This research is focussed on the application of Ion Beam Figuring (IBF)
techniques to manufacture aspheric optical elements. IBF will be used to remove
spherical aberration and defocus. This will be accomplished in several steps. An
optical map of the element will be first obtained using phase measurement
interferometry. This will be processed by a restoration algorithm, which is to
be developed, to determine the time the ion beam source is to dwell at each
location in front of the substrate. IBF will then be performed to make the
aspheric element. This approach will remove a significant amount of uncertainty
from the process of fabrication of aspheric optics which are now almost totally
dependant on operator skill. Since these type of optics are pervasive in optical
instrumentation, this research will make a significant impact on improving the
productivity of the optic industry.
