Following publication of a magnificent volume on the diversity and biology of
palms in the world, Dr. Natalie Uhl at Cornell University and her colleagues
will continue their study of taxonomic relationships of palms, particularly
those of Madagascar. Special emphasis will be placed on anatomical
investigations of ovule and stamen diversity among palms, integrated with other
aspects of leaf, stem, flower, and fruit morphology. Collaborating with her
Cornell colleague Dr. Jeffrey Doyle, Dr. Uhl will also begin intensive molecular
investigations of variability in chloroplast DNA of select groups of palms. This
work will generate new data for determining phylogenetic relationships of palm
genera, under the likely assumption that similarity in chloroplast DNA
composition betokens close evolutionary affinity. The project provides a model
example of integrated morphological and molecular analyses of phylogeny in an
important group of tropical plants.
