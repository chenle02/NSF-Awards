This research effort will conduct measurements of primary production and grazing
on cruises to the equatorial Pacific in 1992. The basic measurement techniques
will use the stable isotope 13C to assess total carbon production and the
dilution technique to measure grazing by microzooplankton. Measurements will be
directed toward quantifying the potential for dissolved organic production by
the equatorial upwelling system and providing comparisons for the model
simulations.
