The objective of this program is to investigate nanoelectrode nanopore DNA
sequencing devices combined with a hybrid approach that measures the electrical
response of the devices to short hybridized DNA sequences. The intellectual
merit is to investigate a new approach to DNA sequencing that has a strong
theoretical basis but needs to be developed experimentally. The proposed
research will test well-developed hypotheses that DNA can be sequenced by
transverse tunneling measurements. The first hypothesis is that transverse
tunneling is sensitive to specific nucleotides and that sequences of nucleotides
can be detected in nanoelectrode tunneling devices. The second hypothesis
relaxes the need for single base resolution by using short probes that hybridize
with DNA. These labeled strands are proposed to give rise to significant
fluctuations of the tunneling current in nanopore devices. &lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts are to discover a new type of low cost DNA sequencing device
that enables new medical applications for the benefit of the general public. The
successful discovery of low cost nanodevices for DNA sequencing would be
transformative for personalized genomics by greatly expanding our ability to
study, diagnose, and treat disease. A successful outcome of the research will
have a tremendous impact on healthcare world-wide by facilitating wide-spread
DNA sequencing technology. The research will also foster outreach to the general
public to disseminate information about the potential benefits and ethical risks
of genome sequencing technology. Other broader impacts include impacts on
graduate and undergraduate education and summer outreach activities to high
school students, including underrepresented groups.
