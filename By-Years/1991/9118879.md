The central goal of this project is to determine 129I/I and 36Cl/Cl ratios in
fluids from the KTB pilot-hole (Vorbohrung). This project is a component of the
international participation in the scientific investigation of the super-deep
borehole (Hauptbohrung) of the Federal Republic of Germany. The purpose of
investigation is to contribute partially to the international efforts for a
better understanding of the petrogenesis, geochemical and isotopic evolution of
the segments of the continental crust as represented in the KTB pilot-hole. In
particular, the principal investigators will address the issues of residence
time and sources of the fluids encountered at 3.4 km depth. The objectives of
the study are in complete agreement with the scientific goals of the KTB
Hauptbohrung.
