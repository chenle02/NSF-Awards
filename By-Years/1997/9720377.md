9720377 Reiser In this 36 month project, the PIs develop an Instructional model
of reflective inquiry, including a description of the cognitive strategies that
comprise reflective activity in scientific inquire and principles for their
instruction. The project also develops software and curriculum that will enable
the investigation and evaluation of this instructional model in real-world
classrooms. The instructional model accounts for the following elements:
cognitive strategies for reflection, strategic timing and initiation of strategy
use, and beliefs that support reflection. It provides a framework for designing
supports for reflection through social structures, tools, and artifacts. The
model is used to guide the design of an inquiry-support environment called the
Progress Portfolio, which will work in conjunction with third-party
investigation software. The Progress Portfolio provides support for reflection
by giving students mechanisms for turning their work products and processes into
explicit objects for reflection. Ongoing empirical studies with the software and
curriculum will lead to improvements in the design of the software and
curriculum and refinement of the instructional model.
