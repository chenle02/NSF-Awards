Learning theory deals with the design and analysis of algorithms that learn from
data. The goal of this proposal is to extend the recent theory to reach out and
cover new areas, thus enhancing its impact and power. There are four directions
the PI's wish to pursue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A first direction examines the
question of "unsupervised" learning, i.e., learning in the absence of a teacher
who provides labels and feedback. Problems of clustering, density estimation,
information extraction etc. are instantiations that will be considered. Our
approach makes contact with ideas in geometry and topology. A second direction
considers "active learning" where input points of the data are determined in
some manner other than random sampling. This direction makes contact with
Shannon sampling theory, and parts of scientific computation. A third direction
considers "population learning" where one considers a population of learning
agents interacting with and learning from each other and studies the dynamic
evolution of such populations. This framework contains natural models for the
evolution of language in societies of linguistic agents and the evolution of
financial markets in societies of economic agents. A fourth direction examines
problems of large scale data analysis, classification, and retrieval in the
context of speech, image, and text data. Many of the algorithms developed will
be empirically&lt;br/&gt;evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will
stimulate cross fertilization between diverse fields such as linguistics,
engineering, mathematics, economics, computer science, and
statistics.&lt;br/&gt;
