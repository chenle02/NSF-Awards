This award is in support of the ANSMET (Antarctic Search for Meteorites)
program. The first goal of the project has been to locate and collect meteorites
in Antarctica, and return them for distribution to interested scientific
researchers. A second goal has been to understand how the meteorite
concentrations are related to ice-sheet dynamics. The ANSMET collection includes
many meteorites of previously unknown types and varieties; continued collection
is expected to provide many more such specimens, including new lunar samples and
others of possible martian origin. Field study of meteorite stranding surfaces
will continue, collecting information on the incompletely understood
relationship between exposed ice and the meteorite concentrations.
