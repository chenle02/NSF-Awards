This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program includes a broad survey of transition metal complexes with two
multidentate ligand systems, tropocoronands and binucleating dicarboxylates,
with the primary goal of learning how the properties of a metal ion can be tuned
by the local ligand environment. Studies of Co, Rh, Fe, Mn, V, Ti, and Zr
complexes of the tropocoronands will be performed in which variation in chain
length and stereochemistry at the metal center is expected to affect the
physical properties and reactivity at the metal center. The dicarboxylate
ligands will be studied with labile metal pairs, and the phosphate-ester
hydrolysis reactions of Zn(II), Mn(II), and Mg(II) will be examined. Among other
things, dinuclear early transition metal organometallic complexes will be
examined for their C-C bond-forming reactions, and multielectron transfer
reactions in systems with redox-active porphyrin rings will be studied. In this
work the fundamental factors controlling structure and reactivity of metal
centers bound to nitrogen and oxygen donor atoms will be explored. These atoms
are constrained by carbon atom frameworks to orientations which enhance the
reactivity at the metal center. These fundamental studies have relevance to
areas of bioinorganic chemistry, catalysis, and materials science.
