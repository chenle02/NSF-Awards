Unlike most bioinformatics data, such as DNA sequences and
protein&lt;br/&gt;structures, pathways show the interactions of different bio-
chemical&lt;br/&gt;entities. Thus, each entity or subpathway can have a function
in its&lt;br/&gt;pathway that the pathway can not realize without it.
Formulating these&lt;br/&gt;functions presents exciting computational
challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops algorithms for
efficient and accurate&lt;br/&gt;computational analysis of pathways. The first
step in achieving this&lt;br/&gt;goal is to build a mathematical model for
functions of pathways and&lt;br/&gt;subpathways. This proposal defines the
function of a subpathway as its&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the steady state of
the entire pathway. Computing this&lt;br/&gt;contribution is a difficult problem
especially for gene regulatory&lt;br/&gt;pathways. Existing methods can compute
this for metabolic pathways,&lt;br/&gt;but they do not scale to even medium
sized gene regulatory&lt;br/&gt;pathways. This proposal develops efficient
methods for computing&lt;br/&gt;function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the
subpathway that has a desired function is a challenging&lt;br/&gt;problem. There
is no clear way of searching for subpathways with&lt;br/&gt;desired functions
using existing tools. This proposal develops&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for
searching subpathways with desired function.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal takes this
one step further, and develops mathematically&lt;br/&gt;sound algorithms for
comparing two pathways so that the entities that&lt;br/&gt;map are functionally,
homologically and topologically similar. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal also explores
feature and reference-based index structures&lt;br/&gt;for biological pathway
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on the project can be found
