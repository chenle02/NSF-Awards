During the past 5 years, a tremendous growth of the wireless communications
technology has been fueled by a widespread use of cellular phone and GPS (global
positioning system). Wireless communications is a highly interdisciplinary area
that requires a coverage of subjects from communications, electromagnetics, and
digital and analog electronics. It has become apparent that the traditional
electromagnetics and communication courses are not adequate to teach the
wireless technology within one-quarter period, and a new course has been
developed. The purpose of the proposed Wireless Lab is to introduce measurement
techniques, simulations, and hardware design in the new wireless communications
course. This is implemented by creating new laboratory projects and improving
those offered in the experimental course EE400. In the new wireless
communications course, a teaching method is employed that emphasizes the
combination of theory, simulations, and hands-on experiments. *
