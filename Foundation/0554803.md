The principal investigator proposes to study questions dealing with the
algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete semigroup
and the combinatorial applications of that structure. Some of the questions,
while easy to state, are notoriously difficult. For example, is there a
nontrivial continuous homomorphism from the Stone-Cech compactification of the
positive integers to its remainder? Equivalently, is there a finite subsemigroup
of the remainder whose elements are not all idempotents? Among the applications
of this algebraic structure have been results establishing that certain infinite
matrices are image partition regular. It is hoped that progress will be made on
the difficult question of characterizing which infinite matrices are image
partition regular.

The study of the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a
discrete semigroup is important for two main reasons. First, many of the
questions that remain open are very simple to state and quite natural. Secondly,
experience has shown that information about this algebraic structure has
significant applications to the field of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory. The
first such application was the algebraic proof in 1975 by Fred Galvin and Steven
Glazer of the "Finite Sums Theorem", which asserts that whenever the positive
integers are divided into finitely many classes, one of these classes contains a
sequence and all of its sums of finitely many distinct terms. After this initial
application many other applications have been found. For example very easy
proofs of van der Waerden's Theorem (which asserts that whenever the positive
integers are divided into finitely many classes, one of these must contain
arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions) and some of its extensions have been
found. The principal investigator intends, with some of his students, to
continue the investigation of this algebraic structure and its applications.
