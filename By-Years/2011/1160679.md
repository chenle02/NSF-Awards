This project will document and revitalize the Iskonawa language, one of the 30
existing Pano languages from the Amazon. Iskonawa is almost extinct, but still
fluently spoken by a few elders and partially by some of their descendants,
totaling around 14 known speakers. There is also an Iskonawa community of around
80 members living in voluntary isolation on the border between Peru and Brazil.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the project intends to develop a high-quality
audiovisual database including lexical and textual material, testimonies, and
ethnographic information. Second, the project will train the younger members of
the Iskonawa community in re-learning the language, compiling material,
documenting it and teaching it to future generations. The knowledge gained
through the study of the Iskonawa language and culture will help to preserve a
vast legacy of cultural production in the form of songs, rituals, dances and,
mainly, oral narratives. Iskonawa represents a critical case of an indigenous
language in a rapid process of disappearing. It has not been completely
assimilated by the Shipibo-Konibo language, as linguists usually thought.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent field research (summer of 2011) has demonstrated
that Iskonawa still has an independent life of its own. Specialists in different
disciplines form the team of researchers. Their goals transcend just language
documentation and involve ethnographic compilations, community development,
language revitalization and cultural empowerment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
important feature of this project is the training and participation of both
students and native speakers in language documentation, linguistic analysis and
development of materials. The project will produce a comprehensive database in a
website that will organize the basic information about grammar, vocabulary and
the oral tradition of the Iskonawa language and people. Part of this database
will be included in a trilingual DVD (Iskonawa, Spanish, English). The project
will also contribute to the better education of international public and
Peruvian people about the richness of their linguistic and cultural diversity.
