This research project deals with modeling, analysis, design and experimental
verification of a novel tuned distributed vibration damper (TDVD) for
intelligent vibration control of structures. Recent advances is smart materials
make it possible to adjust the parameters of dampers and absorbers on-line, and
thus dramatically broaden the utility of dampers and absorbers in industrial
applications. Although much progress has been made, dampers with spatially
distributed inertia have been overlooked. Many dampers and absorbers have a
characteristic lumped mass, which limits their operation to relatively narrow
frequency bands. Since the structure to be controlled may have a wide frequency
spectrum, it is desirable to have wide-band dampers with relatively simple
configuration and realizable control algorithms. The TDVD is unique in that an
elastic bar is introduced in its configuration. The distributed inertia of the
bar enables the new damper to provide wide-band augmentation, leading to
vibration reduction by up to several orders of magnitude, compared to
conventional dampers. The major objectives of this research are to understand
the damping amplifying mechanism of the TDVD; to investigate TDVD-structure
interactions; to develop TDVD- based vibration control algorithms; and to
experimentally justify the feasibility of the TDVD in real engineering problems.
