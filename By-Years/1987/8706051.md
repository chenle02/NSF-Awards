This project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is a
continuation of studies on the design and development of fundamentally new
reactions, reagents, and strategies for organic synthesis, with an emphasis on
strategy level ring-forming methodology. New and more efficient procedures for
the total synthesis of structurally and biologically important compounds will be
provided extending understanding of fundamental structure-reactivity
relationships, reaction theory and mechanisms. The first part of this program is
directed at nickel-mediated reactions and includes studies on the stereo- and
substituent- selectivity of this reaction, its use in asymmetric synthesis,
catalyst variations and applications toward the total synthesis of
asteriscanolide, taxanes, and ophiobolanes. New reactions based on nickel are
also proposed for study. The second part of this program is directed at the
further investigation of photo- induced bis-diene cycloadditions. Stereo- and
substituent selectivities will be evaluated in connection with the above
synthetic work and a new method for cycloadduct rearrangement will be explored.
The third section of this program focuses on a continuation of studies on the
arene olefin cycloaddition, a powerful strategy level reaction which has
provided simplified solutions to numerous structural objectives. This effort
will be directed at the completion of synthesis of retigeranic acid, laurenene,
and grayanotoxin II.
