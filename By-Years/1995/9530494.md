9600311 McFadden The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit which
will support Dr. Christopher F. McFadden to work with Professor Nicholas D.
Spencer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.
This project will focus on investigating the ability of chiral adsorbed organic
species to provoke the formation of screw dislocations in a metal overlayer. The
objective is to characterize via various surface spectroscopies, the structure
of metals deposited onto chiral organic substrates. The hope is to produce
heterogeneous catalysis materials selective for the synthesis of chiral
molecules. ***
