The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology at Southern
Technical Institute will purchase an automated optical fiber analysis system.
This system will be housed in the new Fiber-Optic Communication Laboratory which
is to be part of the department's Wilder Communications Complex. The system will
provide the department's 1,100 undergraduates with state-of-the-art automated
test and measurement experience in the new technologies associated with fiber
optics. The students will use the computerized system to analyze the performance
of optical fiber waveguides, of various fiber-optic light sources and detectors,
and of entire fiber-optic communication systems. This laboratory experience will
allow the department's graduates to make immediate contributions in the
burgeoning new fiber-optic communication industry.
