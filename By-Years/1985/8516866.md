As part of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Research Program, the testing of the full-
scale six-story steel structure has now been completed. This cooperative program
included pseudo-dynamic tests of the full-scale structure, as well as several
coordinated support tests and an analysis of components and models of the
building. A number of the support studies are still in progress. This project
will thoroughly investigate, analyze, evaluate, and report the results of tests
of the full-scale structure. The results are investigated in light of current
design practice, especially from a U.S. perspective. An interim report will be
prepared within 6 months of the start of the study to quickly disseminate
general test results and conclusions. A more detailed final report will be
prepared at the end. This report will cover overall building response and the
individual member behavior. A third report will contain design implications of
the study from a practical standpoint of seismic design of steel buildings,
which will be a consensus report from all the investigators involved in this
cooperative program.
