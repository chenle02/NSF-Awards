9403851 Jensen This award supports mathematical research on problems in
differential geometry. The work focuses on Dupin hypersurfaces and deformable
surfaces in Lie Sphere geometry. Efforts will be made to determine whether or
not there exist minimal surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature in
the complex projective plane. The problems involve special submanifolds of great
interest; their solutions involve a combination of techniques arising in the
study of systems of partial differential equations combined with geometric
structures. Applications of the work may be expected in mathematical physics as
well as geometry. Differential geometry is a branch of mathematics which
combines methods of analysis with geometric motivation. The problems often
derive from those of the physical world such as would be found in studies of
relativity, turbulence, dynamical systems and chaos. ***
