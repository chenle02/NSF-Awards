9603039 Stiglich This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative project
between Dr. Jacob Stiglich, Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI), Virginia, and
Dr. Ramiro Perez Campo, Universidad Autonoma de Mejico (UNAM), Cuernavaca. They
will conduct research on coatings applied to metallic substrates by a
developmental MMI coating procedure called pulsed electrode surfacing (PES), in
order to determine its effectiveness on three environments - high stress wear,
corrosion, and oxidation. MMI will fabricate the experimental coated specimens
and the Physics Institute in UNAM will define and conduct the environmental
exposure testing and perform the primary characterization of specimens and will
evaluate the effectiveness of the coatings to withstand the test environments.
Wear problems exist in many engineering applications involving machinery and
equipment, but they have not received the same detailed attention as corrosion
problems. To solve wear problems it is first necessary to identify the
predominant wear mechanisms that have contributed to failure. MMI believes that
PES is an important, generic technology to address and alleviate not only wear,
but corrosion and elevated temperature oxidation problems as well. ***
