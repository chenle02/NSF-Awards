An extensive data base of on-site and ground based data is used to describe
various features of the electrodynamics and plasma composition in the
ionosphere. This proposal describes an effort to interpret observational
phenomenon with the aid of simple and sophisticated computer models containing
some of the basic physics of a particular phenomenon. Comparison of the
predicted and observed behavior is used as an indicator of the adequacy of the
physical description and as a confirmation of our understanding of the
phenomenon. The following features will be studied with this approach: The
scale-size dependency of electric field mapping and its effects on the expected
relationship between field and currents and particle precipitation. The effects
of winds and waves in the bottomside F-region on the generation of large scale
dynamo fields and smaller scale intermediate plasma layers. The response of the
ionosphere to large sub-auroral ion drifts with varying evolution times. *** //
