This is an interagency transfer of funds to the NASA Ames Research Center for
the participation of Dr. Francisco Valero and his colleagues in the Central
Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX). This experiment which will take place in
March 1993 is designed to test the so-called "thermostat hypothesis" which
attempts to explain how sea surface temperatures are regulated in the tropical
Pacific through cloud radiation feedback processes. Dr. Valero's group will be
responsible for obtaining and analyzing the required atmospheric solar and
infrared radiation measurements.
