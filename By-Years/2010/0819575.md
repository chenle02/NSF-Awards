This symposium brings together legal scholars and social scientists who study
the influence of legal and extra-legal variables on sentence severity. The one-
day workshop includes six sessions, producing papers that will be published in a
special issue of Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. One of those papers
examines the conditioning effects of the legacy of lynching on the relationship
between the race of defendant and length of sentence. Other papers examine the
extent to which recent reforms have affected judicial discretion in sentencing
outcomes. In terms of broader impacts, the workshop will bring together social
scientists and scholars who study law from more traditional, doctrinal
approaches. Graduate and undergraduate students will have a unique opportunity
to interact with a wide range of scholars. Finally, the workshop includes a
session at a local library, offering an opportunity for the general public to
become informed on issues in sentencing policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
