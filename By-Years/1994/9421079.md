9421079 Dickerson Bordered by two of the Earth's major industrial regions, the
North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) is one of the remote areas of the Earth most likely
impacted by air pollution. The overlying marine troposphere is also an ideal
laboratory in which to study the chemical and meteorological mechanisms leading
to the long-range transport of pollution, and the consequent perturbation of the
radiative properties and oxidizing capacity of atmosphere. The overall goal of
this work is: To understand the role of anthropogenic emissions and natural
processes in the ozone budget and oxidizing capacity of the troposphere over the
North Atlantic Ocean. The primary data set for this project will be collected in
the spring of 1996 when we conduct a carefully planned airborne experiment with
the University of Wyoming King Air supported by surface intensive experiments
and ozonesonde launches from the US east coast and Bermuda. The King Air has the
payload and range to carry the essential instruments on flight paths near fronts
and out to Bermuda. Its crew is also experienced with research in convective
conditions. This work will be supplemented with collaborative surface
measurements made on Bermuda, and in Maryland by the NOAA Air Resources
Laboratory. Detailed meteorological guidance for the field programs will be
provided by colleagues. For example, the ozonesonde launches will be triggered
by forecasts of interesting transport conditions. Flights will coordinate as far
as possible with other experiments conducted in our area at the same time. We
will work with the NOAA Aeronomy Lab and their P-3 flights to assure that
compatibility of analytical methods, and share results. We will incorporate
experimental results into global, hemispheric, and regional models to show the
large-scale impact of anthropogenic emissions. Initial model results will, in
turn, help direct the next phase of experiments.
