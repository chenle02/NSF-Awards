Biofilms are communities of microbes attached to surfaces. Interest in these
communities has been intense because of their negative impacts in drinking water
systems, in industry and in other settings. Biofilms can also be beneficial. For
example, bacteria can colonize plant roots and protect those plants from disease
causing microbes, thereby serving as an alternative to pesticides. Biofilm
forming microbes also contribute to breaking down toxic contaminants during
wastewater treatment. This research focuses on how these biofilms are formed by
an important environmental microbe called Pseudomonas fluorescens. In
particular, the project addresses how this microbe responds to environmental
signals to control the formation of biofilms, and how those environmental
signals are sensed by the bacterium to control the formation of the surface-
attached communities. The control system explored here is widely conserved among
bacterial species, so the outcomes of these studies will be broadly applicable
to a large range of important microbes. A greater understanding of these
processes will help aid in the control of biofilm communities.

Broader Impacts: The goal of this project is to better understand how microbes
control formation of biofilm communities, and through this information, we may
better manipulate microbes to promote or block their formation to the benefit of
agriculture, wastewater treatment and industrial processes. During the course of
this project, six undergraduate and/or high school students will have the
opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research projects by working in the
laboratory and presenting their work to other scientists. Information gained
through this research will be posted and discussed on a regular basis on the lab
web site (www.dartmouthbiofilm.org). Furthermore, the project leader is actively
engaged in the education of graduate and undergraduate students, and founded and
directed a program that has brought over 70 undergraduates to the Dartmouth
campus to participate in a research experience to date. A critical component of
this proposal is to help educate undergraduate, graduate and high school
students in the sciences, to help prepare these students for careers in the
sciences and to broadly communicate the findings from this work to other
scientists and the general public.
