This research will use a series of geotechnical centrifuge models to explore the
effect on geotextile reinforced constructed soil slope and soil retaining wall
stability when the backfill is silt or clay. The four point focus will be on the
effects on sloped wall stability of different batter angles; of the drainage
characteristics of the system which includes permeability of the soil, the in-
plane permeability of the geotextile, and the vertical spacing between layers of
geotextile reinforcement; of the length of reinforcement; and of the addition of
lime to the cohesive soil. The ultimate outcome will be the development of a
simple analytical tool for design of walls and slopes which are less expansive
to construct in areas where granular soils are not readily available.
