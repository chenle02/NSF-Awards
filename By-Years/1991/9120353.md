Adequate blood perfusion of the heart (coronary flow, CF) is essential for its
performance and survival and until recently it has been believed that the sole
purpose of CF is that of mass transfer; namely, to provide nutrients and remove
waste from the myocardium. However, recent evidence from our laboratory
indicates that besides the mass transfer function CF is also a stimulus for the
cardiac utilization of glucose and oxygen (metabolic effects, ME) and a stimulus
for the transmission of the electrical impulse from atria to ventricle
(dromotropic effect, DE). In addition, associated with changes of CF there are
changes in two forces that act on the blood vessel wall and consequently could
act as stimulus. These forces are distention of the vessel wall (pressure) and
frictional forces acting on the surface of the vessels (shearing). Our
preliminary results have indicated that shearing is the important stimulus.
Moreover, we reasoned that the mechanism by which shearing could have a ME and a
DE may be via deformation of cellular structure(s) on the intravascular wall
that are oriented perpendicularly to the direction of the force. Specifically,
we are concerned with the sugar-containing protein (proteoglycans) chains that
are embedded in the cell membrane blood vessels. To test this hypothesis we
decided to "clip" selectively some of these proteoglycans with enzymes; that act
as scissors removing specific protein chains. Our preliminary studies show that
removal of specific proteoglycans containing the sugar heparin caused the
stimulatory effects of shearing on ME and DE to be significantly reduced. Our
proposed studies will establish that the deformation by shearing forces of
specific endothelial proteoglycans will result in modified cardiac function
possibly by the release of chemical messengers that cause a ME and DE in the
adjacent cardiac cells. These studies will open new avenues in the understanding
of cardiac function and metabolism.
