9421933 This project is for the study of all state research and development
expenditures for Fiscal Year 1994. The project will test a model for collecting
accurate information on an annual basis. The approach described is to collect
information through close interaction with all 50 states, as well as selected
regional groups and national organizations dedicated to state issues. The
resulting network of state officials will provide guidance to the overall
research project while also collecting vital data through an extensive survey.
Battelle will analyze the data, addressing a list of questions identified in the
proposal and the course of the project concerning state research and development
expenditures. Upon completion of the project, a structure will be in place for
annual studies of state R&D activities. Also an accurate characterization of
state involvement in research and development will be prepared for distribution
to state and federal leaders in science and technology, science policy
researchers and others interested in the patterns of U. S. research and
development investment. The data and analysis will be of great value for policy
formulation, program development and program evaluation.
