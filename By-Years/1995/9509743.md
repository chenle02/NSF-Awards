9509743 Krotscheck Theoretical research will be conducted on strongly correlated
many-body systems. Existing models will be applied to experiments and
suggestions for new experiments will be made. In other areas where there are
deficiencies in existing theoretical methods, the appropriate theory will be
developed. Problems to be addressed include excitations of helium-four films and
clusters; the description of adsorbed helium-three films and droplets, and in
particular quasi-two-dimensional and layered electronic structures; and the
formulation and implementation of a theory of multiparticle-multihole
excitations analogous to the multi- phonon theory for bosons. %%% This
theoretical research will deal with the formalism and applications of systems of
many strongly interacting particles. Of particular interest are low temperature
systems such as liquid helium which exhibit quantum properties. Connection will
be made to recent experiments. ***
