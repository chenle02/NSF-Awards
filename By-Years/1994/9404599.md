The investigator and co-workers study the theory, implementation, and
applications of spectral methods on unbounded domains. The term spectral method
as used here includes not only the traditional applications involving
differential equations, but also the computation of integral transforms and
special functions. The central theme is the optimization of the accuracy of such
expansion methods by judicious parameter selection. This is accomplished either
through theoretical asymptotic analysis, or via numerical algorithms where the
analytical approach falls short. Target applications include scattering
problems, the computation of integral transforms, and nonlinear waves. The first
part of the project involves, among other things, the computer solution of
certain fundamental problems arising in quantum mechanics. The second part is
devoted to the computation of integral transforms. These formulas arise
ubiquitously in science, in areas such as viscoplasticity, geophysics, and shock
waves in diatomic chains. In industrial applications these transforms can seldom
be worked out by hand and efficient computer codes are required for their
computation. Through the use of mathematical analysis the investigator aims to
optimize the efficiency of such codes. The third part of the project involves
the computer simulation of waves arising in areas such as laser optics and
water. The challenge here is to ensure that the computer output is a true
reflection of the actual physics of the problem. The project is expected to have
an impact not only in numerical mathematics, but also in various branches of
technology and engineering such as high-performance computing, materials
science, and optical science and engineering.
