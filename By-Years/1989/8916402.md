The Taupo eruption of New Zealand (ca. A.D. 186) contains a spectacular example
of transition from plinian to ignimbrite eruptive activity. This change is
probably due to a combination of decrease in volatile content of the melt and
increase in vent size at the time of eruption. The volatile content of the magma
which produced the precursor plinian tephras is well known. This project will
determine the volatile content and volatile distribution within the ignimbrite-
producing magma by analyzing melt inclusions in phenocrysts, in order to assess
the influence of the volatile component in a plinian-ignimbrite transition.
Using ion and electron microprobe techniques it is planned to determine H2O, f,
and Cl in melt inclusions throughout the ignimbrite. Electron microprobe
analyses of major elements will help assess if inclusions have undergone
alteration. Finally, trace element analyses of bulk rock from different
stratigraphic horizons will show if volatile and trace elements were coupled or
decoupled in this magmatic system.
