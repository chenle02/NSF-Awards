This award supports the renewal of the REU site located at Idaho State
University with a focus on applied nuclear physics. Undergraduate students will
be recruited for ten weeks of summer research and will work with ISU researchers
in Accelerator, Nuclear, and Materials Science Facilities in the Idaho
Accelerator Center (IAC) and associated laboratories. Weekly lectures on
advanced topics in materials science and physics are also planned, as are
opportunities for students to improve their communication skills through
presentations on their work. Once accepted into the program, but prior to
arrival at ISU, REU students will be assigned to work in pairs with one or two
specific faculty mentors. Assignments will be based on prior student experience
and communications between students and mentors. Each pair of REU students will
spend almost all of their time working with faculty mentors on a specific
research project. A variety of social activities that allow students to explore
the area and to interact with other students are also planned.
