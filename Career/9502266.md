9502266 Silber This work is supported by a National Science Foundation Faculty
Early Career Development Award. The research component will focus on the further
development of mathematical methods of equivariant dynamical systems for
application to specific physical problems. These include hydrodynamic models of
rotating convection and of magnetoconvection, models of Josephson junction
arrays, and models applicable to combustion or solidification problems in
various two- and three- dimensional geometries. In each case, the focus is on
instabilities for which there is clear evidence that symmetry plays a central
role. An essential component of the proposed research is to compare theoretical
results, based on model- independent group theoretic/dynamical systems methods,
with those obtained by direct numerical simulation of the governing differential
equations. The education component will include course development in applied
dynamical systems at the undergraduate level, curriculum development at the
graduate level, graduate student advising, mentoring, and organizing graduate
seminars. The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early
development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers. The Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation- wide program that
provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their overall
career development. It combines in a single program the support of quality
research and education in the broadest sense and the full participation of those
traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering. This program enhances
and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development of full,
balanced academic careers which include both research and education.
