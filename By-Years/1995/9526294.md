95-26294 Cochran As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet Shoemaker-
Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Cochran proposes to analyze, model,
and archive data obtained of the event with the telescopes of the University of
Texas McDonald Observatory. In particular, Dr. Cochran and his team members,
both at the University of Texas and the University of Colorado, will analyze in
detail the infrared and CCD imaging and spectroscopy data of the fireball that
resulted from the impact of comet fragment R. Furthermore, they will examine the
data from the impacts of fragments F, U, and V for evidence of fireballs or
plumes. The goal is to determine the distribution of impact debris in the Jovian
atmosphere; the origin of the material (cometary or Jovian); the impacts'
effects on the vertical, zonal, and meridional winds in the Jovian stratosphere;
the ultimate destruction processes of the material; and the amount of
stratospheric water that accumulated over the impact sites. **
