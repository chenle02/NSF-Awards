PROPOSAL NO: 0429924&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Georgia Tech Research Corporation -
GA Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Technology&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Manolios,
Panagiotis&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: System-Level Processor Verification Using
Refinement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
proposal is to develop a formal refinement-based methodology for term-level
microprocessor verification and to apply it to complex designs. State-of-the-art
microprocessors are extremely complex and industry estimates of validation
costs, as a percentage of the engineering effort required to develop a new
product, range from 30% to as high as 70%. Even with such resources allocated to
validation, bugs are common and the trend toward more complex designs will
exacerbate the problem. Current validation efforts focus on checking low-level
properties of small components. However, it is difficult to imagine a set of
properties that captures system-level correctness, which is why the project
advocates a refinement-based approach, where the instruction set architecture is
the specification. This means that to an external observer, the processor
behaves in a fashion that is consistent with the instruction set architecture,
with respect to both safety and liveness properties. The project proposes to
develop a theory of refinement for system-level verification and to apply it to
complex term-level designs. The refinement-based approach will be part of a
design-for-verification methodology that complements the design cycle, that can
be automated in a compositional, scalable way, and that is generally applicable
across a wide spectrum of designs.&lt;br/&gt;
