9303427 Light The ability of animal cells to regulate their volume is one of the
most fundamental properties of living cells. When cells are exposed to hypotonic
solutions there is an initial increase in the volume of the cell followed by a
regulatory volume decrease (RVD) back to the original size. The mechanism by
which this process occurs is not known. This research will characterize the ion
channels involved in the RVD using the red blood cells of the mud puppy,
Necturus, which have been found to regulate their volume with the involvement of
potassium, calcium and chloride channels. %%% The ability of animal cells to
regulate their volume is one of the most fundamental properties of living cells.
The goal of this research is to characterize the role of specific ion channels
in the process of cell volume regulation. The results will not only increase our
understanding of the role of ion channels in the process of cell volume
regulation, but this research at an undergraduate institution will provide an
opportunity for undergraduates to participate in original research as a part of
their science education. ***
