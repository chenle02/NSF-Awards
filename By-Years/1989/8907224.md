In all democratic systems, policy outcomes are essentially the product of
coalition formation and bargaining within the legislature. After a flurry of
basic research on these topics in the 1960's and early 1970's, there has been
very little progress in our understanding of the phenomena. However, recent
analytical advances in theory have opened up new avenues for productive
research. This research focuses on two logically distinct issues. The first
concerns the role of uncertainty in legislative bargaining among parties in
parliamentary democracies. In earlier work, the investigators explored the
consequences of a particular type of bargaining institution when no party in a
three-party legislature held a majority of seats. In this institution, the
researchers assumed that the largest party was given the first opportunity to
form a coalition government, proposing a policy to implement and a distribution
of portfolios. If this party failed, then the next largest party was offered a
similar opportunity, and so on. The researchers discovered that if there was no
uncertainty about parties' objectives and relative evaluations of policy and
portfolio, then the largest party would always form a coalition government
successfully with the smallest party. Evidently, this does not always happen.
One natural way to develop the model further, one which offers the possibility
of predicting a richer set of legislative outcomes, is to make the more
realistic assumption that not all facets of a party's objectives are known for
sure by every other party. This development is the first issue that the
investigators are studying under this award. The second issue concerns the role
of portfolios in legislative outcomes. In the above referenced work,
"portfolios" were characterized simply as perqs of office. Because the
investigators assumed that policies had a very simple structure (viz. points on
a line), this characterization was sensible. However, real policies are complex
and portfolios are essentially allocations of rights and responsibilities for
choosing certain aspects of overall policy. Recognizing this, the researchers
are studying the strategic properties of a variety of institutions for
determining how portfolios are allocated in coalition governments, and what
policies they subsequently generate. Preliminary work already reveals that
minority governments can occur and be stable under such institutions: hitherto,
finding a theoretical model that can predict minority governments has proved
elusive.
