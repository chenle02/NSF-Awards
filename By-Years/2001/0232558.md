This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will investigate the
feasibility of generating electricity from existing fires in abandoned coal
mines and waste banks. These can be high temperature fires (charted in excess of
1,200 degrees Fahrenheit) that have been burning for decades and will continue
to burn long into the future. There are currently over 600 fires associated with
past coal mining activity. Millions of dollars have been spent trying to
extinguish these fires only to find that there is no practical and cost
effective solution. We will drill into burning coal seams and install a thermal
extraction system that would tap into these unutilized heat sources and in turn,
convert these otherwise wasted energies into a useful product commercially
viable electricity. This research may lead to the construction of commercial
power plants at sites now regarded as unproductive liabilities. The generally
shallow depths and high temperatures of these fires lead to the belief that
commercially competitive power plants can be built and operated at these sites.
These factors, as well as others, should lead to lower costs in construction and
in higher efficiencies of the power plants as compared to already proven power
plants in the geothermal industry.
