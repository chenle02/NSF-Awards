The PI's overarching goal is to investigate short-term Arctic climate
predictability and to improve understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to
short-term Arctic climate variability. Coupled interactions involving sea ice
are her chief focus. New ocean and sea ice state estimates that assimilate both
ocean and sea ice observations make it possible for the first time to properly
initialize fully coupled climate models to investigate short-term Arctic climate
forecasts. A few climate models, including the Community Climate System Model,
appear capable of high quality simulations of Arctic climate and should be good
candidates for such an activity: She proposes to validate predictability of
short-term Arctic climate forecasts using an ensemble forecast with the new
CCSM4. She will investigate methods to produce Arctic seasonal to interannual
forecasts. She will produce short-term probability forecasts of the Arctic sea
ice and climate system by the end of the project. Since many of the same sea ice
physical processes of fundamental importance for climate change time scales are
also key to short-term forecasts, she will use understanding gained about the
model from short-term predictions, which are more easily verifiable, to
interpret projections of future greenhouse warming climate change.
