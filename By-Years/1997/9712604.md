Abstract 9712604 R.H. Davis, U. of Colorado - Boulder The effect of particle
roughness on particle-particle interactions in suspension flow will be
experimentally and theretically investigated, including the visualization and
analysis of particle collisions. The study includes observation of particle
contact and rebound by using microvideo photography, development of models of
the contact forces and torques that can be subsequently employed to predict
particle motions and flow microstructures, and formulation of a theoretical
framework to study the flows with particle-particle contacts. The project has
relevance to particle and multiphase processes in industry and environment, and
deals with a key research issue in suspension flow that has not yet received
proper attention. ***
