The proposed research includes several interconnected areas of activity. First
among them is the continuing developments of a general stabilized finite element
method for incompressible fluid flows in the presence of moving boundaries, with
particular emphasis on free surface and two-phase flows. The method is based on
a stabilized space-time formulation, and is capable of handling large
deformations of the domain. The velocity- pressure-stress formulation will be
developed in parallel. It is a novel stabilized formulation for incompressible
flows which is applicable to viscoelastic fluids. This research area will be
merged into the space-time method development, to allow for numerical treatment
of viscoelastic fluids in the presence of moving boundaries. Proposed finite
element formulations result in large linear systems of equations. These systems
will be solved implicitly using a GMRES iterative method. To improve the rate of
convergence, efficient preconditioning techniques will be designed and test.
Among others, techniques combining the Clustered Element-By-Element and
Multigrid approaches will be examined. All implementation work will concentrate
on massively parallel architectures.
