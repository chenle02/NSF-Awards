Consistent with the National Science Foundation's goal "to initiate and support
... programs to strengthen scientific and engineering research potential [and]
science and engineering education programs at all levels", this project develops
materials that will support education and broad awareness of the importance of
key engineering advances . In particular, it will support creation of
educational films and corresponding lesson materials for K-12 mathematics and
science teachers that will allow students to be exposed not just to the advances
in information theory, but also to how an ordinary person played a pivotal role
in fostering them. By adapting material previously restricted to graduate-level
courses and technical conferences to a larger audience, a broader dissemination
of information theory should profitably inform teachers and researchers in other
fields, thereby fueling the nation's STEM workforce and improving commercial
technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the efforts and
advances of Claude Shannon, who established the field of information theory by
stating some of its most fundamental problems and solving them. The technologies
that his work made possible form a major driving force of our economy. His
information theory concepts provide the foundation for nearly every aspect of
modern information technology and have been applied to many fields, including
communication, language, genetics, computing, cryptography, psychology,
perception, memory, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, and others.
