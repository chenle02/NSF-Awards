I propose to work on p-adic interpolation of modular eigenforms, and on
statistical issues in arithmetic arising from, for example, the recent advances
in the conjecture of Sato-Tate; I will continue a long-range project, joint with
Karl Rubin, to study Selmer groups; recently we have been applying our work in
various directions. For example, to obtain some results in mathematical logic
(we show that a piece of the classical Shafarevich-Tate Conjecture implies that
Hilbert's Tenth Problem phrased for any commutative ring of in&#64257;nite
cardinality that is &#64257;nitely generated over the ring of rational integers
has a negative answer) and to resolve a conjecture of Darmon regarding a
re&#64257;ned form of the classical ''analytic formula'' for the &#64257;rst
derivative at zero of a Dirichlet L-function, and to study the proportions, in a
family of quadratic twists, of the elliptic curves with 2-Selmer rank equal to a
given number. Our goal is to make advances in each of these directions.

The broader issues that are the focus of the aspects of my proposal described
above are the classical ones: determining the structure of solutions to
polynomial equations; of delineating arithmetic problems that admit of no
algorithmic solution; and studying the statistical features of data important to
the study of arithmetic.
