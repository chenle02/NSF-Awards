At the heart of the research components of this project are homological objects
with group actions, which arise in a wide range of areas of application,
including biology, chemistry, algebraic topology and geometry, optimization, and
physics, among others. The project involves the development of a host of new
tools to express geometric properties algebraically, via certain families of
matrices with polynomial entries. The education and broader impacts portions
integrate with these projects through work with undergraduate and graduate
students, as well as postdocs. The PI will also continue involvement in several
mentoring initiatives, including the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education
(EDGE) Program, Math Alliance, and Minnesota's Women in Math program;
organization of regional and international conferences organization; and
software development and distribution for the open source computer algebra
system Macaulay2.

The research components of this project seek to establish a foundational
framework for each of the following: (1) free complexes corresponding to line
bundle resolutions of sheaves on smooth toric varieties, (2) resolutions of
certain equivariant sheaves via vector bundles over smooth toric varieties, (3)
arrangements of hyperplanes, and (4) rings of differential operators for toric
face rings. More specifically the research includes (respectively): (1)
constructing an explicit vector bundle resolution of the diagonal for smooth
toric varieties, which will yield an analogue of the celebrated Hilbert Syzygy
Theorem, (2) resolutions of certain equivariant sheaves via vector bundles over
smooth toric varieties, (3) A-hypergeometric polynomials in prime
characteristic, and (4) rings of differential operators for toric face rings.
The research will yield a host of new tools that will shed light on the
underlying geometry and group actions by aiding the computation of important
algebro-geometric and PDE invariants.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
