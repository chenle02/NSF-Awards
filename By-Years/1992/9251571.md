Digital technology has revolutionized the way scientists approach the
measurement and the analysis of experimental data. Today's laboratory
instruments are capable of digitizing complex detector responses, produce
instant numerical readouts, and transfer the information to a computer for
further processing and permanent storage. Once loaded into a computer, these
datafiles can be accurately compared to theoretical expectations with relative
ease using commonly available commercial software. While such procedures are
currently the norm in most research or industrial laboratories, they are often
ignored in introductory physics laboratories where many aspiring science
students gain their first and often last chance to study experimental methods in
the physical sciences. This project is modifying an existing set of
undergraduate laboratory experiments involving analog oscilloscopes, commonly
performed at most institutions, to include an introduction to digital technology
and computer data analysis. The project is being implemented with the
acquisition of analog/digital oscilloscopes, IBM compatible personal computers,
and commonly available scientific software for these computers.
