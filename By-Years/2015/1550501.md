This award provides funds for an early career development exercise using the
Human Occupied Vehicle Alvin. The training will include a series of half-day,
mini-courses on various aspects of Alvin dive operations, cruise planning and
execution, and strategies for crafting successful Alvin proposals. The mini-
courses will allow participants to explore how their specific research
objectives can be accomplished with Alvin.&lt;br/&gt;Participants will each have
an opportunity take part in a half-day simulated Alvin dive. These 'dives' will
take place in the Alvin hanger, but in many respects will simulate the
experience of a dive. In particular, participants will gain an appreciation for
the field of view from the submersible, the time it takes to conduct
manipulations for sampling and sensor/experiment deployment, and the
responsibilities of dive participants for recording data and interacting with
the pilots. Dives will last 3-4h and allow the participants to gain a deeper
understanding of how to execute mission-specific goals with Alvin.&lt;br/&gt;The
primary goal of the training is to provide new Alvin users with an opportunity
to learn about the operation of the sub in the context of their research
objectives. The PI will produce documentation from mini-courses to be published
on the DeSSC and NDSF websites so that others who are not able to attend can
benefit. Attendees will provide an evaluation of the workshop including: size
and structure, topical foci of the mini-courses, simulated dive experience, and
instructor effectiveness. The results of these evaluations will be synthesized
in a short document to circulate at UNOLS, DeSSC, NSF, and NDSF for the benefit
of future training exercises.
