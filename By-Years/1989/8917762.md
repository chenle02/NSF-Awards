This is a project to map a section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the South
Atlantic and is designed to answer fundamental questions and to test hypothese
central to understanding of a slow to intermediate spreading rate ridge system
in the South Atlantic. The questions to be addreses include: 1) What is the
segmentation geometry of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the South Atlantic and what
is the relative abundance of first and second order discontinuities? 2) How does
the segmentation geometry observed along a representative length of ridge
compare with the early segmentation character of the South Atlantic in terms of
the distribution of first and second order discontinuities? 3) What are the
structual and kinematic characteristics associated with a change in plate
boundary geometry and the creation of a second-order discontinuity? 4) What are
the strutural and morphologic characteristics associated with the trnsfromation
of a first-order discontinuity to a second-order discontinuity and what is the
age of the offset when the boundary no longer behaves rigily? 5) What are the
morphotectonic characteristics associated with evolution of a second-order
discontinuity to a third-order discontinuity? 6) What is the distribution of
rifted and non- rifted ridge segments along the MAR between 22S and 34S?
