9632094 Reisman This proposal involves a number of senior undergraduate design
projects targeted at aiding the disabled. Through their work, the students will
design and implement new technologies, fulfill academic requirements, and
produce a usable device. The target population, or consumers, includes
individuals with spinal cord injuries, stroke survivors, individuals with
sensory or neurologic deficiency, and geriatric individuals. The work will be
performed in conjunction with the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West
Orange, New Jersey. The primary objective of the proposed projects is to
increase safety and independence for their consumers. The devices produced will
be designed with particular attention to affordability, reliability and
portability. More specifically, the projects will address problems in personal
hygiene (e.g., feeding, dressing and toileting), and difficulties in verbal,
written and telephone communication. The projects will also include devices for
handling money and credit cards when driving, page turning and accessing laptop
computers. ***
