This research encompasses five topics aimed at the development of better
working tools for the analysis of multivariate data: (1) Procedures for subset
selection and evaluation in regression, (2) A new and better procedure for
fitting nonlinear-nonparametric additive models through transformations of the
predicted and the predictor variables, (3) Global nonlinear optimization
methods, (4) Prototype analysis algorithms, and (5) Nonlinear smoothing methods.
This research is in the statistical area of regression. Data analytic tools are
extended following a significant step beyond traditional general linear models
that was made practically feasible with the availability of cheap computational
horsepower.
