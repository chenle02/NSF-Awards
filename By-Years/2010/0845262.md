The embedding of positioning capabilities (e.g., GPS) in mobile devices
facilitates the emergence of location-based services (LBS), which is considered
as the next "killer" application in the wireless data market. Location-based
services allow clients to query an LBS provider in a ubiquitous manner, in order
to retrieve detailed information about points of interest (POIs) in their
vicinity. However, for such applications to succeed, privacy and trust are
essential. To this end, this project will focus on two separate tracks. First,
due to the increasing popularity of the database outsourcing model, the LBS
provider may not be the real owner of the data. Consequently, it must prove to
the client that (i) the data originated from the data owner (authenticity) and
(ii) the result set is correct and complete (integrity). In this project, the PI
will address the above issues, and design efficient algorithms, based on digital
signatures and public-key cryptography, for authenticating several types of
spatial queries in outsourced databases.

Second, similar to every other online activity (e.g., web surfing, online
purchases, etc.), location-dependent queries may disclose sensitive information
about an individual's health, lifestyle, habits, political/religious
affiliations, etc. Therefore, hiding the client's location from the LBS provider
is of paramount importance for building private mobile computing applications.
The PI will utilize the theoretical work on Private Information Retrieval (PIR)
to design efficient algorithms that support a wide range of private location-
dependent queries. The results of this research will be applied to the effective
teaching of both undergraduate and graduate students, by (i) creating new
courses on database security, and (ii) involving undergraduate and
underrepresented students in research through a number of projects.
