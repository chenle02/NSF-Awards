The past decade has witnessed tremendous advances in computing, wired and
wireless communication and storage technologies. It is also important that
remarkable cost reductions have made large computing and storage capacity
increasingly available. Many networks are integrated into the world's largest IT
(Information Technology) infrastructure called the Internet. With the
unprecedented connectivity provided by Internet, a huge amount digital data has
been created and made available. Storage for the huge amount of data being
generated has become a significant challenge. At the same time, more data types
like audio and video are converted into digital format and data in various types
needs to be preserved for a very long term (beyond 100 years). Thus, we are
indeed in a big data era.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The big data problem is
currently faced by not only individuals, but also by almost all segments of the
society, including professional groups, research communities, companies and
government. In this project to address the challenges of storing and accessing
big data, the plan is to investigate new and efficient ways of using a promising
technology called Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) for storing large volumes of
data in magnetic disk drives (called Shingled Write Disks). SMR based drives are
a promising technology that may answer the storage demand of big data. Since the
benefits of SMR come from overlapping tracks during writes, it is important to
investigate novel uses to reduce the potential write amplification when updates
of data are performed. The project plan is to develop both novel layout designs
that can reduce write amplification and specialized file systems that can enable
applications to use such a device without any modifications, as well as, novel
ways of efficiently supporting tree and graph based data structures on SMR
drives for many big data related applications. The successful completion of this
work will provide a new type of storage devices meeting the demand of big data.
