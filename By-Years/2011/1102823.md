Abstract This project examines how different types of labor organizations
respond to political opportunities in times of an economic downturn. How do
labor unions react to economic crisis? In what ways do unions change their
strategy in response to recessions, such as the recession of 2008 or the Great
Depression of 1929? What is the relationship between organizational traits, such
as the credential of labor leaders or the type of management hierarchy, and
changes in unions' response to economic crisis? Political opportunity theory
suggests that social movement organizations will increase political action,
while business cycle theory predicts that economic crisis will be detrimental to
unions, reducing membership and power. As a case in point, this dissertation
compares different types of labor unions during the Great Depression and the
economic crisis of 2008 and, in the process, creates a dataset on the political,
economic, and organizational activity of 30 labor unions both before and after
the onset of the crisis of 2008. Researchers will collect and code data on
political activity, organizing activity, organizational characteristics, and
alliances from constitutions, convention proceedings, and other union records
located at the Kheel Center Archives in Ithaca, NY, University of Washington
libraries, union websites, and the Office of Labor-Management Standards.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in four areas. First, it considers
the range of possible activities, from conventional lobbying to radical actions,
allowing for more nuanced findings. Second, focusing on organizational
characteristics enables us to determine which organizational characteristics
make unions more likely to take advantage of political opportunities. Third,
comparing labor union activities in response to crisis with activities before
the crisis began, allows for longitudinal analysis of tactical changes. Finally,
the project extends research on business cycles by recording responses of labor
unions to declining economic conditions.

Broader Impacts First, the project will produce a dataset on 30 labor unions
from 2005-2010 using detailed organizational, financial, and political
variables. Second, undergraduate coders will receive a valuable educational
opportunity to learn hands-on research skills and experience a research project
in progress. Third, the findings may further our understanding how organized
labor, and interest groups more generally, affect work place conditions and
policies.
