9711300 Bingham This project is to investigate how ocean water characteristics
varied from year to year during the WOCE Pacific field program. This will be
done using a variety of existing datasets, including repeat hydrography and
other regional hydrographic surveys. The data will be analyzed for spatial and
temporal scales of water- mass variability in the region. The ultimate goal of
the project is to help place the WOCE observations into the context of a highly
variable region of the ocean.
