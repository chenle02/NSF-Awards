Abstract OPP-9423329 This project takes a novel approach to observing and
understanding zooplankton patch dynamics, supported by recent developments in
both theory and instrumentation. The species for this research project are the
northern boreal euphasiids Thysanoessa raschii, T. inermis and Meganyctiphanes
norvegica. These are ideal subject organisms for this study, because much is
already known regarding their basic physiology and ecology. Strong diel and
seasonal changes in their physiological activity are expected to provide
measurable differences in both metabolism and aggregation behavior. The ability
to measure such significant differences is important, because the research
emphasizes observations of metabolism, using a novel application of bioacoustic
technology. This project will explore a new application of the acoustic Doppler
current profiler (ADCP), using measurements of Doppler spectral broadening to
quantify locomotory activities of these euphasiids in situ. The relationship
between locomotion and respiratory metabolism, which is well established for
other euphasiid species, will be measured for the three species in the proposed
study area of Balsfjorden, northern Norway. This research will provide an
assessment of a new, non-invasive method for measuring the in situ metabolic
state of macrozooplankton. The results will lead to a better understanding of
how locomotory behavior, per se, influences patterns of patch formation,
maintenance and dissipation. These findings will be interpreted within the
framework of a mew model that describes patch dynamical processes in terms of
statistical mechanics. It is expected that new basic knowledge will be added to
the understanding of aggregation behavior of the three species of euphasiids
that play a central role in Arctic ecosystems.
