Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The trusted processor model is a promising model
for designing highly secure systems. However there are several drawbacks that
limit its application as a highly trusted computing base.This CAREER project
will address these drawbacks in a compilation and language framework to fill the
gap between a secure application developer and the secure processor for the
provision of a programming environment with high efficiency, usability and
security. The successful development of the proposed research will greatly
impact the design and implementation of system level security
protection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Imapct&lt;br/&gt;The educational
component of this proposal will be integrated in institutional efforts of
curriculum development, and will have an extendeded impact nationwide on
education in system security. Eventually, wide adoption of the trusted process
model for developing high performance secure applications will hopefully take
effect.&lt;br/&gt;
