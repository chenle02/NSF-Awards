The primary objective of this Dissertation Improvement Award is to study the
facial skeleton in a group of early Miocene primates from Africa and Saudi
Arabia. The group, the proconsulids, will be compared to early catarrhines and
living anthropoids and the study will cover the 24 million years of our history.
It will allow the refined use of facial characteristics for testing of
proconsulid phylogenetic relationships. A series of metric and non-metric
characteristics will be employed and a diagnostic characters of each group will
be determined. This research will add to our understanding of the evolutionary
relationships of the proconsulids and add to the utility of facial
characteristics in phylogenetic studies.
