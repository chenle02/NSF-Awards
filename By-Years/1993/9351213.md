9351213 Elbert A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with an energy-dispersive
spectrometer (EDS) is being used in the Geology Department. This equipment is
bringing modern imaging and mineral analysis capabilities to the department
enabling curricular modernization in the petrology, mineralogy, geochemistry,
and introductory courses in the major program; enhancement of a new course for
non-geology, science majors; and improvement of the senior-research program.
This modernization is providing students an opportunity to work with the most
common analytical method used in modern petrologic and mineralogical research.
Ready access to a high-powered instrument in their course work is encouraging
students to pursue ideas, investigate their own hypotheses, think for
themselves, and discover new principles, processes which parallel the
fundamental methodology of creative science. ***y
