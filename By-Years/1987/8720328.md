We propose to continue our studies of earthquake fault behavior initiated two
years ago. Our project interprets geodetic data from routinely monitored
networks and special surveys near active earthquake fault regions. The goal of
our project is to develop quantitative pictures of coseismic and postseismic
strain accumulation and release. To do this we employ newly developed techniques
which invert geodetic elevation changes, triangulation measurements and tide
guage observations, to recover the location and intensity of slip on shallow
earthquake faults. Our new mathematical tools for computing the surface
deformation due to non-uniform slip on curved surfaces can reveal the
distribution of coseismic slip and interseismic creep with detail far greater
than previously possible. With extended funding, our program will continue to
provide both theoretical foundations and practical rewards regarding the
earthquake cycle and illuminate currently unresolved aspects of earthquake fault
movements.
