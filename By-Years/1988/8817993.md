This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program provides support for the continuing
research of Dr. William Dolbier of the University of Florida. The thrust of the
research is the study of the unique kinetic and thermodynamic effects of
fluorine substituents on the mechanisms of thermal homolytic and pericyclic
reactions. Experiments have been designed which will provide a fundamental
understanding of the origin of the previously observed dramatic substituent
effects. Included are experiments designed to test the influence of substituent
mass upon the rotational component imparted during carbon-carbon bond cleavage
and a test of the feasibility of tuning the thermodynamics of electrocyclic
equilibria. Innovative mechanistic probes such as high pressure techniques,
kinetic isotope effects, stereochemical probes, solvent effect studies and
correlation of theory with experiment will be employed to study the mechanisms
of electrocyclic reactions, (2+2), (2+4) and 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions and a
number of reactions involving homolytic formation of diradicals.
