This workshop will bring together outstanding scholars from engineering, the
social sciences, and mathematics to probe the future of infrastructure research.
The workshop will view infrastructure systems as large complex networks that are
conglomerates of traditional physical infrastructure (road, telecommunications,
water, and energy) networks and social networks. Such complex infrastructure
networks will not only be considered as topics of scholarly inquiry but also as
cornerstones of national, regional and metropolitan economic viability, quality
of life, sustainability, and social justice relied upon by every citizen. The
workshop will extend over a three day period, be recorded by professional audio-
visual engineers, and streamed live to the entire NSF community. The workshop
will explore: (1) alternative notions of sustainability and resilience for
complex infrastructure networks; (2) new modeling and computational innovations
that make possible the qualitative and numerical study of very large-scale
complex infrastructure networks; and (3) integration of modern social network
models with traditional network flow models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, this research will create mathematical tools to help engineers
better design and operate infrastructure networks, such as the road network or
the electric power grid of a metropolitan region. More specifically, this
research effort will employ new ideas from a branch of complexity science called
"network science", which describes the evolution of networks, including social
networks, over time. The critical step in applying network science to real,
physical networks is to blend the tried and true methods of designing and
evaluating infrastructure, with new insights into social networks. This
integration of the old with the new makes network users both clients and sources
of information about the status of a road network, or for that matter any
infrastructure network.
