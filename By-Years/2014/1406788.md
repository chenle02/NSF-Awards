String theory, a branch of physics, predicts that the building blocks of
spacetime (which is the fabric of the universe) are certain geometric objects
called Calabi-Yau manifolds. The PI will focus on the investigation of the
geometric properties of these spaces, mainly by computing important invariants
associated to them, called Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. Both
Gromov-Witten (GW) and Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theories are inspired by
theoretical physics and involve several mathematical subjects, including
geometry, topology, algebra, combinatorics, and representation theory. The
principal investigator will continue his research on the curious conjectural
correspondences between GW and DT theories and will try to discover their links
to these branches of mathematics and physics. The investigator plans to use the
framework provided by these disciplines to create and teach courses for and
mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as
postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the principal
investigator will investigate the DT invariants of 2-dimensional sheaves in
Calabi-Yau threefolds inspired by "M5-brane elliptic genera" and "BPS invariants
of D4-D2-D0 systems" studied by string theorists. The PI plans to prove 1) the
modularity of these DT invariants and 2) find their relation to the "BPS
invariants of D6-D2-D0 systems" predicted from dualities in string theory. The
latter BPS invariants are manifested in DT invariants of 1-dimensional sheaves
as well as in GW invariants. The PI also plans to develop an algorithm for
computing the rank 2 DT invariants of toric threefolds and then study their
properties. This is known as the "Topological Vertex Algorithm" and has been a
very powerful tool for computing GW and rank 1 DT invariants of the toric
threefolds. The advanced tools that will be employed for these projects are
localization, deformation, degeneration, categorification, wall-crossing, and
mirror symmetry techniques.
