The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is empowering the 68 million U.S. natural gas
consumers and their transaction managers and partners to access transaction
status in real time, enjoy continuous control of their transactions, settle
transactions in time scales less than the industryâ€™s current monthly accounting
cycle, and enjoy heightened levels of security. The United States natural gas
industry has operated in its present physical form for more than a century, and
over the past four decades the industry has evolved through various policy and
regulatory actions to open transaction participation to thousands of parties. In
other industries, the past two decades have introduced digital capabilities that
share transaction information and automate select functions, but these
developments have not enjoyed infusion in natural gas transaction management
processes. The proposed solution will serve as a platform for industry
innovation by multiple parties, reducing transaction cost and increasing speed.
This innovation will have applications in other industries characterized by
complex, multi-party transactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II
project proposes to advance blockchain innovations and related technologies to
transform complex natural gas utility transaction management processes across
production, transmission, distribution and consumption functions. The proposed
solution will accelerate the development of third-generation smart contracting
frameworks with user-friendly/interactive human-machine-interfaces (HMI) and
predictive and interactive smart contracting functionalities based on artificial
intelligence, and with advanced cybersecurity
measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
