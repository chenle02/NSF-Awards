Emmanuel Candes, a mathematician at the California Institute of Technology, has
been selected to receive the National Science Board's prestigious Alan T.
Waterman Award. The board cited Candes' development of new mathematical tools
that allow efficient digital representation of wave signals, together with his
discovery of new methods to translate analog data into a cleaner, tighter
digital form--work that promises to improve the digital processing of signals in
a vast array of modern technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the advent of
digital technologies, translating analog information faithfully into digital
representations has been a major challenge. The translating method, called
sampling, must select enough information from the analog object to adequately
reproduce it in digital form. Otherwise, key information may be
lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, Candes developed a new sampling mechanism
that allows the faithful recovery of signals and images from far fewer data bits
than traditional methods use. This new sampling theory may come to underlie
protocols that sample and compress data simultaneously and much faster. "In
practice," Candes said, "this means one could obtain super-resolved signals from
just a few sensors."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual Waterman award recognizes
an outstanding young researcher in any field of science or engineering supported
by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Candidates may not be more than 35
years old, or seven years beyond receiving a doctorate. In addition to a medal,
the awardee receives a grant of $500,000 over a 3-year period for scientific
research or advanced study in the mathematical, physical, medical, biological,
engineering, social, or other sciences at the institution of the recipient's
choice.&lt;br/&gt;
