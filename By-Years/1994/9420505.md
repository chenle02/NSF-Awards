ABSTRACT 9503226 Giovanelli, Riccardo Dr. Giovanelli will carry out a program of
spectroscopic and photometric observations that will refine our understanding of
the distribution of light and dark matter in the Universe, provide a reference
frame in the determination of large scale deviations from Hubble flow, and
improve the dynamical definition of nearby to intermediate redshift clusters of
galaxies. The results should also clarify the current limitations of the
redshift-independent methods of measuring extragalactic distances. ***
