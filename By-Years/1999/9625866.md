96625866 Horwitz We seek to replicate, document, and study an informal
educational experiment, performed last year, that successfully taught Einstein's
Special Theory of Relativity to largely minority students at an inner-city high
school. Although the students had very little knowledge of mathematics and
physics, the approach adopted was similar in all respects to that pioneered with
second- year physics students at an excellent suburban school during a previous
NSF-supported project. The results, too, were similar-a striking finding given
the disparity in preparation of the two student populations. This indicates that
the use of advanced educational technology, coupled with research-based
pedagogy, may have an even more dramatic effect in inner-city schools than in
the suburban ones in which it has traditionally been applied. The aim of the
proposed project is to acquire and communicate hard evidence bearing on this
conclusion. ***
