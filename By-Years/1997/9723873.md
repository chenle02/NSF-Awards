This project will investigate the application of geographic information science
concepts and methods to the modeling and analysis of genome data. The primary
objective of the research is to develop a data model for genomes that supports
the graphical exploration of the higher order spatial arrangement of genome
features through spatial queries and spatial data analysis tools. The spatial
genome model formalizes topological and order relationships among genome
features (before, after, overlap), uses metric properties to refine spatial
topologies, and includes representations of features that have uncertain metric
properties. The genome spatial model enhances the integrative and comparative
potential of genome data by providing the foundation for more powerful spatial
reasoning and inferences than can be achieved by data models that incorporate
only a small subset of possible temporal-spatial relationships among genome
features (e.g. order and distance). The research represents a logical extension
from current "feature by feature" analytical approaches of genome studies to one
that allows biologists to ask questions about the contextual and organizational
significance of the spatial arrangement of genome features. These functional
capabilities should, in turn, aid in the automation of repetitive analytical
tasks associated with the mapping of genome features and drive the discovery of
biologically significant aspects of genome organization and function.
