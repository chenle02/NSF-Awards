Several problems in probability theory will be studied. The first is the
question of uniqueness for diffusions on fractals. For infinitely ramified
fractals such as the Sierpinski carpet it is not yet known whether all possible
constructions of Brownian motion whose state space is the fractal lead to the
same process. This problem has applications to mathematical physics. Another
concerns applying probabilistic techniques to the hot spots problem, a difficult
problem in analysis. The hot spots problem is to determine where the solution to
the heat equation with reflecting boundaries takes its maximum. A third problem
is the estimation of the heat kernel, a problem that is related to partial
differential equations. The heat equation for elliptic operators in divergence
form has a fundamental solution that is comparable to that for the Laplacian. Is
this true when the state space is not Euclidean space, but rather a more general
manifold? Several problems in probability theory will be studied. They are all
related to analysis and partial differential equations, in particular, to the
heat equation. The heat equation governs the flow of heat as well as many other
physical quantities. Interestingly enough, the study of random processes such as
Brownian motion, can shed a great deal of light on the solutions of the heat
equation in various media.
