9552931 Schiller Temple University will initiate a 4-week, commuter Young
Scholars project to serve forty entering ninth graders of high potential from
inner-city schools of Philadelphia during the summers of 1996 and 1997. The
disciplinary focus is mathematics with a particular emphasis on discrete
mathematics, using computers and graphing calculators as tools in the analysis
and solution of problems. The activities planned will include individual and
group work, group research projects, field trips, and interaction with student
role models, mentors, and professionals in mathematics-related areas. The
participants will be involved in ten academic-year follow-up meetings during
which they will present their research and explore other problems.
