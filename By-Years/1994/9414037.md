9414037 Zita The rapidly oscillating peculiar A stars, known as roAp stars,
exhibit small amplitude brightness variations with periods of minutes or tens of
minutes. While this behavior is similar to the p-mode oscillations observed in
the sun, a different excitation mechanism must be involved. The PI suggests that
magnetic fluctuations are a strong possibility. She has shown that the
conditions in the envelopes of the roAp stars are suitable for this mechanism.
With the support of this Research Planning Grant she will establish the initial
and boundary conditions needed to model the dynamics of the roAp star envelopes
and produce some test models. ***
