In the history of technology, nothing is more mysterious yet more central than
the act of invention. Technological historians, however, have yet to develop a
precise interpretation of how an inventor identifies an opportunity, develops a
new idea, and manifests it in a physical device. In response to this conceptual
lacuna, Dr. Carlson and Dr. Gorman are studying invention as an intellectual or
cognitive process. To do so, they will examine the invention and development of
the telephone from 1870 to 1880. They will investigate and compare the work of
Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Elisha Gray. They have chosen to focus
on these inventors because their work is well documented by notebooks, sketches,
and artifacts and because their efforts to perfect this invention have received
limited scholarly attention. To analyze and compare the work of these inventors,
they will employ concepts from cognitive science. In particular, they will
consider three elements of the cognitive process of invention: how an inventor
conceptualizes an invention (mental representation); the strategies used to
develop an invention (heuristics); and the specific technical devices used to
construct the invention (mechanical representations). In their investigation,
they will examine how an inventor's personal style may be viewed as the
synthesis of these different elements. Through this research, they will: 1)
enrich the history of technology with a new conceptual framework and a detailed
study of a major invention; 2)suggest to cognitive scientists how technological
creativity may be effectively studies; and 3) help interested laypersons to see
inventors not as mysterious geniuses but as individuals with specific talents
and skills.
