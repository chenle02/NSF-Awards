The goal of this Climate Process Team is to formulate and test parameterizations
for internal wave mixing in the ocean interior for inclusion in state of the art
coupled climate models. Mixing by internal waves is thought to be a primary
mechanism governing the overall thermohaline structure of the oceans, and may
have significant implications for climate variability. The project promises to
reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale
physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The
project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at
internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy
transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal
wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based
relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process
models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the
parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing
data set of microstructure observations.
