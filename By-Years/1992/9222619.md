The escape response of the cockroach Periplaneta americana has been
characterized as a simple behavior: a cockroach turns away from an attacking
predator and then runs. A set of wind-sensory giant interneurons has long been
known to mediate this response. Based on studies from our laboratory and others,
it has become clear that escape can be elicited by stimuli other than wind, and
be mediated by sensory interneurons other than the classic giants. In behavioral
studies we found that touch is a potent cue for escape, and we have identified
several touch-sensory interneurons that appear likely to be involved in escape.
We propose experiments to clarify the control of cockroach escape by wind-
sensory interneurons, and to examine the organization of touch-sensory
interneurons and their relationship to the wind- sensory system. The experiments
will involve recording from and stimulating specific interneurons, mapping the
afferent input to the interneurons, and assessing behavioral functions by
multiple cell (electrolytic) and single cell (enzymatic injection) lesioning
techniques. Even the "simple" escape response of insects shows evidence of
complex multisensory control. Since the behavior also can be related to
identified central neurons, it provides a model system for understanding
sensorimotor integration at a cellular level.//
