This award supports an NSF/CBMS regional conference to be held at Winthrop
University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, June 28 - July 2, 2014. The conference
focuses on understanding genetic relationships via the study of binary trees
known as phylogenies. These trees are constructed by comparing nucleotide or
protein sequence data which is then mathematically analyzed to find the tree
which best reflects the differences among the genetic material. At the heart of
these mathematical models are problems of interest to pure and applied
mathematicians, statisticians, and operations researchers. The principal
lecturer will be Dr. Mike Steel, Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at the
University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, and cofounder and
director of the university's Biomathematics Research Centre. In additional to 10
primary lectures by Dr. Steel, four guest lecturers will present research and
problems from related mathematical perspectives.

Hallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single
important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published
monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation
through regional recruitment emphasis. Funding is available for faculty from
undergraduate institutions, graduate students, post-doctorates, and beginning
researchers. During this conference working groups will encourage collaboration,
the development of resources, and the acquisition of new tangible research
skills.
