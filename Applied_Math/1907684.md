Mean field games are models for problems in which a large number of individuals
need to make decisions which are related to those of many other individuals.
Many applications of mean field games arise from economics. One example to be
treated is modeling the decision of households to allocate their income between
savings and consumption; the benefits of a household's decision depend on the
decisions that the other households make, since the interest rate in this
example is determined through the aggregation of the decisions of all the
households. This research will seek to understand mathematical theory of these
models; this includes proving that the models have solutions and understanding
how these solutions depend upon parameters present in the models. Developing the
mean field games theory can have impact on the quality of economic forecasts and
economic decision-making. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be
trained through participation in this research project

Existence and regularity theory will be developed for solutions of mean field
games models, and important asymptotic problems will be investigated. The
regularity theory includes demonstrating analytic and Gevrey regularity for
solutions which have previously been proved to exist with finite Sobolev
regularity. Asymptotic regimes include rigorously studying the limit of
differential games with finitely many players as the number of players tends to
infinity, studying the limit as diffusion parameters vanish, and studying the
limit as the time horizon goes to infinity. Problems with nonseparable
Hamiltonian and problems arising from applications, such as the household
savings problem, will be emphasized. Mean field games systems are taken with
initial and terminal data rather than just initial data; tools from initial
value problems in areas such as fluid dynamics will be adapted to the forward-
backward setting of mean field games.
