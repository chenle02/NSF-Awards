MODELING MAGMA DYNAMICS AND DEGASSING IN VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207821&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Proussevitch &amp;
Sahagian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to develop a
mathematical analysis and computer model of the movement of magma within
volcanoes. Eruptions are normally driven by the growth of gas bubbles that come
out of solution in the magma due to reductions in pressure before and during
magma ascent within the volcano. The project consists of two parts. The first is
a mathematical and computer analysis of volcanic eruption processes. The second
is a sensitivity analysis to determine how the model system responds to
variations in each of a number of attributes of the volcanic system. This should
elucidate the roles and relative importance of all relevant factors in driving
volcanic eruptions. The numerical model will enable us to explore the
interaction of magma ascent, bubble growth, bubble size distribution,
temperature change, and other specific volcanic processes. The proposed model is
not intended to simulate specific natural eruptions. Rather, the results of the
model and sensitivity study should lead to a better understanding of the
mechanisms by which bubble growth drives eruptions, and an understanding of how
magmatic conditions, properties, and conduit geometry affect the style of
volcanic eruptions. This will set the stage for determining the conditions under
which to expect explosive volcanic eruptions and their related volcanic
hazards.&lt;br/&gt;
