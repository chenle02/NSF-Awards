This project will address a central algorithmic problem in computational
physics, namely, reliable calculations for strongly interacting quantum
mechanical systems that obey fermion statistics. Some examples of such systems
include high-temperature superconductors, heavy-fermion metals, and magnetic
materials. The challenge lies in the correct and accurate treatment of
microscopic correlations, which is essential to understanding the properties of
these systems and their theoretical and technological implications. The project
will be based on a recently developed algorithm for treating correlated many-
fermion systems on a lattice, the Constrained Path Monte Carlo (CPMC) Method. It
consists of three separate but closely related parts: (1) The Ground-State
Properties of Prototypical Lattice models for Electron Correlation; (2) Finite
Temperature; (3) Continuum Systems. All of this will be done in the context of
scaleable parallel computing algorithms, a critical aspect of the problem of
studying lattice models of great relevance to high-temperature superconductors
and heavy-fermion materials. A new version of the CPMC algorithms will be
developed for finite temperature calculations. This will enable studies of
thermodynamically properties and true phase transitions. This project will also
extend the algorithm to the continuum, which will enable more realistic
calculations of materials.
