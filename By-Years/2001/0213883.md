The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
of Southern Mississippi supports an interdisciplinary research program in the
area of polymer coatings and films. The Center also supports a wide range of
educational activities, including the establishment of advanced degrees in
polymer education and a new course leading to an advanced degree in Distance
Leaming. The Center is entitled the Response-Driven Polymeric Films Center. The
Center supports well maintained and accessible shared experimental facilities
and interacts with industry and other sectors at local, regional, national and
international levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's research is organized
into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGS). &lt;br/&gt;IRG 1, Design and
Synthesis ofresponse -Driven Poymers, focuses on the the design and synthesis of
molecular processes in biomaterials, liquid crystals, and environmentally
fismart" molecules. IRG 2, Response-Driven Film Formation, conducts molecular
level investigations of films and coatings that exhibit response-driven
properties. Potential application of the Center's research are in diveres areas
such as water treatment, controlled drug release, and formulation of water-based
coatings.. In addition, seed support is provided for emerging research
opportunities which are within the general scope of the Center.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Center currently include 19 senior
investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 30 graduate students, 12
undergraduates, and 6 technicians and other support personnel. Professor Marek
W. Urban directs the MRSEC. &lt;br/&gt;
