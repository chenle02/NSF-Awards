This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award supports a renovation project to provide infrastructure improvements
to approximately 1000 square feet of existing research space into a lab shared
by six chemistry and biochemistry faculty, their instrumentation and equipment,
and undergraduate research students. The renovated facility will improve
research conditions for faculty pursuing research projects with undergraduates
studying the mechanisms of viral genome evolution; several high-value areas of
organic chemistry: high-spin molecules and their metal complexes, carbonyl and
heterocycle chemistry, and organofluorine chemistry; solid/aqueous phase and
interfacial chemical reactions influencing the fate of trace elements through
bench-to-pilot scale experiments; environmental sampling, analysis, and
remediation of soil, vegetation, wildlife, and water resources on the college
campus; and developing "green" oxygenation catalysts that are organometallic in
nature.

The renovated laboratory will provide the faculty and their students interested
in pursuing careers in the chemical sciences modern and safe facilities in which
to develop their interests.
