This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide a
novel, patented sensor of the polarization properties of light for operation in
the vacuum ultraviolet spectral range, from ~ 120 to 200 nm. The instrument is a
complete polarimeter that measures all four of the Stokes parameters of
polarized light. It enables new semiconductor metrology applications and
measurements with high precision and accuracy that are not achievable by
rotating analyzer ellipsometry.

The $30B semiconductor equipment market is continuously challenged to meet
changing requirements with decreasing dimensions and thickness of structures on
chips. The G-DOAP instrument meets key requirements of the industry for vacuum
ultraviolet metrology tools. It also brings new capabilities to surface science
investigations in many fields through the product for this market that we will
offer. This technology can accelerate progress along the International Roadmap
for Semiconductors, which cites VUV tools as a key need.
