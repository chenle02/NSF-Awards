The research problem is to determine why transport in the region between Hawaii
and the California coast deviates substantially from what would be expected from
wind forcing alone (Sverdrup balance). Possible reasons are significant errors
in the wind stress field, seasonal variations in the transport which are not
resolved by the measurements, forcing by surface heat fluxes, or strong ocean
fronts. Several of these mechanisms are being examined using new data available
from earth-observing satellites, and comparisons with two quite different
methods of analyzing ocean dynamics: hydrographic measurements and numerical
modeling of ocean circulation. Satellite wind and sea surface height
observations are being assimilated into a simple circulation model to separate
the effects of Rossby waves, seasonal heating, and wind forcing. Interactive
activities include teaching a graduate course on ocean data and models, a
workshop on balancing career and family, and another workshop on careers in
science education.
