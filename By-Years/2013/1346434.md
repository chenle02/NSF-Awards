This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to
develop new tools that will make it possible to better predict crop yields under
changing climatic and environmental conditions, associate phenotypic expression
of desired plant traits with genetic markers, and enable plant breeders to
accelerate the development of new crops and varieties under changing climatic
conditions. Plant growth and crop models may be limited by a lack of detailed
environmental data inputs and detailed knowledge of crop physiology. A new
approach to greatly improve the estimates potential of new crops will be
explored by using existing crops as data surrogates for potential new crops, and
to estimate performance of known crops under changing environmental conditions.
To identify which species and varieties can serve as the best surrogates, an
integrated approach will be utilized involving sequencing the
genomes/transcriptomes of various species-wide genotypes and bioinformatics
analysis. Genotypes will be identified based on their phenotypic performance in
geographically and environmentally diverse locations, building a reference
genome guided and/or denovo transcriptomes from treated samples, identifying
genetic markers (SSRs and SNPs) and resolving their placement in the angiosperm
phylogeny. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project, if successful, will be improvement in the production of food and energy
crops under changing climatic conditions, which will benefit consumers and
commercially benefit farmers, seed companies, agricultural input and service
companies and food processors and distributors. The development of new crops and
varieties is essential to help meet the food, fiber and energy needs of the
nation and the world. Global climate change and increasing weather variability
means that even existing crops will need to be modified to perform well under
new environmental conditions. Using traditional plant breeding can take years to
develop new crops that are optimized to perform well in specific locations.
While the new tools of genomics and genetic mapping hold the promise of greatly
reducing the time that it takes to develop new crop, these tools have not yet
been fully integrated into assessing how plants respond to specific
environmental conditions and determining how to isolate and develop the genetic
determinants of desired phenotypic expressions. In this proposed project, plant
production models will be integrated with genetic mapping to produce tools that
make it possible to project crop yield potentials in the context of local
environments as distributed across the landscape.
