Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding and
interrelationships of the atomic structural, electronic and vibrational
properties of metal-semiconductor interfaces will be conducted The PI is
recognized as a pioneer in the imple- mentation of MEIS for surface analysis,
and the proposed program brings together an impressive array of advanced surface
analysis techniques to assist in the fundamental studies proposed. The research
aims to understand the correlation between Schottky barrier behavior and general
metal-semiconductor interface atomic level structure and electronic properties.
%%% This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of
metal-semiconductor interfaces and their relationship to Schottky barrier
behavior in terms of barrier height and homogeneity. From an application point
of view, understanding these properties is helpful to semiconductor device
design and fabrication. The results will be of importance in a general way to
the technology of large scale, high speed integrated electronic circuits.
