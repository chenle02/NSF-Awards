In response to changes in public services in recent years, faith-based community
development organizations have increasingly provided social services such as job
training, low-income housing, and small business loans. Although rarely studied,
these organizations take the form of cooperative collective action or social
movements. This projects draws from organizational and collective action
theories to understand the emergence and outcomes of faith-based community
development. In so doing, it evaluates hypotheses concerning the growth of
bureaucratic structures in these organizations as they grow older and larger,
and the growing similarity of organizations in their "action frames." Field work
in three faith-based community development organizations, including interviews
with organizational leaders, examination of organizational documents, and
observations of meetings and activities, provides the data to evaluate the
theories and hypotheses. The results help understand an increasingly important
social movement that the literature has largely ignored.
