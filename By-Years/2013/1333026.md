More than 400,000 tons of petroleum hydrocarbons are released annually into the
ocean, where they are subject to physical, chemical and biological processes,
known as weathering, that are known to remove select hydrocarbons from the
ocean. However, little attention has been given to the residues left by the
weathering of oil, and studies indicate that oxygenation of these hydrocarbons
can play a part in the formation of recalcitrant tar and toxic compounds. To
address this gap, researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
University of Mary Washington, and University of California Santa Barbara will
conduct research to lay a scientific foundation for understanding 1) which
processes control the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons, 2) the rates of
these processes, 3) the identity of the major products, 4) the rates at which
they are formed and destroyed, and 5) for distinguishing photochemical
oxygenation from biological oxygenation. The results from these experiments will
contribute to a better understanding of the petroleum oxygenation processes and
the environmental fate of understudied oxygenation products.

Broader Impacts: This study will provide for several undergraduates and two
postdoctoral scholars to be trained in innovative analytical and experimental
techniques. The results of this effort will help regulatory agencies to define
new analytical methods and target compounds for oil spill research, and will add
to our understanding regarding the fate and impacts of hydrocarbons released
into the ocean.
