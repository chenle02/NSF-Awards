San Diego State University Foundation will conduct a five- year program to
enhance 225 mathematics teachers of grades 4 through 8 who teach in schools with
large African-American and Latino enrollments. Each teacher will participate in
one of four two-year cycles (180 hours) of Saturday workshops during the
academic year, a two-week summer workshop, and working with students and parents
in after school activities. Participants will 1) study mathematics content,
research on teaching and learning mathematics, and methodologies and curricula;
2) participate in an after- school mathematics laboratory program for children;
and 3) assist in implementing workshops designed to involve parents in their
children's mathematics education. Mathematical content will include number,
patterns and functions, algebra, statistics, probability, geometry, and
measurement. The project design also calls for the study of the longer- term
effect of the enhancement. San Diego State University's Cost-sharing accounts
for 17% of the NSF budget. This proposal is well-conceived and has the potential
for becoming an exemplary model for the enhancement of teachers working in
schools with high African-American and Latino populations.
