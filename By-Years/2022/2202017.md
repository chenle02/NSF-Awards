We encounter symmetry in nearly every aspect of our daily lives: looking at our
faces in the mirror, watching snowflakes fall from the sky, and driving across
bridges. Symmetric organisms persist through evolution in nature, symmetric
protagonists are perceived as especially beautiful in art, and symmetric
components are critical to engineering structures that can withstand powerful
forces. The set of symmetries of a particular physical object enjoys a rich
algebraic structure, because symmetries are operations that can be composed
together. This group of all symmetries can then be conveniently studied by
encoding each symmetry as a rectangular array of numbers called a matrix. This
process of passing from a symmetric object in the natural world to a related
collection of matrices is the hallmark of the mathematical field of
representation theory. Representation theory thus reduces the complex study of
symmetry in nature to questions in the well understood area of mathematics
called linear algebra. As such, the proposed projects have broad potential to
substantially impact our understanding of many symmetric structures occurring
throughout the mathematical and natural sciences. This project also provides
opportunities for directly involving undergraduate students in mathematical
research, with a focused goal of supporting the development and recruitment of
women in mathematics.

This project will address two topics in the algebra, geometry, and
representation theory of reductive algebraic groups over non-archimedean local
fields. First, applying techniques from geometric group theory to the associated
Bruhat-Tits building, the investigator will provide a global approach to
understanding the conjugacy classes of any affine Weyl group. Second, this
geometric perspective will also be applied to reinterpret the K-theoretic
generalization of Peterson's isomorphism from the equivariant homology of the
affine Grassmannian to the equivariant quantum cohomology of a finite flag
variety. Specific objectives include a complete description of an affine
conjugacy class in terms of the underlying finite Weyl group, and new
representatives for the Schubert classes in the equivariant K-homology of the
affine Grassmannian. As such, the research will stimulate new interactions among
the mathematical subfields of representation theory, arithmetic geometry,
enumerative geometry, algebraic combinatorics, geometric group theory, and
mathematical physics.
