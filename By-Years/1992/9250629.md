An atomic absorption spectrometer is being used throughout the chemistry
curriculum for the demonstration of fundamental aspects of atomic spectra as
well as for elemental analyses. The spectrometer is being used in four existing
courses: Instrumental Analysis, Analytical Chemistry, Biochemical Techniques,
and Spectroscopy. In addition, it is being used in an Environmental Chemistry
course which is under development as part of a new Environmental Studies
Program. Finally, groups of high school students are bringing water samples to
Shepherd College each year for analysis, and ongoing records of the results are
being compiled by the high school students.
