9320929 Galaskiewicz This is a project to study how not-for-profit organizations
adapted to the threat of organizational decline at the end of the 1980s and
early in the 1990s. It will collect a fourth wave of interview data from a
sample of 174 such organizations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, organizations
which were previously studied in 1980, 1984, and 1988. Ideas about the
importance of managerial strategies in adapting to the threat of organizational
decline will be systematically tested. This project is distinctive in building
upon longitudinal data collected from not-for-profit organizations, data which
in the past have yielded important insights into organizational performance and
behavior. In an era in which responding to rapidly changing external conditions
and organizational down-sizing are keynotes of economic life, this project will
help lead to an understanding of the factors and strategies that influence
organizational survival and success. ***
