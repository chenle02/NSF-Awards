This project will focus on fluid evolution in the upper part of the hydrothermal
system at the Archean Wiluna lode-gold deposits. The mixing of surface and deep-
seated ore fluids may be an important precipitation mechanism for gold and other
metals. The goal of this study is to constrain surface water components in the
Wiluna deposits, and to quantify fluid fluxes in the metasomatic zones. This
will be the first to study the nature and role of surface waters in Archean
lode-gold systems. The surface water components of the fossil hydrothermal
system will be quantified by GC/IC, PIXE-probe, and noble gas analyses on fluid
inclusions, and stable isotope analyses on homogeneous groups of fluid
inclusions and alteration minerals. Mass- transfer modeling will quantify fluid
flow through channel ways and wallrock, and will quantify fluid mixing as a gold
precipitation mechanism in the upper parts of the lodes. This research will be
conducted in collaboration with the Key Centre for Strategic Mineral Deposits,
Perth and the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Canberra.
