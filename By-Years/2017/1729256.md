Why are there more languages that have suffixes than ones that have prefixes?
Why do languages that have both prefixes and suffixes use the suffixes more? One
explanation that has been suggested is that the beginnings of words are more
salient and therefore more important Yet little research has been done on the
relative ability of speakers to understand and produce prefixes in contrast to
suffixes. Most prior research has been conducted on English; the little research
on other languages is mostly on languages related to English, such as French or
Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this collaborative research project
are to analyze processing and production differences among clitics occurring in
different positions, and to test whether any differences are the same cross-
linguistically. The research targets a language that is unrelated to English and
other Indo-European languages: Udi, a member of the Nakh-Daghestanian language
family. It examines both affixes and the precursors of affixes, clitics. Clitics
are little words that are pronounced with a host word, similar to the way
English 'will' can be pronounced with the subject of a verb: he'll go. Udi is
unusual in having clitics that can occur in four different positions in the
verb: at the end of verbs, before the verbs, between meaningful parts of the
verb, and inside the root of the verb. Psycholinguistic experiments will compare
the perception/production of clitics in different positions, and compare clitics
in one position with suffixes occurring in the same position. Further, the
researchers will compare these aspects of Udi with the same aspects of European
Portuguese, another language with both affixes and clitics that can occur in
various positions. This research is significant because it will inform an
interpretation of the human ability to understand words and will apply this
interpretation to typological differences among languages and the historical
change from clitics to affixes. Researchers will work with an Udi literacy
expert and will create materials based on their research that will aid in
literacy efforts.
