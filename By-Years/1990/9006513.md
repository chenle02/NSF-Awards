Several electronic and physical properties: electrical resistivity,
thermoelectric power, and physical structure, of a set of carefully chosen solid
and liquid metals and semimetals will be measured. This study includes: 1) the
measurement of the thermopower of liquid gadolinium; 2) measurements of the
resistivity and thermopower of liquid magnesium-calcium, magnesium- strontium,
and magnesium-barium; 3) measurement of the total structure factor for liquid
magnesium-barium near the equiatomic composition utilizing neutron diffraction
techniques; and 4) measurements of the thermopower and resistivity of the liquid
alloys aluminum-calcium and aluminum-barium. These studies will test recent
theoretical work, in addition to providing a spur for new developments in the
theory and applications of liquid and amorphous solid systems.
