In these times, scientists are not the only ones struggling to grasp the overall
picture from a flood of specific, detailed, high-dimensional data. Understanding
a high-dimensional data set often means understanding a lower-dimensional space
that generates it, as, say, the important part of the image of someone playing a
body-controlled video game is the few angles of their arm and leg joints, and
not the many pixels coming from a camera and depth sensor. Topology is the
branch of mathematics that looks at connections rather than specific points or
values; two popular tools in topological data analysis, hierarchical clustering
and Reeb graphs, are based on path-connectivity. This project generalizes both,
developing generalizations to parameterized hierarchical clustering and Reeb
spaces. There is an exciting interplay between the practical questions of data
analysis and the theoretical and mathematical tools to answer them -- each
deepens the other. This project will train students through this interplay.

The PI will develop algorithmic foundations for Reeb spaces and theoretical
foundations for parameterized hierarchical clustering. The Reeb space of a
continuous map summarizes the path-connectivity of its fibers. The Reeb graph,
which is the Reeb space of a map to the real line and for which there are fast
algorithms to compute, is now a commonly used tool in topological data analysis.
The PI will focus on developing practical algorithms for computing the Reeb
space of a map to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces. When the domain of the
continuous map is equipped with a metric, the path-connected components of each
fiber assembles into a (Vietoris-Rips) hierarchical cluster. Thus the map gives
rise to a family of hierarchical clusters parameterized by the co-domain of the
map. The PI will use sheaf theory to develop a theoretical foundation for
parameterized hierarchical clustering.
