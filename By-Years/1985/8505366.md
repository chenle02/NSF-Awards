Many civil engineering projects are large systems requiring the evaluation of
many parameters. Engineers have traditionally solved these systems by neglecting
several factors as of inconsequential effect on the total behavior of the
system. This project will develop a methodology by which the large systems may
be evaluated by considering the effect of as many parameters and factors as
possible in a computer program.
