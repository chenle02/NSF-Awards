One of the major difficulties in understanding how autocracy arises in electoral
democracies is the limited data that exist on citizen participation in and
support for autocratic moves. Such moves often arise suddenly, making them
difficult for analysts to anticipate and study. One such move was the successful
effort by President Daniel Ortega to void the participation of his major
opponents in Nicaragua's recent and upcoming elections. This case provides us a
unique opportunity to examine an effort to install electorally-validated
autocracy. By closely examining this case, the findings can impact foreign
policy and domestic organizations that support democracy and its development.

The project uses a multi-wave survey design. An initial national public opinion
survey gauges citizen vote support for Ortega, and then two subsequent national
public opinion surveys trace the evolution of citizen attitudes in the months
following the initial survey. These surveys will be used to examine the
following question: Is citizen support for autocracy truly broad-gauged and
sustained, as elected autocrats claim, or is it more limited and subject to
rapid decay as the oppressive reality of strong-man rule emerges?
