9704671 Benton Boron and lithium are important tracers of slab devolatilization
during subduction. While their isotopes have the potential to discriminate
between the vartious B and Li reservoirs, the interpretation of such data is
complicated by the lack of understanding of their isotopic behavior during slab
metamorphism. The objective of the proposed research is to study the evolution
of B and Li in slab-derived fluids and subducted sediments and oceanic crust.
This will be achieved through laboratory experiments and study of natural
examples of slab devolatilization from the Otter Point Formation (southern
Oregon) and the Catalina Schist Subduction Complex (California).
