This project involves 32 middle school science and social studies teachers from
the lower midwest. Working under a team of scientists and science educators for
a period of three collegiate semesters, the participants will focus on earth
science and ecological principles and on the science-related societal issues
associated with geological and ecological resources in the region. One of the
strongest components of this project is the outcome related to the participants'
understanding of science-related societal issues within their own geographical
region. Field activities, supported by the local school systems, are an integral
part of the scheduled activities. Teachers and administrators will be
familiarized with the local and regional resources and will be trained in issue
investigation and problem solving, thus aiding them in implementing similar
instruction in their own classrooms. The project will be carried out in four
phases, enabling teachers to participate in activities, carry out independent
investigations, implement these activities in their classrooms and evaluate the
impact of the project. Graduate credit will be given upon completion of the
project.
