This study explores the potential of a new type of jury instructions to improve
the longstanding problem of juror instructional comprehension. The present study
examines the viability of "pinpoint" instructions, or instructions that provide
explicit examples to help jurors understand traditionally abstract concepts, and
make direct reference to the facts presented at trial. Two-hundred jury-eligible
community members will observe a realistic videotaped simulation of a capital
penalty phase trial. Following the simulated trial, participants (randomly
assigned to one of three groups) will hear one of three sets of instructions:
the traditional California pattern jury instructions; psycholinguistically
improved instructions; or "pinpoint" instructions modified to include case-
specific factual examples to explain abstract concepts for jurors. At the
conclusion of the trial and instructions, participants will be asked to indicate
a verdict choice, complete a comprehension measure (designed to gauge
comprehension levels in various ways), and to provide demographic information.
Comprehension levels of the three groups will be examined and compared to
determine whether and to what extent pinpoint instructions improve
comprehension.
