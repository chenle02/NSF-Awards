This project is to set up a process instrumentation and control laboratory
within the industrial automation laboratory. Included will be a process control
simulation system, consisting of simulators, PID controllers, discrete
controllers, programmable logic controllers, and process simulation
microprocessors. The laboratory will use industrial grade instrumentation and
IBM PC compatible computers to insure maximum versatility and compatibility. The
students will thus learn control techniques ranging from PID controllers to
discrete systems control using equipment which is found in industry.
