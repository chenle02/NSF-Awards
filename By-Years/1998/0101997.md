Submitted under the guidelines for Teacher Retention and Renewal, this sixty-
month project supports approximately 300 teachers of high school mathematics in
fourteen school districts of California. These teachers comprise three distinct
groups. First, those already experienced with instructional materials aligned
with NCTM's Principles and Standards for School Mathematics "develop mentoring
and professional development skills and serve as mentors and leaders in their
districts... The other two groups are veteran teachers wishing to improve their
teaching through alternative means of instruction and assessment, and novice
teachers needing mentoring and support in the critical early years." The
Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) materials are the primary vehicle for the
project's professional development. The teacher enhancement curriculum includes
summer and winter workshops and individual work, collaboration, mentoring and
electronic networking throughout the school year. All participants are expcected
to make a commitment for at least two years (130 hours of professional
development per year), but may choose to participate for three or four years.
