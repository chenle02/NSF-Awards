This is a proposal to develop a new system for measuring blood flow using
Doppler ultrasound. Repeated pulses, consisting of synchronous swept-frequency
sinusoids, are used for excitation. After appropriate processing of the
reflected signal (which may include correlation with the excitation waveform),
both depth and velocity information can be recovered. The proposed system
includes software cancellation of stationary tissue structures, allowing a
substantial increase in the signal-to-noise ratio for weak flow signals. If
successful, the work will open up new research and diagnostic avenues by
facilitating the determination of flow in small arteries and peripheral
vasculature.
