The research project studies differences in the molecular structures of genes
and genomes across a wide swath of organisms ranging from humans to parasites.
In particular, the project seeks to answer the mystery of the origins of
introns, intervening stretches of DNA that interrupt the genes of all
eukaryotes, i.e., the organisms that have nucleated cells. By conducting the
work at San Francisco State University, one of the most diverse comprehensive
universities in the country, this work will support training in biological and
computational sciences of individuals from underrepresented minority groups at
early stages in their careers (undergraduate and masters students).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to answer the mystery of the origins of
spliceosomal introns in eukaryotes. The vast majority of introns are DNA
fragments inserted within protein-coding genes without a known function and with
a quasi-random DNA sequence, raising the twin questions of (i) why are there
introns; and (ii) how are introns created in evolution? To answer these
questions, the project uses the strategy of identifying and studying recent
cases of intron gain (creation of an intron) and loss (deletion of an intron
from the genome). Recent gains and losses will be identified by direct genome-
wide comparison between 50 groups of closely related organisms, as well as by
comparison of individual intron sequences within the genomes of a larger set of
1000 organisms. These identified changes will be scrutinized to determine the
molecular mechanisms that gave rise to these changes, the impact of these
changes on production of gene products, and the overall impact of these changes
on organismal fitness.
