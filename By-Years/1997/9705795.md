9705795 Donoghue et al. This project will inventory plant and fungal diversity
in western Sichuan and eastern Xizang (Tibet) provinces of China. This area is
one of extreme topographic complexity caused by the parallel, very deep valleys
of the major rivers that drain the Asian plateau. Lower elevations of the region
are characterized by tropical forests, while higher elevations are dominated by
conifers and alpine vegetation. Preliminary work has shown that vascular plant
diversity in this area is far greater than in any other region of comparable
size in the Earth's temperate zones. It is reasonable to hypothesize that high
levels of diversity will also be found among the non-vascular plants and fungi,
although current knowledge of these groups is very poor for this region.
Expeditions to collect plants and fungi will be undertaken in 1997, 1998, and
1999; these will be in close collaboration with Chinese colleagues from Beijing
and the Chengdu Institute of Biology in Sichuan. Spciemens will be distributed
to relevant institutions within and outside of China, and will be made available
particularly quickly to experts in various groups. The specimen data will be
made available electronically, as quickly as it can be provided via the WWW.
This project is funded as a partnership among the International Programs and
Biotic Surveys &amp; Inventories Program of the NSF, Harvard University, the
Chengdu Institute and other Chinese institutions and agencies, and the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh. Through the course of the project, both American and
Chinese students will be trained and have the opportunity for international
travel and collaboration. In addition, this project will establish long-term
collaborative edforts to assess the biodiversity of China.
