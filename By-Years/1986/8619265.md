This study will address an important question that must be answered before
reliable climatic records are deduced from core in glaciers. An observed two
degree (Centigrade) termperature difference at ten meters depth in coreholes
less than two kilometers apart near the divide of Agassiz ice cap on Ellesmere
Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, show that climatic intepretations are
vulnerable to microclimatic effects, at least near these coreholes. The two
degree difference is important because it is 20% of the total probable
temperature change between the late Wiconsinan glacial maximum and the present
at that location. The study consists of two parts: (1) a strain and temperature
survey at that surface that will provide input data for a finite element model
that will be eventually be used to determine how ice dynamics determines the
paleoclimatic record down the coreholes, and (2) a microclimate investigation to
learn the precise mechanisms that cause the two degree temperature difference.
Wind pumping--that is, frictional dissipation caused by forcing of air through
the porous firn by surface turbulence-- is tentatively proposed as the cause of
warmer ten meter temperatures at the ice divide.
