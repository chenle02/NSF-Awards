Abstract ATM-9630226 Mechoso, Carlos Arakawa, Akio University of California, Los
Angeles Title: Numerical Simulation of Global Atmosphere This grant supports two
graduate students over a period of three years to investigate the sensitivity of
the Atlantic ocean- atmosphere interface surface fluxes to 1) the local and
remote SST forcing and 2) the upper gradation of the cloud microphysics in the
UCLA AGCM. The understanding of this issue is of fundamental importance for
climate modeling efforts. A successful completion of this project will go a long
way in the future evolution of the coupled GCMs and climate modeling.
