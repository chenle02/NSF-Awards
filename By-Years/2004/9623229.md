With the widespread use of distributed and concurrent systems and with the
increase in the complexity of software for such systems, it becomes important to
develop various methods for ensuring the quality of concurrent software systems.
This project explores various methods for automated and semi-automated analysis
and verification of concurrent and distributed systems. In particular, the
research seeks methods based on temporal logic model checking for verification
of concurrent systems. Although model checking has been applied fairly
successfully for verification of quite a few real-life systems, its
applicability to a wider class of practical systems has been hampered by the
state explosion problem (i.e. the enormous increase in the size of the state
space). In this research, symmetry based techniques are used to overcome the
state explosion problem. In particular, symmetry is exploited for verification
of liveness properties of real-life concurrent and distributed software systems.
The effectiveness of symmetry-based methods for model checking requires
efficient solutions to the orbit problem. A solution to the orbit requires
checking if two given global states are equivalent under the symmetry. An
efficient solution to this problem facilitates the construction of the quotient
structure by collapsing each set of equivalent states into a single state. The
project investigates various efficient algorithms for the orbit problem for many
of the symmetries that occur in practical systems. It is implementing an on-line
model checking system that exploits symmetry by simultaneously constructing
reduced global state graph (i.e. the quotient structure) and exploring the
partially generated quotient structure for existence of certain fair strongly
connected components containing an incorrect computation. ***
