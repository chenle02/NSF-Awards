This objective of this research is to develop a highly exploratory
&lt;br/&gt;non-lithographic approach to fabricate room-temperature single-
electron &lt;br/&gt;transistors based on chemically synthesized metallic
nanoparticles of &lt;br/&gt;controllable sizes and shapes. The approach is based
on controlled &lt;br/&gt;manipulation and assembly of colloidal nanoparticles
assisted by a &lt;br/&gt;nonuniform electric field. The proposed approach is
unique in that the &lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles are used to form not only the
central conducting islands &lt;br/&gt;which allow room-temperature operation,
but also metallic interconnects to &lt;br/&gt;connect the central islands to
conventional structures without the need of &lt;br/&gt;high-resolution
lithography. The approach also allows for the fabrication &lt;br/&gt;of
suspended single-electron transistor structure, which may address the
&lt;br/&gt;problem of random background charges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The proposed work could lead to true breakthroughs in the
&lt;br/&gt;fabrication technology of practical single-electron devices, which
are &lt;br/&gt;identified in the International Technology Roadmap for
Semiconductors as &lt;br/&gt;possible alternatives to metal-oxide-semiconductors
field-effect &lt;br/&gt;transistors, which will soon run into fundamental
physical scaling limits, &lt;br/&gt;for future memory and logic applications.
The project will also provide the &lt;br/&gt;students with excellent research
and educational opportunities in &lt;br/&gt;nanoscience and nanotechnology. The
highly interdisciplinary nature of the &lt;br/&gt;research will result in broad
training of students. The research project is &lt;br/&gt;well suited for
undergraduate students at all levels to participate. &lt;br/&gt;Particular
effort will be made to involve minority students.&lt;br/&gt;
