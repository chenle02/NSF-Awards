9601839 Almasan A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer for materials research will be acquired by Kent State University.
The instrument will support research on the magnetic properties of high
transition temperature superconductors and of liquid crystals. Major research
projects that will use the instrument include studies of Josephson coupling of
copper oxide bilayers and of the vortex phases in high-temperature
superconductors, and of phase transitions and critical points in lyotropic and
polymeric liquid crystals. %%% The instrument will benefit a group of young
faculty working in one area which routinely involves sensitive magnetometry
(superconductivity) and in another area where the application of such technique
is just emerging (liquid crystals). Both the principal investigator and main co-
investigator in the project are female faculty in physics, a discipline where
women are severely underrepresented. The instrument facility will enhance their
role model and will help to attract female students to the sciences. ***
