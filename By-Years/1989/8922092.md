The Berkeley Automated Supernova Search has passed its proof of concept. This
award will build a powerful, new scientific tool by locating the search at a
remote site with a darker sky, better seeing, and better weather than the
present location. Combining this with a new CCD and a faster computer, will
increase the sensitivity for finding supernovae to 20th magnitude and decrease
the processing time per image from seventy to thirty seconds. Funding for a
telescope, a CCD camera, a building, and the necessary computers has already
been obtained. This award will cover the deployment and testing of the new
remote search. The scientific goals of the search are to find supernovae at the
earliest possible time and to find a large number of supernovae for statistical
purposes. Finding supernovae early and following them up with light curves and
spectra will aid theorists who study the mechanism of supernova explosions and
aid in the study of supernovae as distance indicators. Supernova statistics (in
particular the supernova rate in galaxies) provides information about galaxy
composition and evolution as well as the structure, kinematics, and composition
of the interstellar medium.
