Learning theory studies the extent to which meaningful patterns can be extracted
from data. Two popular frameworks for the analysis of learning algorithms are
statistical learning and worst-case online learning. Recent developments suggest
that these two seemingly disparate frameworks are, in fact, two endpoints of a
spectrum of problems which can be studied in a unified manner. The goals of this
project are (a) to understand learnability and to develop efficient algorithms
for a spectrum of problems corresponding to various probabilistic and non-
probabilistic assumptions on the data; (b) to extend learnability results to
encompass performance criteria beyond the classical notion of regret; (c) to
understand the inherent complexity of reinforcement learning and to develop
novel algorithms inspired by the learnability analysis; (d) to study
learnability in settings with imperfect or partial information, and to
understand algorithmic implications of dealing with
uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms that extract patterns from data are
becoming increasingly important in the information age. However, classical
methods that assume a "static" nature of the world are unable to capture the
evolving character of data. Recent advances in learning theory have been on the
dynamic interaction between the world and the learner. Being able to tailor the
algorithms to particular assumptions on data is arguably a central goal of
learning theory. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes the
development of a unified theoretical framework, increasing our understanding of
what is learnable by computers. Advances in this direction will likely
facilitate the development of more intelligent systems, having a positive impact
on technology. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will likely increase
collaboration between Computer Science and Statistics.
