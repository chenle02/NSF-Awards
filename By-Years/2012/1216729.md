This research investigates four fundamental questions in quantum information
processing. &lt;br/&gt;1. The power and limitations of two quantum provers, in
particular the relation of this model with the classical complexity classes of
Polynomial Space and Exponential Time. &lt;br/&gt;2. The optimal rate at which
mixed state quantum information can be compressed, in particular if a well-known
lower bound on the rate by Holevo quantity is tight. &lt;br/&gt;3. Strong lower
bound on quantum one-way communication. &lt;br/&gt;4. The power and limitations
of short quantum refereed games, in particular the relation of those models with
other quantum and classical complexity classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum
information processing is of fundamental importance to the security, prosperity,
and welfare of the nation, as it may lead to revolutionary technologies for
super-fast computing and secure methods for communication. The successful
completion of this project will illuminate the power and limitations of quantum
information processing capabilities, thus contribute to the realistic deployment
of quantum information technologies. PI will actively involve undergraduate and
graduate students in his research.
