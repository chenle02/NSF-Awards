Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae, and the cosmic
microwave background radiation tell us that ~85% of the matter in the universe
is made of unknown particles. Understanding the nature and properties of dark
matter is fundamental for furthering the fields of cosmology, astrophysics, and
particle physics and for shaping our understanding of the makeup of the
Universe. A leading theoretical candidate for this dark matter is a class of
particles known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which would
have been produced at the time of the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to detect
these particles via their scattering from atomic nuclei have significantly
matured and are possibly within a few years of making a definitive detection.
The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of
low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare WIMP interactions
and distinguish them from backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
provide support for the continuation of the University of Florida's efforts in
terms of supporting the operation and data analysis of the SuperCDMS Soudan
experiment, performing detailed R&amp;D into detector response to electron
recoil backgrounds, both empirically and via simulation, and supporting the
detector characterization and testing program for devices intended to be
deployed in the proposed SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment at SNOLAB.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The SuperCDMS experiment has had a broad
impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical development
will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many
applications in cosmology, astronomy and industry. This work will contribute to
the training of graduate students, using techniques at the leading edge of
measurement technologies.
