This Presidential Young Investigator award is for Dr. William N. Bialek, an
Assistant Professor of Biophysics and Physics. His research interests are in the
application of theoretical approaches to biological problems, especially
problems in sensory physiology and biophysics. Examples of the areas in which he
has contributed include: 1. photochemical processes in photosynthesis, 2. the
roles of protein structure and dynamics in oxygen transport by myoglobin
solutions, 3. the mechanism by which hearing thresholds can be below the
estimates of thermal noise levels, 4. the mechanism by which photon absorption
can lead to visual nerve impulses, 5. the relation of neural impulse frequency
to information coding. The PI intends to continue to explore these and related
areas of biophysics, applying theoretical concepts to a number of problems. This
approach is greatly underutilized, probably because the overhwelming majority of
biological scientists do not have the extensive background in physics nor do
most physicist have sufficient awareness of the biological problems that would
profit from these methods. In addition, the PI appears to be a most remarkable
young investigator, with depth of understanding in physics and what one
evaluator describes as "stunning breadth of knowledge". There is no doubt that
our understanding of various sensory processes can benefit tremendously from the
efforts of Dr. Bialek. This amply demonstrated by the importance of his
contributions during the few years that he has been active.
