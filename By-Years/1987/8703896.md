This workshop will explore the interrelationships between historical patterns
of landscape use and consequent variations in patterns in ecological succession.
The workshop will be held 28- 31 January 1988 and will consist of formal
presentations dealing with specific landscapes by historians and ecologists, as
well as discussions and a field trip. Workshop goals include: 1. Facilitation of
interaction among historians, historical geographers, and ecologists; 2.
Evaluation of the economic, social, technical, and cultural factors that have
influenced the history of land use on different landscapes; 3. Evaluation of the
effects of variations in landscape history and landscape utilization on patterns
of community succession and ecosystem recovery; 4. Consideration of the
interactions between successional trajectories and patterns of land use; 5.
Prediction of future trends expected in land use and succession; 6. and Critical
analysis of ecological methods for reconstruction of landscape history. In
addition to a formal report to the NSF on workshop findings, the meeting will
produce a series of articles in professional journals.
