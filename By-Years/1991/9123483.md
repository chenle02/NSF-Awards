This proposal supports the acquisition of a parallel computer capable of
operating in both Single Instruction, Multiple Data mode and Multiple
Instruction, Multiple Data mode. The computer will be used to support research
in operating systems, scientific computing, parallel algorithms, VLSI design,
and logic programming. Collaborations with other departments, particularly with
computational physics and chemistry, will also be enabled by the acquisition of
this computer.
