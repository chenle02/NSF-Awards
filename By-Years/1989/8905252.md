This research project will support a second three-year program of summer
workshops in ethnographic methods in cultural anthropology. The first three
workshops were held in Gainesville, Florida. Twelve PhD-level cultural
anthropologists will attend a three-week workshop to be held at Northern Arizona
University the first two years (and at the University of Florida in the third
year), to learn the state-of-the-art in research methods. The emphasis is on
micro-computer applications and advanced methods in cognitive anthropology such
as consensus analysis. The need for this activity was shown by the submission of
108 applications for the 12 available positions for the summer of 1989. This
workshop is important because social science is developing new methods of
research and faculty members must maintain their expertise if they are to
conduct leading-edge scientific research.
