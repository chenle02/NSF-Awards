This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
deals with the chemistry of metal cluster compounds, which are molecules
containing three or more metal atoms joined together by metal-metal bonds. The
physical and chemical properties of such clusters are different in many ways
from those of compounds containing a single metal atom, and are useful models of
metal surfaces or small metal particles, which are of technological importance
as catalysts. The project will focus on the effects of nuclearity, i.e. the
number of metal atoms, and of variations in the identity of the metal atoms of
the cluster upon its chemical reactivity. The project will be divided into three
areas of research, according to the size of the clusters. The chemistry of
clusters containing three metal atoms bridged by a methylidyne ligand will be
studied, with the goal of understanding the electrochemically-induced chemistry
of the methylidyne ligand and the influence of the identities of the metal atoms
(Fe, Ru or Os). The chemistry of clusters containing four metal atoms, of which
three or four are bridged by methylidyne ligands, will be studied with the goal
of comparing the chemical reactivity of the methylidyne ligand on clusters of
three or four metal atoms. The chemical and electrochemical behavior of large
clusters of nine to eighteen rhodium atoms will be studied to determine how
these properties are influenced by the nuclearity, charge and face geometries of
the cluster. The ultimate goal of the work is to determine the way in which the
properties of metal clusters differ from small metal particles and from
monometallic metal complexes and to be able to selectively modify these
properties by changing the number and identities of the metal atons and the
coordination sphere of the cluster.
