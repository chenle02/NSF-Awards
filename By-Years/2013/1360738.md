Firms that buy and sell products across international borders often must make
important decisions without full information about future government policies.
For example, a exporting firm may have to decide whether or not to invest in a
new production technology even though the firm is uncertain about future trade
policies that will affect its customers. This award funds a research project
that seeks to measure the effects of uncertainty about trade policy on firms'
investment and export decisions. The data will allow the team to measure the
effects of such uncertainty during two recent events: the Great Recession and
the recent global integration of the Chinese economy with the rest of the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds a basic framework for modeling
and estimating the impact of trade policy uncertainty on investment and export
decisions. The framework incorporates several key factors: (i) general
equilibrium effects of policy reform; (ii) a set of investments that is broad
enough to incorporate innovation and input choice; (iii) the interaction with
pure economic uncertainty and (iv) endogenous trade policy uncertainty. The
model is estimated with firm microdata.
