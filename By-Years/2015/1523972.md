Wireless networks have become ubiquitous and we have come to depend on wireless
access for a wide-range of applications. However, current wireless networks are
very unpredictable in one critical aspect: communication delay. It is well-known
and widely observed that the delays incurred in accessing a wireless network,
regardless of which flavor we choose, can vary widely. The issue of
unpredictable and often high latencies precludes wireless networks from being
used in mission-critical environments. Even common applications, such as real-
time video-conferencing, suffer from poor performance due to the unpredictable
nature of these delays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing consistent low-delay
wireless access will further enable mission critical applications as well as a
host of real-time applications such as video and audio. The workshop will bring
together thought leaders in the wireless field and help shape the research
agenda in this area. The proposed workshop will help identify key impediments
toward low-delay wireless networks. In particular, given the huge leaps made in
wireless communications over the past decade, the workshop will revisit
foundational principles, identify gaps in existing architecture, design and
practice of wireless networking systems to enable consistent low-delay wireless
networks, and specify future research directions in this area. The workshop will
be inter-disciplinary, involving researchers and practitioners from the wireless
space ranging from the macro-scale satellite/cellular networks to the micro-
scale on-chip wireless networks, as well as experts in the theoretical and
systems aspects of wireless networks and communications. The outcome of this
project will be a set of key technical issues that will need to be addressed and
research directions to pursue in order to ensure low-delay wireless access for a
large number of wireless devices.
