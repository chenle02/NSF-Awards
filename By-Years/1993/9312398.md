9312398 Tong The research described in this project will utilize laser light
scattering techniques to study statistical properties of the local velocity, the
relative velocity and the local vorticity fields of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard
(RB) convection in water. The experiments will aim at finding and testing
scaling laws if velocity and vorticity statistics over varying Rayleigh numbers
and length scales in the turbulent core region and near thermal and viscous
boundary layers. Special attention will be given to the intermittent nature of
velocity fluctuations and to correlations between coherent structure and the
probability density functions for the velocities and the vorticity. The project
will provide a body of reliable data to test current theories for turbulent RB
convection. The velocity and vorticity measurements will complement a wealth of
temperature measurements. %%% This project will utilize laser light scattering
techniques to study statistical properties of turbulent motion in thermal
convection. The project is of fundamental interest for understanding the basic
statistical properties of thermal turbulence, and it is also relevant to many
technological applications for effective heat transfer. Understanding heat
transport phenomena in turbulent convection can shed new light on the subject
potentially lead to technological improvements in various industrial
applications ranging from heat exchanges in nuclear reactors to reentry
vehicles. ***
