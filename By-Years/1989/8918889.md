The proposed work is intended to deepen our understanding of a novel class
artificially-structured, magnetic layered materials, composed of both amorphous
and crystalline components. The main thrusts of the work will be: (a)
relationships between fundamental microscopic interactions (anisotropy and
exchange) and the magnetic properties and spin correlations, (b) relationships
between electronic structure, optical, and magneto- optical properties, and (c)
studies of the design of magnetic materials with the desired properties. The
types of experiments to be performed include x-ray diffraction, electron
microscopy, dc magnetization, ac susceptibility, Mossbauer effect, ellipsometry,
polar Kerr effect, and small angle neutron scattering (at NIST). In addition to
providing information on procedures for producing different types of bilayered
and multi- layered magnetic films the research should increase our understanding
of: (a) interfacial magnetism and perpendicular anisotropy, (b) fundamental
relationships between electronic structure and principles of alloy design based
on chemical considerations, and (c) prospects for new magnetic-optic data
storage media based on these systems.
