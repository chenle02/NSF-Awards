Baumgartner will work on problems in the theory of forcing and on combinatorial
set theory, in particular on combinatorial problems that seem to raise
fundamental questions about forcing. Forcing is a powerful method for examining
the extremes of set theoretic behavior permitted by given axioms of set theory.
One uses it to construct models of set theory obeying the axioms, the object
being to show that some additional property does not follow from the axioms. If
one can show that neither a property nor its opposite follows from the axioms,
one has found an independence proof for that property. These are highly prized
as illuminating the foundations of set theory and thereby of all mathematics.
