This grant supports the acquisition of new computational equipment to upgrade
the facility available to the terrestrial geophysics research program at
Washington University - St. Louis. Specific equipment to be purchased will
include three Sun Fire 280R servers, three Sun Blade 1000 2-processor
workstations, 2 DLT-800 tape drives, a color printer, and a Xiotech Magnitude
SAN 612 Gb disk array. Much of the current research conducted by the 2 faculty
members and 6 Ph.D. research scientists/post-doctoral scientists in this group
has become either computationally intensive or storage intensive. Synthetic
seismograms, tomographic inversions, and inversions for geomagnetic field
variations require processor speeds that exceed current machines. Washington
University is also currently involved with four IRIS PASSCAL seismometer
deployments which will involve the processing and analysis of about 700 Gb of
seismic data. Obtaining a system of fast and reliable machines will allow this
program to carry out research in an optimal and productive manner. ***
