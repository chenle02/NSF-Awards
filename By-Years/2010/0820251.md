Proposal Number: 0820251&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Studying Design Intent for
Software Evolution and Maintenance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dewayne
Perry&lt;br/&gt;Co-PIs: Randolph Bias&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
research project is to develop an understanding of the documentation needs of
maintenance designers for software systems and to build a model of how these
maintenance designers interact with knowledge about legacy designs. Managing
evolution is one of the fundamental challenges of software engineering. During
the design process many design decisions and trade-offs concerning functional
and non-functional requirements must be considered. The process of abstracting
requirements into models and converting those models into code yields design
artifacts where decisions are documented?if at all?informally. To preserve
design decisions through maintenance, the current research approach is to
annotate architecture models with explicit representations of design decisions
as first-class entities. Unfortunately, it is clear that we lack the instruments
for evaluating the effectiveness of design decision modeling systems, for
comparing these systems to each other, and for using these analyses to drive
future research. To accomplish our research goals, we propose a course of
empirical study that uses surveys, expert interviews, and talk-through protocol
analysis as the basis for formulating a theory of maintenance design. The theory
will be tested using experimentation by protocol analysis and validated through
ethnography in real-world industrial contexts.&lt;br/&gt;
