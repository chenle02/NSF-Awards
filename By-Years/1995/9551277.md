The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Varian 300-MHz Gemini 2000 FT-NMR
spectrometer to incorporate modern NMR techniques into all laboratories in its
curriculum. Students are introduced to NMR spectroscopy in the first year and
use increasingly advanced techniques as they progress through the lab
curriculum. First-year students record 13C NMR spectra to help identify unknown
organic liquids. Organic Chemistry students record and learn to interpret 1H and
13C NMR spectra of products they generate in the lab. Physical Chemistry
students use FT-NMR to measure reaction kinetics and to calculate equilibrium
constants and other thermodynamic parameters. In other upper-level courses,
students learn more advanced FT-NMR techniques, including NMR of other nuclei,
and two-dimensional methods such as COSY and HETCOR. Students use variable
temperature FT-NMR to study conformationally mobile molecules, determine
activation barriers to molecular rotations, and probe and elucidate the chemical
structures of molecules they generate in organic and inorganic synthesis
projects.
