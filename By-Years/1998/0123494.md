This project is for The American Mathematical Society to administer a program
for selecting approximately 130 U.S. mathematicians for whom travel awards of
about $2000 each will be provided to attend the International Congress of
Mathematicians in Beijing, China, August 20-28, 2002 (ICM-02).

Held every four years, the International Congress of Mathematicians is one of
the most important gatherings of the world's leading mathematicians, where major
mathematical developments across subdisciplines are discussed. The Congress
promotes cross-fertilization among the different subcommunities of the
mathematical world. Significant U.S. representation at ICM-02 is important to
the scientific health of the nation.

Applications will be evaluated by a panel of professional mathematicians, who
use their judgment both in evaluating professional qualifications and
guaranteeing that early career and minority applicants are not overlooked. The
awards are intended to cover travel, and a portion of subsistence or
registration fee coverage, except in the case of early career mathematicians,
who will be awarded more subsistence. The AMS administered similar programs for
ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan, ICM-94 in Zurich, Switzerland and ICM-98 in Berlin,
Germany.
