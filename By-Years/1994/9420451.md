9420451 Russell ABSTRACT The purpose of the proposed project is to integrate the
basic concepts and applications of scanned probe microscopy (SPM) into the
undergraduate and entry level graduate engineering curriculum by developing
lectures, laboratories, computer modules, and video-based instructional
materials. Scanned probe microscopy (SPM) has grown, in little more than a
decade, from an instrument used only by surface scientists into a broad family
of microscopical and microanalytical techniques that are increasingly employed
for engineering applications. The rapid development of this new technology has
outpaced the supply of engineers having the appropriate training in the
fundamental aspects of scanned probe microscopy, as well as the details of
engineering applications. The proposed project will integrate these concepts and
skills into the educational program of a significant number of engineers, so as
to fill the present need, as well as facilitate advances in technology that may
result from taking advantage of SPM's unique capabilities. ***
