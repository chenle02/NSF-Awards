In the Skyrme model, baryons emerge as topological solitons from a nonlinear
theory of mesons. The relation of conventional nuclear physics to non-
perturbative QCD in terms of this model is expected to lead to a deeper
understanding of the structure of the nucleon and nuclear interactions. It is
proposed to do exact numerical calculations of the time evolution of skyrmion
scattering processes in three dimensions. The effective interaction potential
and corresponding inertia will be deduced as a function of energy. Internal
excitations of skyrmions and pion emission from solitons are expected. These
calculations would allow the first study of skyrmion-skyrmion collisions with
finite impact parameters and arbitrary relative isospin rotations. In addition,
several interesting static calculations are planned. By imposing periodic
boundary conditions, the density dependence and many-body effects for lattices
of skyrmions (skyrmion matter) can be studied. The proposed research project
involves undergraduate students at Westmont College. It will provide hands-on
experience in research and motivate and prepare students for advanced degree
studies in physics.
