Hoffman 9418862 The lively controversy now encircling geomagnetic reversal
studies--as to whether the paleomagnetic field is geographically biased during
polarity transitions--has stimulated considerable interest throughout the SEDI
community. The excitement in part comes from the possibility that these
paleomagnetic records may be capable of providing direct information about long-
term core-mantle interactions and the state of the geodynamo. The work plan is
to search out as many sequences of lava as may be accessible on Tahiti that
record field behavior during the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal. All R-N transition
zones will be subjected to radiometric age determination. A detailed sampling of
all confirmed M/B sequences will be conducted, followed by the development of a
composite record. ****
