This project is concerned with problem formulation, analysis, and large scale
computation in semi-conductor device design. The classical drift-diffusion
equations will be reviewed and more realistic boundary conditions derived.
Computation methods for steady and unsteady cases will be developed. Both MOSFET
and Bipolar devices will be considered. New physical models appropriate for
smaller devices will be developed, especially those based on a Boltzmann
equation formulation. Suitable boundary conditions and computational methods
will be derived.
