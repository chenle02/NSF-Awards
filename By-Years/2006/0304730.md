The objective of this NIRT project on Biologically Inspired Synthetic Gecko
Adhesives is to use a biologically inspired approach, where static and dynamic
measurements of gecko hair function, from the nanoscale to the whole animal will
lead to development of mechanical and adhesive models. Among the 850 recognized
species of geckos, those with design features easiest to model and fabricate
will be chosen. Mechanical models of gecko hair patches will be analyzed and
simulated to determine the conditions for robust elastic and adhesive
interactions with rough surfaces. In parallel, setal hairs and sptulae will be
nanofabricated using self-assembly of block copolymers. Measurements on low-
complexity spatula arrays will be used to refine models of biological gecko
adhesion and to guide the design of more complicated, and more functional,
synthetic gecko adhesive patches which include a flexible substrate, setal
hairs, and a hundred million nanoscale spatula tips per square centimeters.
