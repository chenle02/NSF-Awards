9457481 Swartzlander The five-year experimental effort will be executed in three
phases. (I) Develop techniques (generation and control of vortices using
computer-generated holograms or spatial light modulators, preparation of
materials), laboratory and numerical experiments, proof-of-concept
demonstrations of novel lightwave technologies (optical interconnection and
logic, optical trapping, nonlinear spatial filtering, sensing) using thermal
nonlinear media, form cross-disciplinary collaborations (some are already
underway), train Ph.D. and B.S. students, prepare lab for phase II. (II) Obtain
state-of-the-art nonlinear materials from collaborators (semiconductors, liquid
crystals, atomic vapors, doped glasses), demonstrate photonic devices, perform
linear and nonlinear experiments with optical vortex traps. (III) Establish
industrial contacts for technology transfer, identify novel nonlinear
applications including neural network schemes and self-organizing structures,
address fundamental issues such as optical turbulence, chaos, and nonlinear
scattering from single or clustered atoms. ***
