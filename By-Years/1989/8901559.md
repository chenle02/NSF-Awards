High resolution chromosomal footprinting and new genetic approaches are being
used to complement the biochemical characterization of tRNA gene transcription
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nucleoprotein structures of wild type and
selectively altered chromosomal genes will serve as guides for reconstitution
and physical characterization of transcription complexes in vitro. At the same
time, selections methods requiring reduced tRNA gene promoter strength will be
used to obtain mutations in the required trans-acting components. The effects of
the mutations on chromosomal complexes and on individual aspects of
transcription reconstitution in vitro will be tested. Genes encoding
transcription components will be cloned by complementation and characterized.
Gene products derived from the clones will be used to faciliatate biochemical
analyses. Saccharomyes cerevisiae provides vast amounts of eukaryotic
transcription protein factors and also offers a general model of expression and
regulation of class III genes. Class III polymerase is responsible for the
synthesis of a variety of small RNAs and are the most complex of the eukaryotic
enzymes. Information obtained here will probably be appropriate for higher
eukaryotic systems.
