9617369 Harvey The Education Development Center is developing mathematics
curriculum materials for the last two years of high school that complement the
emerging NSF comprehensive secondary curricula, that supplement existing high
school curricula, and that provide a method of transition from traditional
curricula to standards-based programs. The materials include modules for
students and support materials for teachers and feature: attention to the
concerns of postsecondary education and the workplace; a modular design that
allows many configurations to meet different needs; an emphasis on helping
students develop mathematical ways of thinking; an integration of continuous and
discrete topics, stressing connections among them; and teacher guides, a course
organization guide, and an implementation guide.
