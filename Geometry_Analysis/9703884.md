9703884 Zheng This project lies in the area of complex differential geometry.
The investigator earlier showed that the ration of the two Chern numbers of a
nonpositively curved compact Kahler surface is always between two and three; he
now wishes to generalize that work to higher dimensional settings. In addition,
the investigator is to pursue the remaining classification in the famous
Kodaira-Enriques classification for complex surfaces. Finally, the investigator
would like to construct a certain class of nonpositively curved Kahler
manifolds. Kahler manifolds generalize curved surfaces, and are based on complex
numbers. The Chern numbers of a Kahler manifold are certain integers that are
topologically invariant, i.e., they are quantities that are unchanged under
small deformation of the manifold. Kahler manifolds have found applications in
other parts of mathematics as well as theoretical physics. For example, the
famous Yau-Calabi spaces used in the string model of the universe are Kahler
manifolds.
