This instrument with combined ultra-high resolution (UHR) imaging and nano-
probe microanalytical capabilities will strengthen and enhance ongoing and
future research programs on semiconductors, (electro-optical materials),
ceramics, intermetallics and superconductors at North Carolina State University
at Raleigh. The microscope will operate at a maximum voltage of 200kV with
point-to-point resolution of 0.18nm. An image acquisition system combined with
appropriate digitizing and processing computer hardware/software will be
interfaced directly with the high-resolution microscope. Further, this computer
will be interfaced with the departmental VAX 11/750 to allow up and down loading
of digitized experimental images for a detailed comparison with theoretically-
calculated high resolution images.
