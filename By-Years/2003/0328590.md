The US Universities Council on Geotechnical Engineering Research (USUCGER) is an
organization of US Geotechnical Engineering professors. A three-day workshop
will be held, which will include presentations on research and teaching
objectives, and geotechnical faculty and student professional development. The
purposes are to encourage exchange of research ideas, procedures and sources of
research funding, collaboration amongst faculty and graduate students, and
improvement of geotechnical teaching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students,
and faculty from predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) are invited.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The meeting will include:&lt;br/&gt; short presentations
by all USUCGER institutions on their research projects&lt;br/&gt; a focus on
expanding research &lt;br/&gt;a) with /at Predominantly Undergraduate
Institutions &lt;br/&gt;b) with new and prospective faculty&lt;br/&gt; senior
PhD student attendance and participation&lt;br/&gt; two keynote speaker sessions
on research ideas and funding&lt;br/&gt; breakout sessions (two on day one; nine
on day two), Each was followed by joint sessions where the breakout ideas are
presented and discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research benefits will come from
the rich faculty synergism that generates new ideas, faculty experiences in
research and an improved collaboration with PUIs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational benefits of the meeting will come from
graduate students meeting with other students and faculty, educational issues
being shared and discussed, and an enhanced camaraderie and sharing of teaching
experiences. Some new directions in engineering education will be highlighted.
