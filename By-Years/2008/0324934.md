Longshore currents in the nearshore are primarily driven by the breaking of
incoming ocean waves. These currents play an important role in beach erosion
through sediment transport and in larval transport and wastewarder dispersal.
Current numerical models of these currents are commonplace but rely on
approximations that may not capture all of the small-scale processes responsible
for these flows. In particular, current models often fail when applied to barred
beaches. This project will use a vorticity model and a statistical mechanical
model to explore the effects of wave-driven vortex dynamics on the flow.
