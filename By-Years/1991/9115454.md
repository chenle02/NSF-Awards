This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program is made to
Dr. Jack Halpern of the Chemistry Department, University of Chicago, for studies
in the general area of kinetics and mechanisms of reactions for organometallic
compounds. Five areas of investigation will be pursued: asymmetric catalytic
hydrogenation reactions; dissociation energies of transition metal-alkyl bonds;
catalytic properties of transition metal polyhydrides; alkyl transfer and iron-
carbon bond dissociation energies for alkyl iron porphyrin compounds; and
oxidative addition reactions of Rh and Ir metalloporphyrins. The asymmetric
hydrogenation of acrylic acid derivatives and transfer hydrogenation reactions
will be investigated. Studies on the polyhydrides will include reactions
involving hydrogen transfer, hydrogenation, and reductive elimination. %%% Some
catalysts, like enzymes, promote reactions in which not only a certain
arrangement of atoms is achieved, but only one of two possible three-dimensional
arrangements. Understanding the mechanism of such "asymmetric catalysis"
reactions is important in order to be able to develop new catalysts which can
behave with this specificity in a variety of reactions. Asymmetric catalysts
promise to find broad use in organic synthesis, biological modeling studies, and
the pharmaceutical industry. Iron porphyrin studies may have relevance to
reactions of iron-containing enzymes.
