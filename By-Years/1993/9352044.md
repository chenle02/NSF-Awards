The Electrical Engineering Department at West Virginia Institute of Technology
is initiating the development of a comprehensive laboratory to provide "hands-
on" training in control and robotics. There are five workstations. The main
components of these workstations are: a robot arm, a servo mechanism, an IBM 486
computer and Computer-Aided Control Engineering. The lab is flexible enough to
allow students to investigate classical and modern control techniques for a wide
variety of applications and use of neural networks and fuzzy logic in control.
