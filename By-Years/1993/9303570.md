The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Professors De Lucia and Herbst in high-frequency
microwave spectroscopy with emphasis on the collisional tranfer of rotational
energy and the spectroscopy of molecular ions. Novel low-temperature line-
broadening studies are underway to lead to increased understanding of the energy
transfer mechanism. The techniques are also ideally suited to the investigation
of the identity and structure of molecular ions. %%% When a beam of gas
molecules is rapidly expanded, it cools to temperatures as low as 1K, giving an
opportunity to study a number of spectroscopic properties uncomplicated by
vibrational effects seen at higher temperatures. An apparatus employing this
effect is being used to study the transfer of energy between colliding molecules
and the structure of molecular ions.
