ABSTRACT Children who experience difficulties in their social relationships
with their peers are at risk for later problems of social and emotional
adjustment. However, little is known about the antecedents of these individual
differences across children. This research will explore the contributions of the
family in the development of social competence with peers. Children and their
families (both mothers and fathers) have been followed yearly since kindergarten
and will be evaluated again when they are in grade 3, during the current grant
period. The research will evaluate several aspects of this issue, namely: (1)
the impact of parent-child interaction on peer relationships, (2) the impact of
the parent as advisor and (3) the role of the parent as a provider of
opportunities for contact with other children. A multimethod, longitudinal
approach will be used involving self- report and observational measures in both
naturalistic and laboratory contexts. The research will focus on emotional
processes including children's emotional understanding and cognitive
representations of social relationships. Also to be examined is the role of the
social context, the neighborhood, in determining parental management activities
and children's social behavior. The research will permit us to identify (1) the
changing role of the three parental influence sources across time (2) the
relative importance of these three sets of strategies as a function of
children's social acceptance and (3) the cross time relationships between
changes in these strategies and changes in children's peer acceptance. This
research will help identify how families contribute to the development of
children's social behavior with their peers and suggest strategies for the
modification of family patterns that would, in turn, lead to improvements in
children's social competence.
