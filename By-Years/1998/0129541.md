Much good Internet research is being frustrated by an inability to&lt;br/&gt;
deploy experimental router software at points in the network where it&lt;br/&gt;
makes most sense. This problem affects a wide range of research,&lt;br/&gt;
including routing protocols themselves, active queue management&lt;br/&gt;
schemes, and so-called "middlebox" functionality such as intrusion&lt;br/&gt;
detection systems. Research becomes unrealistic because of the&lt;br/&gt;
difficulty of experimenting under real network conditions; often
ideas&lt;br/&gt; never make it out of the network
simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To address these problems, the XORP project
will develop a complete&lt;br/&gt; open-source router software platform, from
forwarding path to routing&lt;br/&gt; protocols, using an architecture that
permits extensibility whilst at&lt;br/&gt; the same time providing stable well-
performing basic router&lt;br/&gt; functionality. The vision is of an integrated
router software&lt;br/&gt; platform running on off-the-shelf hardware, that is
sufficiently well&lt;br/&gt; performing and reliable to see production service
in a wide range of&lt;br/&gt; network conditions. The software architecture will
be designed with&lt;br/&gt; extensibility in mind from the start. The goal is
for Internet&lt;br/&gt; researchers needing access to router software to have a
common&lt;br/&gt; platform for experimentation; this will provide all the basic
router&lt;br/&gt; functionality that the researcher can then use to perform
measurements&lt;br/&gt; or augment with new protocol functionality.&lt;br/&gt;
