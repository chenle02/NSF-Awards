This project will use computer shape matching algorithms to assemble the
remaining fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae, a giant marble map of ancient
Rome. The original, measuring 60 feet wide by 45 feet high, dates to the second
century AD. The map now consists of 1,163 fragments, and is incomplete. Piecing
the remaining fragments together is a unique challenge for computer graphics
research. If successful, it will offer to archeologists a resource of great
importance. In order to test the graphics algorithms the raw data was acquired
at great cost and effort. A team of faculty and students from Stanford spent a
month on site digitizing the shape and surface appearance of every known
fragment using laser scanning and digital color photography. The processed raw
data now consists of 8 billion polygons and 6 thousand color images, amounting
to 40GB of data. The project hopes to produce and disseminate a database of 3D
models and photographs of this famous archaeological document and in the
process, contribute new algorithms for shape matching for objects of
kind.&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;
