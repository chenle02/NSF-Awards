The aim of this project is to enhance the undergraduate control engineering
curriculum in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at Oakland
University via modernization and expansion of the current control engineering
facilities. The major laboratory equipment may be categorized as follows: 1) a
pneumatic and hydraulic hardware-in-the-loop computer-based control experiment
system, 2) a diesel engine simulator-control system, 3) two computer-aided
control system design (CACSD) workstation with advanced graphics and software
support, 4) two microcomputer-based controller hardware development stations for
8/16/32-bit microprocessors and digital signal processors, and 5) an electronic
industrial sensors module. The equipment will be used to strengthen junior and
senior offerings by introducing new laboratory experiments and projects in
specific courses. A well-planned sequence of laboratory assignment involving
analysis, design, simulation and experimentation will expose students to strong
hands-on experience in an Integrated Computer Control Systems Engineering
Laboratory (ICCSEL) environment. By incorporating the proposed hardware-and
simulator-in-the-loop systems, students will become more familiar with
applications, components, signal processing, computer-aided design and tools,
implementation, and computer hardware technology for control engineering.
