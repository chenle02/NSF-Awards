The Chemistry Department is developing several chemistry courses to attract non-
majors including a popular one with a forensic science perspective. A laboratory
experience accompanies each of these courses so that non-majors experience the
type of thinking that a laboratory experience brings. Modern instrumentation is
a part of this laboratory experience including computer control of instruments
with data handling and manipulation by computer.A spectrofluorometer is being
used in several courses, but especially the forensic science course for non-
majors. Students are determining fluorescent spectra of motor oils and magic
markers and comparing the spectra obtained by other students to determine
whether oils and markers can be distinguished by their spectra. Students are
getting experience with manipulation and comparison of the spectra by computer
software. The fluorometer is being used in courses for majors as well.
