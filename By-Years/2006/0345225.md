Proposal # DBI-BDI: 0345225 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Thiers
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New York
Botanical Garden has been awarded a grant in collaboration with Yale University
and the University of Illinois to create a system to image specimens in natural
history collections (plant specimens in this case), use Optical Character
Recognition (OCR), Natural Handwriting Recognition (NHR) and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to read the labels on the specimens and parse the label data
into its component fields, then enter the data into a database. Modular,
configurable, open source web services will provide interoperability and
scalability in mirrored, distributed environments. This project will make the
data capture of natural history collections much more efficient and lower the
associated time and costs per specimen digitized.&lt;br/&gt;
