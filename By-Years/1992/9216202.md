This Institutional Infrastructure award is for the support of research projects
in experimental and implementation aspects of distributed and parallel
computing. The funds will support the acquisition of a parallel computer and for
the support staff to maintain it. The research supported includes systems and
programming issues for parallel machines, parallel algorithms, and dynamic
visualization. The High Performance Computing, Communications and Information
Technology initiative recognizes as important to the nations future the
development of new architecture computers to solve problems which now cannot be
solved on computers. This infrastructure award gives the University of
California, Santa Barbara the equipment necessary to participate in this
research initiative.
