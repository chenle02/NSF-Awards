Twin Cities Public Television is producing 13 new episodes and new outreach and
Web activities for the fourth season of DragonflyTV, the weekly science
television series targeted at children ages 9-12. The series presents authentic
inquiry-based investigations, created by and for children. The programs focus on
children doing their own scientific investigations and sharing the excitement
that comes from making their own discoveries. The programs also include real
scientists doing research on related themes and snapshots and home movies of the
scientists when they were kids. Outreach for DragonflyTV consists of an
interactive website where children can share their science investigation,
programs at selected Boys and Girls Clubs of America and 4H Clubs, Teacher's
Guides distributed through the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) and
PBS stations, and the development of new community partnerships with established
informal science organizations. Multimedia research and Rockman et al will
conduct formative and summative evaluations.
