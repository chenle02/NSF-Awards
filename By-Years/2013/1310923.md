This action funds Wai Keung Chu of the University of California at San Diego to
conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Tsinghua
University in Beijing. The project title is "Analyzing Single Cells from
Unculturable Samples." The host scientist is Professor Peng Liu.

Relatively few unculturable species of bacteria have been discovered and
sequenced due to conventional approaches that require many cells from "clonal"
cultures. A Lab-on-a-Chip device has proven the concept to identify some known
species of bacteria from a mixed population of uncultured bacteria by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and flow cytometry integration
(FlowFISH). This project integrates on-chip cell sorting to FlowFISH that
attempts to isolate a targeted uncultured single cell for polymeric chain
reaction (PCR) characterization. This project will allow quick and direct
detection of bacteria that appear in uncultured samples, such as water, soil, or
different clinical samples from the human body. The benefits to society may
include quicker response to bacterial contamination in the environment and
elucidation of the relationship between disease and human microbiome.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the resulting publications of this technology
will be shared in the public domain, and among the scientific communities which
attempt to detect uncultured samples, such as water, soil, or different clinical
samples from the human body.
