With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at the University of New Mexico (UNM) will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer with CCD detector and low-temperature system. Some of the
research projects that this instrument will support include: preparation of
metal complexes and compounds for fixation of carbon dioxide, olefin
oligomerization catalysts, and lanthanide- and actinide-ion separations;
structural studies in main group and coordination chemistry; and studies of
catalysis in pyranopterin molybdenum enzymes and and in using cobalt as a
spectroscopic probe of catalytic Zn enzymes. The UNM Chemistry Department will
include X-ray crystallography as part of the teaching curriculum in at least two
upper-level undergraduate courses and two laboratory classes, as well as at
least one graduate-level class. Due to the ethnic diversity of the UNM student
population, many chemistry students from traditionally under-represented groups
will participate in courses and research projects having X-ray crystallography
as a core technique. This is true of the other New Mexico universities that will
also make use of the new instrument.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. Such structural studies have a
large impact in a number of areas, especially in the synthesis of important
organic and inorganic chemicals and in understanding chemical interactions with
biomolecules.
