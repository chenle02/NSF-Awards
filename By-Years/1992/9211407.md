With the advent of high speed circuits and mixed analog-digital designs, it is
important to make sure designs are insensitive to manufacturing process
variations. Designs must protect against two types of faults: catastrophic-short
and open circuits, and parametric where circuits fail due to parameters
deviating too far from their nominal values. This research is on statistical
simulation of analog and mixed signal systems. Three research problems are being
pursued. First, a SPICE-based macromodeling approach to reducing the simulation
time of analog components is being used. An algorithm for finding the best
parameters, given the performance needs is being sought. Second, both circuit
level and macromodel level statistical process models for analog components are
being explored. Algorithms for worst case analysis and for computing parametric
yield, which are attuned to the complex parameter models of the analog circuit
manufacturing process are being developed. Third, a new catastrophic fault model
is the basis of algorithms for efficiently computing catastrophic fault coverage
of test sets. From this information catastrophic yield of analog components can
be computed.
