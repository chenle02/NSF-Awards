To improve the biology undergraduate curriculum a spectrum of laboratory
experiences in cellular and molecular biology were introduced that were not
previously included in the curriculum of the college, which serves a significant
number of women and Hispanics. Biology majors enrolled in Cellular and Molecular
Biology, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Genetics, and Microbiology are
affected by the acquisition of equipment used to establish a cell and tissue
culture room with facilities to carry out "in vitro" laboratory exercises with
animal cells. The equipment improves the technical capabilities for
fractionation, separation, detection and analysis of different macromolecular
