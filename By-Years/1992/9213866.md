The purpose of this project is to complete the research for a book to explore
the interaction of the ideology of human perfectability and reproductive science
and technology. The author argues that, in the wake of the new sciences and
technologies of reproduction, standards are being set for the "perfect child,"
echoing an older ideal, the "perfect man." The book examines trends, counter-
trends and alternatives to pressures for a new health hierarchy of birth. This
grant will enable the investigator to study works in feminist and postmodern
philosophy that provide a way of examining the idea of human perfectibility and
reproductive science and technology within a network of intersecting, unequal
power relationships. Drawing especially on feminist interpretations of the
European philosopher Michel Foucault, the investigator finds a framework for
illustrating how perfectibility standards are emerging, not through grand
design, but through the intersection of the discourses and practices of
differently situated groups: through medical professionals, parents,
researchers, set against persisting negative attitudes toward people with
disabilities. Feminist postmodernism provides a way of heeding counter-voices
from genetic support groups, concerned medical personnel, parents of affected
children -- of linking them together and thus of offering alternative directions
for reporductive science and technology and for framing procreative values and
norms.
