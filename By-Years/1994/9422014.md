real-time control and visual sensing hardware, to support research in five
robotics projects in the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science. The research projects include parallel vibratory parts orientation,
rigid body manipulations, dynamical acquisition of multiple objects, gestural
input recognition systems for remote robot guidance and remote teleoperation,
and dynamically interpreted gestural control. ***
