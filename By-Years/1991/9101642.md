Theis is a theoretical study of the dynamics of hydrothermal processes beneath
ridge.crest thermal areas. A theoretical analog of the natural system has been
designed to facilitate analyses of the interaction among processes that
redistribute energy and mass from the pluton sized magma bodies near the bottom
of the ocean crust through percolation networks in the overlying rocks. The
objective of the study is to predict the magnitude and periodicity of long and
short term variations of field parameters in the subsurface beneath active hot
springs that are caused by local feedbacks amongst the transport processes. The
study will focus primarily on the behavior of hydrothermal activity at state
conditions that coincide with the near field of the critical region of the
fluid.
