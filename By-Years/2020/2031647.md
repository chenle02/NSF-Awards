Open science practices have gained widespread adoption, globally, with the help
of federal funding and&lt;br/&gt;publisher policies, as well as the increasing
visibility and growing awareness of the value of sharing&lt;br/&gt;work. This
has been largely evident in light of the current COVID19 pandemic, with data
sharing driving&lt;br/&gt;many areas of research, and open software resources
must evolve to meet the needs of researchers. To meet the emerging demands and
growing requirements of the research community who need support for both data
and software sharing, Dryad and California Digital Library partnered in 2018 and
Dryad and Zenodo partnered in 2019. These partnerships have allowed for the
three organizations to re-think the data and publishing processes, explore ways
for data curation, software preservation, and for output re-use to be tied
together more seamlessly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a one-day,
invitational workshop bringing together researchers and adjacent community
members with diverse backgrounds to discuss needs, challenges, and priorities
for re-using research data and software. The goal of the meeting is to develop
pathways for consistent engagement with individuals and groups across the
diverse scientific disciplines in order to be connected with and responsive to
researchers' needs and goals. Meeting topics include dataset re-use, deposition
guidance, curation standards and requirements, integrations and relationships
between data and code, and advocacy and adoption. The anticipated outputs are a
set of requirements and needs to better enable data and software sharing and re-
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
