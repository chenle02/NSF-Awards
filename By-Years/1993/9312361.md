This award provides partial support for a symposium entitled "The Past, Present
and Future of Plant Biology" to be held on May 27 - 29, 1993 at Washington
University. The symposium is organized to celebrate the life-long achievements
of Dr. Joseph E. Varner. The program is designed to encompass major past and
present achievements in broad areas of plant sciences as well as future research
directions in plant biology. Three major sessions include; (1) from structure
and function to molecule, (2) from molecules back to structure and function, and
(3) on the horizon. Speakers are encouraged to speculate and discuss the
implications of their research findings for future directions in plant biology
research, which the organizers hope will promote discussions among the
participants. The NSF award will specifically support graduate students and
postdocs attend this symposium and be exposed to a slightly different kind of
discussion from that of traditional research conferences.
