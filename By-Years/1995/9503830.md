Problems in propositional logic, such as Boolean satisfiability, are studied
from the point of view of developing practical algorithms, although the problems
are often NP-complete or co-NP-complete. Such problems are of practical
importance in VLSI design verification, test generation, related CAD
applications, as well as automated verification. Many other applications also
occur naturally. E.g., higher order theorem provers require a satisfiability
checker as a module. Recent hardware advances bring solution of some of these
problems within reach. Algorithms are being implemented and tested for
performance in typical applications, such as test pattern generation, sequential
circuit verification, and program verification. Model search (usually called the
Davis-Putnam method) and resolution are two well known, but somewhat
conflicting, strategies for solving propositional satisfiability. Model search
``succeeds'' by discovering a satisfying assignment, whereas resolution
``succeeds'' by detecting that no such assignment exists. Some work on combining
the two ideas in one algorithm has recently appeared. This project investigates
more powerful combinations of these methods. Besides resolution, recognition can
be valuable. The goal is to identify contexts in which resolution, equality
recognition, and other inferences can be beneficial in reducing the search
space. Equally important is to find implementations, usually requiring advanced
data structures. Another goal is the development of application-independent
methods. Heuristics described in the literature for particular applications are
examined to determine whether the application content can be abstracted away,
making the heuristic applicable to a logic problem without knowing its origin.
