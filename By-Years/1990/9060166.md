There is substantial need for new sensors which measure absolute distance for
applications in robotic positioning, machine vision, automatic inspection and
gauging. With its ability to measure non-continuous changes in position, the
sensor could provide feedback measurements for closed loop position control for
robots, CMMs and machine tools. For automatic inspection, a highly accurate
distance measuring sensor will reduce the need for mechanical touch probes which
are very slow. For machine vision, the ability to measure range will eliminate
the need for complicated algorithms which extract information from intensity
images. The researchers will study and classify the applications of sensor
technology in the machine tool industry and carryout experiments to demonstrate
its applicability to one machine tool sensor need: the measurement of material
removed by a grinding machine, and determine a preliminary design for an
integrated optic version of the sensor.
