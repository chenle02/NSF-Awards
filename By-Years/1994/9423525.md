labarabs.doc 9423525 LaBarbera This research is directed toward understanding
the evolution of swimming locomotion in bony fish, the most diverse group of
vertebrates. It will demonstrate how muscle structure and function change during
development in each of four families of fish, and how those changes affect the
"fast- start" ability of the fish. The research will show what changes in muscle
anatomy or physiology underlie superior locomotor performance in fish, and show
how such changes are correlated with evolutionary success. The results will lead
to increased understalding of the constraints that muscle development place on
the ecology of larval fish, with possible application in managing populations of
particular species.
