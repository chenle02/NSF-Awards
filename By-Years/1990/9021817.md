This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Kentucky for the
renovation and repair of the Chemistry-Physics Building which houses the
Department of Chemistry and the Department of Physics and Astronomy. This
building was constructed in 1960 and last renovated in 1988. The ARFMP grant of
$690,000 and $4,025,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities. This project will
address the need to improve the current research infrastructure both in terms of
health and safety and of the quality of research that can be conducted by
providing fume hoods that are in compliance with current codes, by insuring the
adequacy of air-handling exhaust systems, and by removing and replacing all
transite (cement asbestos) duct work. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment not only for
research in chemistry and physics but also more broadly, because these
departments have a central role in various interdisciplinary programs at the
University of Kentucky and because a number of faculty and students from other
state institutions in the area utilize these facilities.
