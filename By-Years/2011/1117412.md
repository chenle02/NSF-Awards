This project aims to build a reliable and efficient communication support for
highly mobile ad hoc networks. This type of networks many time are mission or
safety critical requiring reliable communication. For an ad hoc network, this
problem is especially challenging because two communication nodes may have never
encountered before and do not possibly belong to the same organization. Pre-
sharing any information between two nodes may not be feasible. This project
addresses a number of adversary attacks in highly mobile ad hoc networks,
including communication jamming and eavesdropping, by building a supporting
communication layer. More precisely, the main research in this project is to
design novel schemes to defend against jamming attacks by agilely changing
communication channels, and extract physical layer information to build a secure
communication channel. The supporting communication layer provides a secure
infrastructure for efficient communications. The project applies both
theoretical analysis and real experiments to validate the solutions.
