The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Richard
Hetnarski of the Rochester Institute of Technology and Dr. Jozef Ignaczak of the
Polish Institute of Fundamental Technology Research is to analyze wave
propagation in generalized thermoelastic solids. The researchers hope to gain a
better understanding of interactions between the mechanical and thermal fields
in a continuum. Efforts will emphasize fundamental work pertaining to
temperature-rate dependent thermoelasticity (TRDT) theory and nonlinear dynamic
coupled thermoelasticity (NDCT) theory. Results are expected to contribute to
our basic knowledge of the principles underlying high-temperature
superconductivity and semiconductor processing. This engineering project in
solid mechanics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge
by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
compelmentary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
