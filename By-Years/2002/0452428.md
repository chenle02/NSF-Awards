Filippelli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abtsract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal
of the project is to evaluate Phosphorus accumulation rates at an array of sites
using ODP cores and targeting glacial-interglacial (G-I) time scales. These P
accumulation rates (PAR) will then be used to construct time-dependent mass
balance for the oceans, to evaluate how this has changed on G-I time scales.
Subsidiary goals are to contrast PAR to other proxies for bioactive elements.
The understanding how the P budget evolves through time is important for
insights into how the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.&lt;br/&gt;
