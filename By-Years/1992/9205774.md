A detailed field and experimental investigation of the mechanisms responsible
for fault zone weakness will be conducted by collaborators with expertise in the
natural and experimental deformation of rocks. The study will concentrate on
fault gauge from the San Andreas, Punchbowl and San Gabriel faults as these
faults are thought to have slipped under small resolved shear stresses. The
results of this study will provide an independent estimate of the mechanisms
responsible for slip localization along faults of the San Andreas system, and
will be of considerable importance to studies of major shallow-level fault zones
worldwide.
