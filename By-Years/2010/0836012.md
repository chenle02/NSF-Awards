Proposal SBE 0836012: PSLC&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a
proposal to renew PSLC, the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center for an
additional and final five year term. PSLC is situated at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, with the University of Pittsburgh as the principle
partner institution. Like all Science of Learning Centers, PSLC is a multi-
university, multi-year, interdisciplinary project to address the theoretical and
practical issues involved in conducting rigorous laboratory-quality studies of
learning in real-world classrooms enhanced with intelligent tutoring systems.
Central to the vision of investigators is a focus on the conditions that enable
"robust learning", learning that transfers to new situations, lasts for a long
time and accelerates future learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the data
generated is collected in large data-bases for mining by the broad community of
learning researchers, not just by those associated with
PSLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a research center, PSLC is also
committed to the education of undergraduates, graduate students and post-
doctoral students; to increasing diversity among faculty, students and future
scientists, and to the transfer of research results to educational practice.
