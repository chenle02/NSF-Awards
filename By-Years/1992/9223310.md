This action is to provide travel fellowships and participant support costs for
young American scientists to attend the 1993 International Symposium on
cholecystokinin, (CCK) a peptide occurring in the brain and intestine. This
meeting is to be held May 19-22, 1993 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. New
breakthroughs in this rapidly advancing area make this 1993 symposium very
timely for dissemination of information and the fostering of interdisciplinary
collaborations. Moreover, this symposium provides a forum for interactions of
some of the most outstanding investigators from throughout the world with young
American scientists. These exciting advances including the elucidation of the
structure of the CCK receptor and the development of new non- peptide agonists
and antagonist specific for CCK receptor subtypes will be addressed in the
state-of-the-art lectures. The topics of the session include the biochemistry
and molecular biology of CCK and its receptors; the pharmacology of CCK and its
antagonists; and the neurophysiology and gastrointestinal physiology of CCK.
Moreover, current issues on the role of CCK in satiety and disease will also be
extensively explored. These and other advances will most certainly lead to a
better understanding of the important role of CCK in gastrointestinal physiology
and in central nervous system function.
