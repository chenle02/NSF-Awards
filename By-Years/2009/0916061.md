The proposed research addresses the problem of identifying and providing source
code-based understanding of obfuscated malcode plaguing the Internet. Obfuscated
malcode presents a clear and present danger to today?s society in terms of
individual privacy, security as well as to the Internet?s overall
trustworthiness. Attackers continue to use obfuscation to successfully defeat
attempts by defenders to prevent infection or spread of the malcode.
&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research will be to develop dynamic binary analysis
processes for Internet worm executables. These processes will be used to create
a reverse engineering framework to create assembly code from worm machine code
and in turn create associated control and data flow graphs. Generalizations of
instruction sequences, known as motifs, are extracted from these graphs using
new techniques based in part on program slicing and will be applied against
models of worm behavior described in terms of state machine, decision tree or
family tree models; partial or complete matching against these models will yield
knowledge of worm interactions with its target environment, its obfuscation
techniques and its means of command, control and update by the
attacker.&lt;br/&gt;This research will help to assess if control and data flow
graphs can represent any obfuscated malcode. In case some malcode cannot be
represented using these graphs, other representations will be investigated. The
accuracy of the malcode representation will be evaluated since the
representation will be based mainly on system call analysis. Finally, several
combinations of static and dynamic analyses will be studied to assess the impact
on the malcode representation details.&lt;br/&gt;
