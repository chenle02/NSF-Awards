This award for a long term visit to the United Kingdom will support
collaborative research in geometric analysis and differential geometry between
Steven Rosenberg of Boston University, K.D. Elworthy of the University of
Warwick, and T. Lyons of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. The
investigators propose to apply probabilistic and classical geometric methods to
problems in differential geometry. They will study Riemannian manifolds and
their applications to topology and geometry of manifolds. Three problems will be
investigated: (1) The Hopf conjecture for the Euler characteristic of negatively
curved manifolds; (2) a method for extending Bochner's and Myers' theorems for
positively curved manifolds; and (3) a method for yeilding soft eigenvalue
estimates for the Laplacian using a modification of the Fukaya method. The later
problem will be developed with Dr. T. Lyons of the University of Edinburgh.
Manifolds are a fundamental concept in many areas of mathematics and physics.
This collaboration offers an innovative approach to studying these problems by
combining the complementary expertise of the U.S. and British investigators in
classical differential geometry and in probability respectively.
