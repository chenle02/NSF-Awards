9522981 Musavi Lignin holds wood fibers together, and must be removed to produce
high strength pulp for kraft paper. The Kappa- or K-number indicates the degree
of lignin removal by a pulping process, and is probably the key variable for
measuring quality in this process. A difficulty is that it is an off-line
measurement. More importantly, there is usually a four hour process delay
between when raw materials enter a pulping digester and when the K-number is
measured. This makes modeling and control difficult. This Grant Opportunity for
Academic Liaison with Industry project uses neural network models to predict
K-number as a function of a number of more readily available process parameters.
This is a first step in improving the control and responsiveness of this process
to changes in chip feed stock. The research team from the University of Maine
and S.D. Warren Company will develop characterization and prediction models
using data from an operating plant, and compare their long term predicative
capability when integrated into digester operations. Throughout, seminar and
workshops are part of the technology transfer and model improvement. The impact
of this research will be more uniform quality of pulp, even with variable feed
stock, and more uniform quality in subsequent bleaching and papermaking
processes.
