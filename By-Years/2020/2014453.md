The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project advances the translation of
hydrogen technologies in heavy duty and ultra-duty applications. The hydrogen
economy could generate an estimated $2.5 T in economic value in the
manufacturing, transportation, energy storage, and building energy, sectors.
Current membranes that require high humidity levels and low temperatures for
operation complicates fuel cell thermal and water management components in heavy
duty fuel cell systems. The proposed solution advances the development of a new
membrane serving as a drop-in replacement to enable low humidity and elevated
operating temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will use
porous polymer supports to translate a nanocomposite material that exhibits both
low humidity and elevated temperature proton conductivity into a standardized
solution for a proton exchange membranes. Furthermore, the composite materials
will be added at high volume fractions to confer additional benefits in
mechanical stability and lower gas permeability. The project activities include
material translation into supported membranes, membrane composite formulation
optimization, measurements of key membrane properties, and demonstration in a
fuel cell stack. If successful, the project would yield new proton exchange
membranes that enable operation under low humidity â€“ elevated temperature
conditions to simplify fuel cell systems while extending system
durability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
