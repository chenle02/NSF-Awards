The primary goal of this project is to help students improve their relational
reasoning, that is, a way of attending to and recognizing relations, including
commonalities and differences, between mathematical objects and concepts.
Relational reasoning has been shown to support learners in developing their
problem-solving skills, skills that are helpful not only in mathematics, but
also in subjects like science, engineering, and healthcare, where strong
reasoning skills are important for learning and problem solving. The project
studies aim to identify instructional supports that help students develop a
“relational mindset” as well as to enhance their conceptual flexibility in
problem solving.

Drawing on cognitive science literature on relational reasoning, the project
includes three experimental studies designed to test whether directing students'
attention toward relations can foster a relational mindset and consequently
enhance students' conceptual flexibility. The studies include a) explicitly
directing students’ attention to mathematical relations through classroom
discourse; b) implicitly priming relational attention through completing a
relevant task; and c) engaging students in antithetical thinking during
practice. Analyses will include both descriptive analyses and multiple
regression analyses. Study results will provide insights into effective
instructional approaches designed to foster students’ attention to and
interaction with mathematical relations.

This project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
(STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and
practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related
disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied
research that advances knowledge within the field.
