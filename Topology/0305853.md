Algebraic topology is an area which examines properties of shapes not affected
by continuous deformation: in a traditional example, a coffee cup made out of
modelling clay can be continuously, without gluing or tearing,deformed into the
shape of a donut, but not a solid ball (because of the `hole' in the handle).
Sophisticated methods using algebra, primarily groups, were developed to
describe and explain such concepts. String theory is an area of theoretical
physics which is currently the best candidate for solving the greatest puzzle of
modern physics, namely unification of gravity with the other forces of nature.
The fundamental idea of string theory is that very small particles may not be
`dots', but $1$-dimensional objects (`strings'). The present project focuses on
connections between algebraic topology and string theory. While physicists know
about the fact that topology is connected to the phenomenology of strings, the
present project explores connections of a new nature. Notably, algebraic
topology is needed in making the concepts of string theory mathematically
rigorous, which in turn is a necessary step toward possibly using such concepts
for scientific prediction. On the other hand, string theory suggests exciting
new methods for algebraic topology, which will also be explored in this project.

The investigator will continue to work on using string theory to construct
mathematical models for elliptic cohomology. He will also consider extending
these methods to finding generalized cohomology theories related to D-branes and
M-theory. In the process, he will work on mathematical theories which will serve
as axiomatic systems for fundamental and extended objects of string theory. Many
aspects of this project are joint work with Po Hu.
