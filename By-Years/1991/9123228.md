Many polar fishes produce macromolecular antifreezes that act in non-colligative
way to prevent freezing. Some arctic fishes in the Smelt and Greenling families
use a novel method to avoid freezing. These fishes increase the freezing point
depression of their body fluids by producing high concentrations of glycerol in
winter. This study will focus on the high glycerol concentrations in arctic
fishes and the physiological and biochemical implications they have on water
balance, kidney and gill function, and metabolism of energy stores. Conservation
of glycerol by the kidney and gills will be investigated by measuring glomerular
filtration rate, urine flow, drinking rate and permeability of the gills to
glycerol. Because glycerol is present only in winter, seasonal variations in
these parameters will be determined. The source and fate of glycerol will be
determined with assays of glycogen, lipid and key enzymes using cold- and warm-
acclimated fish. Additional studies will be conducted to determine the maximum
concentrations of glycerol that occur in cold-acclimated fishes, the
environmental conditions that regulate its production, and the occurrence of
glycerol in other species. A puzzling characteristic of the smelts is that they
have both colligative and non-colligative antifreezes. Further studies will be
undertaken to explain why two different antifreezes are needed in these species.
