The laboratory course in instrumental analysis in the contemporary chemistry
curriculum suffers from a tension between the teaching of the functional details
of instruments versus the overall process of chemical analysis. Analytical
chemistry as practiced in industry and elsewhere requires an understanding of
the overall process. This project addresses that need by the incorporation of an
analytical method development project into the laboratory. Students choose one
inorganic (mineral) and organic (i.e. vitamin) component of a processed food
product such as infant milk formula or fortified cereal to analyze. They
research analytical methods in the chemical literature, exercise critical
evaluation in choosing methods, and develop independent thinking as the analyses
are carried out. The High Performance Liquid Chromatograph acquired through this
project is crucial to the success of many of the organic analyses that students
encounter in the exercises. The institution contributed to the project in an
amount equal to the NSF funds.
