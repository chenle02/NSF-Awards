The objective of this project is to develop a new process for Ta chemical vapor
deposition (CVD). The deposition of TaN and Ta-Si-N films have potential
applications in microelectronics, but useful methods for forming them have not
been reported. The reactants will be TaF5 and SiH4. Calculations suggest that
these materials are the simplest commercially available compounds that have
favorable thermodynamics for producing Ta metal while avoiding silicide
formation. Films will be deposited over a range of operating conditions and
characterization measurements will determine whether Ta metal is being deposited
cleanly and uniformly. Training of graduate students will be the primary
educational impact. The results of this project may have a significant impact on
the microelectronics industry. Tantalum and mixed Ta/TaNx thin films are the
leading candidates for diffusion barrier layers, which are essential for
advanced interconnect technology based on copper metallization. The proposed
work should also enhance the fundamental understanding of early transition metal
chemistry. The mechanistic implications of the observed kinetics may be useful
for subsequently developing an alternating layer deposition technology for the
reactants used in this study.
