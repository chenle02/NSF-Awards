DMS Proposal #9622841 PI: Dr. Maria Girardi University of South Carolina @
Columbia Girardi's ultimate goal is to gain a better understanding of Functional
Analysis; her approach is to examine the interplay between its various sub-
areas; at this time, her main thrust is in the branch of Banach Space Theory.
She will continue her work, in which she has made progress over the past years,
on several (related) long-standing problems in Banach space theory that are
centered around the Radon-Nikodym Property. She will also continue examining the
Bochner-Lebesgue space and begin a new project that ties together Functional
Analysis and Homological Algebra. Roughly speaking, a Banach space is a
collection of points that has, among other things, a way to measure the
"distance" between any two points. An example is the 3-D Euclidean (ordinary)
space. Another example is the space of "suitably nice" functions (so a point in
this type of Banach space is a function) with distance suitably clarified. A
practical application of Banach space theory is compact disc coding; a sound
signal is, roughly speaking, a function in a suitable Banach space.
Unfortunately the sound signal contains too much information to store on the CD
so the signal is approximated by an element from the Banach space that is close
to the true element (this is where the notion of distance enters). Understanding
the structure of Banach spaces aids in the above, and other, practical
applications.
