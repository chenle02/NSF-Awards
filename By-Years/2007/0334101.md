This project will design and produce 200,000 copies of an Ice Age Trail map that
interprets for informal learners (tourist travelers, local residents, school
students) the late Quaternary history of eastern coastal Maine, glaciated North
America and the north Atlantic region. The map will lead geo/eco-travelers along
public roads to critical stops where they can observe glacial, glaciomarine and
vegetation features, as well as historical and human events described and
interpreted on the map in photos, diagrams and text. The travelers will be drawn
from the approximately 4 million visitors to Maine's coastal state and national
parks. Additional dissemination will be via web cast through at least five
separate websites.
