ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Barry Dellinger of Louisiana
State University &amp; Agricultural and Mechanical College is developing
multiple path FTIR spectroscopy for the detection of the presence and movement
of toxic or reactive chemical plumes. The idea is to combine multiple FTIR
measurements over open paths to construct an accurate map, in real time, of the
concentrations of the chemical species over a specific geographic area. The work
is to conduct laboratory experimentation and computer simulation to obtain the
critical design parameters for the construction of a field deployable system.
Two post-doctoral fellows, a graduate assistant and a research assistant
professor will be involved in this work on FTIR-tomography. The project will be
used to recruit undergraduate students into the NSF-REU program at LSU in
summer, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the NSF
and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in
the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in
basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to
national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
