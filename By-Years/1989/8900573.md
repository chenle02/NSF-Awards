This award provides funds to the Department of Sociology at Eastern Montana
College to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. Data
collection and data analysis are two of the basic skills an independent
researcher must master. The project will attempt to foster technical competence
in students, their skills in the collection of data through survey and in
quantitative analysis through the uses of SPSS-X. Equally importantly, if not
even more so, this project will attempt to cultivate in students the unique
sense of joy and excitement from the research process itself in general, and the
ability to generate research "findings" in particular. The PI will target Native
American undergraduate students to participate in this program.
