Next-generation high-end machines will include interconnected computer nodes,
each having heterogeneous accelerators and multi-core CPUs with complex memory
hierarchy. They demand a programming model with a unified abstraction for
programming dramatically different on-chip and off-chip parallel processing
capabilities. None of the existing models is suitable for this need. The most
fundamental challenge here is natural expression of parallelism in applications
and efficient mapping of such parallelism to the hardware, including data
distribution, locality, communication, synchronization, and load balancing.

This collaborative research between Syracuse University and Sandia Labs aims at
developing an efficient programming model for high performance computing (HPC)
applications using multi-core and heterogeneous processors. The specific goal of
this study is to develop a high-level parallel programming abstraction with new
high-level language constrctions, data types, and runtime library. Hardware
features such as cores, memory hierarchy, processor heterogeneity, and
interconnection will be embedded in the semantics of the language constructs and
data types. The programming abstraction will guide the design and expression of
parallel algorithms in the high-level language, mapped automatically onto the
hardware for efficient execution. Users will be free from the low-level hardware
details. The approaches include: memory virtualization,communication
virtualization and processors virtualization.
