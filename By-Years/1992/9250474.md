The Department of Geological and Environmental Science is purchasing equipment
to establish: 1) a hydrogeologic field laboratory, and 2) a groundwater modeling
workstation. The hydrogeologic field laboratory permits students to perform,
under actual field conditions, groundwater-level measurements, pumping tests,
and groundwater quality sampling. Under agreement with a local power plant
students will have access to the monitoring wells field in the flyash disposal
basin. The groundwater modeling workstation allows students to design and test
computer models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. Further, these
two facilities are also being used in undergraduate research projects.
