This study examines three specific hypotheses regarding the responses of
planktonic rotifers and cladocerans to potentially interfering non-toxic
filaments, toxic cells, and toxins of blue-green algae. The hypotheses,
supported by some field observations and laboratory experiments, predict that:
1) rotifers, especially those with specialized diets, will beless susceptible
than cladocerqans to non-toxic filaments and toxic cells of blue-green algae; 2)
the presence of such filaments and toxic cells will reduce the ability of
cladocerans to competitively suppress rotifers; and 3) rotifers and cladocerans
will be equally susceptible to exotoxins and extracted endotoxins of blue-green
algae. The hypotheses will be tested by: 1) determining the effects of non-toxic
filaments, toxic cells, and soluble toxins of blue-green algae on the intrinsic
rates of natural increase, feeding rates, feeding behaviors, and swimming
behaviors of a variety of rotifers and cladocerans; and 2) determining the
abilities of rotifers to compete with cladocerans in long-term, mixed-species
cultures with and without non-toxic filaments or toxic cells of blue-green
algae. The results of these experiments will be useful in understanding and
predicting the effects of these algae on zooplankton population dynamics and
species structure in natural communities. Interfering blue-green algae, like
zooplanktivorous fish, may slelectively inhibit cladocerans and there by favor
the development of rotifers.
