AST-0434322&lt;br/&gt;Ng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a
spectral element magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation code, incorporating
Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) techniques, to investigate the formation and
geometry of current sheets in astronomical magnetic fields. This development
builds on recent accomplishments of the participants in fluid simulations,
analytical and numerical results on current sheets, and algorithms for magnetic
reconnection. The project will make significant advances in applied mathematics
for the spectral element method, and provide a rigorous and conclusive answer to
the important question of whether current sheets form in the Parker model. These
algorithms to help better resolve singularities in fluid systems will also be
useful in other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work integrates research and
education at all levels, including a summer institute for local high school
students, interdisciplinary training of graduate students, and mentorship of a
junior research scientist, and will promote wide-ranging inter-disciplinary
interactions between applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and plasma
astrophysicists.
