0305526&lt;br/&gt;Sheahan&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and graduate
students from the Northwestern University in a collaboration with Tom Lunne of
the Offshore Geotechnical Engineering Division of the Norwegian Geotechnical
Institute in Oslo, Norway. The collaboration will advance the state of the art
in how soft soils are sampled, the degree of sample disturbance is measured, and
effects of disturbance on measured behavior are evaluated. The research program
will also bring the state of US sampling practice in this area from one that has
remained essentially constant for the past 50 years to one that is at the
forefront of present capabilities. A great part of the uncertainty in
geotechnical design and research comes from sample disturbance and current
methods of sampling and testing cause a wide range of sample disturbance that
affects material behavior. The US-Norway collaboration gives the US group access
to the premier geotechnical research institute in the world, and can only add to
the success of the domestic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also
fulfills a training objective. The international project will allow graduate
students involved to benefit from performing research in another country. They
will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also
learning important new technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
