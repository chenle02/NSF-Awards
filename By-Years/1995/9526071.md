ABSTRACT OPP-9526071 Forman Recommendations of an earlier workshop entitled
"Defining Research Priorities for Arctic Land-Shelf Interactions" will be
implemented with this award. The arctic shelves are critical areas for the flux
of water and ice that modulate the global climate and those fluxes are
controlled partly by the freshwater runoff into the Arctic Ocean. A workshop of
U.S. scientists will be convened to write a science plan for implementation of a
global change research program addressing human adaptions and land-shelf
biogeochemical fluxes in the Russian arctic. The science plan will be presented
at a second workshop in Russia in order to achieve a consensus with Russian
scientists on the research priorities that may be achieved in a collaborative,
international research program. The collaborative research program resulting
from these workshops will facilitate access for U.S. scientists to a vast part
of the circumarctic that has previously been inaccessible to western researchers
studying global change processes.
