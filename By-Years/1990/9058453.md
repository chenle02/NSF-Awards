Rapid prototyping is the process of quickly building and evaluating a series of
prototypes of a proposed system. A computer-aided prototyping system is a set of
integrated tools supporting an iterative prototyping process characterized by
exploratory design and extensive prototype evolution. The goal of this research
is to investigate rapid prototyping of hard real-time systems via a computer-
aided prototyping system, which is based on a prototyping language supporting
the modeling of real-time systems and the reuse of software components. The
research focuses on automated methods for retrieving, adapting, and combining
reusable components; establishing feasibility of real-time constraints via
scheduling algorithms; simulating unavailable components via algebraic
specifications; generating translators and real-time schedules; constructing a
prototyping project database; providing design completion and error checking
facilities; and establishing a graphical interface for design and debugging.
