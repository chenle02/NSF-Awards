This award supports the participation of U.S. scholars in an international
workshop on ethical and value issues that arise in the interactions of business
and the environment. The workshop is to be held in Mendoza, Argentina, from
November 9-11, 1989. The project is jointly supported by NSF and the Argentinian
National Research Council (CONICET). U.S. and Argentine scholars and
entrepreneurs will discuss issues of ethics and values as they relate to
attitudes and behaviors of businesspeople towards society and the physical
environment. Argentine participants will identify an agenda, issues and
priorities for encouraging more harmonious interactions between economic and
ecological concerns. U.S. participants will share their experiences in examining
and reconciling conflicting environmental and developmental priorities. This
sharing will help in the search for and emergence of (1) unique results in each
country, with its specific economic, social and ecological constraints and
opportunities, and (2) better policies in both countries with respect to these
constraints and opportunities.
