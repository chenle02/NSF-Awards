9415482 Kou The Bridgman process has been widely used for growing single
crystals of electronic and photonic materials, but dopant segregation along the
crystal, which degrades the crystal quality, has been a significant problem.
Materials science research on bulk crystal growth will be carried out to develop
a better fundamental understanding of the processes associated with segregation
of dopants in the Bridgman growth process. Two modified Bridgman crystal growth
processes will be studied, and their effectiveness in segregation reduction will
be evaluated in single crystals of Indium Antimonide and Cadmium Zinc Telluride.
Flow visualization of the transparent melt during the growth of Sodium Nitrate
crystals will be conducted using a transparent crucible and furnace will be
employed in these experimental studies to obtain additional information on the
mechanisms operative in dopant segregation in electronic and photonic materials.
%%% The primary goal of this program is to develop a fundamental understanding
of the bulk crystal growth of Indium Antimonide and Cadmium Zinc Telluride, two
important electronic and photonic materials. Greater control over the process of
dopant segregation will allow higher quality crystals to be produced, which, in
turn, will lead to improved device and circuit performance and reliability. An
important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials
and processing research. This research will contribute to improving the general
perform ance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,
information processing, and tele communica tions. ***
