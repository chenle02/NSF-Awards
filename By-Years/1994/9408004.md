9408004 Meffert Current research has shown that a recovery from a crash in
population size (i.e., bottleneck) can involve increased potential for shifts in
the reproductive traits due to apparent release from the non-additive genetic
constraints that operated on the ancestral state. The proposed study will
examine the degree to which populations can exploit such perturbed genetic
structure. First, genetic constraints on reproductive traits will be identified
through the resistance of a housefly population to selection upon multivariate
(composite) components of videotaped mating behavior. Secondly, a derived
bottleneck population that is determined to have a significant genetic
disruption (through parent-offspring comparisons) and the stock control will
each be subjected to selection upon the multivariate trait that exhibited low
selectional response to the ancestor. Line cross analysis will evaluate how non
additive genetic components (e.g., dominance and epistasis) may be converted to
additive genetic variance through the bottleneck event and tests on mate
recognition will assess the consequences of shifts in mating repertoires. Such
experiments on the genetic properties of populations near extinction are
critical to management of endangered species of pest invasions in that they
identify genetic processes that mould traits in equilibrium populations.
