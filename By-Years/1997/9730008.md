9730008 Marton-Lefevre ICSU will undertake a series of activities to advance
scientific planning related to research on global change and the environment.
These activities include those of ICSU's Advisory Committee on the Environment
(ACE); ICSU's Environmental Sciences Officer who provides staff support for ACE;
and scientific planning activities of the World Climate Research Programme
(WCRP), the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), and the
International Dimensions (of Global Environmental Change Program (IHDP). ACE
will promote coordination regarding global change research among ICSU's various
international scientific unions (e.g., the International Union of Geodesy and
Geophysics (IUGG); International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS);
International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS); and International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAP)); between relevant ICSU bodies and external
partners, especially the intergovernmental organizations co-sponsors of global
change research (e.g., the World Meteorological Organization (WMO); the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC); and the UN Environment
Programme (UNEP)); and other international organizations representing the
interests of the social and engineering sciences and industry in global change
research. ACE will review and provide scientific guidance to the WCRP, IGBP,
IHDP and their component projects; to the international global change observing
systems (for climate (GCOS), for the oceans (GOOS), and for the terrestrial
system (GTOS); to all other ICSU activities related to global change and
environment research (such as those of the Scientific Committee on Problems of
the Environment (SCOPE); and to intergovernmental bodies concerned with global
change issues such as climate change, biodiversity and desertification. ***
