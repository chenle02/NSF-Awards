The purpose of this research is to develop a model to analyze the determinants
of household energy conservation decisions. Conservation investment decisions
are modeled in the presence of energy price uncertainty, and the actual patterns
of household investments during the 1970's and early 1980's are analyzed. The
irreversibility of energy related investments creates an option value in
postponing investment, given the possibility that future energy prices could
fall sufficiently to make the investment economically unattractive. It is quite
possible that the existence of this option value can help explain the low rate
of investment in energy conservation measures recorded during the past two
decades. Using the model developed in the project, investment simulations
calibrated to aggregate data will be carried out to explore the pattern of
energy conservation investment, and then to investigate empirically the impact
of tax incentives on investment behavior. The empirical work will use a large
panel data set of individual tax returns followed over a three year period. In
addition, different investment patterns by energy conservation category will be
analyzed.
