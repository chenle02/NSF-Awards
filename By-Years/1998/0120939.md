The goal of this research project is to develop new query evaluation and
optimization techniques for processing relational queries in main-memory
databases. Recent improvements in main memory size and cost suggest that large
classes of applications may obtain the performance benefits of having the data
in main memory. The project focuses on issues in computer architecture that
influence main memory performance, including cache miss latency and branch
misprediction penalties. Algorithms for database operations will be developed
that are sensitive to these and other issues, and thus perform well on modern
architectures. Broader questions such as how to design a comprehensive
architecture-sensitive query processing framework will be studied. The
algorithms and techniques resulting from this project could have application in
commercial and experimental database systems, where they could improve the speed
of query processing. Results from the project will be disseminated as research
papers and as freely available prototype software.
