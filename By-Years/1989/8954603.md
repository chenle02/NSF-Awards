Modeled on the New York City Writing Project, this two-year project will
develop a model for teacher enhancement in mathematics in grades K through 12.
The goals include increasing teachers' knowledge of basic mathematics,
increasing their ability to teach this material to their students, obtaining the
informed support of the supervisors of participating teachers, and creating a
professional learning community and support network for teachers of mathematics
at all grade levels. Participants will attend either a sixteen- day summer
institute in mathematics content and related methodology or similar academic-
year courses. Extensive in- school support will also be provided, and during the
second summer, fifteen teachers will attend a twelve-day advanced institute.
Responsibility for instruction will be shared by university faculty and school
personnel. A total of 105 teachers from a region centered on District 10 in the
Bronx will participate in the project. Lehman College of the City University of
New York and the New York City Board of Education are contributing as cost-
sharing an amount equal to 67% of the NSF award.
