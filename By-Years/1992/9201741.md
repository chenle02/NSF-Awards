Professor Stopple will work on a new way to look at the trace of Hecke
eigenforms on GL(3) by generalizing an idea of Zagier on the trace formula for
Hecke operators. He will then apply this trace formula to the case of non-normal
cubic extensions of the rationals. Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean
geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and
physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental importance
are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is principally concerned
with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis,
it retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems in areas as
diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in information
theory.
