This grant provides support of a workshop on Innovations in Pricing of
Transportation Systems. The objective of this workshop is to bring together
practitioners, experts, and researchers worldwide to discuss and share
innovative ideas in using market-based approaches to encourage a more efficient
use of multi-modal transportation systems and to devise better financing schemes
for improving or enhancing these systems. The intent of the workshop is to
address both theory and practice so as to generate cross fertilization of ideas,
to get more research into practice and to make current research more relevant.
Additionally the workshop will address congestion mitigation and improved
mobility and their effects on economic productivity, energy efficiency and
environmental quality which are three of the four focused areas of Intelligent
Transportation Systems.

The expected outcomes of the workshop are to provide a venue for practitioners,
policy makers, and researchers to share ideas and critique each others work, to
provide a mechanism for transferring technology, to identify potential research
topics, and to increase awareness of and appreciation for the various aspects of
transportation pricing.
