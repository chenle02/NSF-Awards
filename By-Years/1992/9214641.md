This award provides one-half the funding necessary to support a major equipment
acquisition at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). WHOI is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition of a
large-radius, high- transmission, secondary ion source mass spectrometer system,
more commonly referred to as an ion microprobe. Recent technological
developments have made the new generation ion probes capable of measuring
isotopic species with extremely high abundance sensitivity and micron-level
spatial resolution in samples of geological interest. The WHOI ion microprobe
will be installed and maintained at the Woods Hole campus and operated as a
facility open to the national geoscience research community. The analytical
capabilities of the new instrument will be employed in research areas including
the early evolution of the Earth, upper mantle dynamics (melting, melt
extraction, generation of basalts), deep-seated metamorphic processes (rock-
fluid physicochemical interactions), and environmental geochemistry (use of
oxygen isotopes and trace metal distribution in foraminifera and bivalve shells
to monitor changes in temperature and nutrient content of seawater).
