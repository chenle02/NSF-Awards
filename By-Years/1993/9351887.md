9351887 Quigley The aim of this project is to develop an undergraduate
astronomical imaging laboratory. This laboratory enables physics majors during
their junior year to acquire the know- ledge, skills, and experience needed to
undertake astronomy research projects during the following year. To accomplish
this goal, the department is purchasing a CCD charge-coupled device camera and
controller system, three Sun SPARCstation computers, and associated peripheral
equipment. The CCD imaging system enables students to carry out both laboratory
imaging experiments and actual star-field imaging using the department's
Celestron-8 telescopes. The Sun workstation allows students to carry out
detailed analysis of CCD images and NASA satellite telescope spectra of
astronomical objects. IRAF, the powerful astronomy image analysis software
package used by professional astronomers throughout the world, is the primary
tool used for data analysis. The Sun workstations are networked and connected to
Internet so that data can be routinely retrieved from NASA centers and on-line
astronomy data services. Students also are able to transfer data to and from
observatories and other universities that they may work at during the summer
after their junior year. This project is significant because it enables
undergraduate physics majors to become actively engaged in astronomy research.
Students also become "plugged in" to the modern astronomical community by
becoming users of NASA's Astrophysical Data System and other astronomy data
archives and services that are available over Internet. It enables Western to
offer a solid Astronomy Concentration within the Physics B.S. degree, a
concentration that gives students a good idea of what to expect if they go on to
graduate school or other professional work in astronomy. ***
