In this project, the P.I. will study the top-to-bottom circulation and
characteristics of the North Atlantic Ocean, and relate them to a recently
completed study of the South Atlantic. A traditional approach based on the
assumption of near-geostrophic flow will employ extensive new high-quality data
not previously available.
