Marine programs at the Shannon Point Marine Center will be enhanced by the
purchase of a High Performance Liquid Chromatography system. This modern marine
research equipment will be used by Western Washington students majoring in
environmental science and biology (in Marine Ecology and in Estuary courses), by
community college students, and students doing independent research projects.
Workshops will train the community college faculty and students, and the WWU
students in the use of this equipment, which will enable them to analyze water
samples for petroleum hydrocarbons, PAH's, fatty acids, and selected nutrients
(nitrates and phosphates). The university will provide 50% matching funds.
