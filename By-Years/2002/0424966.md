Recent studies by the principal investigator show that the midpoint scattering
in 2D multichannel seismic studies can be used to advantage by processing that
takes into account the 3D character of the data and of the geology. The final
products are a much improved stack, determinations of structural dips at right
angles to the survey line, and a significantly improved velocity model. Further
improvements in the developed automatic techniques for extracting local crossdip
moveout and producing optimum crossdip stacks will be pursued. These techniques
will be made available to the community.
