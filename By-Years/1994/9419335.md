This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities program is
to aid the Department of Chemistry at University of Colorado at Boulder in the
purchase of a scanning probe microscope (SPM). This instrument will be used in
the following research programs: 1) Heteroepitaxial 2-D crystals on highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite which grow under liquid crystal films; and Self-
assembled monolayers on glass. 2) Synthesis and topographic characterization by
SPM of chemically deposited films. The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables
researchers to image atoms directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect
which involves bringing an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms
of the samples surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak or
tunnel across the gap and generate a minute current. As the gap between the tip
and the sample increases, the current decreases. As the probe crosses the
sample, moving back and forth across its surface, the probe traces out a contour
map of the sample's surface atoms. The SPM is used in the control of material
used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.
