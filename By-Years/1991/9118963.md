Cotton and his group will continue their research on the analysis and numerical
simulation of convective storms. They will focus on multi-scale aspects
(organization of convective cells into lines and clusters, interaction with
synoptic scale systems) and on the genesis of severe weather events (flash
floods, strong winds, tornadoes). The work combines the use of an interactive,
nested- grid model, viz. CSU's Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) with
analysis of data gathered by high-resolution observational systems, including
the CHILL-radar, a national research facility housed at CSU. The linkage between
modelling and observations provides iterative testing of hypotheses by numerical
simulations, validation and refinement of the models and objectively analysed
documentation of storms. This last function will depend on four dimensional data
assimalation procedures (4DDA) to be developed. A significant element of the
planned work lies in new developments in the RAMS' physics and numerics.
Cotton's past record of productivity (in students and public- ations)
foreshadows a significant contribution toward meeting the demands generated by
the U.S. Weather Research Program, and the national effort in weather system
modernization over the next decade.
