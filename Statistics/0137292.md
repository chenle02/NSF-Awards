This award provides funds to partially support group travel to the seventh
international Valencia meeting on Bayesian Statistics. The money, primarily,
support junior researchers and graduate students with limited sources of
funding. Members of the underrepresented groups will be actively recruited and
encouraged to apply. The meeting will be held in Tenerife, Spain, from June 1-6,
2002. It brings together leading experts in the area of Bayesian Statistics and
junior researchers, facilitating scientific interactions and providing a
stimulating environment for the exchange of ideas. A pre-conference tutorial
will be held that is targeted towards junior investigators, graduate students
and people with limited exposure to the vast developments in the area of
Bayesian statistics.
