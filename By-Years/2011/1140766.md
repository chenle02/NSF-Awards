The objective of this EAGER project is to rapidly increase the efficiency and
stability of organic solar cells by combining them with an inorganic solar cell
in a tandem or multiple junction arrangement and do the fundamental device
research needed to get over 10% stable efficiency. Achieving higher efficiency
and stability simultaneously is a critical need in the field of organic solar
cells. The project is based on the very recent invention by the PI of a tandem
junction comprising inorganic and organic solar cells which increased the
conversion efficiency and the stability compared to the organic cell by itself.
