The SLALM's (Simposio Latino Americano de Logica Matematica) have been very
successful at bring together top researchers in logic from the United States and
Latin American and at encouraging young researchers in Latin America to pursue
further studies. Through contacts made at the symposium, some of the most
talented individuals from Latin America have chosen to continue their
development in the United States through higher degrees or postdocs or visiting
positions. The large majority of the Latin Americans studying mathematical logic
in the United States return to their Latin American universities where they
assume leadership positions and maintain collaborations with North American
researchers. In addition to encouraging graduate students to enter the field of
mathematical logic and foundations, the SLALM's have provided a forum for
introducing, to the international logic community, new areas of research
developed in Latin America for example, the paraconsistent logics. The SLALM's
have also foster collaborations across the Americas that have resulted in new
results in the more traditional areas. A proceedings for XIII SLALM is planned;
the web page http://slalm.izt.uam.mx/ gives more details about the meeting; in
particular, the site publicizes the national and international foundations that
are providing support.
