9421595 Davoodi This project provides support for U. S. researchers to
participate in Third International Conference on Stochastic Structural Dynamics
to be hosted by the University of Puerto Rico from January 15-18, 1995. This
conference aims to be a forum for bringing together researchers from various
engineering disciplines, physics, and mathematical sciences from throughout the
world, who work in the area of stochastic mechanics. The conference is organized
by the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
and Rice University. This conference will provide an opportunity to explore
possibilities for research collaborations between institutions of higher
education in the United States. Because of the geographical location of Puerto
Rico, this conference provides an excellent opportunity for the researchers of
South and Central Americas to present their work and establish stronger ties
with the stochastic community in the United States. In addition, this conference
will promote an exchange of ideas on the status of stochastic mechanics methods
as they are applied to analysis of a broad spectrum of multidisciplinary
problems in mathematical sciences, physics, and engineering. ***
