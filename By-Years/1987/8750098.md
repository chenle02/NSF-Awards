A new capstone course required of biology majors is being created. Immunology is
replacing the course which has served a capstone function for the past 22 years,
Plant Physiology. Immunofluorescence electrophoretic procedures, and cell
culture--hybridoma production are becoming part of a revised Immunology
laboratory curriculum. This revised curriculum is seeking to ensure that biology
majors are knowledgeable and well-trained in the areas of experimental design;
discipline in experimental work; care of living organisms; precision in
manipulative work; use of instrumentation; data collection; data analysis; and
report writing. Microscopes, protein electrophresis and immunoductrophoresis
equipment are being used by the students. Specifically, the immunology
laboratory includes three new project areas in which students generate and test
hypotheses: humoral immunity (producing antisera to soluble antigens, protein
determinations, and electrophoretic/immunoelectrophoretic/- immunodiffusion
demonstrations of antibody specificity and titer), immunolabelling (producing
antisera to bacterial antigens, purifying and labelling antibodies and
subsequent demonstration of their specificity with immunofluorescence), and
cellular immunity" (demonstrating populations of T- and B-lymphocytes, culture
of mouse myeloma cells, fusion of myeloma cells with stimulated mouse splenic
lymphocytes, and attemps to identify monoclonal antibody- producing cells).
