This research will examine the development of conceptual thought in infants and
young children and their ability to recall the past. Until recently, we had
little information about the way infants conceptualize the world or how long
they can recall events that have happened to them. The phenomenon known as
infantile amnesia, in which adults recall little or nothing about their early
years, suggests that infants may not be able to remember their past for very
long. However, recent work in Mandler's laboratory indicates that two-year-olds
can recall events that occurred at age one. This research program will use
deferred imitation, in which children are asked to imitate events they observed
in the past, to measure recall in children too young to talk. There has also
been little experimental work on concept formation in infancy. It has
traditionally been thought that infants first form concepts about concrete
objects, such as dogs, chairs, and cars, and only later develop broader concepts
of animals, furniture, and vehicles. However, research from Mandler's laboratory
indicates that the broader concepts precede the more specific ones. This
research will use several new techniques, involving the way that infants handle
and explore objects, to test this hypothesis. The overall goal of the research
is to provide a systematic body of knowledge about the preverbal foundations of
thinking and remembering, so that we can better understand what young children
need to know in order to learn language.
