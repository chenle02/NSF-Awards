9316306 Kellogg This award is for support of a one year systematic study of
Diatoms and other biogenic micropraticles in the McMurdo Dome ice core, which is
being drilled during the austral summer 1993/94. The identity and provenance of
the species (marine vs. non-marine and Antarctic endemic or cosmopolitan) should
give some indication of the closest and most likely sources for biogenic
particles. Down- core fluctuations in numbers and identity of Diatoms may record
changes in wind strength and/or direction. The Diatom record is expected to
provide an additional tool for linking the paleo- climatic history of the Ross
Sea and ice-free areas of Southern Victoria Land with that of the East and West
Antarctic ice sheets. ***
