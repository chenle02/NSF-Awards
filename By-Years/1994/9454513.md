Pac-TEC is a consortium of two-year colleges, secondary schools, and businesses
situated in the Silicon Valley with regional partnerships in seven western
states. This project is developing and distributing state-of-the-art
instructional materials and techniques to secondary schools, colleges, industry,
and government. These materials focus on innovative mathematics, science,
engineering, and technology and are aimed at students who will become
technicians. Emphasis is being placed on the development of materials which will
enhance students' problem solving abilities, computer literacy, effective oral
and written communication skills, and ability to work in groups. The materials
are being created around open-ended design based project work.
