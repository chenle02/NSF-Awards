9725057 Mayewski This award is for support for a Science Management Office (SMO)
for the United States component of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific
Expedition (US ITASE). The broad aim of US ITASE is to develop an understanding
of the last 200 years of past West Antarctic climate and environmental change.
ITASE is a multidisciplinary program that integrates remote sensing,
meteorology, ice coring, surface glaciology and geophysics. In addition to the
formation of a science management office, this award supports a series of annual
workshops to coordinate the science projects that will be involved in ITASE and
the logistics base needed to undertake ground-based sampling in West Antarctica.
