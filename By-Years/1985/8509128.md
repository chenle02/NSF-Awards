Support is provided for a symposium on "Creep and Shrinkage of Concrete:
Mathematical Modeling", to be held at Northwestern University during September
1986. The aim of the symposium is to provide a forum for an in-depth discussion
of the frontiers of research and a critical appraisal of the current state-of-
the-art. Improvements in the understanding and mathematical modeling of creep
and shrinkage are now being perceived as essential for improving the economy and
reliability of concrete structures, both in traditional civil engineering
applications as well as new applications such as nuclear reactor structures. The
symposium is expected to greatly contribute to the communication between
scientists working on the subject from the viewpoint of material science,
continuum mechanics, and structural engineering.
