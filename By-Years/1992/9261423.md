Present manufacturing technologies for non-volatile ferroelectric random access
memories (FRAM) are not sufficiently developed to ensure reproducible deposition
of large area, high oriented polycrystalline PZT (Lead-Zirconate-Titanate) thin
films on substrates compatible with semiconductor integrated technology. In
order to address problems of large area stoichiometry and compatibility with
thermally sensitive semiconductor substrates used in very large scale integrated
circuit (VLSIC) fabrication, the researcher suggests laser crystallization of
spin-on ferroelectric thin films for radiation-hard memories. The project is
innovative in the precise control of temperature distribution afforded by laser
crystallization. The program objectives include the evaluation of spin-on
deposition and pre-anneal conditions, identification of laser crystallization
parameters, characterization of PZT ferroelectric thin films and integration of
films into parallel plate capacitor configurations. The significance of laser
crystallization of spin-on ferroelectric thin films lies in minimizing the
thermal budget, interdiffusion of substrates/electrodes/film, phase segregation
and in increasing compatibility with thermally sensitive semiconductor
substrates. Further advantage lies in the use of standard aluminum metallization
technology in VLSIC manufacturing currently limited to FRAM applications due to
high temperature diffusion problems. Successful completion of this research will
result in the fabrication of cost-effective non-volatile random access memories
having improved quality, reliability and performance.
