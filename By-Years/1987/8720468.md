This project has been aimed at testing the hypothesis that the Laramide orogeny
and the formation of the Rocky Mountains was due to horizontal subduction of
oceanic crust under the western United States. Development and testing of a
finite-element code for continental deformation has been completed. This renewal
will make technical improvements to the efficiency, thermal boundary conditions,
and plate-tectonics inputs to the model, find steady- state models of the
Cretaceous Sevier Orogeny, conduct unified models for the Cretaceous-Tertiary
history of North America and compare the results to geologic and geophysical
data, and to apply the same program to test for similar tectonics in other areas
of the world.
