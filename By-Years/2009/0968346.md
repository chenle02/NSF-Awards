Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design, epitaxially
grow, fabricate, characterize, and analyze optically pumped and electrically
injected subwavelength nanoscale rolled-up In(Ga)As quantum dot 1.3µm lasers
that can demonstrate ultra low threshold (&lt; 100µA) at room temperature. The
inherent advantage offered by quantum dot tunnel injection heterostructure for
nanoscale laser operation, such as large gain, low threshold and high quantum
efficiency will also be investigated. The transformative impact of this research
is the availability of a low power and compact laser for interconnects and for
spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit is the first demonstration of nanoscale rolled-up subwavelength sized
laser on GaAs, that can be optically or electrically pumped. Demonstration of a
reliable room temperature nanoscale laser on GaAs/InP is also transformative and
is considered as a milestone in optoelectronics. The rolled-up technique and
associated device fabrication are more simple than other techniques for
nanoscale lasers that are currently being explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research include social,
economic and educational benefits. Ultra-low power light sources reduce energy
consumption and help in transmitting information efficiency and at faster rates.
The interdisciplinary nature of the program will provide an excellent training
ground for graduate and undergraduate students - our future work force in
several critical areas. Training of women and underrepresented minorities in
summer programs in the general areas of optoelectronics and lighting will be a
priority. K-12 outreach will include demonstrations during visits and creating a
broader awareness for science and mathematics.
