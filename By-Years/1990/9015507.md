This grant will support an International Conference in Stochastic Partial
Differential Equations (SPDE's), May 6-8, 1990, and a satellite School-Seminar
in the same topic for new researchers, May 3-5. Both activities will be held at
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The purpose of the conference is
to bring together researchers who are working on different theoretical and
applied aspects of SPDE's and to promote research in this field. The purpose of
the School-Seminar is to bring the subject of SPDE's to the attention of new
researchers (graduate students, postdocs and recent Ph.D.'s) and provide them
with a unique opportunity to be taught by, meet, and have discussions with the
outstanding scientists working in the area. The introductory sessions scheduled
for the School-Seminar are linear elliptic and parabolic SPDE's, methods in non-
linear SPDE's, and applications of SPDE's. The main part of the conference will
cover recent theoretical developments in SPDE's and various applications,
especially to oceanography and signal processing.
