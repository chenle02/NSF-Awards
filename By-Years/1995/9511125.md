9511125 Inman and Haughwout Investment in public infrastructure has become one
of significant policy concern. The two central questions addressed by the
proposed research agenda are: 1) Do we have a public infrastructure crisis? 2)
If so, what government actions, including incentives, can best encourage
appropriate types and levels of expenditures on public infrastructure? First, to
address the crisis question, the researchers identify the benefits of public
infrastructure investment. Does public structure investment increase the income
of individuals and businesses in the impacted area or not? The researchers
expect that positive benefits from public infrastructure investment will accrue
to large urban areas and negative benefits to rural areas. As a result of these
possible offsetting effects, uniform government policies to encourage
infrastructure investment will have zero impact on productivity and income for
the country as a whole. If their predictions are confirmed, government policies
need to be carefully formulated to differentiate between large urban and rural
areas. The benefits of public structure infrastructure on individual households
are examined, by considering the impact of such investment on housing prices and
local labor markets. Second, the researchers will look at the effect of federal
tax and grants policies on state and local public infrastructure expenditures.
Their proposed research recognizes that elected-body officials at the state and
local level will vote-trade or be willing to favor another official's program in
return for support of their own favored program. An analysis of state and local
public infrastructure decisions capturing such behavior will hopefully allow for
better design of federal programs.
