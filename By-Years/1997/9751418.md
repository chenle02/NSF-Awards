The Biology Department is revising its introductory biology laboratory course.
This large course enrolls 300 students per year, approximately 10% of whom are
biology education majors. This project will allow us to incorporate more data
analysis and discussion of concepts into the laboratory portion of this course.
The biology faculty believe that using computers to help with the graphing of
results is giving more time to present additional data sets to compare with
those generated in the laboratory. They are using computer programs with
integrated wordprocessing and spreadsheet capabilities that enable the students
to prepare laboratory reports with a more extensive analysis of the data and
concepts. Computers, printers, and software are being purchased for the revision
of biology laboratories. *
