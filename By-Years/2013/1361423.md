Geometric combinatorics is a rapidly developing field that has close connections
to optimization, computer science, engineering, statistics, and even
mathematical biology. A typical problem in optimization involves optimizing a
function over the set of all solutions of a given linear system --- a system
that usually contains hundreds or thousands of equations in many variables.
Geometrically, the corresponding set of points is a high-dimensional object,
called a polytope. Moreover, in recent years the study of polytopes with certain
symmetry has led to surprising implications in statistics, probability,
information theory, and signal processing, and is also expected to have impacts
in such subjects as medical imaging and digital communications. In engineering
and computer science, e.g., robotics, one often needs to describe a space of
"allowed motions": this space can usually be approximated by a collection of
points, segments, triangles, pyramids, and higher dimensional analogs of
pyramids nicely glued together --- an object known as a simplicial complex. The
problems aimed at deepening our understanding of polytopes and simplicial
complexes are at the heart of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The primary
aim of this proposal is to attack several long-standing problems and conjectures
in the theory of face numbers of various classes of simplicial and, more
generally, CW complexes. Specifically, research on this project will involve the
use of algebraic, geometric, topological, and combinatorial methods to attack
fundamental enumerative questions related to (1) simplicial spheres and, more
generally, complexes embeddable in a sphere of a given dimension, (2) balanced
triangulations of spheres and manifolds, (3) flag and banner complexes, and (4)
centrally symmetric polytopes. The main flavor of questions we are interested in
is how the topology of the underlying space (e.g., being a triangulation of a
certain manifold) or a certain combinatorial restriction, such as symmetry or
balancedness, affects the possible face numbers of complexes in question.
Although most of the problems proposed here are combinatorial in nature, recent
advances are carried out by a subtle combination of algebraic and geometric
arguments (among them Lefschetz algebras, generic and not-so-generic initial
ideals, local cohomology, rigidity, etc.). Thus solutions to the proposed
problems may impact not only combinatorics and discrete geometry but also such
fields as combinatorial algebra, algebraic topology, and Riemannian geometry.
