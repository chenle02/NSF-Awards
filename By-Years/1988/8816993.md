Project investigates the changes in focal mechanisms during the source
processes of several large subduction zone earhtquakes. Project uses source
process and seismicity to assess mechanical conditions of subduction coupling,
determines slab geometries near the source areas to assess local tectonic stress
orientations, and investigates the implications on the regional stress field of
multiple focal mechanisms.
