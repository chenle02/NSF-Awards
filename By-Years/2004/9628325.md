Abstract Research Related Revenues and Undergraduate Education in Public
Research Universities Larry L Leslie, Gary Rhoades, and Ronald L. Oaxaca

The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of changes in institutional
revenue patterns on undergraduate education within science, mathematics, and
engineering of US public research universities. The study uses existing data
bases to develop a model of research support based on "resource dependency
theory" which holds that internal organizational activities are primarily
influenced through the actions of external resource providers. The proposal will
assess the magnitude of public university revenue changes, measure impacts of
research revenues on undergraduate education in SME units, and assess changes in
curricular structures.
