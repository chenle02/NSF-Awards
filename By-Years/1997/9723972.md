*** 9723972 Adami A new multipurpose "artificial life" software system will be
developed, to model several aspects of evolution in simple systems in
"computational evolutionary biology". This will include studies of molecular
evolution near the error threshold, and the "directed mutation" hypothesis. The
results of the computer studies can be compared with the evolutionary processes
observed in simple biological systems involving strains of E.Coli. ***
