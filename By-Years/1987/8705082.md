The object of this equipment proposal is to request funding for upgrading the
remote geophysical field stations operated by the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska on Mt. St. Augustine volcano in Cook Inlet, Alaska. The
instrument upgrade will consist of tiltmeters, 3-component (EW, NS and vertical)
seismometers, and radio linkage for telemetering the seismic and tilt data to
the Geophysical Institute in Fairbanks. St. Augustine is an active volcano whose
explosive eruptions and related tsunamis pose a threat to the major population
center of Anchorage, nearby international air traffic lanes, a major fishing
industry and to off-shore petroleum production rigs. In addition to enabling
efficient monitoring and warning against hazards, the systematic acquisition of
data made possible by the deployment of the equipment will also allow a
scientific interpretation of magma migration and earthquake sources in this
important area for understanding the mechanisms of plate tectonics.
