9530059 Fitzgerald This project is proposed as part of Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Baseline Trace Metal Study of the oceans. The
primary objective is to obtain needed data for the distribution, speciation and
biogeochemcial cycling of Hg in the waters and atmosphere of the equatorial and
South Atlantic Ocean. The field program will be conducted on the IOC cruise of
the R.V. Knorr to these regions in the western Atlantic during may/June 1996.
The research involves shipboard collections for total Hg, particulate and Hg
species (i.e., reactive, elemental and methylated Hg) in air and water, on-board
Hg analyses, and incubation experiments designed to study the biotic and abiotic
sources of elemental and methylated Hg in the open ocean waters. Post cruise
activities will include analyses of stored samples and additional incubation
experiments. This research is designed to complement and extend recent
investigations of Hg in the North Atlantic Ocean (August, 1993) that were part
of the IOC Baseline Trace Metal Study, and earlier Hg studies in the Pacific
Ocean. ***
