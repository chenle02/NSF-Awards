A pilot investigation of the effects of parasites on howler monkeys on Barro
Colorado Island, Panama will be conducted. The effects and biological costs of
parasites on natural populations of nonhuman primates are poorly known and this
well-known, habituated island population is a good choice for an initial study.
Two specific parasites will be investigated by this inter-disciplinary team. The
pathology and infestation rates for the howler monkey bot fly larvae will be
documented as will those for the howler malarial parasite (Plasmodium
brazilianum). Additionally, there will be an attempt to determine the effects of
environmental stress (climatic, nutritional etc) on infestation rates.
