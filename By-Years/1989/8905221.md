Alginate synthesis and de novo assembly into a cell wall by the fertilized egg
of the brown alga. Fucus provides a simple system for studying plant cell wall
formation. Alginate is a linear polymer of the two acidic sugars, mannuronate
and guluronate, arranged in nongelling and gelling subunits. Recent work
identified the intracellular site of synthesis of the gelling subunits as the
Golgi apparatus. Alginate molecular size and the subunit length distributions of
intracellular and extracellular alginate will be examined by electrophoresis
after cleavage by specific enzymes. The ability of zygote alginate to gel in a
seawater environment will be studied by labelling zygote sections with
fluorescent hybridization probes of known chain length. The activities of two
enzymes, one regulating alginate gelation (epimerase converts nongelling
subunits to gelling subunits) and one causing its cleavage (lyase cuts alginate
chains for wall expansion) will be correlated with wall development by enzyme
microassays. Antisera to the purified enzymes will be prepared for immunogold
ultrastructural localization during wall development. In vitro translation
products of messenger RNA prepared form zygotes during development will be
immunoprecipitated. This project will provide information on enzyme and mRNA
controls of the synthesis, assembly, structure and modification of a gelling
wall carbohydrate. %%% This project will provide detailed information on the
control of a gelling plant cell wall polymer at the carbohydrate, protein and
mRNA levels of control. This gelling/nongelling allows the cell wall components
to adapt to growth while maintaining the integrity of the organism.
