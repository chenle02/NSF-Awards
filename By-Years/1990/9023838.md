This project represents a "Research Fellowship in Marine Biotechnology and the
Ocean Sciences. Dr. Yentsch, the research fellow, will receive formal training
in a laboratory course format followed by an apprenticeship at, The Jackson
Laboratory, in Bar Harbor, Maine under the supervision of a sponsoring senior
scientist, Dr. Charles Sidman. The training encompasses learning laboratory
techniques in molecular biology, specifically these techniques will include use
of restriction enzymes, blotting, cloning, sequencing and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The scientific focus of the project is to learn and
refine/develop techniques in order to assess heterogeneity of gene expression
and mutation rate in single celled microalgae. Eventually with additional
funding, the fellow Dr. C.M. Yentsch and faculty sponsor Dr. C. Sidman expect to
place dialysis cultures in environments with varying degrees of human insult and
assay for heterogeneity of gene expression in single cells via fluorescent in
situ PCR (FLIP) using flow cytometry.
