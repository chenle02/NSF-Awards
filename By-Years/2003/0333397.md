Title: Equidistribution problems and semisimple Lie
groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator, in several joint works
with W. T. Gan and&lt;br/&gt;A. Eskin, has exploited methods from harmonic
analysis and&lt;br/&gt;ergodic theory to understand the equidistribution
&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon of integer representations of invariant
&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. The investigator proposes to continue
her&lt;br/&gt;study on equidistribution questions on homogeneous
spaces&lt;br/&gt;of semisimple Lie groups, especially those connected with
&lt;br/&gt;problems in number theory and geometry. For example, the
&lt;br/&gt;problem of understanding compact maximal flats in Riemannian
&lt;br/&gt;symmetric space or orbits of lattices in various homogeneous
&lt;br/&gt;spaces of Lie groups are of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
application of ergodic theory and the representation theory &lt;br/&gt;of
semisimple Lie groups in number theory is one of newly
discovered&lt;br/&gt;tools in modern mathematics. The methods, when applicable,
turn&lt;br/&gt;out to be very powerful and solve some of the important problems
which&lt;br/&gt;pure number theoretic methods cannot deal with. The
investigator&lt;br/&gt;is interested in the problems at this intersection
and&lt;br/&gt;hopes to develop further tools to deal with
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
