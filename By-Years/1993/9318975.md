9318975 Bergin Grand Rapids Community College requests support from NSF for
connection of its campus network to NSFNET. MERIT is the midlevel network
located in the state of Michigan that will provide operations and network
information services. It will give Grand Rapids Community College a 56 thousand
bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
per second) National Backbone network. The college needs greater functionality
and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
