Rapid changes in the understanding of food as well as other biological systems
continue to be one of the major reasons for putting this meeting together.
Critical needs and new objectives arising from the food industry continually
challenge present and future research directions of the food processing
engineering field and areas continually surge and develop. Many important,
progressive, and technological changes are advancing and there is no other forum
but the Conference of Food Engineering (CoFE) that combines engineering
fundamentals with basic principles of food science with such an integrating
approach. The Institute of Food Technology (IFT) emphasis is on food ingredients
and formulation, not on engineering aspects of food processing. The American
Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE) deals primarily with post harvest
processes. CoFE 2003 is being convened by different food engineers from several
U.S. universities and key food industries to address the numerous and rapid
transformations taking place that will outline future research directions in the
food engineering field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
