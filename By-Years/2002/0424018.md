This project proposes an exploratory study with the long-term goal of using
findings from K-12 research through the Cognitively Guided Instruction materials
in the design, implementation, and exploratory research of professional
development (PD) for college mathematics instructors. Specifically, the SGER
project will: (1) design and implement a semester-long course for mathematics
graduate student TAs; (2) develop, pilot, and refine PD activities for use as
data collection instruments to document TAs' knowledge of student understanding
of significant mathematical ideas; (3) develop, pilot, and refine data
collection and analysis methods for documenting TA teaching practices; and (4)
develop, pilot, and refine methods for examining the nature of students'
learning opportunities in TAs' classes and changes in those learning
opportunities resulting from the PD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
