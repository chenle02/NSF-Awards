The aim of this project is study ion channel activities on the inner and outer
membranes of mitochondria. Patch clamping will be used to assess channel
activity on native mitochondrial membranes and on isolated liposomal membranes
into which mitochondrial channel proteins have been reconstituted. These studies
will contribute to our understanding of ion movements in the context of
mitochondrial function. The regulation of ion movement across mitochondrial
membranes is not well understood, but apparently involves several classes of
proteins that operate as pumps or as channels. The focus of this work is on
channel proteins that facilitate the passive movement of ions across either the
inner or outer membrane of the mitochondrion. An electrophysiological technique
known as patch clamping will be employed to study the activity of these proteins
either in their native membranes, or in a reconstituted artificial membrane
system. Patch clamping will be used to assay the ion flux activities through
certain channels under a variety of conditions.
