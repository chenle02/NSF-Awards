9712821 Mathiowitz The aims of this research are to develop a novel magnetically
based system for bioadhesive measurements and to develop local bioadhesive drug
delivery systems, which provide enhanced bioavailability of therapeutic agents
to treat peptide ulcers. This research includes the objectives: (1) to finalize
the development of a new magnetic method to study bioadhesion between polymeric
microspheres and living tissue, (2) to use this method to study bioadhesion of
drug-delivering spheres to gastrointestinal tissue, and (3) to track orally
administered microspheres in experimental rats. The adhesion forces will be
measured by quantifying the magnetic force required to hold an iron-loaded
microsphere stationary, while the adherent tissue is separated at a constant
rate. The polymers selected for trial, hydrogels and thermoplastic
polyanhydrides, will be used to encapsulate and deliver two different drugs,
fibroblast growth factor and platelet derived growth factor, which have been
shown to be useful in the treatment of ulcers. ***
