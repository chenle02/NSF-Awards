This research project will utilize newly developed surgical and recording
techniques to quantitatively examine the ontogeny of inhibitory/facilitatory
modulation of the dentate granule cell population. The recordings will be done
in chronically implanted, behaving, preweaned rats. Extracellular field
potentials will be obtained in response to single- and paired- pulse stimulation
of the perforant path. Bispectral analysis and non- Gaussian autoregressive
modeling techniques will be used to characterize the development of the
hippocampal EEG during the early postnatal period of development. These studies
will shed new light on the interactions which occur between hippocampal neural
systems responsible for the generation of hippocampal EEG patterns as the animal
interacts with its environment during the early postnatal period of development.
The results will provide new approaches to probe questions related to the
maturation of neural circuits and developmental patterns of the EEG in behaving
animals.
