This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)proposes to support an integrated
program of research and teaching that will both strengthen professional
engineering design activity and enhance engineering education by broadening the
understanding of the role of variation control as a fundamental part of the
design process. The educational component of this award promotes the explicit
recognition of process and product variability as a common thread through the
design curriculum. This will prepare our students for their senior design
capstone project and beyond, where they must not only draw on the decision-
making skills developed in the first three years, but must also deal with the
reality of specifying parts unambiguously so that they can be manufactured by
others. Research in the role of geometric variation, especially as it propagates
through assemblies, will complement naturally the educational efforts described
above. This research focuses on advancing a more thorough and fundamental
understanding of the "physics of mechanical assembly" and its application
through the extension of current modeling and analysis methods.

The basis for this research is a novel mathematical assembly model, GapSpace,
that represents both contact and clearance conditions in an assembly. The
broader impacts of these activities will include: (a) involvement of engineering
and non-engineering students in the process of modeling and analyzing geometric
variation, (b) collaboration with other educational institutions - universities,
community colleges, and institutions serving underrepresented groups - in the
dissemination of teaching techniques and materials related to geometric
tolerancing, (c) outreach to K-12 students and teachers in "science summer camp"
programs, (d) continued participation in the development of National Standards
that reflect accurately the current state of knowledge in geometric control and
measurement, and (e) partnering with industry to validate research results and
facilitate the transfer of new analysis methods to practitioners.
