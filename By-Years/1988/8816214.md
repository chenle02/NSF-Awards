Collaborative studies of various topics in mathematical physics will be made.
In particular, the connection, first pointed out by Whitten, between topological
invariants in different geometries and quantum gauge fields will be explored,
with the hope of obtaining information on the behavior of the fields. The
structure of correlations in gauge fields and other systems will be
investigated.
