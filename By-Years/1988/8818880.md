This proposal is to study kidney function and osmoregulation during avian
embryonic development. Current knowledge of kidney function in embryonic/fetal
amniotes has been restricted to basically one species of mammals due to the
difficulty of invasive maternal surgery and catheterization required for
conventional infusion and clearance studies. The proposed experiments are
designed to take advantage of the chick embryo as a versatile accessible model
for kidney function druing early development, mid devlopment and late
development. This system allows easy accessibility to the embryo and
extraembryonic fluid compartments by making a small window in the eggshell on
the second day of incubation, and using microtechniques to determine glomerular
filtration rates, electrolytes, urine flow and compartmental volumes during the
developmental stages. In one group of embryos, the effects on development of
having only one kidney will be determined. Since undergraduate science students
will be involved in all aspects of this project, Dr. Murphy will provide a
stimulating atmosphere to encourage these students to pursue upper division and
graduate studies in the basic sciences.
