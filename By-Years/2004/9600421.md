A cooperative research program on the development of novel theoretical
techniques (`nonperturbative expansions`) primarily applied to quantum
chromodynamics, the theory of strong nuclear interactions, will be carried out.
There will be collaboration between a researcher at the University of Oklahoma
and one at the Bogoliubov Laboratory at Dubna, Russia. The investigators have
been working individually on closely related work. Their collaboration will
facilitate a better understanding of the theory of strong interactions.
