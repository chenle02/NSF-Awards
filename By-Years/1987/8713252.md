This is a conference sponsored by the Department of Mathematics at the
University of Georgia on the cohomology and representation theory of finite and
algebraic groups. The conference is to be held in January of 1988. The purpose
of the conference is to bring together a small number of experts in the research
area to exchange recent results and to consider problems of current research
interest. The conference will concentrate on such topics as the representation
of algebraic groups in characteristic p, in restricted p-Lie algebras and
cohomology rings, and in varieties and complexity of modules over finite groups.
