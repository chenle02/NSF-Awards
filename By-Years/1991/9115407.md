Using methods developed by Soviet scientists, detailed calculations of mesic
atomic and molecular scattering cross sections will be performed. These results
will allow a detailed analysis of experiments which have been performed as a
result of the collaboration between William and Mary, PSI (Switzerland), IMEP
(Austria) and Munich (Germany) and will be helpful in planning future
experiments.
