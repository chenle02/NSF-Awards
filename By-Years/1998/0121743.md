This collaborative project (with personnel at the University of Maryland
Baltimore County) is investigating the creation of a learner-centered
metathesaurus based on the analysis of transactions between learners and two
learning resources - the Math Forum and www.smete.org. Three modes of
interaction are being considered. The first involves data in which many students
respond to the same problem (the "Problem of the Week" at the Math Forum). The
second interactional mode involves data from transactions between learners and
experts (the Math Forum's "Ask Dr. Math" feature). The final interactional mode
under study uses collections at a third resource, www.smete.org, where learner
usage is more in the traditional library mode of search-retrieve. Additional
feedback information in the form of the viewed and selected resources enables
the construction of a map between the learners' language and resource metadata,
which has potential to permit the extension of the metathesaurus across domain
boundaries.
