The objective of this project is to advance the fundamental understanding of
the Laser Additive Manufacturing processes that is necessary for the industrial
implementation of LAM in a wide range of aerospace applications. LAM combines
characteristics of conventional laser welding with the ability to automatically
produce complex geometries. One goal of LAM is to reduce the cost of
manufacturing new aerospace components with complex features. In conventional
manufacturing methods, complex features must be incorporated into a casting or
forging process, at substantial cost. Cost savings can be realized by using LAM
to add complex features to easy-to-produce, generic manufactured components.
Other applications of LAM include the repair of worn or cracked components by
selective material addition, which is substantially more economical than part
replacement. In this project, the relationship between deposition process
variables and the three key deposit characteristics critical to aerospace
applications: melt pool size, residual stress and microstructure will be
developed. This understanding will be demonstrated through model results
presented in the form of process maps, which "map out" the dependence of deposit
characteristics on process variables such as laser power and laser velocity.
Process maps will be of direct use to industry researchers working to advance
LAM processes. This research establishes a strong collaborative team including
academic researchers from three universities, government researchers from two
national labs, and several industry partners. The results of this work are
expected to have a significant impact on the widespread industrial
implementation of LAM processes. This project will also expose graduate,
undergraduate and high school students to research integrating aerospace
applications and manufacturing constraints with the fundamentals of solid
mechanics, heat transfer and materials science.
