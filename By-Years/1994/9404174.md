9404174 Miner The scope of the research entails problems related to the geometry
and topology of complex hyperbolic spaces and group actions on these. Curvature
invariants can be used to distinguish between certain equivalences classes of
manifolds modeled on the boundary of the latter. Further questions concerning
the geometry of Heisenberg space will be pursued. This research may have
potential applications to mathematical physics. ***
