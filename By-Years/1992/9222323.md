Dr. Nowak's research is aimed at obtaining additional knowledge of the
mechanisms underlying N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-channel function in
mammalian brain neurons. The NMDA subclass of glutamate receptors are coupled to
nonselective cation channels permeable to Ca2+ and blocked by Mg2+ in a voltage-
dependent way. It is Ca2+ entry through NMDA channels which is thought to serve
as a trigger for some of the plastic changes observed during nervous system
development and in learning. Thus, the overall goal of the research is to
address the question, "how can the apparently high influx of Ca2+ through NMDA
channels as demonstrated by dye measurements be reconciled with all of the
factors which would tend to limit Ca2+ entry"? One possible explanation is that
there is more diversity among NMDA receptor-channels than previously recognized
with some putative forms of the channels being relatively insensitive to
blockage by Mg2+. Dr. Nowak's first series of experiments will involve an
examination of the similarities and differences in biophysical parameters
between NMDA channels in cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons where
different forms of the channels are predicted to occur. She will then perform
additional experiments designed to examine the potential sites of Ca2+
interaction with NMDA channels. All of the proposed experiments are designed to
explore the fundamental role(s) played by two divalent cations found in
physiological fluids, namely Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, in regulating the functioning
of a major class of neurotransmitter-activated receptor-channels in brain
neurons.
