The objective of this project is to integrate scientific visualization tools
into key engineering laboratory and lecture courses. The goal is for students to
attain an improved physical understanding of the fundamental principles taught
in undergraduate engineering courses through a visual representation of relevant
principles, whether in the field of fluid mechanics, thermal sciences,
structures, etc. The program is implemented in sophomore courses where students
perform simple image processing on canned images to acquaint themselves with the
capabilities of scientific visualization; in upper division courses where image
processing assignments complement in-class discussion of difficult engineering
concepts; and in senior laboratory courses where students capture, digitize, and
analyze images of physical phenomena in a laboratory environment.
