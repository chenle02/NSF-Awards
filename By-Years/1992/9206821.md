The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg,
Austria, is a multinational, nongovernmental institution established in 1972 to
conduct research in systems analysis "in relation to problems of modern society
arising from scientific and technological development." The Institute is
governed by a council comprised of representatives from 15 National Member
Organizations (NMOs), including the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan, and
several Western and Eastern European countries. The grant will support research
in three program areas: (1) Global Environmental Change, (2) Global Economic and
Technological Transitions, and (3) Systems Methods for the Analysis of Global
Issues. The primary goal of the Global Environmental Change program is to
advance understanding and develop the means to assess the implications of the
interactions between human development and the environment. Specific areas of
concern include emission, transformation, and transport of toxic materials and
pollutants; changes in water resource availability and quality; degradation of
soils, biological resources, and ecosystems; and implications for managed
agricultural ecosystems. The Global Economic and Technological Transitions
program is concerned with issues arising from the transition from centrally
planned economies to market economies, the integration of these economies into
world markets, the impact of technological developments on all economies, and
the complex relationships between the economy and the environment. Research in
the Systems Methods program aims at an analytical approach uniting mathematical
modeling and other methods that can deal with complexity, coupling of diverse
processes, uncertainty, and nonlinearity. IIASA maintains a balanced research
program in this area, with an emphasis on applying methodological expertise to
applied problems in its substantive program areas.
