Static blackboard drawings do not help instructors engage advanced psychology
students in learning how humans process perceptual information. Moreover,
blackboard drawings do not permit students to conduct research investigating
perceptual processing. This project funds a perception teaching laboratory
capable of supporting student research projects and teacher-initiated class
demonstrations. The laboratory contains microcomputers and software designed for
tachistoscopic presentation of visual stimuli that both teach and permit
students to explore kinetic factors in depth perception. Specific objectives for
the project are (1) to enhance student understanding of perception of depth
through motion, perception of motion and velocity, visual persistence, backward
visual masking, and the perception of moving equiluminant contours and (2) to
place students in active research roles that require them to use the requested
microcomputers to perform individual experiments on each of the perceptual
topics being taught. The project overcomes current pedagogical deficits by
allowing for experiential, as well as decriptive, learning.
