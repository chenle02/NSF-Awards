ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0125313&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will
use a series of aircraft flights out onto Artic ice fields in the SBI work areas
during March and April of years 2003 and 2004 to obtain hydrographic, nutrient
and other chemical tracer distributions representative of end-winter - early
spring conditions of the underlying water column. These late winter samples will
be used to complement additional Shelf Basin Initiative (SBI) cruise hydrography
in this region. Hydrography (temperature, salinity, density) will be profiled
from the ice surface to 250m or the sea floor depending on water depth.
Additional samples will be taken for nutrients, d 18O and possibly dissolved
inorganic carbon parameters. The study areas will include transects out from
Point Barrow (Alaska) to 1650 W, a transect across the shelf-slope break at 1540
W, and a transect across the shelf break at 1510 W, along the location of a
current meter mooring line which is deployed as part of the larger SBI
experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
