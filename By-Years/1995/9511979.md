Evidence that poor and minority neighborhoods suffer disproportionate levels of
exposure to environmental hazards has mobilized citizen groups, and these groups
have pressured governmental officials for action to alleviate the problems. The
unknown source(s) of environmental inequities raises additional questions. Are
government actions directly responsible for inequitable risks from environmental
pollution? To date, the contribution of public policy to environmental inequity
has been viewed as a problem to be remedied rather than a hypothesis to be
tested. This research will evaluate the distributional consequences of policy
decisions in environmental protection. The research will establish whether
policy decisions produce unequal risks. If so, the processes that generate these
policy outcomes will be examined. A model of environmental policymaking will be
offered and tested. The model will provide insight into the consequences of
market incentives on pollution control as well as the ways in which government
policy can increase or alleviate environmental inequities.
