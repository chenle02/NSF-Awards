Partners for Terrific Science (PTS) is a multi-faceted teacher enhancement
project for 4th through 12th grade teachers. The five initiatives are: 1. an
academic year Industrial Applications Workshop (IAW) for intra-district teams,
2. summer Industrial Internships for graduates of the (IAW), 3. a Facilitator's
Program enabling engineers, scientists, university faculty and master teachers
to establish PTS programming, 4. two-week summer workshops where the teachers
concentrate on the science and technology of one- industry and develop
corresponding classroom materials, and 5. a concerted outreach effort to
disseminate PTS. Written materials include: Partners for Terrific Science
Handbook, workshops materials developed by the mentor teams, and Handbook
updates. Project faculty include teams of industrial scientists and engineers,
university science or science education faculty, and Partners for Terrific
Science will take place at Miami University beginning in September, 1991, and
ending in March, 1995. The PI is Mickey Sarquis. The project includes both
summer and academic-year activities with appropriate follow-up elements. Model
site programming, facilitator efforts, and second generation outreach efforts
will be evaluated through an on-going multi-step process that will allow
continual monitoring of progress toward stated goals. Cost sharing equals 212%
of the NSF award.
