This project is increasing the success rate of financially needy students in the
Master of Marine and Environmental Science (MMES) program at the University. The
MMES program serves an environmentally fragile and economically disadvantaged
region whose residents are predominantly racial minorities. The S-STEM project's
objectives are to (1) eliminate barriers that hinder financially needy students
from participating in the MMES program and (2) increase participation by
students from under-represented groups. Academically talented and financially
needy undergraduates or working professionals, especially Virgin Islanders,
black and Hispanic students, and women, are recruited through seminars,
opportunities for assisting in hands-on research, and financial support once
enrolled. To guide students from acceptance to graduation and career placement,
a dedicated S-STEM Faculty Mentor is working with students. S-STEM Scholars have
access to tutoring, the opportunity to participate in paid internships, and
financial support for completing their Masters thesis research. &lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the project is the contribution that the students make to
scientific knowledge through their original thesis research within the context
of a tropical island ecosystem. The intellectual challenge for the students is
to approach environmental issues through a joint scientific and management
perspective. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal are that the MMES
program is training the next generation of diverse environmental leaders to
respond to the need for creative, well prepared managers and scientists to
address Caribbean and global environmental crises. There is a clear benefit to
society as people depend on the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs and
the other systems of the Virgin Islands.
