Recently, an algorithm has been established to describe the unitary dual of a
Lie group arising as the real points of a complex connected reductive algebraic
group. Interestingly, the algorithm forges connections with other mathematical
ideas outside of real groups (for example, twisted Lusztig-Vogan polynomials and
the study of mixed Hodge modules on flag varieties). The new theoretical
developments that led to the algorithm suggest many exciting new directions,
both in conceptualizing the answer that the algorithm provides, as well as
pushing the ideas in new settings (for example by studying functorial
relationships with representations of reductive groups over p-adic fields). The
projects undertaken under the support of this grant are devoted to investigating
those directions. In particular, the PI plans to investigate the behavior of the
algorithm on representations predicted to be automorphic. He also plans to adapt
aspects of the algorithm to the setting of graded affine Hecke, and therefore
obtain information about unitary representations of p-adic
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lie groups (named after the Norwegian mathematician
Sophus Lie) are at the center of much of the mathematics developed in the
twentieth century. They are the language in which physicists encode symmetry,
and thus have been studied intensely for their applications to physical problems
exhibiting symmetry. Particular examples have led to significant advances in
signal processing. In a completely different direction, Robert Langlands used
Lie groups as the language to attack problems in number theory, aspects of which
have led to applications in modern cryptography. The projects undertaken under
the support of this grant place limitations on how Lie groups can appear as
symmetries of physical problems, on one hand, and limitations on how they can
appear as symmetries of number theory problems, on the other. These limitation,
therefore, rule out candidate solutions in both contexts, and thus provide
powerful insight into the actual solutions and the important applications
mentioned above.
