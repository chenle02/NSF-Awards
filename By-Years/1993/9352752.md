9352752 Clayton The project will purchase a high field nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer to enable its students to fully learn modern
chemical methods. The instrument will be used at all levels of the curriculum
and its use will lead students progressively to a more sophisticated
understanding of the power of the NMR method. In the descriptive inorganic
course, students will experience the utility of multinuclear NMR and learn to
apply the method for the determination of physical properties. In the physical
chemistry laboratory, the spectrometer will be used to determine kinetic
parameters, thus illustrating the application of NMR to time dependent
phenomena. A rich array of advanced NMR techniques will be featured in the upper
level chemistry courses including multinuclear methods, quantitative analysis,
relaxation time techniques, and two-dimensional methods. The instrument will
have regional impact as well. ***
