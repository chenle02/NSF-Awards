Number fields, algebraic structures associated with the roots of polynomials,
are important objects in algebraic number theory. A crucial component in
studying these algebraic structures is to understand interesting invariants of
it, and the symmetry of the number field heavily influences the behavior of
these invariants. More precisely, although the invariants can be mysterious and
random for a single number field, as in a family, their statistics obey certain
distributions determined by this symmetry. The goal of this project is to study
these invariants utilizing their symmetry from a statistical point of view. In
particular, this research will prove new results on invariants for number fields
with special symmetry, discover new phenomena in arithmetic structures motivated
by statistical results, and propose new statistical measurements of these
invariants. This project will also include research opportunities for graduates,
undergraduates and postdocs, and will facilitate in-depth conversations between
the analytic and algebraic sides of number theory.

More concretely, this project will investigate distribution results for
discriminants and class groups of global fields with a fixed Galois group, using
tools from algebraic number theory and analytic number theory. For the
distribution of discriminants, this project will prove new asymptotic
distribution, upper bound and lower bound using relative invariants and
inductive ideas. It will also include discussions of global fields with
different characters and symmetry. For the distribution of class groups, this
project will study both extremal behavior for a single number field and
statistical behavior for a family of number fields. It includes investigating
new existence-type arithmetic questions and representation theory questions
suggested by distribution problems. On the other hand, this project will propose
and study generalizations and variations of the class number problems. Finally,
this project will also address fundamental questions on the distribution of
roots of polynomials. This includes giving sharp inequalities leading to
equidistribution results and constructing optimal root distributions with
respect to various functionals.
