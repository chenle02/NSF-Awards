The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of
Massachusetts has a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program in the
department's Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory. Researchers in this laboratory
create research instrumentation that is used by federal agencies, industry and
other universities to conduct important scientific experiments on the earth's
atmosphere, oceans, land and ice surfaces. Undergraduate students supported
under this project will work with a large number of talented pre- and post-
doctoral researchers, who design, fabricate, test and use their sophisticated
sensors in geophysical experiments with members of the scientific community.
This work will require the students to do highly interdisciplinary work in the
laboratory and in the field.
