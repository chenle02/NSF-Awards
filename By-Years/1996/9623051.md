9623051 Tsygan This grant supports the research of Professor B. Tsygan to work
on various problems in the deformation theory of Poisson manifolds. In
particular he will work on algebraic index theorems, the homological algebra of
characteristic classes and quantum cohomology and applications of structure
theorems for deformations to both Riemann-Roch and the Verlinde formulas. This
is research that starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that to
touch both geometry and theoretical physics. The reasons for these connections
are that algebra can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As
such algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In
particular the modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses this area of
algebra extensively and this project will study some of these connections at
length.
