Equipment is obtained that is required to perform testing on VLSI chips and this
equipment consists of two parts. The first part is a logic analysis system which
includes a logic analyzer and a pattern generator. The pattern generator
generates a sequence of test vectors which are then fed into the unit under
test. The outputs of the logic analyzer are used to detect errors in the chip
(only at the logic level). The second part of testing is at the physical level
which requires a probing station system. This system has probes which can access
almost every part of the chip. Signals are fed in and out of the chip and a
particular part of the chip can be isolated. The Hewlett Packard 163OG is the
logic analyzer to be used and the 600-MZ analytical test station from micro-tec
West, Inc., forms that major portion of the probing system. The VLSI testing
station will be used to check chips for communication and signal processing
systems, in particular, a concatenated coding system.
