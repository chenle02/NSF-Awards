The objective of this research is to study the mechanics of granular material
from micro-structural point view to obtain the stress-strain relationship. The
focus of this research is to formulate the stress-strain relationship for large
strain problems with a continuum representation which will be studied with
particular attention to the fundamental understanding of the behavior of
granular systems, such as energy dissipation, stress- dilatancy characterists,
etc.. The objective will be achieved by redefining the continuum variables,
stress and strain, in terms of contact forces and micro geometrical measures.
The stress-strain relationship will be developed by considering the sliding, and
rotation of the particles. The theory will be then extended for pickings made of
multi-sized and non-spherical shape particles. Experimental studies on
assemblies of rods and computer simulation will be conducted to aid the
development the theory. the results from the experimental studies and computer
simulation along with the available date from studies on natural granular
systems, such as sands, will be used to validate the developed theory.
