The proposed workshop will convene experts in discipline-based education
research (DBER) to introduce novice DBER scholars to interdisciplinary
educational theories and research methodologies and to support their scholarship
through ongoing mentoring. The event aims to unite mathematics and physics
researchers with discipline-based education researchers to share knowledge,
develop new understandings, and create new networks. Participants will develop
research questions around their interests, with close attention to functional
research design, including data collection and analysis, methodology, and
theoretical frameworks. The workshop sessions will integrate issues related to
project development and dissemination. The project is expected to bridge the gap
between discipline-based scholars and STEM education researchers while expanding
the contribution to scholarship about STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
three-day workshop curriculum is divided into three primary strands: research
design and generativity; theory and methods; and communication and ethics. Each
strand has associated modules and combined individual and group activities and
learning objectives. A diverse group of 20 participants will be selected to
complete the modules and receive mentoring that is tailored to their needs.
Mechanisms will be established for ongoing networking and communication among
the participants and between the participants and the project team. The workshop
is expected to help establish interdisciplinary communities of practice that can
be sustained through virtual meetings. The project has the potential to broaden
the pool of STEM education researchers and enhance knowledge transfer between
mathematics and physics scholars. The project is supported by the ECR: Building
Capacity in STEM Education Research competition of the EHR Core Research (ECR)
program. ECR funds fundamental STEM education research projects that address
topics relevant to STEM learning and learning environments, broadening
participation in STEM fields, and STEM professional workforce
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
