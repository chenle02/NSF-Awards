This three-year proposal requests funds to establish a Minority Scholar Program
for graduate and undergraduate physics majors Research Assistantship support is
requested for three minority Graduate Scholars who will be selected
competitively to do doctoral research with a faculty supervisor in one of the
Department's many exciting research areas. This will be augmented each year by
ongoing special Institute Fellowships which provide full support for three
minority students pursuing Ph.D.s in Physics. All six graduate students
participating in this Minority Scholar Program will be designated as Graduate
Scholars. Many of the Department's undergraduates are introduced to physics
research through MIT's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), which
is recognized as a national leader in university research programs for
undergraduates. This proposal also requests funds to support five Undergraduate
Scholars selected competitively from the under-represented minority students.
Undergraduate Scholars supported through the Minority Scholar Program will work
closely with individual faculty supervisors. Historically, the UROP program has
been very effective in involving undergraduates in stimulating, front-line
physics research.
