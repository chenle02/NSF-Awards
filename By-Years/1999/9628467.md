GLAZ DMS-9628467 The Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland,
College Park, will purchase $77,323 of equipment and will spend $23,088 for
personnel to support research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will
be used to study: (1) Systems of Conservation Laws and Applications to
Computational Fluid and Solid Mechanics; (2) Hydrodynamics near the liquid-vapor
critical point; (3) Fast Multilevel Boundary Element Algorithms; (4) Dynamics of
encapsulated vortices in nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and (5) Eigenvalue
Problems for Ordinary Differential Equations. We purpose to upgrade the RAM
memory of the existing SGI Indigo2 workstation by 256MB and purchase two Indigo2
workstations with 250MHz R4400 chip, and one Indy workstation with a 200MHz
R4400SC chip.
