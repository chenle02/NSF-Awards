ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0429492&lt;br/&gt;Shriram Krishnamurthi&lt;br/&gt;Brown
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As programs evolve, their code becomes
increasingly tangled by the addition of both programmers and requirements. This
mosaic quality complicates program comprehension and maintenance. The lack
of&lt;br/&gt;quality documentation in most systems further complicates this
process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new developer is likely to approach a system
with the same mindset as a user, viewing the system as a collection of features,
not in terms of its internal structure. The proposed research thus
describes&lt;br/&gt;program fragments in terms of the features they impact, so
developers can assess the effect their changes are likely to have and, in
particular, be alerted to unexpected consequences. It will do this by exploiting
information provided in the program's test suites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal should result in tools to help programmers such as a better,
``semantic'' code browser; an assistant to generate better version-control
documentation; and an analysis of test suite dependencies. It will also study
questions that facilitate future programming language design. Broader impact
will include introducing new, related ideas into software engineering education
and training undergraduates to conduct research.&lt;br/&gt;
