This proposed focuses on a two year series of summer workshops, with an
evaluation period, in Scientific Visualization. These workshops are scheduled
for the summers of 1996 and 1997. The workshops are jointly sponsored by NSF and
the ACM SIGGRAPH education committee. The co-PIs have successfully conducted CCD
and workshops in Computer Graphics, sponsored by the NSF. The workshops have 3
separate objectives: provide participants with working knowledge of scientific
visualization, to produce curriculum materials, and to bring participants into
an awareness of this emerging discipline. The concept for these workshops builds
on previous foundation work done by the professional societies. The utility of
these workshops will be evaluated after the participants have had a chance to
integrated this new knowledge and curricular material within their own CS
programs, by formal follow up by the PI. The results of this evaluation will be
reported to the community. The PIs intend to actively pursue minority and women
participation in all workshops. They have linked with individuals and
institutions at HBCUs that have interest in participating in the workshops.
