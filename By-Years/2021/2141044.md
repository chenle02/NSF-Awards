The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project advances a technology to lower the cost
and improve the performance of products, such as cloud web services and mobile
computing. Furthermore, it will enable new high-performance embedded
applications, such as self-driving vehicle technology and internet-connected
medical devices. The proposed research develops a semiconductor packaging
process to improve the manufacturing speed by a factor of 3x. This grant expands
the pool of engineers from diverse backgrounds through the active engagement and
mentoring of students from traditionally underrepresented populations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project develops microscale selective laser
sintering (μ-SLS) to overcome many of the current limits in advanced packaging
applications through the direct, high-throughput fabrication of 3D metal
structures with feature sizes of less than 5 μm and aspect ratios greater than
20:1. The envisioned system will fabricate high-density, high-aspect-ratio,
freeform 3D, microscale interconnect structures at rates up to three times
faster than existing technologies. The specific aims of this proposal are to
address the nanoparticle coating and sintering processes through improved
understanding of: (1) The nanoparticle coating process to facilitate more
uniform and repeatable layers within the layer-by-layer additive manufacturing
process, (2) The multilayer sintering process to create higher quality and
higher resolution 3D interconnect structures, and (3) The factors that create
defects and limit yield in the μ-SLS process through the integration of improved
metrology and process control systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
