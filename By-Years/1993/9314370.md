9314370 Barth This project entails the use of a variety of observational
techniques, including rapid upper-ocean hydrographic surveying and towed
acoustic current profiler, to study the circulation in the separation region of
a baroclinic jet off central Oregon. The study seeks to determine: (1) how and
why a strong alongshore coastal current turns offshore, crosses steep topography
and becomes an oceanic jet; (2) how the structure, position and vorticity of the
jet vary downstream; and, (3) how the separating jet is related to the coastal
upwelling front. ***
