This project focuses on the modern theory of automorphic forms and the Langlands
Program. Automorphic Forms are functions with abundant symmetries. These
symmetries are the guidelines to understanding the intrinsic structures of
objects in our universe. In Mathematics, these symmetries are common grounds for
many different theories such as Geometry, Number Theory, Mathematical Physics,
Algebra and Analysis. Hence the modern theory of automorphic forms, essentially
the Langlands program, provides the organizing principle for further research in
these areas. The research of the PI has a goal of establishing basic structures
for automorphic forms. The PI will train graduate students and postodcs, and
give lectures on his research to broader community, including public lectures,
primary lectures and research talks in various occasions and conferences.

The PI, Dihua Jiang, will continue his research on the discrete spectrum of
square-integrable automorphic forms, L-functions and the Langlands functoriality
conjectures. The basic problems that the PI has been investigating are refined
structures of the discrete spectrum of automorphic forms on classical groups,
analytic and arithmetic properties of automorphic L-functions, and explicit
Langlands functorial transfers for square-integrable automorphic forms via
automorphic integral transforms. The theory of endoscopy, the existence of which
was discovered by R. Langlands in 1980's and confirmed through the fundamental
work of B.-C. Ngo and J. Arthur and others via the trace formula approach. On
the one hand, the PI intends to study refined structure based on the existence
of endoscopy. On the other hand, the PI intends to construct explicit modules
for the cuspidal automorphic forms via integral transform with automorphic
kernel functions, so that the endoscopic transfers can be realized via integral
transforms, Moreover, the PI will develop the theory of twisted automorphic
descents that can be used to prove substantially new cases of the global Gan-
Gross-Prasad conjecture, establish new higher rank cases of non-vanishing of the
central critical value of tensor product $L$-functions. Meanwhile, the PI also
plans to develop the local theory, relating basic problems in harmonic analysis
of groups over a local filed to the arithmetic data that are given by the local
Langlands conjecture. The long term research goal of the PI is to understand the
general local-global-automorphic principles in the theory of automorphic forms,
which reflects one of the basic principles in the arithmetic and number theory.
