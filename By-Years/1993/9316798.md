9316798 Kraichnan Under this award, the principal investigator will pursue three
related topics directed at fundamental understanding of turbulent cascade
processes: (1) a search for bounds on scaling exponents of the inertial range of
three-dimensional incompressible Navier- Stokes turbulence; (2) development of
analytical methods for predicting statistics of velocity differences across
distances that fall within the inertial range of scales; (3) theoretical and
numerical study of the probability of extreme values of velocity, vorticity, and
other quantities of turbulent flow. The first project will make systematic use
of exact multi-time dynamical constraints and multi-time realizability
inequalities on statistics. The second project will exploit nonlinear mapping
techniques in order to approximate probability distribution functions and other
high-order statistics of velocity differences across inertial-range distances.
The third project will use nonlinear mapping techniques to estimate the
magnitude and sensitivity of extreme-value tails of probability distribution
functions for turbulence and other nonlinear processes. This research will
provide important insights for a variety of problems in atmospheric sciences
including improvement of the modeling of subgrid-scale processes. ***
