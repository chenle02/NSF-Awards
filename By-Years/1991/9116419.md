An invitational workshop is proposed on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in
the Dry Valleys of Antarctic. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together
leading experts in Antarctic and comparable ecosystems in Arctic and Temperate
regions to discuss the scientific priorities for future research in the Dry
Valleys. A second major aspect of this workshop will be the consideration of
technological, logistical, operational, and environmental concerns associated
with the conduct of this research. The motivation for holding this workshop is
the increased scientific interest and concern that the Antarctic Dry Valleys may
be one of the best barometers of climatic change. The 3 day workshop will be
held at the New York Botanical Gardens' Institute of Ecosystem Studies. Several
foreign scientists will included in the workshop. The organizing committee will
model the workshop after the very successful Dalhem conferences which allow
participants to provide input and discussion on each topic. A report will be
published and distributed following the workshop.
