Chakravarthy This project is aimed at bringing together in a conference forum
researchers, practitioners, and students with interest in matrix-analytic
methods for modeling stochastic systems. The conference has multiple objectives.
These objectives include 1) review of the progress of research and the state-of-
the-art in matrix analytical methods in stochastic models, 2) the analysis of
the design of a tutorial that would allow providing a working knowledge of
matrix-analytical methods to practitioners and students in a form that they can
put the technique to use, 3) discuss and identify technological areas of
application of the technique, 4) present resent unpublished research results,
and 5) identify directions for future research. Matrix-analytical method for
modeling stochastic systems is a relative new area with the first set of
systematic studies appearing in the 1980s. Since then, a number of researchers
in various fields such as telecommunication, production, and computer systems
have applied it to model problems. Despite their widespread areas of
applications, matrix-analytical procedure is still relatively unknown to many
potential users and researchers in the general area of stochastic analysis. The
conference will help to close the gap and disseminate the technique and its
potential application to a much wider audience than has been so far possible.
