In the real world, visual objects commonly block, or occlude, each other from
view. Very little is known about how the brain makes up for the missing
information about an occluded object and recognizes it nonetheless. This project
will help elucidate the mechanisms by which the brain recognizes occluded
objects using neurophysiological methods and will determine what individual
cells in the relevant brain regions do when the brain recognizes an occluded
object. The study will also help characterize which tell-tale features in the
visible portions of an occluded object the brain uses for this purpose, and how
it uses them. For example, someone's eyes may serve as a dead give-away for
them, thus the brain may use this information about the eyes to recognize that
person, even when the rest of the face is occluded. Given the ubiquity of
occluded objects in the real world, understanding how one perceives occluded
objects is critical to understanding, in a larger sense, how the brain works.
This research will also facilitate the development of better machine-vision
tools, so as to help computers better recognize objects of interest in the real
world.

This project also has a significant educational component. For example,
classroom courses and hands-on research experience opportunities will not only
impart scientific knowledge, but also help students develop an active interest
in pursuing careers in science and technology. Undergraduates and graduate
students from the Investigator's institution as well as from many other local
colleges and universities will participate in this project, providing additional
opportunities for students. The results, resources, and tools generated by this
project will be made publically available on the Investigator's website at
