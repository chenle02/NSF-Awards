The proposed research is dedicated to the development and implementation of
integral equation methods for linear equations based on the Fast Multipole
Method (FMM) for use with adaptive finite difference methods for incompressible
flow. The scientific objective of this course of research is to produce new
methods for the study of phenomena in incompressible flow systems which are not
easily approached with existing methods. For incompressible flow systems, the
divergence constraint requires the solution of global elliptic equations which
greatly increases the complexity and computational cost of simulation. Many
fluid systems also contain a large range of relevant length scales which
necessitates the use of spatially and temporally adaptive methods. When
applicable, integral equation methods offer the possibility of efficient,
adaptive, high-order methods which are readily applicable to complex
computational geometries and are also highly parallel. Three distinct
applications of FMM will be developed and coupled with adaptive fluid solvers:
solution of the Poisson equation, solution of the surface Laplacian, and the
fast summation of impulse potentials, each in the context of a specific physical
problem. The numerical study of Boussinesq convection, in which strong localized
fronts develop, requires that a standard Poisson equation be solved. Simulating
front formation of the quasigeostrophic thermal scalar and internal waves in two
fluid systems requires that a psuedo-differential operator equivalent to a
surface Laplacian be inverted. A new approach to modeling thin flexible
membranes in incompressible flows requires that membrane forces be evaluated at
all grid points as well as a Poisson equation be solved to enforce
incompressibility. For all of these physical problems, adaptive methods offer
the opportunity to study problems which are unapproachable with uniform mesh
methods.

The range of important fluid flow applications which the proposed research could
impact is quite diverse. Examples include modeling the ocean or climate,
predicting oil recovery or contaminant flows in the ground, simulating
combustion or nuclear reactions, and modeling the flow of blood in organs like
the heart or kidneys. For these types of applications, the solution of linear
equations represents the most computationally intensive part of the overall
computer model. The use of integral equation methods to solve the linear
equations within these models represents a distinct change from the majority of
current computer simulations. Any increase in the efficiency in which these
equations can be solved translates directly into the ability for scientists to
run larger and more accurate models. The mathematical and computational
techniques necessary to make integral equation methods an attractive alternative
to more standard approaches has only been fully developed in the last 10 years.
Because of the complexity and newness of these methods, little work has been
done to exploit their power in applications involving fluid flow. The
applications that will be pursued as test cases for the new methods represent
problems for which current numerical techniques are inadequate for answering
fundamental questions of interest to scientists. The algorithms developed will
also serve as a stepping stone for future methods applicable to more complicated
problems.
