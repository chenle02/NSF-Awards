A much-touted advantage of the relational data model is the existence of a
formal calculus and algebra to model database queries. In practice, these
formalisms fail to model many of the features present in commercial query
languages (e.g., SQL): grouping, aggregation, duplicate values, and sort orders.
The gap only widens as one moves to object- oriented query languages, such as
OQL of ODMG-93, which must deal with multiple bulk (collection) types, arbitrary
nesting of type constructors, methods and embedded query expressions. Such
features also appear in relational query language standards proposals, such as
SQL3. This work addresses efficient query processing for modern database
languages. It seeks to demonstrate through prototype implementation that new
language features can be handled more effectively if these features have direct
support in a query calculus. The research framework is based on such a calculus,
called the monoid comprehension calculus. Instead of starting from relational
algebra and making extensions, our formal model represents naturally the new
emerging features of database lang uages. A successful outcome for the research
will lead to a better basis for implementing the query processors of commercial
database systems, both of pure object-oriented models and relational-object
