9520526 Neuman The goal of this research is to develop inexpensive
instrumentation for the detection of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in the patients
home. This instrumentation is to be based upon new sensor technology resulting
from research at the Duke-North Carolina Engineering Research Center for
Emerging Cardiovascular Technologies support by the National Science Foundation.
The investigator's goal is to develop low-cost microelectronics-based biomedical
sensors for accurate detecting of bacterial vaginosis with an intravaginal
probe. A tampon-like disposable probe will be developed in two forms-one with
electrical connection to a linear eternal electronic readout (a microcomputer)
for the doctor's office and another self contained unit (battery operated) for
home testing for BV infections. The multi-institutional and multidisciplinary
research team is quite impressive and the impressive investigators have
extensive experience in the areas necessary for completing the work plan. The
project involves multidisciplinary interactions from three universities.
Fundamental chemistry studies and development of the biosensors will be carried
out in the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina;
microelectronics fabrication of sensors will use facilities of the Case Western
Reserve University and North Carolina State University; economic modeling will
be done at Duke University and Case. The potential for cost reduction is through
the development of simple technology for detecting BV that will reduce the cost
of diagnosis as well as reducing treatment costs resulting from nonspecific
diagnosis. ***
