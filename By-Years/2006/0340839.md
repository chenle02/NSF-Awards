This award provides funding for an ADVANCE project with two main components; 1)
To enlarge and expand an existing online database of species distribution data
from seamounts (Seamounts Online: http://seamounts.sdsc.edu); and 2) the
systematic testing of several hypotheses about species endemic to seamounts
using this global dataset. The database content will be expanded to cover all
high-quality species level sampling from seamounts. The results of this work
will further our understanding of species associated with seamounts, many of
which are valuable to the U.S. economy. It may allow us to better manage these
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVANCE awards are intended to promote the
careers of women in science. &lt;br/&gt;
