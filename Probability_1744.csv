Specific instances include biochemical reaction networks, high-tech manufacturing, computer systems, telecommunications, transportation, and business service systems. This project addresses mathematical questions stemming from the challenges of analyzing and controlling such stochastic networks. The research involves the development of general theory for some broad classes of stochastic networks and the study of questions directly motivated by specific applications. Since the complexity of stochastic networks usually precludes exact analysis of detailed ?microscopic? models, the focus here is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation are considered: first-order approximations called fluid models, and second-order approximations, which frequently are diffusion models. New techniques and results will be developed with an eye toward application areas. The investigator will help train a diverse mathematics research workforce through collaboration with early career researchers and women researchers. The project also provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>This project will address mathematical questions associated with the analysis and control of stochastic network dynamics. Topics to be addressed include rigorous justification of approximations, analyzing and controlling the behavior of the approximate models, and interpreting the results for the original microscopic models.  An important subtheme is understanding the interplay between levels of approximation. Five topics are to be studied:<br/>(i) Diffusion Approximations for (Bio)Chemical Reaction Networks and Nearly Density-Dependent Markov Chains;<br/>(ii) Analysis of Processor Sharing Networks;<br/>(iii) Congestion Control and Resource Entrainment in Data Networks;<br/>(iv) Networks with Random Order of Service and Reneging; and<br/>(v) Dynamic Control of Stochastic Processing Networks.<br/>Some stochastic process aspects of these topics include error quantification in the approximation of nearly density-dependent Markov chains by reflected diffusion processes, analysis of measure-valued processes used to track residual job sizes or patience times in stochastic networks with resource sharing and reneging, singular diffusion control problems, foundational questions for reflected processes, and numerical approximation of reflected diffusion processes in non-smooth domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a powerful approach to answering combinatorial questions, often leading to exact and explicit enumerative formulas that are not obtainable from first principles. Asymptotic algebraic combinatorics deals with discrete structures whose defining parameters are extremely large, far exceeding the numerical range of everyday physical experience. In this setting, exact formulas become unwieldy and unusable; asymptotic algebraic combinatorics leverages algebraic methods to obtain useful approximations that are typically not accessible. The algebraic approach to asymptotic combinatorics is especially pertinent in the age of big data, where discrete structures loom large over the information landscape, but the tools to handle them are in short supply. This research project intends employ algebraic techniques to further develop useful tools in asymptotic combinatorics. The project will involve graduate students in the research.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new algebraic methods for the asymptotic analysis of large structures that appear in probability and mathematical physics. On the probabilistic side, the PI will build a theory of asymptotic Fourier analysis for large random matrices using recent analysis of large rank orbital integrals as a foundation. One of the main goals of this endeavor is to provide a toolbox that can be uniformly applied to both large random matrices and their quantized counterparts, random representations of large Lie groups. On the mathematical physics side, the PI plans to use the algebraic techniques underlying recent analysis of large rank link integrals to undertake a rigorous study of Yang-Mills partition functions, first revisiting the two-dimensional case and then moving to higher dimensions via link integrals. A key goal here is to rigorously understand combinatorics of asymptotic freedom and gauge-string dualities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For low dimensional time series, there is a well-developed estimation and inference theory. Inference theory in the high dimensional setting is of fundamental importance and has wide applications, but has been rarely studied. Researchers face a number of challenges in solving real-world problems: (i) complex dynamics of data generating systems, (ii) temporal and cross-sectional dependencies, (iii) high dimensionality and (iv) non-Gaussian distributions. The goal of this project is to develop and advance inference theory for high dimensional time series data by concerning all the above characteristics. The project will provide training to graduate students and publicly avaialble statistical packages. <br/><br/>This project involves developing a systematic asymptotic theory for estimation and inference for high dimensional time series, including parameter estimation, construction of simultaneous confidence intervals, prediction, model selection, Granger causality test, hypothesis testing, and spectral domain estimation. To this end, a new methodology for the estimation of parameters and second-order characteristics for high dimensional time series will be proposed. New tools and concentration inequalities for the asymptotic analysis of high-dimensional time series will be developed. To perform simultaneous inference and significance testing, the PIs will investigate the very deep Gaussian approximation problem and the high dimensional central limit theorems by taking both high dimensionality and temporal and cross-sectional dependencies into account.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's Theorem says that whenever the two-element subsets of the set N of positive integers are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two element subsets are the same color.  Many years ago, the principal investigator proved that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition.  The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. Subsequently, other proofs were found that were less complicated.  But in 1975, F. Galvin and S. Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which makes it a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents.  Sets with the property that they contain all the finite sums from a sequence are called IP sets.  By virtue of the connection discovered above, a set is an IP set if and only if it has an idempotent in its closure in the Stone-Cech compactification of N. Those that have special idempotents which are called ""minimal"" in their closure are ""central"" sets.  These sets have much stronger properties, many of which are consequences of the Central Sets Theorem.  But central sets have a very complicated elementary description.  Sets which satisfy the conclusion of the Central Sets Theorem are called ""C-sets"", and are much easier to describe in an elementary fashion.  The proposed investigation of these various algebraically characterized large subsets of N should continue to yield new Ramsey-theoretic results.<br/> <br/>A significant portion of the funds in this grant will provide support for graduate students at Howard University, an historically black university.  In particular, the grant will provide stipends for three Ph.D. students, two of whom are black Americans, both female.  This project will therefore be instrumental in training  mathematicians who come from a population that is severely underrepresented within the population of US mathematicians."

The first is to study the smoothness properties of densities for laws of solutions to hypoelliptic stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion.  The second is to continue to analyze certain finite dimensional geometric approximations to Wiener measure on a Riemannian manifold.  The eventual goal is to include the super-symmetric setting which will likely entail analysis in non-commutative probability spaces.  The P.I. expects this aspect of the project will make contact with the theory of random matrices.  The third problem is devoted to proving parabolic regularity results for heat equations on certain infinite dimensional Lie groups including loop groups.  In one way or another each of these problems may be recast (at least heuristically) as problem involving path integrals.  Many of the projects proposed here are loosely motivated by the fundamental problem of constructing quantize Yang-Mills fields.  See the Clay Mathematics Institute problem pertaining to quantized Yang - Mills fields for a description of this problem and its importance to the so called standard model in physics. <br/> <br/>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) was implicitly introduced by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1940.  (Kolmogorov seemed to have in mind possible applications to the theory of turbulence.)  A later paper by Mandelbrot and Van Ness (1968) describes a number of possible applications for fBm including using it for economic and hydrology models.  The recent literature includes applications of fBm in the modeling of neural networks, the pricing of financial instruments, and to understanding the clustering of galaxies.  One of the main projects of this proposal is to study the statistical behavior of these types of dynamical systems which are driven by fractional Brownian motion.  The P.I. will also focus on two other projects during the period of this research grant.  One of these projects is a continuation of the P.I.'s program to better understand the Feynman ""path integral"" techniques which are used in the quantum mechanical description of atomic and sub-atomic particles.  Although highly studied, the mathematical footing of Feynman's path integrals is still tenuous at best.  The third project is to generalize the results of the first two projects to ""infinite dimensions.""  It turns out that the seemingly very abstract generalization to infinite dimensions is precisely what is needed in order to understand the quantum mechanical description of the fundamental forces in nature.  (This topic goes under the heading of quantum field theory in the particle physics literature.)  It is a long standing major challenge to make mathematically rigorous sense of interacting quantum field theories.  This proposal has a significant graduate training component as a number of the problems will be tackled by the P.I.'s students."

Coalescent processes are stochastic processes that model a system of particles which start out separated and merge into clusters as time goes forward.  These processes can be used to describe the genealogy of a population because if one takes a sample from a population and follows the ancestral lines backwards in time, the ancestral lines will coalesce.<br/>One goal is to gain more insight into the effect that natural selection has on this process.  The mathematical aspects of this question are related to branching Brownian motion, the FKPP equation, and the theory of spin glasses.  The PI also studies problems in coalescent theory that come from population genetics, related to how increasing population sizes or large family sizes affect the coalescent process, and therefore the patterns of mutations that are likely to be observed in a sample from the population.  A third project is to determine the distribution of the time that it takes for one individual in a population to experience a specified number of mutations.<br/><br/>Stochastic models of coalescence have a wide range of applications in other fields of science such as biology, physical chemistry, and astronomy.  Biologists interested in understanding evolution are concerned with the merging of the ancestral lines of a sample from a population.

An additional project involves determining the amount of time that it takes for one individual in a population to experience several mutations.<br/>This project is motivated by models of cancer in which it is assumed that a cell becomes cancerous only after several harmful mutations take place.<br/><br/>"

These include numerical approximations of expectations of both functions and functionals of solutions of SDEs, whether they be diffusions or more generally Markov processes with jumps.  Models inspired by Stochastic Finance theory will receive  attention; one example is forward-backward SDEs, where a general weak existence and uniqueness theorem is sought.  Further a special emphasis is devoted to filtering theory where a new Monte Carlo approach is developed, and also a martingale problem approach will be tried to treat the infinite dimensional case.  Stochastic partial differential equations will be studied via a new method of viscosity solutions, hopefully yielding existence, uniqueness and stability results in the fully nonlinear case.  Quasi-linear backward SDEs will be studied with an eye to applications in Stochastic Finance theory; in addition several problems in Finance theory will be treated directly, including complete markets with jumps and competitive price equilibria in incomplete markets.<br/> The principal investigators of this project study stochastic differential  equations.  A differential equation models phenomena that vary with time,  dealing with rates of change.  A stochastic differential equation includes the  possibility that the change comes from random forces.  Examples of  applications can be found in modeling radio and x-ray transmissions, and  cellular telephone signals, where the randomness comes from static noise;  biological examples where growth of viruses and plants have a random  component; and also in banking and finance where interest rate models,  commodity prices, and securities prices are modeled with random components.   The stochastic differential equations are complicated and sophisticated and  cannot be solved with explicit solutions: the desired quantities need to be  approximated by using a high speed computer.  Efficient algorithms are needed  and these methods are not yet well understood; by consequence the practitioner  has a choice to use models that are too simple but with methods that work, or  models that better approximate the true state of nature but for which methods  work poorly, if at all.  We propose to remedy this situation to a large extent  by developing algorithms that work for the better models, and in addition we  propose to quantify to what extent the models are effective."

The many types of stochastic integrals that exist at                the moment have developed on an ad hoc basis, to fit the                        particular needs of the situation.

This project is also concerned with the theory of regularity structures, which is a recent breakthrough allowing to define a wide range of singular stochastic systems previously out of reach.  The regularity structures theory also gives an almost deterministic point of view on stochastic calculus, as opposed to the traditional approach which is very probabilistic in essence. The current project should be seen as a contribution in the areas mentioned above. A combination of rough paths, regularity structures and Malliavin calculus techniques will be used to analyze some physically relevant models such as the continuous parabolic Anderson model in rough environments. Thanks to those fundamental techniques, the PI will also study algebraic and geometric aspects of 2-d signatures with some data analysis applications in mind. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/><br/>This project is concerned with relevant models in theoretical physics and image processing. A significant portion of the proposal is devoted to localization properties of the parabolic Anderson model, and a special emphasis is also put on the signature method for random fields. A more specific list of the projects at stakes is the following: (1) Moments of renormalized parabolic Anderson models. (2) Level sets for non Gaussian processes. (3) Path confinement for the continuous polymer measure. (4) 2-d signatures and failure identification. The PI plans to develop probabilistic, geometric, and analytic methods and ideas that will lead to a deeper understanding of the qualitative and quantitative of the aforementioned systems. The main techniques will combine rough paths, regularity structures and Malliavin calculus techniques, together with fundamental tools in geometry, analysis and statistical learning.

One class of problems addresses the evolution of random surfaces according to the KPZ equation, named after its discoverers, Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang. Random surfaces have attracted a lot of recent attention in probability theory, and there are many unanswered questions. This project will aim to answer some of these questions. A second class of problems involves extending and developing a theory of lower bounds on fluctuations of random variables. Understanding fluctuations of random variables is one of the basic goals of probability theory, but there are many important problems where existing methods do not give desirable results. The PI aims to make some progress in this area by providing a new set of tools. Finally, a third class of problems centers around understanding ultrametric spaces that arise in the study of models from statistical mechanics. The strategy of working on problems in varied areas of probability theory at the same time has the potential of uncovering new connections.<br/><br/>The problems concerning the KPZ evolution are mainly about producing a solution of the equation in 2D. This would be an important breakthrough because the task of constructing any solution for the 2D KPZ equation has remained intractable so far. The results about fluctuation lower bounds would give the optimal conditions under which the current best lower bounds can be proved for planar growth models.  Previously, such lower bounds required restrictive conditions. The proposed method of solution is based on a novel coupling, which may be of independent interest. The research on ultrametricity will shed light on the hierarchical organization of states in spin glass models, especially for models with full replica symmetry breaking. It will also introduce a novel connection between the study of these models and tools from graph theory such as Szemeredi's regularity lemma.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to develop empirically realistic and analytically tractable models describing stochastic dynamics of financial variables and analytical and computational methods to implement these models. The project focuses in the following areas. (i) Develop a rich toolbox of financial models with state-dependent jumps, stochastic volatility, and default. This will be based on the methodology of time changes of Markov processes. The proposed model architecture is to pair Markov processes with analytically tractable semigroups with time changes with analytically tractable Laplace transforms to design analytically tractable processes with desired properties. (ii) Develop efficient pricing tools for derivative securities in these models based on Laplace transform inversion and, for symmetric Markov processes, on the spectral expansion method. (iii) Develop the next generation of unified credit-equity models with jumps, stochastic volatility, and default that provide a unified treatment for all financial obligations related to a given firm, including stock, debt, stock options, and credit derivatives in the framework of time changes of Markov processes with killing. Study options pricing and corporate debt valuation in this unified framework. (iv) Develop a novel class of models with mean-reverting jumps for interest rates, commodities, and energy markets by subjecting mean-reverting diffusions to time changes with jumps. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to develop sophisticated mathematical tools for financial practice. This research is expected to have significant practical impact. According to the Bank for International Settlements (2006), the size of the global derivatives markets is $343 trillion in notional amounts. Major market segments include interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy, and credit derivatives used to manage financial risks. The proposed research is expected to find applications in all of these financial market sectors. Empirically realistic and, at the same time, analytically and computationally tractable models developed in this project will facilitate consistent, fast, and accurate modeling and pricing of financial instruments used to manage market and credit risk. This will help improve efficiency and stability of financial markets. The project is also expected to have a broader mathematical impact on stochastic analysis and applied probability. Analytically tractable time changes of Markov processes developed in this project will provide a useful laboratory for theoretical developments in stochastic analysis, as well as find applications in a variety of areas that employ Markov processes for the modeling of physical, biological, engineering, and economic phenomena. The project will have an impact on education and human resources development. It is part of the long-term development effort at Northwestern University in financial engineering, including the recently established Ph.D. concentration.

Thanks to several independent recent developments in the topics of optimal transport, partial differential equations, geometric and functional analysis, the interplay of convexity and curvature has further enriched the understanding of several topics in probability and analysis.  While convexity has been developed through the important notion of submodularity in discrete settings, curvature remains elusive. In the past five years, the investigator and various collaborators have introduced discrete notions of the so-called Ricci curvature in Markov chains and graphs and derived several interesting consequences. However, much remains to be understood and developed in terms of convexity and curvature in discrete spaces. Identifying suitable applications in mathematics and computer science first will be an important guiding principle in developing any new theory.<br/> <br/>In discrete probability, the Ahlswede-Daykin Four Functions Theorem has had numerous applications (by way of the FKG inequality and other consequences) and similarly the Prekopa-Leindler inequality has been instrumental in deepening the understanding of the geometric and functional inequalities, while expanding the applications of the (equivalent) Brunn-Minkowski inequality to branches of probability, analysis and PDEs.  A main technical objective of this project is to relate these two seminal results, using optimal transport-based couplings, and derive refined versions of each inequality. Other aspects include deriving higher-order Buser inequalities relating the k-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian to the higher-order (multipartite) Cheeger isoperimetric constant, under additional assumptions on volume growth and/or discrete curvature. The project also involves several specific problems for investigation with postdoctoral fellows and students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monge in 1781 and rediscovered and crucially developed and applied to areas in economics by L. Kantorovich, eventually earning him the Nobel prize in 1939.  The renaissance of the classical Monge-Kantorovich mass transport topic in the late 1980's is attributed to independent developments by the French mathematician Y. Brenier (studying fluid dynamics),  U.S. mathematician J. Mather in dynamical  systems, and British meteorologist Mike Cullen.  The mathematics of the optimal transport and its extensions has made a tremendous impact on several fields including calculus of variations, functional analysis, geometry, and probability. In recent years the geometry of optimal transport, particularly its link with the so-called Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry, and connections to functional and isoperimetric inequalities  has been extensively investigated resulting in deep and beautiful connections to the above-mentioned topics. The new book by the recent Fields medalist C. Villani is a testament to this explosive development.  What is currently lacking in our understanding, and is actively being sought by various isolated groups,  is the analogous development of the topic in discrete spaces -- developing appropriate ""discrete calculus"" on graphs and finite Markov chains. The PI and his collaborators (including students and postdocs) have identified several concrete directions to make progress, as well as find new applications, in this important and exciting topic.<br/><br/><br/>In recent collaboration, with various collaborators, the PI has initiated a fruitful line of frontier research in developing discrete aspects of the exciting topic of Optimal Transport & Applications. Besides strengthening and refining classical notions, this work identifies several interesting new directions to pursue -- new notions of (Brunn-Minkowski) convexity in graphs, new concentration inequalities (dimension-free, infimum-convolution and transport-entropy inequalities) refining Talagrand's convex distance concentration (and extensions by Marton and others) on non-product spaces, as well as connections to classical sumset inequalities in additive combinatorics. Much of this is motivated by the attempts to understand appropriate metrics and geodesics in optimal transport (of measures) on discrete spaces. Developing the necessary discrete calculus and relating the recently introduced notions of discrete Ricci curvature, displacement convexity and Wasserstein-type metrics in finite graphs and Markov chains, is a technically as well as conceptually challenging objective of the proposal. Connections to other functional inequalities (such as versions Talagrand, Marton transport inequalities) and their equivalent dual formulations provide an important motivation. A second objective is to explore the full extent of applications of the methods developed and the recent theorems proved. While classical theorems (such as the log-Sobolev inequality for the Gaussian measure, Strassen's martingale existence theorem, Talagrand's theorem on the symmetric group) have already been re-derived in the recent initiative of the PI and his collaborators, the full potential needs to be more thoroughly investigated. Concentration inequalities on the noncrossing partition lattice and consequences are a concrete example of new questions that have arisen from this investigation. Another goal of the PI is to compare and constrast the various independent suggested notions of (RiccI) curvature and displacement convexity in discrete spaces."

A central objective is the analysis of stochastic partial differential equations, such as the heat and wave equations, perturbed by random noises. These equations  provide mathematical models in a wide range of areas, such as growth models for interfaces, turbulence in fluid dynamics and polymer models. The proposed research will focus on the ergodicity and random fluctuations of spatial averages, which are related to observed characteristics in particular physical models.  A second objective of the project is to broaden the range of applications of the stochastic calculus of variations, also called Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin calculus is a mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of variations from functions to stochastic processes. It has proven to be a powerful tool in deriving rates of convergence in central limit theorems, which are of great relevance in statistical inference. Particular emphasis will be put in the analysis of random processes with long memory which are useful to handle data coming from finance, telecommunications and other areas. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>A first working block of the project consists in establishing  quantitative central limit theorems for spatial averages of a wide class of stochastic partial differential equations driven by a Gaussian noise which has homogeneous covariance. Challenging problems are the case of the three dimensional wave equation driven by a noise which is white in time and it has a Riesz covariance in space, and also the case of noises which are rougher that the white noise. Establishing the rate for probability densities using techniques of Malliavin calculus is  a central goal of the project. A second working block deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of functionals of the fractional Brownian motion related to local times. An innovative methodology based on the Clark-Ocone formula will be developed. In a third working block we plan to  address several open problems  in the applications of the stochastic calculus of variation in limit problems including local asymptotic expansions of densities and rates of convergence for Euler approximations in stochastic Volterra equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oftentimes, such a simplification is realized by considering a smaller number of factors that are considered more relevant to the understanding of these systems and by neglecting all those factors that are considered less relevant. However, some factors that may appear less important at a certain time scale, turn out to play a crucial role at some longer time scale. Thus, it is fundamental to understand correctly the interplay among multiple scales of complex systems in order to have more effective models. This project will introduce and develop new methods of asymptotic analysis for stochastic partial differential equations. These are highly complex objects and any effort that goes in the direction of their simplified and more effective analysis is important, both for their deeper understanding and for the wide range of their possible applications. This analysis requires the development of new methods and the substantial introduction of new techniques which have to range over many fields in mathematics, from analysis in infinite-dimensional spaces to stochastic analysis and the theory of partial differential equations. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The main goal of this research project is the study of several asymptotic problems for systems that are described by stochastic partial differential equations having multiple scales. Small stochastic and deterministic perturbations of a system, which have a negligible effect on a given time scale can become crucial on a longer time scale.  Limit theorems in the framework of the theory of large deviation and metastability, various realizations of the averaging principle, small mass limits as in the Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation will be the objects of the research. What characterizes and unifies the present approach to all these asymptotic problems is the effort to understand how they all interplay and interact with each other.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will develop probabilistic, geometric, and analytic tools that will lead to a deeper understanding of a large family of physically- and mathematically-interesting SPDEs and related random fields. The investigators believe that these tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of long-standing open problems in the theory of SPDEs and related random fields, and also further promote their applicability.

The investigators have developed ideas, based on probability theory and geometric measure theory, for the analysis of non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields. They have also introduced renewal-theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of nonlinear SPDEs. They plan to continue their investigation of precise quantitative connections between SPDEs, random fields, potential theory, and the geometry of random fractals.

This project aims to study the basic properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar (conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate students who have an interest in probability theory.

One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied.

The questions raised spill over into other areas, such as classical asymptotic enumeration, algebraic topology, and probability proper. One major theme of the project is the effort to understand the ""threshold"" intensities at which various properties of interest appear in (large) discrete random systems. This is a classical area (going back to the beginnings, roughly 60 years ago, of studies of random graphs on the combinatorial side and percolation on the probabilistic); but it is also an area that has seen major progress in recent years, and one that enjoys close ties with several other disciplines, including statistical physics and the theory of computation. Though the questions under study are purely mathematical, work in this subject area has sometimes had quite unforeseen consequences, both in and beyond mathematics. This research project centers on simple and seemingly basic questions with ""pedigrees,"" that is, substantial histories of resisting solution. Attacking such questions is a way of forcing oneself to go beyond existing methods, which often leads to finding and exploiting new connections with other parts of mathematics and related areas. <br/><br/>Several of the main problems under study are concerned with understanding the extent to which various classical facts and theorems remain true in a random setting; for example: (a) When (i.e., for what p = p(n)) is the ""clique complex"" (whose simplices are the vertex sets of the cliques) of the random graph G(n,p) likely to have vanishing k-dimensional homology (e.g., over the integers or the integers mod 2)? (b) When does a random collection F of k-subets of an n-set X have the (""Erdos-Ko-Rado"") property that a largest subcollection not containing two disjoint sets consists of the members of F containing some fixed element of X? In these and other cases, further progress appears to depend on better understanding underlying issues of independent interest. The proposal also suggests some very general possibilities, for example, one on behavior of independent events as a guide to more complicated situations, and another (due to Kalai and the PI) which would in principle determine (up to an unavoidable logarithmic error factor) the threshold for a completely arbitrary increasing property (of subsets of some finite universe; the ""threshold"" being, roughly speaking, where the property goes from unlikely to likely). Though most of the headline problems are of probabilistic-combinatorial origin, there are substantial connections with other areas --- some combinatorial, others, particularly when it comes to methodology, more distant; for instance: (a) the proof of an old conjecture on presence of certain trees in a random graph eventually depended (very much inter alia) on developing precise estimates for a sampling-without-replacement version of classical renewal theory; (b) the currently most promising line of attack on the general threshold conjecture mentioned above is more Fourier-analytic than combinatorial and originates (though much has happened since) in work of the PI and coauthors nearly thirty years ago on a problem from theoretical computer science."

A key innovation is studying continuous problems, which normally use the difficult-to-work-with equations of fluid mechanics, by discrete approximations which allow tools from combinatorics, group theory, and topology to be used. An exciting new tool, the use of Hopf algebras, is proposed to unify the discrete methods. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are a basic tool of scientific computing used in physics, chemistry, statistics, and many industrial applications. The basic running time questions - How long should an algorithm be run to do its job?  are largely open research problems. The PI proposes attacks on two fronts. The first is spatial mixing of tracer particles in a two-dimensional grid under various stirring protocols: Baker's transformations, twist maps, and periodic figure eight stirring. Using tools from topology to bound stretching of line segments and tools from ergodic theory and  probability to bound the behavior of measures after stretching gives a program for analysis.  The second front uses new tools from algebraic combinatorics - combinatorial Hopf algebras  to  give explicit diagonalization of a host of non-reversible Markov chains. These include fragmentation processes studied by Kolmogorov, the riffle shuffling process, and many others. The first front is heavy on analysis, the second on algebra, but both fronts use analysis and algebra.<br/><br/>The work proposed builds bridges between different areas of mathematics and applications. The use of probabilistic analysis in fluid mixing and the  new discrete methods introduced to study continuous problems should contribute to both  probability and the kinematic study of practical mixing. The Hopf algebra front similarly interfaces probability and combinatorics in new ways. The PI is an internationally visible expert who will continue to give talks to both experts, outside scientists, and lay audiences about these exciting new developments. He currently gives about 50 outside talks per year. The  PI currently has eight graduate students working in these areas, as well as a comparable number of undergraduates doing senior theses. He has reached out to a much broader  audience: the book Magical Mathematics: The Mathematical Ideas That Animate Great Magic Tricks (with Ron Graham, Princeton University Press) has just appeared."

In data sciences, rectangular arrays appear whenever the observations are naturally arranged in two dimensions, for instance, in time and space. In quantum mechanics, matrices and related operators appear in modelling of a physical system. When the amount of available information about such a system is limited, a proper modelling is by taking the matrix to be random.

The project revolves around exactly solvable or integrable families of random matrices, for which the eigenvalues are accessible through explicit formulas, actions of differential operations, orthogonal polynomials, and other essentially algebraic techniques. The goal of this project is three-fold: to search for these families, develop delicate asymptotic results about them (which usually go far beyond theorems available for generic systems), and use them for obtaining asymptotic predictions for much wider classes of random matrices and related objects of applied interest. The central objects gluing together different parts of the project are beta-ensembles, which are N-dimensional distributions uniting and generalizing the laws of eigenvalues of various random matrices. While in classical contexts the parameter beta takes values 1, 2, or 4, depending on whether the matrices under consideration are real, complex, or are quaternion matrices, this project emphasize a point of view  in which beta is allowed to take arbitrary positive real values and should be interpreted as the inverse temperature in the terminology of statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyzing such stake-governed random-turn games is a matter of understanding how a precious resource should be budgeted in the long-term in order to maintain strategic advantage; seeking a solution to how to play the game involves capturing the balance needed between the short-term territorial gain of spending big and the long-term cost in diminished capability that arises from such profligacy. Stake-governed random-turn games lie at the intersection of probability and geometry and are one of several directions that the Principal Investigator (PI) will explore in this project. Indeed, techniques from probability and geometry will be also used to address several important physical problems, including how trapping by obstacles impedes a linearly progressing particle, or how random fractals formed as a result of growth in a disordered random environment are sensitive to perturbation of that environment by random disorder.

Much of the research in probability and statistical physics involves investigating random structures equipped with spatial geometry, expected to model some natural phenomena as above and others. The research program outlined in the project aims to study a wide range of problems around various aspects of such random spatial models including correlation structure, scaling limits, phase transitions as certain natural parameters are varied, convergence to equilibrium as well as behavior in the large deviation regimes. While the main focus is on developing novel ideas in probability theory, a key goal is to merge perspectives and develop new bridges between various areas of mathematics, statistical physics and theoretical computer science. The program also has a significant education component including curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/><br/>The project broadly discusses three topics. The first theme includes models of random growth exhibiting a global smoothing mechanism in presence of local roughening forces believed to exhibit certain universal behavior predicted in a seminal paper by Kardar, Parisi and Zhang (KPZ). The PI will study models of  planar last and first passage percolation, which puts random weights  on the vertices of a planar lattice and considers paths between vertices which accrue maximum or minimum energies respectively, and are believed to be canonical examples in the KPZ universality class.  There has been an explosion of activity, mostly around a handful of examples of such models, which are integrable, admitting certain remarkable bijections to algebraic objects such as random matrices, Young diagrams and so on. The PI will pursue a geometric perspective and develop probabilistic tools to study spatial and temporal correlation behavior for such models as well as how the geometry of optimal paths change in large deviation regimes.  The second theme concerns models of self  organized criticality where systems under their natural evolution converge to a critical state without external tuning of parameters. Continuing previous work, the PI will investigate long standing conjectures about phase transitions on infinite lattices and quantitative estimates for finite versions, for the stochastic sandpile model and activated random walk, two paradigm examples of self-organized criticality. The study of evolving self-similar interfaces of related multi-type Laplacian growth models where growth rate is governed by harmonic measure of random walk is also proposed. The final topic is about the study of exponents related to rate of escape, spectral behavior and convergence to equilibrium for random walks and finite Markov chains. Examples considered include models of particles diffusing under gravity in a random evolving potential with connections to fluid mechanics, random walks on random fractal graphs as well as a class of non-monotone spin systems modeling the 'cage effect' in glassy dynamics, with connections to random walk on matrices and oriented percolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They appear extensively in nature and are prevalent in human-generated data such as financial time series, sound files, and internet traffic patterns. By their very nature fractals are rough, non-differentiable objects that cannot be studied by the classical mathematical methods of calculus. The more modern tools of multifractal analysis, which quantify the degree of roughness that appears on various scales, can be used instead. It is particularly interesting to apply multifractal analysis to randomly generated objects, which by default tend to exhibit fractal behavior. Random measures, which for example describe the rainfall distribution over a particular state or the distribution of energy in turbulent fluid flows, are a particularly fruitful area for employing multifractal analysis. The results of such an analysis can often be used for prediction and forecasting of the underlying random system. This research project aims to further develop the mathematical foundations for analysis of multifractal properties.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to analyze the multifractal properties of a broad class of random measures that appear in models of statistical mechanics. The focus will be on random pinning models, random polymer models, random measures arising in two-dimensional conformally invariant systems, and spectral measures of random matrices. In all cases, the major quantity of interest will be the multifractal spectrum, which quantifies the amount of mass the random measure assigns around various points in the space. Computation of the multifractal spectrum is closely related to the theory of large deviations for computing the decay of probabilities of rare events. Many of the tools from that theory will be employed in this project, including the notion of Gibbs condition for describing the most likely behavior of the random system when a rare event occurs. As all the random measures listed above can be described using tools from stochastic analysis, specifically the Wiener chaos decomposition, a particular goal of this project will be to incorporate tools from stochastic analysis into this theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving these problems helps to gain knowledge about the nature and structure of complex systems, and to better design and control these systems by making efficient use of scarce resources.  There are numerous parameters in the formulation of each such problem.  In many cases the exact values of some parameters are not available due to the lack of complete information, especially when such parameters describe future events.  An effective way to manage the long-term behaviors of complex systems under such data uncertainty is to introduce probability distributions on the parameters and use expectation functions in the problem formulations.  To numerically solve those problems with expectation functions, certain types of approximations are commonly used.  The investigators study properties of optimization and equilibrium problems defined with expectation functions, relations between these problems and their approximations, and methods to solve them.  Of particular interest is application of these ideas to study the electricity market competition between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.  Results from this project can be used to evaluate the well-posedness of a given problem, measure the reliability of a solution obtained from a numerical procedure, and solve certain types of these problems.<br/><br/>The investigators analyze the structure and properties of optimization and equilibrium problems defined by expectation functions, develop inference procedures and sampling-based optimization methods, and study an application to the electricity market.  Their first goal is to develop an efficient inference method for the solution to the true optimization or equilibrium problem based on a solution to its sample average approximation (SAA) problem.  They expect this method to work for a general framework that allows the SAA functions to be nonsmooth, the SAA solution to be inexact, and the SAA asymptotic distribution to follow a piecewise normal structure as in the cases of general constrained optimization problems.  They apply this method to predict the out-of-sample performance of the SAA solutions.  Their second goal is to revisit existing importance sampling techniques to efficiently incorporate them into an iterative optimization algorithm for minimizing the probability of a rare event under some design parameters, and study properties of the probability function and compare solutions of the original problem with those of its convex substitutes.  The third goal of the investigators is to study a stochastic equilibrium model of the competition behavior between different types of energy generators in the electricity market and to provide a novel generalization of the classical Nash-Cournot equilibrium when the payoff functions are not concave.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This type of                control naturally appears in problems in which there is no                      natural restriction on the rates of control and the optimal                     control rate id infinite.

Such type of                    action arises in problems with additive control, where there are                no a priori limits on the control rates. It is intended to                      develop of the related partial differential equations with                      gradient constraints, to study optimal reflection barriers in                   multi-dimensional cases and to investigate other problems                       pertinent to singular control in queuing, inventory and flexible                manufacturing models.

The solution to this problem                 suggests the optimal timing of the correction of the course of                  the airplane of the space vehicle. Singular control also appears                in queuing/production/manufacturing models.

While one can try to directly model such systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.<br/><br/>Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems, observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model, Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur / Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently, these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately. The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena."

In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract.

In every instance, the issue of model error is important.  In general, it is not possible for practical reasons (such as limited amounts of data, or the need to maintain computational feasibility) to work with a perfectly accurate model.  Hence it is important to identify those aspects of the model that are uncertain, quantify their impact on predictions, and perhaps even account for this uncertainty while using the model, for example as an engineering tool.  The models of interest in this project are probabilistic.  In this setting we acknowledge that the system is random, and the model error is due to an imperfect understanding of the parameters that describe the probability distribution.  To assess how mathematical predictions based on the model change as the model itself changes, one needs metrics to compare the outcome based on different distributions (e.g., the distribution that is used for ""design,"" and an ideal but not available ""true"" distribution).  The topic of this research is the development of the theory and application of such metrics.  In contrast to prior work, here we focus on situations where the quantities of interest are tied to rare events, such as a catastrophic system failure.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the use of divergences and metrics on probability measures to study model uncertainty, and optimization and control in the presence of model uncertainty.  The probability measures are typically on high-dimensional or complicated spaces, and typically on a path space to model stochastic dynamics.  An important aspect of the work is to establish useful qualitative properties, such as scaling limits and chain rule-type formulas.  In contrast to prior work, the focus here is on situations where (a) one wishes to consider differing models that are not absolutely continuous, and (b) performance measures and quantities of interest are largely determined by rare events and tail properties.  The main mathematical tools used are convex duality or variational formulas that relate the divergences to exponential integrals.  To implement the theory, one needs to evaluate such exponential integrals, which for example may take the form of a moment-generating function with respect to the stationary distribution of some Markov process.

These developments hugely expand our knowledge on the randomness of basic objects such as curves, functions, trees, and surfaces.

The investigator plans to prove a conjecture asserting that LQG is the scaling limit of random planar maps in a strong sense. As a tool for proving this conjecture, the project considers a statistical mechanical model called the critical percolation and aims to establish that the scaling limit of the critical percolation on the uniform random triangulation and on a regular triangular lattice are the same. The ingredients in both investigations include: (a) combinatorial bijections for planar maps that encode their geometric information; (b) a relation between fractals in quantum and Euclidean geometry called the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov relation; (c) the Fourier analysis of Boolean functions.

Nussbaum, Department of Mathematics, Cornell<br/>University, Ithaca, NY<br/><br/><br/>The concept of asymptotic equivalence of experiments serves to compare<br/>properties of statistical models. An experiment is a family of probability<br/>measures; a distance is defined between these objects such that the<br/>informational content of experiments with respect to the parameter is<br/>similar if this distance is small. This basic deficiency pseudodistance <br/>(or Delta-distance) has been introduced by L. Le Cam, generalizing the<br/>concept of sufficiency. If experiments are equivalent via sufficiency<br/>then their Delta-distance is 0; here equivalence via sufficiency<br/>means that one experiment results from application of a sufficient statistic<br/>to the data of the other.<br/><br/>Based on the idea of the Delta-distance, a theory of local<br/>asymptotic normality (LAN-theory) of experiments has been developed which<br/>has found widespread application in statistics. The idea of data reduction<br/>which is at the heart of the sufficiency concept could thus be combined with<br/>limit theorems of probability, resulting in approximation of general<br/>statistical models by Gaussian shift families. These Gaussian shift or<br/>translation families allow explicit expression for risk bounds in many<br/>instances, and these risk bound then become valid in an asymptotic sense in<br/>the approximated models.<br/><br/>The limitation of the LAN-theory consists in its restriction to a<br/>local setting, in which the rate of localization is tied to the<br/>normalization rate in the central limit theorem (the classical root-n in<br/>most cases). This setting precludes application of the resulting risk bounds<br/>to the class of ill-posed function estimation problems. The emphasis of the<br/>current project is on the treatment of this problem class (which includes<br/>nonparametric density estimation) by methods involving the Delta-distance.<br/><br/>The restriction to a local setting (or alternatively, a finite dimensional<br/>setting) which is inherent in the LAN-theory has been overcome in recent<br/>years, by efforts of Brown and Low (1996) and by various<br/>results of the P.I. and collaborators, starting also in 1996 <br/>(asymptotic equivalence of density estimation and Gaussian white noise). <br/>The main tool has been approximation of general likelihood processes by Gaussian<br/>ones, using coupling methodology. The present project focuses on elaboration<br/>and extension of these results, with two main directions:<br/><br/>(i) constructive realization of equivalence in nonparametric models,<br/>enabling explicit equivalence mappings (direct transfer of decision<br/>functions)<br/><br/>(ii) equivalences in nonparametric models for dependent data (time series<br/>and diffusion process models).<br/><br/>"

These results help to describe the asymptotic behavior of wave fronts and  other patterns in reaction-diffusion equations.   Mathematical models of real processes sometimes,turn out to be too complicated for analysis. But very often some of the parameters included in the model are small (or large) in comparison with the others.

The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of solutions to the parabolic Anderson problem, the solutions to the equation of the evolution of a magnetic field in a random flow, and a variety of probabilistic aspects of transport phenomena. For the Anderson problem the study focuses on the equations with random time-dependent potential. In the scalar case this problem can be looked upon as a scalar model for the equation of the evolution of the magnetic field in a random flow. In the vector case the Anderson model is related to passive transport by random flows, which is also a subject of the current project. The study of transport phenomena is concerned with the long-time behavior of ensembles of points as well as connected sets under the action of a large class of physically relevant flows. <br/> Most of the proposed problems arise naturally in the study of various physical phenomena in meteorology, oceanography, and the theory of turbulence. In particular, when studying passive transport, one assumes that certain properties of the media are known (for example, while the temperatures or velocities on the surface of the ocean can not be measured in every single point exactly, certain statistical information is assumed to be available). The problem then consists of trying to predict the long-time behavior of a passive scalar (such as an oil spill carried by the currents on the surface of the ocean) based on the statistical properties of the underlying media. Several such problems can be formulated in relatively simple terms, yet the solutions are very non-trivial, and at times surprising. <br/>"

The long-time evolution of perturbed systems with conservation laws, even in the case of purely deterministic perturbations, leads, in general, to stochastic process on complexes defined by the conservation laws.  So the classical averaging principle (say, for deterministic perturbations of integrable Hamiltonian systems when the Hamiltonian has many critical points) should be treated in the stochastic framework.  In this research small diffusion asymptotics for reaction-diffusion in an incompressible 2D-fluid, which is closely related to the averaging for Hamiltonian systems, is studied.

For example, quantification of risk of extreme outcomes is of central concern in many problems in finance, economics, environmental science, geophysics, and engineering. The mathematical framework for studying such problems is given by the theory of large deviations which is concerned with the characterization of decay rate of probabilities of deviations of a system with uncertainties from its nominal expected behavior. In the last twenty years a new approach to the study of large deviations problems, that brings to bear techniques from the theory of stochastic control, has become prominent. The goal of this research is to develop a systematic framework based on stochastic control ideas for an important and challenging class of large deviation problems that arise in the study of interacting particle systems. Interacting particle systems considered here are motivated by phenomena in Natural Sciences. Some examples include models for chemotaxis of biological particles, reaction-diffusion systems arising from ecological models, and crystal growth models from chemistry. In addition to developing the mathematical machinery for providing asymptotic bounds on decay rate of rare event probabilities, this work will develop accelerated Monte-Carlo methods for estimating probabilities of interest using methods of importance sampling that are inspired by a large deviation analysis of the underlying systems.<br/><br/><br/>This project will study four different families of particle systems: (A) Weakly interacting diffusions with a small common noise; (B) Microscopic particle models for Patlak-Keller-Segel equations; (C) Brownian particle systems for reaction-diffusion equations; (D) Locally interacting jump-diffusions. Under topic (A), the focus will be on large deviation asymptotics as the number of particles becomes large and the intensity of the common noise becomes small. The goal is to characterize different forms of large deviation behavior as the two parameters approach limits at different relative rates. Patlak-Keller-Segal equations in topic (B) are nonlinear non-local PDE that model active chemotaxis of biological particles. Interacting diffusive particle systems that are fully coupled with the evolution of the underlying chemical field have been used to give a mesoscopic description of the phenomenon. Goal of the proposed research here is to study large deviation problems aimed at understanding the long time behavior of such particle systems. In particular, this work will study invariant measure asymptotics and metastability behavior near a rest point. Under topic (C), large deviations behavior of particle systems of reaction-diffusion type will be studied. Of particular interest are annihilating Brownian particles approximating reaction diffusion equations with a polynomial reaction term in which the interaction becomes singular in the limit. Finally topic (D) is concerned with locally interacting particle systems on discrete lattices with a suitable temporal and spatial scaling. Such systems arise, for example, as crystal growth models in chemistry. The goal is to develop stochastic control methods for studying large deviation properties of such systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition we will study of the behavior of evolutionary games, which were introduced many years ago to help understand animal behavior and have recently been used to understand the interactions of different cell types in cancer modeling. Despite the fact that it has been clearly established that spatial structure changes the outcome of evolutionary games, most applications assume homogeneous mixing and use the replicator equation to determine the dynamics. Having a well developed theory that predicts the behavior of spatial games will be useful for applications. Much of this theory has been developed under the assumption of weak selection, so it is important to understand whether the results are valid when selection is not weak.<br/><br/>Work will be carried out on evolutionary games, variants of the voter model, coalescing random walk, and epidemics. These processes will in most cases take place on static random graphs generated by the configuration model in which vertices are assigned i.i.d. degrees, but in one situation we will let the states of an SIS epidemic and the graph co-evolve. The degree heterogeneity of random graphs forces the development of new techniques in order to extend results known on the d-dimensional lattice.

The goal of this work is to understand the statistics of these transitions, especially in the small-noise regime: what are the typical pathways by which the transitions occur? what is the typical time required for a transition?  These issues are very relevant to problems in chemistry and molecular dynamics, as well as many other physical systems exhibiting metastable behavior. The second type of stochastic dynamics which the PI will study has to do with stochastic interacting particle systems.  Specific systems to be studied involve random motion, growth, and selection, as in models of evolution, population genetics, adaptive dynamics. The PI will study continuum limits and large-time limits for such systems. In particular, this will illuminate new relations between interacting particle systems and continuum free boundary problems.<br/><br/><br/>When viewed at a certain scale, many physical and biological systems seem to behave randomly or are influenced by small random fluctuations. Mathematical models of such systems involve probability theory.  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to use these mathematical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over a long period of time or over a large spatial region.  Therefore, a fundamental scientific and mathematical problem is to understand how random dynamics or interactions at one spatial or temporal scale influence a system at another spatial or temporal scale. This research project develops mathematical tools for predicting and describing the macroscopic behavior of certain systems which behave randomly at a microscopic level.  The specific systems to be studied are motivated by problems in chemistry and by models of biological evolution. One common feature in these systems is the appearance of random, perhaps rare, transitions: a chemical reaction occurs or a cell produces a mutation.

It underlies models of air turbulence, chemical dynamics, and algorithms for big data. Such models are often high dimensional or even infinite dimensional, as in the case of turbulence. Central to understanding these systems is understanding the way both energy and randomness are spread by nonlinear interactions in the dynamics. This research project explores a number of directions that exploit both the geometric and algebraic structures of such systems to better understand these basic transport phenomena. The investigators will work to understand how such interactions can lead to stabilization in systems that are unstable in the absence of randomness. The project includes research participation by graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students.  At the high school level, the investigators will also work to keep the students' teachers connected with cutting-edge mathematics, helping them to be more effective and better informed as teachers. In addition, videos chronicling the student research efforts will be made in collaboration with a center for documentary films to further disseminate the experience and broaden the project's impact. <br/><br/>This collaborative research project in stochastic analysis and dynamics will explore the propagation of noise and dissipation in stochastic systems and their effects on the existence and structure of stationary states. There is particular emphasis on effects that occur in stochastic partial differential equations, the ability of noise to stabilize unstable systems, and non-equilibrium steady-states in forced systems. Many of the equations to be investigated are physical models (e.g. from fluid mechanics or non-equilibrium statistical physics) while other equations to be studied serve as examples that aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms producing stability or instability in such systems. This work will build on the investigators' previous work in designing Lyapunov functions in the finite-dimensional setting of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) and establishing practical methods for proving unique ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium in both the finite-dimensional setting of SODEs as well as the infinite-dimensional setting of SPDEs. While the research is anticipated to have immediate implications in fluid mechanics and statistical physics, the techniques that will result from studying such systems will be applicable to a wide family of problems in other areas, such as biology, engineering, physics, and finance, which regularly employ stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations as modeling tools."

Devising, analyzing, and benchmarking such algorithms often rely heavily on random matrix and random graph theory, as studies have shown that large network characteristics can often be replicated (and more easily studied) via random graph models. Thus, good theoretical results on the spectra of large random graphs are needed to understand the typical behavior, as well as the limitations of community detection algorithms.<br/><br/>The PI will work on a variety of problems, ranging from the theoretical (spectral of random graphs) to the applied (proposing and analyzing community detection algorithms).

Ergodic theory studies abstractly what kinds of randomness are possible in such a process, where two processes are regarded as equivalent if either can be obtained by a suitable encoding of the other.  However, many random phenomena of great importance in modern coding theory, statistics, and data science do not arise in the linear fashion that is dictated by the arrow of time in a stationary process.  Rather, they are structured according to a large underlying network, which may itself be highly disordered.  The current project seeks to adapt methods of ergodic theory to this new setting or understand why they fail and then develop replacements.  For models of randomness governed by underlying disordered networks, some of the main issues to be investigated include: (i) whether the broad statistical features scale in a simple way with the size of the network; (ii) whether the random behavior that is visible at a particular node of the network can be estimated easily from the parameters of the model; (iii) how one can determine effectively whether a given model of network randomness can be re-encoded in some simpler form, such as pure independent noise at each node.  All of these issues arise in the theoretical underpinnings of modern research in computer and data science and could serve as a guide towards new discoveries in those fields.  The pursuit of these questions requires background knowledge from diverse parts of probability and pure mathematics, and so the current project includes plans to develop educational materials and train graduate students in a novel but valuable mix of those disciplines.<br/><br/>The project has two more specific aims. The first is the further development of the methods in the principal investigator's recent proof of the weak Pinsker theorem in ergodic theory. This theorem asserts that any stationary ergodic process may be re-encoded, in the sense of measure-theoretic isomorphism, into a nearly deterministic component and a purely random component.  The methods from the proof apply to the joint distribution of a stationary sequence of random variables, deriving a structural description from some basic information-theoretic parameters of a joint distribution.  Such implications are still in their infancy, and the proposed project would explore a range of related parameters and their consequences. The second aim concerns the broad and important class of joint distributions in combinatorics and statistical physics that are constructed over locally tree-like graphs. These models provide examples of measure-preserving actions of free groups, and conversely methods from free-group ergodic theory help to describe their asymptotic behavior. The physics literature predicts novel and consequential phenomena such as shattering and condensation, but only a few special cases have been established rigorously. The project will explore these phenomena using notions and methods from ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the great triumphs of 20th Century science was the development of many robust tools for understanding and analyzing random noise in many kinds of systems.  One such set of tools is stochastic analysis, which presents a rigorous mathematical treatment of ideas that first appeared in physics, adding random noise to the equations of state that describe our world.  These so-called stochastic differential equations have playing a fundamental role in advancing our knowledge in many area: economics, systems engineering, biological dynamics, and within mathematics, with applications to fields like differential geometry and quantum information theory.<br/><br/>This project addresses questions relating stochastic differential equations, heat kernel analysis, and random matrix theory. The central theme is understanding how differential equations with some randomness affect the evolution of eigenvalues of random matrices. These ideas connect with geometry, since the flow of heat on Lie groups (groups of continuous symmetries of geometric objects) can be characterized by such matrix stochastic differential equations.  Herein, ten research projects are proposed which yield connections between these topics and applications to others.  Generally, these problems can be described as studying the large-dimension asymptotic behavior of geometrically-motivated matrix-valued stochastic differential equations.

Two levels of approximation are considered: first order approximations called fluid models, and second order approximations which frequently are diffusion models. An important subtheme is understanding the interplay between levels of approximation. Five topics are proposed for study: diffusion approximations for (bio)chemical reaction networks, analysis of processor sharing networks, congestion control and resource entrainment in data networks, networks with random order of service and reneging, and dynamic control of stochastic processing networks. Some stochastic process aspects of these topics include rates of convergence in the approximation of density dependent Markov chains by reflected diffusion processes, analysis of measure-valued processes used to track residual job sizes or ages of jobs in stochastic network models with resource sharing, singular diffusion control problems, foundational questions for reflected processes, and numerical approximation of reflected diffusion processes in non-smooth domains. This award will support the training of early career researchers and underrepresented minorities through direct support of a female graduate student, and through collaboration of the PI with one early career researcher and one female researcher who is at a non-PhD granting institution."

Probability theory has contributed substantially to the field of population genetics because many of the factors that are responsible for the evolution of populations are best modeled as random events.  The aim of this project is to make further contributions in this area by undertaking a detailed mathematical study of some natural models of randomly evolving populations.<br/><br/>The first part of the project focuses on branching Brownian motion with absorption.  Particles move according to Brownian motion with drift, divide into two at a constant rate, and are absorbed upon hitting the origin.  This process can be viewed as modeling a population undergoing selection.  The particle positions represent fitnesses of individuals, the branching events represent births, and absorption at the origin models the death of unfit individuals.  The goal will be to provide sharp estimates for the probability that the process survives for a long time and for the position of the right-most particle.  The second part of the project involves studying a model of a population of fixed size in which individuals acquire beneficial mutations.  The goal will be to prove results concerning the speed of evolution, the distribution of the fitnesses of individuals in the population, and the genealogy of the population.  The third part of the project involves further study of the beta coalescent, a process which can be used to describe the genealogy of populations with large family sizes."

Special cases have been proved directly, and by numerical calculations. Another conjecture concerns integral inequalities which extend the well-known van Den Berg-Kesten Conjecture (rumored to have been proved recently) and suggest interesting new applications. Special cases of the new aonjecture have already been established using FKG type and rearrangement inequalities; numerical calculations seem to support these extensions. d) Limit theorems for dependent random variables, with the goal of obtaining convergence rates in terms of meaningful characteristics  of the dependence structures, using Stein's method and classical approaches.    The assumption of statistical independence of sampled measurements is basic to much of classical data analysis. It is relevant when one can assume that the data arises from repeated controlled experiments in which there is no carryover of errors between repetitions. However,  situations with more complex data are ubiquitous. The proposed research centers on the study of certain aspects of samples  which consist of observations (random variables) which are not independent,  and various models for dependence structures. Such structures are also  relevant in various models in physics, and certain issues arising in   percolation theory, for example, are also studied. Another aspect of this  research is relevant to statistical large sample theory. A good portion of  statistical theory is based  on approximations which are valid only for  large samples. Methods for such approximations for dependent data are  investigated, in order to determine the validity of the theory in complex situation. The quality of the approximations is important in deciding how  large samples must be in order for large sample approximations to be valid."

The network models being considered are heterogeneous, may have complex feedback mechanisms, and allow for stochastic variability in arrivals, service times and routing. Buffers in the network enable jobs to be stored that cannot be served immediately. In addition, the models with control allow for dynamic sequencing and alternate routing of jobs. Since the complexity of these network models usually precludes exact analysis, the focus is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation are being considered, namely fluid models (first order approximations) and diffusion models (second order approximations). Investigating the interplay between these models is an important feature of the research. The two main topics are (i) dynamic control through sequencing and alternate routing, and (ii) performance analysis for processor sharing networks. With regard to topic (i), some authors have successfully used diffusion control problems as formal tools for generating good control policies for some specific network models. However, there are few rigorous analyses of the performance of such policies. The PI is developing a systematic approach to finding and interpreting solutions of diffusion control problems and to analyzing the performance of the policies generated in this manner. Regarding topic (ii), the processor sharing discipline is an example of a service discipline for which a natural state descriptor involves a measure-valued process (to keep track of the residual service times of all jobs in the network). The PI is studying fluid and diffusion approximations of processor sharing networks with the aims of understanding the dynamics of such networks, obtaining measures of performance, and developing general tools for studying measure-valued processes associated with network models. <br/> Stochastic networks are used as models for complex manufacturing, telecommunications and computer systems. A challenging problem for such networks is to design controls that are simple to implement and yet are near optimal in an appropriate sense. Motivated by such problems, a number of mathematical questions associated with controlling and analyzing the performance of stochastic networks are being studied under this grant.

Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering.

One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When one individual in a population acquires a beneficial mutation, that mutation may eventually spread to a large fraction of the population, or even the entire population. Modeling this phenomenon mathematically becomes particularly challenging when there can be many different beneficial mutations in the population at a time. This research project studies mathematical models of evolving populations that repeatedly acquire beneficial mutations.  Because, in these models, populations are assumed to evolve in a random way, the theory of probability plays a central role in the analysis. The research aims to provide mathematical insight into important biological problems. Questions of interest include determining the rate at which the fitness of the population increases as a result of beneficial mutations, understanding the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the population at a given time, and understanding how to describe the genealogy of a sample from the population. <br/><br/>To model populations undergoing selection, the investigator will consider a stochastic process called branching Brownian motion. Each particle dies at a given rate, each particle moves independently according to one-dimensional Brownian motion, and particles occasionally split into two.  Here particles represent individuals in a population, and the position of the particle along the real line corresponds to the individual's fitness.  It will be assumed that the branching rate depends on the position of the particle, so that individuals with higher fitness have more offspring.  It is conjectured that in the long-run, the empirical distribution of the positions of the particles is approximately Gaussian. A proof of this result would provide a mathematically rigorous formulation of the idea, well-established in the biology literature, that for certain populations undergoing selection, the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the population evolves like a Gaussian traveling wave.  Because branching Brownian motion can be used to model populations experiencing either beneficial or deleterious mutations, this work could also shed light on a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet, which refers to the decrease in the fitness of a population resulting from the accumulation of deleterious mutations. The investigator will also consider some population models that incorporate the effects of recombination, as well as a nested coalescent model that describes the genealogy of a collection of individuals sampled from multiple species."

Mathematicians call those tables matrices, and try to find hidden structure within them.  One such hidden signature is a list of numbers called eigenvalues that describes some of the properties of the larger matrix of numbers.  Eigenvalues not only summarize the information in a large array; they can reveal information that was hidden from plain view, through ubiquitous tools like principal component analysis that statisticians have used to great effect for decades.  The main purpose of this proposal is to explore promising new computational tools to understand the behavior of eigenvalues of very large matrices lacking any overall symmetry.  The PI and his team have discovered new and surprising connections between several different mathematical fields of study that can be used to compute the large-scale behavior of the eigenvalues of such symmetry-free matrices, opening the door to solve problems that have remained inaccessible for decades.  As a new methodology, there is much to explore including low-hanging fruit that is perfectly suited to research by Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers.

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more. Educational impacts include providing summer research experiences for undergraduates and developing teaching/computational resources for interdisciplinary topics in statistics, probability, and mathematical finance.

These are grouped under three headings. (i) Approximation   of multiclass queueing networks in heavy traffic. Most queueing network models cannot   be analyzed exactly and must be approximated by more tractable models. A certain class   of diffusion processes, known as reflecting Brownian motions, have been shown to   approximate heavily loaded single class and some multiclass queueing networks. However,   currently there is no general limit theorem to justify such approximations for heavily   loaded multiclass queueing networks with feedback. Although it is known that such   approximations do not hold in complete generality, the PI seeks to identify broad classes   of multiclass networks for which they do hold and to provide limit theorems to support   such approximations. (ii) Long run behavior of reflecting Brownian motions. For the   purpose of obtaining approximate measures of performance for queueing network models   and as a problem of intrinsic mathematical interest, it is natural to consider the long run   behavior of reflecting Brownian motions. In particular, conditions for positive recurrence   of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions are being sought by study of a related   deterministic dynamical system. (iii) Stochastic differential equations with   discontinuous/degenerate coefficients and applications to nonlinear time series. The need   for nonlinear models in time series analysis has become increasingly apparent in recent   years. Continuous time models can greatly facilitate the analysis of irregularly spaced data.   A useful class of nonlinear continuous time models are the continuous time threshold   autoregressive models. These are defined by stochastic differential equations with a   discontinuous and degenerate diffusion coefficient. A compelling problem for future use of   these models is to resolve the problem of uniqueness for solutio ns of these equations when   the order of the model is larger than two. This problem, as well as multivariate versions of   it, are being studied.  Multidimensional diffusions processes are used as stochastic models in a wide   variety of applications in the physical, biological, engineering and social sciences.   Motivated by such applications, a number of mathematical problems for diffusions are   being studied. As an illustrative example, queueing networks are of current relevance for   analyzing congestion and delay in computer systems, communication networks and   complex manufacturing systems. These networks may process more than one class of   customer or job (e.g., voice, video and data may pass through each node in a   communication network), have complex feedback structures (e.g., as in reentrant lines for   semiconductor wafer fabrication) and are frequently heavily loaded. In general such   models cannot be analyzed exactly and one is naturally led to seek tractable   approximations, such as multidimensional diffusions. A challenging mathematical question   here is when is such an approximation valid? Results of recent years have revealed this to   be a complex issue for multiclass networks with feedback. This question and others for   multidimensional diffusions are being pursued under this grant."

The investigator has                      recently obtained generalized arcsine laws for occupation times                 of one dimensional Levy processes in joint work with M.J.Sharpe.                He will attempt to find higher dimensional analogues of these                   results.  The second class of problems deals with the potential                 theory of a general Markov process. In a recent monograph the                   principal investigator has shown that for many purposes excessive               measures are more fundamental than excessive functions. He plans                to continue his investigation of the potential theory of                        excessive measures. In particular the connection with capicitary                measures and excursion theory.                                                       This research is in the area of Markov processes. A Markov                 process is a mathematical model of how certain random phenomena                 evolve in time. Examples are the diffusion of a gas or liquid, or               the motion of a collidal particle in a liquid subject to                        molecular bombardment. This last example is called Brownian                     motion. Surprisingly the mathematical model for Brownian motion                 also turns out to be of fundamental importance in potential                     theory which encompasses electrostatic potentials and equilibrium               temperature distributions in solids among other things."

In many such processes, the key to understanding this macroscopic order is a careful analysis of the random motions of individual particles (or bits of information) in the network. In turn, understanding the random motions of particles in inhomogeneous networks often requires analysis of the corresponding motions in homogeneous networks. A major goal of this research is to construct a comprehensive picture of how random walkers behave in infinite homogeneous networks with tree-like, or ""hyperbolic'' geometry. A secondary goal is to determine the behavior of a number of specific models of epidemic and information-propagation models in such networks.

Mathematical questions to be addressed include rigorous justification of these approximations, analyzing and controlling the behavior of the approximate models and interpreting the results for the original microscopic models. <br/>Four topics are proposed for study:<br/>(i) Dynamic control of stochastic processing networks,<br/>(ii) Analysis of processor sharing networks,<br/>(iii) Congestion control and resource entrainment in data networks,<br/>(iv) Stochastic systems with delayed dynamics and state constraints.<br/>Some stochastic process aspects of these topics include study of singular diffusion control problems, analysis of measure-valued processes, foundational questions for reflected processes, and the asymptotic properties of functional stochastic differential equations with natural state constraints.<br/><br/>Dynamic stochastic networks are used as mathematical models in a wide variety of applications in science and engineering, particularly in operations management, computer science, electrical engineering and bioengineering. This grant funds research to develop new results and techniques for addressing mathematical problems stemming from the need to analyze and control such dynamic stochastic networks. The networks under study are substantially more general than those that have been rigorously studied to date. The results will be of fundamental mathematical interest as well as of interest for applied researchers in relevant areas of science and engineering. The training of mathematics PhD students, dissemination of results through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations of the research at cross-disciplinary conferences, are all integral parts of the project."

The second problem is to study the quasi-invariance and smoothness properties of heat kernel measures on infinite dimensional Lie groups. The P.I. hopes to find examples of infinite dimensional subelliptic operators which are hypoelliptic. The proof of these results will rely on the results of the first problem. The third problem relates to the understanding of Euclidean Feynman path integrals by finite dimensional approximations.

The P.I. will investigate a number of problems related to Feynman's model in the context of elementary particle physics. Despite being studied for 70 plus years, the mathematical foundations of these types of theories are still not well understood and many interesting questions remain open. For example, physicists believe that ""quarks"" should be confined. However, with the current state of the models, the theoretical derivation of quark confinement is out of reach.

The proposed research is related to several areas of probability theory:  the theory of Dirichlet forms and Markov processes, weak convergence theory, stochastic calculus and martingale theory. The investigator is mainly interested in the following problems:    1) Time-dependent Dirichlet form and moving boundary problems;    2) The analysis of the Markov chain models which give approximating solutions for the above problems;     3) The estimate of the rate of weak convergence when a sequence of Markov chains approach a diffusion process. The investigator expects that this proposed study will introduce more applications of the existing results of diffusion process theory thereby enriching the whole theory.      The main purpose of this investigation is to study problems related to the temperature evolution of an object composed of several different materials. Two examples are the melting-freezing process of ice hills on the oceans and temperature control inside a nuclear reactor. For those problems, the real computations are very complicated and sometimes applied scientists do not even know if their computational result is precise enough to the applicable to the real world.  The investigator will use a special mathematical model known as ""diffusion processes"" to simulate the real temperature evolution on those objects. Moreover, the investigator  will study how to realize this process on a computer and how accurate the computer simulation result will be."

The following issues are to be addressed. 1. The existence of differential type inequalities related to hypoelliptic heat equations in finite dimensions, including the existence of logarithmic Sobolev and Poincare (or mass gap) type inequalities. 2. The existence of differential inequalities related to heat kernel measure and Wiener measures on path and loop spaces of Riemannian manifolds 3. The relationship between heat kernel measures and pinned Wiener measures on Loop spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds. 4. Extensions of Fock space like representations from finite dimensional groups to infinite dimensional loop groups. 5. The generalization of certain finite dimensional approximations to Wiener measures to include the ""super symmetric quantum mechanics"" setting used by physicists. <br/> Most of the questions to be studied in this research are motivated by, or are outgrowths of, questions coming from studying a number of fields, namely the spread of heat in curved metal plates, quantum mechanics, quantum field theories, and certain aspects of probability theory. These seemingly disparate fields turn out to share a common mathematical description, namely ""parabolic partial differential equations"" or equivalently the probabilistic theory of ""Brownian motion."" In most interesting (physically relevant) cases it is seldom possible to find explicit solutions to the complicated partial differential equations to be studied by the P.I. Nevertheless, it is often possible to discover interesting and relevant properties of the solutions. A typical phenomenon of parabolic partial differential equations is the fact that their solutions tend towards steady state values after waiting a sufficiently long time. For example, if a metal plate is heated in a non-uniform way and then left alone, the heat in the plate will redistribute itself over time so that the temperature reaches a constant equilibrium value throughout the plate. A fundamental problem, related to ""Poincare"" and ""logarithmic Sobolev"" inequalities, is the questions of how quickly do the systems described by the parabolic partial differential equations to be studied in this research converge to their equilibrium value. This same rate of convergence question has another interpretation in the context of quantum field theories describing relativistic (i.e. moving near the speed of light) elementary particles. For these theories the existence of a Poincare inequality has the desirable interpretation that the mathematical theory does not predict an unreasonable plethora of elementary particles. The particle interpretation of parabolic and related quantum mechanical Shrodinger equations will be another point of study. The particle interpretation goes under the title of Fock space representations which were mentioned in the first paragraph. <br/>"

The problems in flows involve rates of dispersion of a set of passive tracers carried by the flow. Of special interest here are the set of ballistic points, those which travel at a linear rate that greatly exceeds the diffusive rate. The PI will examine the Hausdorff dimension of this set of points and the structure of the image of the set of points which have traveled at a superdiffusive rate. Another problem is the study of the length of a curve moving under the flow. The PI will attempt to show, under the assumption that the top Lyapunov exponent is positive, that the length grows exponentially at a rate greater than the top Lyapunov exponent. The PI also proposes to study solutions of the parabolic Anderson equation in both the scalar and vector case. The problems in the vector case involve establishing exponential growth rates for magnetic fields generated by turbulent velocity fields. In the scalar case, the problems involve gaining more insight into the properties of solutions. <br/> The proposed problems on stochastic flows are motivated by the motion of pollutants on the ocean surface or in ground water. A stochastic flow is a convenient model for the motion of particles under the effect of ocean currents. The proposed work on the parabolic Anderson model arises from a problem in astrophysics called the dynamo problem. The solution of a vector version of the parabolic Anderson equation models the magnetic field in a young star. The basic open question in astrophysics which will be approached by the PI is whether the magnetic field grows exponentially fast and to determine the exponential growth rate. <br/>"

These include 1)   applications of martingale inequalities to investigate the  operator  norm of the Beurling-  Ahlfors operators in two and several dimensions, 2) the use of Brownian motions to   investigate sharp bounds for the fundamental frequency and fundamental gap of the   Laplacian in Euclidean domains, and 3) the use of asymptotic expansions for Wiener   functionals to investigate the asymptotic expansion in the trace of Schrodinger operators   and  how the signs of the coefficients in such  expansion depend on the sign of the   potential.    Probability Theory has its roots in various fields of applied sciences and hence it should   not be surprising that modern stochastic analysis draws many of its technical tools from   several distinct areas of mathematics.  What is often far from  obvious  is that probabilistic   ideas and techniques can be effectively used to investigate problems and applications   which on the surface do not seem to be related to probability at all. The problems   discussed above fall in this category.  The Beurling-Ahlfors operators are (singular)    integral operators which describe regularity (smoothness) properties of solutions to   various nonlinear  equations arising from, among other topics, elasticity.  The computation   of their operator norms is a fundamental problem with many applications.  On the surface   this operator  appears to be very far from probability.  The Principal Investigator, in   collaboration with G. Wang and A. J. Lindeman, has successfully used the theory of   martingales (fair games) to study this problem.  The first part of the project describes   various new probabilistic approaches for further work in this direction.  Bounds  on the   fundamental frequency and fundament al gap of the Laplacian operator are basic quantities   in the theory of vibrating membranes. The trace of Schrodinger operators plays a   fundamental role in  various problems in mathematical physics related to, among other   things, scattering theory. Here, too, the connection to probability is not transparent. In the   second part of the project the PI proposes to use the theory of Brownian motion and   stochastic calculus to investigate several open problems in this areas. It is expected that   these investigations will lead, as it has happened many times in the past, to new and   surprising applications of probability to analysis, geometry, partial differential equations,   and the application of these subjects to mathematical physics. Several students will most   likely participate in these investigations."

If a fair  coin is flipped repeatedly and X(n) represents the number of  heads in the first n flips minus the number of tails in the first  n flips, the sequence of integers X(1), X(2),... is called fair  random walk. Reinforced random walk is constructed in a similar  manner except that if X(n) is the maximum price seen so far then  the coin which determines X(n+1)-X(n) has probability p<1/2 of  coming up heads, while if X(n) is a record minimum the coin has  probability 1-p, which of course exceeds 1/2, of coming up heads.  In words, this walk is fair random walk with partial reflection  back to previously assumed values at records. The fact that the  history {X(1),X(2),..X(n)} of the process is needed to determine  the probability of the next jump means that reinforced random  walk is not a Markov process, and renders the vast theory of such  processes inapplicable. The investigator has shown that X(n)  divided by the square root of n converges in distribution as n  goes to infinity. He hopes to refine this result, for example by  identifying the limiting distributions, and to prove its analog  for the related processes which have probability greater than one  half of setting new records, if they are at a record. Oddly, this  situation will require very different methods. In another  direction, the investigator will use Brownian motion to study  positive solutions of the Dirichlet heat equation in planar  domains, more specifically to find geometrical properties of the  shape of the domain which determine or ensure that the ratio of  any two solutions at any positive time is bounded throughout the  domain, above and below, by positive constants, a property which  is called intrinsic ultracontractivity of the Dirichlet heat  semigroup.  The investigator will study reinforced random walk. Suppose the  price of a stock always changes by one dollar. Track the price  after the first price change, the second, the third, and so on.  Fair random wal k models this under the assumption that each  change is equally likely to be plus one dollar or minus one,  regardless of all earlier changes. Reinforced random walk behaves  the same way except when the current price is a record high, in  which case the next change is more likely to be down, or when the  current price is a record low, in which case the next change is  more likely to be up. That is, the walk shies away from setting  records. It is a primitive model of a buy-low-sell-high market.  It is less tractable than fair random walk because the past price  fluctuations are used to determine the probabilities of the next  step being plus one or minus one. The investigator has recently  shown how the average net change in price behaves after a large  number of changes, namely he has shown that it is on the order of  the square root of the number of changes. He will try to refine  this result and to prove a companion theorem for the related  class of processes which like to set records. In another  direction, probabilistic methods will be used to study how a flat  metal plate cools, if it looses heat only out the edges, which  are held at absolute zero, more specifically how the shape of the  plate influences this cooling."

The goals of the proposed research are two-fold. On the conceptual level, it aims to provide a general methodology for the specification of continuous-time asset-price models from the market primitives and to establish a new modelling framework for the analysis and better understanding of incomplete financial markets and their equilibrium dynamics. A novel concept of completeness constraint is introduced in order to capture the fruitful idea that market incompleteness can be interpreted as an exogenously-imposed constraint.  On the technical level, it furnishes tools for the mathematical analysis of the framework described above, based on the existing and new stochastic-, convex- and functional-analytic and PDE-based methods. These tools are, then, used to establish the existence of equilibria and to study their properties.  The mathematical core is the study of the notion of stability for the optimal solutions of stochastic control problems as functions of the modelling inputs. The obtained stability results can be interpreted in terms of the aggregate demand functions and used to grant existence of equilibrium markets with the help of the appropriate (classical and new) fixed-point theorems."

These investigations lead to connections of probability to a conjecture of Morrey which asserts that rank--one convexity does not imply quasiconvexity in dimensions larger than 2. Secondly, extremal problems for the hyperbolic metric will be investigated. These problems arise from the conformal invariance of Brownian motion and conditioned Brownian motion in simply connected domains in the plane.

These connections lead to several questions which if false prove Morrey's's conjecture, a long standing open problem, and if true prove a conjecture concerning the norm of certain singular integrals, another long standing open problem.

These processes are typically modeled using the statistical mechanics approach, i.e. by considering large systems of interacting particles, where each particle corresponds to a molecule or an individual bacterium. Imprecision of our measurements and dependence of physical processes on many factors are typically described by random perturbations of particles. Large-scale behavior of such models is observed when one looks at the systems from a sufficiently large distance, after a sufficiently long period of time. Universality in this case refers to the fact that such growing interfaces exhibit similar large-scale behavior. Description of this universal behavior gives a better understanding of the real physical processes in nature. Recent breakthroughs in probability theory, particularly in stochastic partial differential equations and integrable probability, have provided the tools to study such mathematical models.<br/><br/>The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality arises in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, when studying limiting behavior of random growing interfaces. On the mathematical level, growing interfaces appear in free energies of directed random polymers, random growth models, interacting particle systems, stochastic Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. Depending on the characteristics of models, two universal objects are conjectured to govern such interfaces: the KPZ equation and the KPZ fixed point. Recent developments in the area of stochastic PDEs allow to prove scaling limits of various discrete systems to singular stochastic PDEs. Moreover, methods of integrable probability (exactly solvable models) provided a complete characterization of the KPZ fixed point. The goal of this project is to study universal scaling limits of such random growing interfaces using these new results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the case of plant pathogens, long-distance dispersal phenomena and spatial heterogeneity of infection spreading can lead to failure of disease-control strategies that are based on naive models. Furthermore, such weak control strategies are often uneconomical and use copious amounts of pesticides on crops. In the case of human-contagious diseases, better intervention strategies can be developed if quantitative effects of quarantine are known. By analyzing spatial epidemic models with long-distance dispersal and certain intervention strategies, this research project aims to provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinning of dispersal on features of plant epidemics, and into the effects of quarantine strategies on restraining the spread of contagious infection among humans. To guarantee that the results are relevant to epidemiology, a part of the project will be carried out in collaboration with ecologists and epidemiologists. The involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in this research will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and biology.<br/> <br/>This project addresses challenges in developing more effective and economical intervention strategies for preventing the spread of infection in the plant and human world. Most of the epidemic models that have been analyzed rigorously to investigate the role of space in infection spreading are nearest-neighbor in nature. However, there are many plant diseases where the infection spreads via long-distance dispersals. To understand the effect of long-distance dispersal on infection spreading, several complex agent-based models have been analyzed using simulation and some heuristic methods in the theoretical biology literature. These non-rigorous treatments of the epidemic models sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions.   One of the primary goals of this project is to understand rigorously the effect of long-range interactions on the spread of infections and associated features. In this project, the investigator plans to study several aspects of long-range first-passage percolation models by adding ""long-range interaction"" features to the standard (nearest-neighbor) first-passage percolation models.  The investigator also plans to study intervention strategies for SIS models, which are frequently used for modeling spread of recurring disease among humans, in one dimension and on complex heterogeneous graphs.  The rigorous analyses of these models will require the development of novel mathematical techniques. These techniques are expected to lead to a deeper understanding of a broad class of spatial stochastic epidemic models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As well as being important to probability theory, the results obtained in this proposal will be relevant and applied to many branches of science, as most of the questions were introduced to understand the behavior of various optimization problems in physics, computer science, theoretical biology, and social networks. <br/><br/>More specifically, the proposal involves projects on first-passage percolation (an example of fluid flow in a porous medium) and on mean field spin glass models (example of disordered magnets with frustrated interactions).  The major questions are tied to the complexity of the models, that is, the presence of a large number of extremes and their location in space. In particular the proposer plans to investigate the role played by the functional order parameters in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, mixed p-spin and bipartite models and its relation with the number and location of extremes of the corresponding Hamiltonians. The proposal further addresses fundamental questions on growing interfaces and fluctuations of long chemical chains in a random potential (polymer models). Predictions from physics indicate that, in many of these models, fluctuations should scale sub-linearly with limiting laws that deviate from the standard Gaussian (for instance, which relate to the Tracy-Widom distribution from random matrix theory). This proposal continues and expands the research of the PI on these systems outside the scope of integrable models. In particular, this proposal aims to investigate the universal behavior of scaling exponents, the nature of the limit shape and the geometry of geodesics."

The meetings center on the topic of probability theory and have the goals of training junior mathematicians in the field and stimulating new research. Probability theory is a major branch of modern mathematics. It aims at a rigorous mathematical investigation of collective behavior of random phenomena and is one of the most applicable branches of science. The one-day workshop, to be held in February 2016, will feature four talks on the topic of nodal sets of random functions. The three day conference, to be held in May 2016, will feature twelve talks by experts on the topics of percolation, spin glasses, and random media, three central topics in probability.  The Summer School in Probability, to be held in July 2016,  will include five introductory mini-courses on various topics within geometric analysis, aimed at graduate students and recent PhD recipients. Award funds will be used primarily for the travel costs of attendees who are graduate students or postdoctoral scholars at US institutions. The organizing committee will seek broad and diverse participation in these activities, and will especially encourage the participation of women mathematicians and members of other under-represented groups. More information on these events, which are part of an Emphasis Year in Probability at Northwestern, can be found on the website: <br/><br/>http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/emphasis.html <br/><br/>In the last decades, probability theory has emerged as a central and core branch of mathematics. Part of its importance relies on the connection with several branches of science, including: mathematical physics, chemistry, statistics, economics, and other areas of mathematics. The programmed activities share and promote these connections. Percolation originated from the study of fluid flow on a porous media, spin glasses are disordered magnets that exhibit metastability and large complexity, while random media is a common background to study polymer models. The research on nodal sets of random functions goes back to the work of M. Kac on zeroes of random polynomials and share deep connections with semi-classical analysis and topology. These activities and topics present an excellent opportunity to bring graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to the forefront of research in probability theory."

The analysis is based on the Wiener measure on these spaces, which plays a similar role as the Lebesgue measure in the analysis of finite dimensional manifolds. Since the Wiener measure gives rise to Brownian motion and Brownian bridge, the probabilistic methods (stochastic differential equations, diffusion theory, etc.) will be used extensively in our analysis. The geometric and analytical properties of path and loop spaces will be studied through the probabilistic properties of the so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.  The PI will discover generalizations of integration by parts formula for the gradient operator in various geometric settings (mainly for manifolds with boundary) and compute the familiar geometric objects such as torsion and curvature tensors of the path and loop spaces (as Hilbert manifolds) in terms of stochastic integrals involving the usual torsion and curvature tensors of the underlying Riemannian manifold. The long-term goal is to develop an intrinsic, geometric Malliavin calculus and to investigate hypercontractivity, logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and Meyer's equivalence in our new geometric setting and their interaction with the Riemannian structure of the base manifold.   Interdisciplinary research is the current trend of scientific research. Probability theory is a branch of mathematics which studies random behavior of collective phenomena.  In the last two decades probability theory has been applied with great success to problems from classical mathematical subjects such as partial differential equations and geometry.  This new probabilistic point of view not only stimulated research in these classical subjects but also opened new avenues of research such as stochastic differential geometry and diffusion theory. The PI will use probabilistic methods to study properties of an important class of geometric objects called loop spaces (for example,  the collection of closed paths on a sphere), which just began to gain importance in modern physics. He will show how the curvature of the base space (the sphere in the above case) affects the behavior of certain random processes associated with loop spaces and give both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the interaction between the geometry of the space and the underlying random processes."

A random matrix is used  to model a typical behavior in many problems arising in high-dimensional convexity, functional analysis, as well as in physics and computer science. In all these areas the size of a matrix, i.e. the available number of degrees of freedom is very large, but fixed. This project aims to investigate the spectral phenomena which arise with high probability, and obtain explicit probability bounds. One of the central questions here is evaluation of the probability that a large random matrix is non-singular, and obtaining quantitative characteristics of non-singularity. To this end, the project brings into play a wide array of tools, ranging from classical probability, to asymptotic geometric analysis, and additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is currently undergoing a period of rapid development. In a large part this is due to the demand for explicit probabilistic estimates arising in various problems of computer science and engineering. This includes, among others, the wireless communication, where random matrices are used to model interactions between antennas and obstacles on the ground. The study of random matrices is also of importance for internet privacy protection, since certain kinds of random matrices became tools of choice in constructing hacking algorithms. The project will develop explicit quantitative spectral bounds, which are required for the aforementioned problems.<br/>"

It is known that if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then pricing the Black-Scholes type formula becomes delicate and difficult to analyze.  For instance, if the underlying asset price is a ""true"" martingale, then the European call price is a submartingale, hence the function is increasing. On the other hand, if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then the European call price is not in general increasing.  The project develops techniques from probability theory to build a bridge between mathematical models and financial markets.  A first main direction of the project uses the interpretation of the generalized Black-Scholes quantities in terms of last passage times in the framework of Bessel processes in order to derive fine properties of the call option process, as a function of maturity, written for the strict local Bessel martingales.  Concretely, the work aims to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding market bubbles.  A second main focus of the project investigates the enlargement filtration of the last passage time in the Black-Scholes type formula, in particular, its ""distance"" from the stopping time.  In a financial context, an example of the improper use of stopping time may be interpreted as using signals coming from available inside information. <br/>The project will develop mathematical theory and tools for detecting the presence of arbitrage trading in this setting which is also related to market bubble phenomena.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a series of market crashes and bubbles where mispricing takes place. In economic terms, a bubble is defined as a deviation between the price of an asset and its underlying values.<br/>Mathematically, bubbles are phenomena for which the discounted asset prices are strictly local martingale but not martingale under the risk-free measure. In other words, if the discounted asset price processes are strict local martingales, option prices no longer increase in maturity and Merton's no early exercise theorem does not hold. Intuitively, if a bubble exists, the asset price will increase initially, but a crash is<br/>likely to take place in the future.   It is well-known that many<br/>sophisticated financial derivatives have been built on the foundation of mathematical theories since the 1970s. As a consequence, such a rapid increase of derivative markets necessitates proper communication between financial analysts and mathematicians.  A general goal of the project is to develop a rigorous mathematical understanding of market bubbles and related phenomena.  The project is interdisciplinary in nature and will be integrated into practical applications.<br/><br/><br/>"

Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory. A combined, focused effort is expected to bring new insights toward a better understanding of the participants' respective fields of research, which - while related and occasionally overlapping - are not identical and often employ different perspectives.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics encompassing the methods and the problems described above has recently entered a period of rapid growth. In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

More specifically, the investigator works - partly in a collaboration with other researchers - on questions concerning the structure of limit theorems in the phase transition regime as well as on applications of ideas reminiscent of the concept of complete analyticity to a general probabilistic setting such as, for example, to the theory of Markov chains or to the theory of random fields. Principal mathematical issues addressed in this research include further investigation of the two dimensional Ising model in the whole of the phase transition region, analysis of Ornstein-Zernike behavior of two-and-higher dimensional correlations and related shape and fluctuation theorems, analysis of limit phenomena for almost Markovian random fields and justification of the Wulff construction in various two and three dimensional models (e.g. SOS, Ising and continuous spin Ising, percolation etc.), based on sharp subvolume order large deviation results.     Long term objectives of this research are twofold. On the one hand, powerful ideas and methods developed over the past decade in mathematical statistical mechanics--such as, for example, the method of polymer expansions, the concept of complete analyticity and the method of induction in volume--may provide both useful insights and approaches to various limit problems in probability and stochastic processes. On the other hand, most of the problems addressed in this research emerge from physical and material science theories of a rigorous reconstruction of thermodynamical and kinetic properties of matter directly from microscopic considerations. Thus, a successful investigation is ultimately aimed at a better understanding of such issues as, for example, equilibrium structure and stability of crystals and dynamics of surface growth."

Path and loop spaces over a Riemannian manifold are naturally equipped with the basic ingredients for an analytic theory, namely, the Wiener measure and a differentiable structure. These are important infinite dimensional mathematical and physical models. The PI will study the following problems concerning these models: (1) Integration by parts formula for manifolds with the Neumann boundary conditions (adiabatic case); (2) Logarithmic Sobolev and related inequalities for simply-connected manifolds; (3) Couplings of Brownian motions on manifolds, especially the problem of maximal couplings; (4) Infinite dimensional mass transportation problems related to the Wiener measure. <br/> The importance of mathematical objects, such as path and loop spaces over Riemannian manifolds, has been recognized by mathematicians and physicists for quite some time.

Famous examples include the bell curve  that appears in countless empirical histograms, or Benford's law that governs the first digit of many real-life sets of numerical data. While these universal laws are very well studied, there are numerous mysterious laws that are frequently observed, but not at all understood, especially those arising from random systems with complicated component correlations. A major part of this research project provides rigorous mathematical methods to discover and justify universality phenomena for various complex systems, with a special focus on random matrices and random polynomials. This study is expected to lead to a more complete and deeper understanding of these systems, with considerable impact on related areas of science, including mathematical physics, combinatorics, number theory, statistics, and theoretical computer science. The principal investigator will also run a number of seminars and workshops to help postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates in their professional career development, as well as to stimulate interaction across fields including, but not limited to, combinatorics and probability.<br/> <br/>In technical terms, the research project will develop novel methods to characterize inhomogeneous random walks of large returning probability in both discrete and continuous settings for non-abelian groups.  This task also includes finding optimal characterizations of random multilinear forms with large concentration probability.

With respect to the universality phenomenon, the principal investigator will focus on random polynomials, random eigenfunctions of smooth manifolds, and random matrices. More specifically, the PI will study correlations of roots of random polynomials, nodal statistics of the random wave model with Bernoulli coefficients, and important questions involving the smallest singular values, the spectral repulsion, and the logarithmic determinant and permanent of random matrices of different types of symmetry and sparsity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of those are designed to model physical or biological processes with numerous components, such as bacterial growth, combustion fronts, very cold gases at the atomic level, and so on. Predicting the behavior of such a system at large times is very challenging, and for mathematical analysis one needs to rely on certain special structure of the model at hand. This structure originates in algebra and representation theory, and it ultimately allows one to access large time and scale characteristics at a very fine resolution. The resulting probabilistic laws tend to be occurring in a substantially wider range of probabilistic systems, which can be observed through numerical and physical experiments. <br/><br/>This project is about stochastic systems that can be analyzed by essentially algebraic methods; such systems are often call exactly solvable or integrable. The overarching goal is to develop a theory of stochastic vertex models related to  quantum affine groups of arbitrary ranks.  On one hand, this class of models is very general, uniting many previously studied integrable probabilistic models (such as ASEP, directed polymers in random environment, and quantum Boson systems), as well as adding many new ones (such as multi-species or colored exclusion processes).

Mathematical studies of such topics have led to fundamental developments in modern probability theory.  In turn, rigorous analysis has  provided useful feedback on our understanding of the relevant physics.  Examples of the latter are found in the disorder effects on phase transitions in two and three dimensional classical and quantum systems systems (such as the so-called Imry-Ma phenomenon), and in the spectral and dynamical effects of disorder in the context of random quantum operators. The PI was instrumental in past works of this type, including recently, in which he contributed key results which helped uncover new classical and quantum physical phenomena thanks to studies in probability theory.  The projected research will both continue and redirect the PI's efforts, and will necessarily continue be interdisciplinary in nature. Beyond its use of probability theory and mathematical analysis on physics questions, the results of the research could potentially bring broader impacts to other areas where modern probability theory is helping elucidate new phenomena, such as computer science and engineering, and data science.  Of particular note with this project's other broader impacts is the potential for outcomes of the highest caliber in training the next generation of US scientists. Based on the PI's past and recent supervision of extraordinarily talented graduate students and postdocs under NSF support, the project will certainly allow the PI to offer research experience of the highest level for such future trainees at Princeton University. Some of the research will be carried out in collaboration with top researchers from other institutions, providing valuable networking opportunities for the trainees.    <br/><br/>The PI's attention will be redirected towards critical phenomena in a number of instructive models below their upper critical dimension, a concept whose understanding was firmly advanced by PI's previous work on percolation, Ising spin systems and phi^4 field theory.   It was recently noted that the techniques by which the PI has previously established the Gaussian (bosonic) nature of the Ising model's scaling limits in dimensions greater than four yield also simple proofs of the fermionic nature of certain correlation functions in the planar case.   Some of these relations have been known through exact solution of the two dimensional model, but the new argument suggests a path towards explanation of ""universal"" emergent planarity in a class of critical non-planar and non-solvable two dimensional models.   Related questions concerning critical phenomena will be explored for the three-dimensional case, which is neither trivial nor solvable yet of obvious interest.  Work will also continue on classical and quantum effects of disorder on the spectral and dynamical properties  of random operators, and on the structure of Gibbs equilibrium states of systems with quenched disorder."

While one can try to directly model such systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.<br/><br/>Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems, observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model, Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur / Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently, these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately. The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena."

The dependence in time is of white-noise type, while the dependence in space can span a wide range of behaviors. The differential operator is the standard Laplacian on the real line or on the circle (or sometimes in higher dimensions), with a small diffusion parameter ""kappa"" included. In the multiplicative noise case, a nonlinearity may be included. The basic point of view is simple: an SPDE with a unique solution is an input-output system, and as such the solution's behavior must be inherited from the equation's coefficients. The local behavior to be considered is the modulus of continuity of the solution in the space variable. The long term behavior of interest, specific to the linear multiplicative case, is the large-time exponential asymptotics of the solution (Lyapunov ""exponent"" question). The PI characterizes both of these behaviors via the spatial modulus of continuity of the potential itself, extends some of the results to equations driven by fBm, and designs a new numerical method for the solution using a system of interacting particles. It is shown that the solution's Lyapunov exponent is of the order of kappa to the power of alpha/(1+alpha) where alpha is the almost-sure spatial Holder exponent of the solution. It is also shown that the solution has spatial Holder exponent alpha if and only if the same holds for the potential's antiderivative. An investigation of how these results change when one uses fractional noise instead of white noise is also considered. For the nonlinear equation, a branching and interacting particle system is constructed as the basis for a numerical method for simulating the solution. It is proved that the numerical scheme, when properly mollified, converges to the solution in the Skorohod space of continuous-function-valued ""cadlag"" processes. The particles interact because, as they branch at evenly spaced short intervals, their mean number of offspring is a random variable whose mean is calculated relative to a certain ""fitness"" of all the other particles, and depends explicitly on the non-linearity of the potential. <br/> The main physical meaning of the research is that a complex space-time-dependent system with significant random perturbations can exhibit an exponentially strong increase of size or energy in the long term, and that the exponential rate of increase can be predicted precisely by looking at the short-range spatial variability of the physical environment. This has potentially important applications in hydrodynamics and turbulence, including a local characterization of the so-called ""fast dynamo effect."" It would say that a magnetic field in a magnetic fluid can be enhanced precisely by controlling the fluid's mezoscopic level of turbulence. The research has important educational effects. Ph.D. students and, under the PI's supervision, undergraduates and MS students, conduct computer simulations in connection with the particle methods, with an emphasis on designing efficient algorithms. The simulations are being integrated as class projects in a new curriculum emphasis in computational finance and other applications, preparing the students for the technology-dominated job market and workplace. From the purely theoretical point of view, the research brings together several areas of great current interest in probability theory: infinite dimensional stochastic analysis, branching and interacting particle systems and numerical methods, Gaussian regularity theory, Lyapunov exponents. <br/>"

This project focuses on a particular aspect of the behavior known as large deviations, which is about small-probability events occurring in the systems of interest. The theory of large deviations is one of the pillars of probability theory; understanding how it manifests itself in different types of systems is a practical and important task. Further, the study of large deviations has applications to understanding excursions between meta-stable states, analyzing phase transitions, and benchmarking numerical algorithms. The research aims to advance understanding in these and other areas. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In concrete terms, this project will study the finite-dimensional and sample-path large deviations of asymmetric interacting particle systems and of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations. They exhibit large deviations in various regimes, including the short-time, intermediately-long-time, and long-time regimes. The main goals of this project are: i) establishing the short-time large deviation principles of various systems; ii) studying how the large deviations in the short-time regime converge to the (mostly conjectural) large deviations in the long-time regime; and iii) investigating the large deviations in the intermediately-long-time regime. These goals involve the mathematical study of various physical phenomena, including the correspondences between soliton waves and shock waves, the spontaneous generation of soliton waves, and dynamical symmetry breaking. The goals of this project will be achieved by a combination of stochastic analysis and integrable structures using the Feynman-Kac formula, the connection to quantum-many-body systems, and the inverse scattering transform of integrable partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The statistical analysis, in turn, relies on assumptions which, if violated, can lead to incorrect or misleading outcomes. In many modern applications, the statistical modeling is further complicated by inherent structural inhomogeneities in the population. Specific examples include the spread of information in social networks, genetic variation among mitochondrial DNA sequences from different species, collisions of particles suspended in a non-uniform medium, and identification of suspicious activity in a criminal or terrorist network. With these applications in mind, the project initiates a systematic study of probabilistic models and inferential principles for data taken from heterogeneous or specially structured populations. Attainment of these goals requires techniques from several mathematical and scientific areas and should lead to progress at the intersection of applied science, statistics, probability, and mathematics. Project outcomes will lead to a better understanding of how fundamental statistical assumptions affect the validity of scientific conclusions. The mathematical theory and statistical methods developed should have a broad societal impact, as combinatorial stochastic processes are used throughout modern applications in physical, biological, and social sciences, national security, and beyond. The PI has extensive plans for training graduate and undergraduate students in the methods to be used, via courses on the foundations of statistics at both levels, the supervision of Ph.D. theses, and conferences and workshops on these topics for these and other early-career researchers. The plans are innovative and the PI will devote significant time and resources to them. In particular, a strong emphasis will be placed on attracting and hiring students from underprivileged backgrounds who are first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The specific technical objective is a rigorous mathematical theory for understanding random structures that exhibit relative exchangeability and other invariance principles.  A hallmark of the project is the in-depth study and rigorous development of theory and applications for edge exchangeable network models, which were first introduced by the PI as a novel invariance principle for network analysis.  Desired outcomes include relative invariance principles, structural properties, and characterization theorems for evolving combinatorial structures. The project will also exploit deep connections between combinatorics, algebra, logic, and probability theory to refine prior work by de Finetti, Kingman, Aldous, Hoover, and Kallenberg, on graph limits and Levy-Ito-type representations of Feller processes on combinatorial state spaces. Theoretical developments should guide methodological advances in specific applications, including climate science, network science, and phylogenetics."

The interplay between mathematical models and probability is rich and profound with applications far-reaching across all fields of science. This interplay can appear in many physical settings in materials science and fluid dynamics, but also in the modeling of various many-agent or many-particle dynamics, such as the self-organized motion of organisms or the spread of an infectious disease through a population. The Centre de Recherches Mathmatiques is organizing an intensive thematic program on this topic, ""Probabilities and PDEs"" during the period January 2022 -- July 2022. There will be four workshops, each with mini courses specifically aimed at graduate students or early-career researchers in related areas, and many long-term visiting scientists as well. This award provides funding to support the participation of US-based graduate students, early career researchers, and under-represented minorities through travel and accommodation during one of the two workshops and accompanying mini-courses. This will provide the participants with a perfect opportunity to interact with each other and with leaders of the field and will help them to understand the major questions and learn the cutting-edge methods of the field.<br/><br/>Probability and PDEs have always been intertwined and modern research continues to intertwine them further. One common aspect concerns how introducing randomness into PDEs, through e.g. random initial data, random environments, random forcing will profoundly affect the long-term behavior, either because it provides a flexible and realistic approach to study physical models or because it is an inevitable feature of models of the underlying systems. Another aspect is how one can obtain deterministic PDEs from underlying random many-agent or many-problems, such as in classical kinetic theory or in many-agent problems such as in mathematical epidemiology.

The Loewner energy is a quantity measuring the roundness of a simple planar loop. It arises from the asymptotic behaviors of the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), a model of random fractal curves. SLE plays a central role in random conformal geometry and two-dimensional statistical mechanics that study the macroscopic geometry of systems with given information on the microscopic level. Surprisingly, this probabilistically motivated Loewner energy can be described using fundamental concepts from seemingly disparate branches of mathematics and mathematical physics, including geometric function theory, Teichmller theory, conformal field theory, and string theory. These links suggest deep connections between random conformal geometry and those branches. This research project aims at revealing these connections and exploring how the variety of perspectives around the Loewner energy can bring new insights to probability theory and other fields. The results are expected also to reveal new facets of the mathematical architecture underlying theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The Loewner energy of a Jordan curve is defined as the Dirichlet energy of its driving function via the Loewner differential equation. Finite energy curves can, therefore, be viewed as the Cameron-Martin space of SLE, which has a multiple of Brownian motion as driving function.  This definition of both Loewner energy and SLE depends strongly on the parametrization of the curves. However, an equivalent and intrinsic description of the Loewner energy was discovered using determinants of Laplacians and is known to be the Khler potential of the Weil-Petersson metric on the universal Teichmller space. This research project first aims to provide similar intrinsic descriptions of SLE loops via the canonical measures on the welding homeomorphisms, then studies generalizations of the Loewner energy to other scenarios involving multi-chords or higher genus surfaces, analytic identities inspired by results from random conformal geometry, and the relation to minimal surfaces in the hyperbolic 3-space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the PI will develop theoretical tools in analyzing the statistics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large random matrices, which are the fundamental objects in data analysis. Besides data matrices, the PI will also investigate the associated matrices of large random graphs and, in applications to mathematical physics, random Schrodinger operators. In order to enhance the exchange of ideas among different groups of researchers, seminars and other scientific events will be organized jointly with the Statistics<br/>and Computer Science departments at the PI's institution and with other institutions in the area.

This work shows that a mean-field model like Gaussian orthogonal ensemble or Gaussian unitary ensemble can be used to model non-mean-field models?in this case, band matrices. The PI anticipates that this project will lead to a solution (in a certain weak sense) of the long standing open problem regarding the delocalization of random Schrodinger operators. Another project aims to extend the existing theory concerning Dyson?s Brownian motion to eigenvectors of free convolution models. This project can be viewed as extending Dyson?s Brownian motion to a non-uniform setting. The third project concerns investigation of the eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics of the adjacency matrices of d-regular graphs for any degree d bigger than or equal to three.

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These originate in physics but the methods of study require significant input from mathematics. A common feature of the problems discussed in the project is that they involve systems of many constituents. It is here where probability theory offers a number of indispensable tools. The specific questions are typically set in the context of a complex microscopic system defined in terms of mathematical concepts such as random walks or random fields. The aim is to show that, as the system size increases, a new structure emerges. This structure, sometimes called a scaling limit, often admits an independent characterization that enables its study using the methods of mathematical analysis. Particular attention is paid to the phenomenon of universality, which refers to independence of the scaling limit to the details of the underlying microscopic system. Understanding universality in its mathematically precise form is one of the overarching goals of the project. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>The project is divided roughly into two parts. The first one is focused on the study of extremal problems for spatial random fields. Drawing on earlier success of the analysis of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field, the aim is to establish universality of the conclusions for other examples of logarithmically-correlated fields such as the random walk local time or the discrete-Gaussian model below the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The interest here is on both the phenomena and the development of techniques required to control such systems. The second part of the project is devoted to the analysis of phase transitions in a number of systems of interest. One of these is a system of interacting bosons, which is proposed to be analyzed using a random-cycle representation. The aim here is to give a rigorous proof of Bose-Einstein condensation at positive temperatures in suitable scaling limits. Another model to be studied is that of interacting random walks; the aim here is to describe the limit shape using a variational problem for the walk range.

High-dimensional probability is proposed as a natural framework for the mathematical exploration of deep learning. This project has a double benefit. On the one hand, it is aimed at theoretically explaining the successes of deep learning. On the other hand, the project will inspire future theoretical developments in high-dimensional probability, especially in random matrix theory.

The goal of this research is to obtain a better qualitative understanding of some of the complex phenomena exhibited by systems made up of a large number of interacting components, with the interaction having a stochastic or random element. Such systems occur in many applications, one notable area being theoretical biology and ecology, where there is great interest in improving older mathematical models which do not allow for explicit spatial dependence (as do these models). Stochastic spatial models are used to study questions involving predator-prey interactions, species coexistence, and genetic diversity. These models often have dozens of parameters and interaction rules; consequently, they are generally not amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. The investigator plans research on several specific models which retain the interesting qualitative behavior of more complicated models, but are ""simple"" enough to allow for the possibility of mathematical analysis. By studying these models, the investigator seeks to give rigorous mathematical arguments which explain the observed behavior of the models. The investigator also plans to study what appears to be an intimate connection between two apparently different types of stochastic spatial models (discrete models with strong interactions and continuous models with weak interactions).<br/>"

Typically the agents are located at the nodes of a network, either a homogeneous, heterogeneous or random graph, and transmission of ``information'' (infection, rumor, traits, etc.) between agents is random but obeys some simple local rule. Interest in processes of this type has been spurred in recent years by the introduction of ``small world'' random graphs used as models of the world wide web and the internet, and attempts to analyze large social networks. There is now a rapidly growing research literature on these new models, primarily outside of mathematics.  An example of the type of question considered in this literature is: given a particular network and interaction mechanism, will a rumor or trait spread rapidly throughout the network or will it quickly die out?  A second, related question is: will a given system relax into a quasi-equilibrium which maintains diversity for a very long time.  There are rigorous results available for such questions for some ``classic'' homogeneous lattice systems, but analyzing the newer more heterogeneous models raises significant mathematical challenges. The research in this project will identify key features of these models, i.e. features of the network and of the interaction mechanism, which will determine their long-term behavior, and develop rigorous mathematical methods to validate corresponding predictions. The project will provide a rigorous foundation from which further research can be based.<br/><br/>More generally, the project is concerned with how large stochastic systems based on local rules develop over time. Systems studied will vary from a spatial model for the evolution of genealogical traits in an infinite population located in homogeneous (geographic) space, both continuous and discrete, to a variety of stochastic models on heterogeneous random graphs.  The proposed research will develop rigorous mathematical methodologies for determining whether or not predictions made based on heuristic or meanfield arguments are valid. The research will make use of a range of mathematical techniques from branching processes, interacting particle systems, percolation theory, finite Markov chains, random walks, and random graphs. In particular the project will make use of, and further extend, results on the behavior of rapidly mixing finite Markov chains."

This project aims to study new concentration phenomena that arise from unexpected connections with several different areas of mathematics: from the study of embeddings (how well can data be represented in a particular space?); from the study of exotic shapes which date back to old problems in geometry from over a century ago; and from the study of non homogeneous random matrices, which are widely used in modern data science.

Many classical problems of probability theory are devoted to understanding the patterns that are generated by random noise in high-dimensional systems. For example, suppose one has a large matrix each of whose entries is the outcome of an independent fair coin flip, i.e., the matrix is filled with noise. What do the eigenvalues of such a matrix look like? Such questions have beautiful answers that are now well understood. There are however many situations, both in pure and in applied mathematics, in which there is nontrivial structure underneath the noise. For example, in the random matrix problem, we could allow each entry to have an arbitrary variance that reflects the intensity of the corresponding variable. The challenge in such problems, which are much less well understood than their classical counterparts, is to capture the interplay between the structure and the noise. The aim of this project is to develop mathematical techniques that make it possible to address such questions in considerable generality. Beside their fundamental interest, such techniques are expected to be applicable to areas such as statistics and computer science where high-dimensional random structures play an important role. Several education and outreach activities further form a key part of this project.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop new mechanisms and techniques in high-dimensional probability to address problems that could be broadly characterized as having nonhomogeneous structure.

This project aims to systematically investigate such problems that arise in three interrelated themes: (i) the norms of nonhomogeneous random matrices (for example, with arbitrary variance or sparsity pattern); (ii) the geometry of nonhomogeneous random processes (such as those that arise, for example, in random matrix theory or in functional analysis); (iii) geometric inequalities and dimension-free phenomena (for example, in connection with measure concentration or convexity).

Question 4   deals with a possible connection (or lack of one) between two strong mixing conditions;   the relevance of this question to an old conjecture of I.A. Ibragimov is discussed.   In the real world, there are many phenomena which appear to be ``weakly   dependent,'' in the sense that observations that are ``close'' in time or location may have   considerable influence on each other, while observations that are ``far apart'' in time or   location have only slight influence on each other.  For example, the annual unemployment   rate for the year 1998 may have considerable influence on the unemployment rates for the   years 1999 and 2000, but will presumably have almost no influence on the employment   rate in, say, the year 2050. Similarly, the fluctuations in the wind currents at a given   location may be highly correlated with the (wind current) fluctuations ten miles away, but   perhaps have no discernible correlation with the fluctuations 3000 miles away.  For the   modeling of such phenomena, much attention has been devoted in probability theory to a   broad type of weak dependence known under the name ``stron g mixing conditions.'' An   understanding of ``structural'' properties of strong mixing conditions can help in assessing   their appropriateness for the modeling of a given real world phenomenon, and ``laws of   averages'' connected with such conditions can provide the foundation for the statistical   inference for the given phenomenon.  This research deals with several questions   concerning both ``structural'' properties and ``laws of averages'' in connection with various   strong mixing conditions."

Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory.

In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract.

These distributions are known to model the impact of highly consequential events that may be difficult to hedge against, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, wildfires, economic shocks, among many others.  In turn, Bayesian methods encompass the body of statistical theory that explains how to combine observed evidence with subjective beliefs. Despite the importance of the applications mentioned earlier, most of the computational methods for Bayesian inference are typically designed to efficiently study light-tailed distributions, which model events that are in some sense easier to hedge against. The project's goal is to study questions that lie at the heart of the convergence speed of computational methods for Bayesian inference with heavy-tailed target distributions. The methods studied in this project will provide the tools to design faster and more efficient algorithms to accurately predict high impact events such as those described above. Successfully enabling efficient and systematic Bayesian inference for heavy-tailed targets requires a breadth of expertise and research experience which would be very difficult to assemble within a single project without the DMS-EPSRC Lead Agency agreement. The results obtained in this proposal will be introduced in courses that will enhance broadening participation. The PI will attempt to recruit personnel from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is the study of the convergence analysis to equilibrium of Markov chains which exhibit heavy-tailed features. While this goal is theoretical in nature, its motivation comes from applications: the existing theory does not apply to randomized Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms with heavy-tailed targets, which nevertheless arise frequently in practice. Despite the fundamental importance of convergence to equilibrium analysis, there are important questions that have not been well studied in the literature. For instance, the presence of a spectral gap is known to be equivalent to the geometric convergence of a Markov chain. However, even under geometric convergence, ergodic estimators may still exhibit large deviation behavior of the heavy-tailed type for standard empirical means. Contributions in this direction will significantly extend the Donsker-Varadhan theory of large deviations (which is fundamental in probability). Conversely, Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures typically do not have a spectral gap but might nevertheless exhibit good convergence properties. Designing quickly convergence Markov chains requires dynamics that are completely different from the standard Langevin diffusion typically used in MCMC. The PI will investigate and build a systematic theoretical treatment of the convergence to equilibrium of Markov chains with heavy-tailed stationary measures arising in randomized algorithms of computational statistics and machine learning (ML).  This project will involve students and a postdoctoral associates who will visit the research teams both in the US in the UK. This will further enhance the human resource development of these participants since they will be exposed to a broad network of collaborators and ideas. The scientific output will have a substantial impact beyond applied probability in a number of sub-areas of computational statistics and ML where such targets arise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A network is comprised of a certain number of objects (normally referred to as 'nodes' or 'vertices') connected by links of various importance ('edges' and their 'weights'). Analyzing network data is notoriously challenging. An important task is to group the vertices into subgroups such that each subgroup is highly connected, and any two subgroups have only loose interconnections. Even if one is only trying to identify merely two subgroups (known as the min-bisection problem), no efficient algorithm is known to partition the nodes of large graphs in general. The situation changes when one considers that the graphs might have a random structure. Indeed, for many reasonable probabilistic models on graphs, there appear to be efficient algorithms to solve the min-bisection problem. This project will develop our fundamental understanding of these probabilistic models and will study efficient algorithms to treat them.<br/><br/>The project focuses on various models of sparse random graphs, the simplest being the Erdos-Renyi (independent edges) random graph, with bounded average degree. Many statistical inference tasks can be addressed by suitably defined combinatorial optimization problems. For instance, the min-bisection problem requires to find a balanced partition of the vertex set that minimizes the number of edges across the partition. These optimization problems are associated to certain Gibbs measures on the underlying graph, from which the optimizers are recovered as ground states. Statistical physicists conjectured that these Gibbs measures are asymptotically equivalent (for random graphs) to Gibbs measures of suitably defined spin glass models. This project aims at establishing this connection on a firm basis and exploiting it to study the structure of large random graphs. It has also recently been suggested that semidefinite-programming relaxations for the same problems can be studied through other Gibbs measures (with vector spins). Studying these spin models will improve our understanding of efficient algorithms for solving these tasks."

The project aims to solve the mathematical problem of determining the minimum sample size required for good performance of importance sampling in any given setting. Lastly, a third class of problems centers around probabilistic techniques for proving that small perturbations of Dirichlet Laplacians are quantum unique ergodic."

This research project investigates a set of questions in probability and statistics raised by large-scale data collection. While of increasing use, empirical Bayes methods have proved difficult to justify. The approach under development in this project brings a novel application of exponential family theory to the job, with the goal of clarifying how empirical Bayes analyses converge to traditional Bayes methods as sample sizes increase. The project aims to develop empirical Bayes methods that use large-scale parallel data sets, such as those from microarray studies, to improve estimation in situations reporting many small sub-experiments, each of which by itself has low accuracy; and improved Monte Carlo methods for the computer solution of massive optimization problems.<br/><br/>Specific topics under investigation in this research project include large-scale empirical Bayes strategies, importance sampling for computer-assisted inference in formerly intractable situations, and a theory of stability assessment for traditional methods of accuracy estimation.  Exponential families of probability distributions play a central role in both computation and statistical inference. A particularly stubborn impediment to their use in massive data analyses is the lack of a suitable norming constant in the exponential family density. This research project further develops computational methods based on solutions of appropriate variational problems; a promising application is in the area of graphical models. A second application of exponential families involves efficient deconvolution of datasets to obtain empirical Bayes estimates."

Recent study on this topic by the PI and his collaborators has led to solutions for a number of long-standing open problems including an approximation of cover times up to multiplicative constant posed by Aldous-Fill, the Winkler-Zukerman blanket time conjecture, the asymptotic relation between cover times and discrete Gaussian free fields for bounded degree graphs, the order of the variance for the maximum of the two-dimensional discrete Gaussian free field, and the critical behavior for Aldous' percolation of averages in the mean-field setting. A general underlying principle in the aforementioned works is to employ tree structures associated with the random processes, highlighted by an application of Fernique-Talagrand majorizing measure theory in the study of cover times of random walks. The main focus of the project is to understand extreme values of various processes via further exploring associated tree structures.  Despite efforts by the PI and a list of other researchers, a number of outstanding questions remain open in this area, such as the asymptotics and concentration phenomenon for cover times in general graphs, the limiting law for the centered maximum and the scaling limit of the extremal process for 2D discrete Gaussian free field, as well as percolation of averages in high dimensions and first passage percolation on social networks.<br/><br/>The research on extreme values has a number of facets including the typical magnitude, the concentration phenomenon, and the limit in law.  While the proposed area is rich both in theory and examples, the proposal features the models/processes that possess tree structures, implicitly always and well hidden in most examples. Special attention will be devoted to cover times of random walks, discrete Gaussian free field, percolation of averages, as well as first passage percolation on social networks.  From a theoretical perspective, our study reveals conceptual connections among topics that have been studied separately, and further understand interesting aspects of important random processes such as random walks (arguably the most studied stochastic processes by mathematicians) and Gaussian free fields (an object that is of fundamental interest in statistical physics). From a practical perspective, the research is motivated by applications in areas including computer science, operation research and social network. For instances, the cover time of a random walk has applications in computer science such as testing graph connectivity and protocol testing; studying first passage percolation on social networks is of significance to understand the spread of information/epidemics, and in turn is likely to provide insight on optimal strategies to manage the flow of information or to preclude infections of diseases."

This approach has been very successful, often for finding the quenched asymptotic behavior when two levels of randomness are present, conditioned on a fixed, typical realization of one element of randomness. The proposed activity focuses on the applications of this approach in two directions:<br/><br/>1. Experiments and simulations involving dynamical systems out of equilibrium report an aging phenomenon, that is ""memory"" being accumulated in the system. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem of statistical physics relates the time derivative of the correlation function at equilibrium to the effect of small perturbations in the dynamical equations. It is predicted in the physics literature that aging is related to a specific form of breakup of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. One goal of the proposed activity is to form the mathematical version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, to understand the causes of the aging mechanism, and to rigorously relate the two.<br/><br/>2. The Gaussian free field and the Brownian motion are two fundamental random objects of great intrinsic beauty and much interest in probability theory (as well as in mathematical physics). The PI and his collaborators have been very successful in studying the fractal geometry of the extremal points of the occupation measure and covering process associated with planar Brownian motion and random walks. Recent works by the PI's students, their collaborators, and others, suggest strong similarity between the extremes of the Gaussian free field and those of the Brownian motion, as well as novel relations between contour lines of random height functions, those of the Gaussian free field and certain conformally invariant loop ensembles. Pursuing further this similarity, one goal of the proposed activity is to gain new insights and develop novel connections between the planar Gaussian free field and Brownian motion. <br/><br/> Over the past three decades, the physics community has developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for making very accurate predictions about the asymptotics of random dynamics, Gibbs measures, and planar objects with conformal symmetries. More recently, mathematicians started making significant progress in developing the corresponding rigorous theories and proving some of these predictions. One of the key tools in this process has been the theory of large deviations and the intuition behind it. The proposed activity is partially motivated by such non-rigorous physics predictions. As such, it is expected to result in new mathematical ideas and techniques that, beyond the immediate resolution of challenging problems of much interest to probabilists, would have an impact on the interface between probability theory and statistical physics. This grant will provide graduate training of students in probability theory. The techniques to be developed in this proposal are also expected to have future applications to the theory and practice of universal non-linear filtering, a problem of relevance and much interest for communication theory (see the URL www-stat.stanford.edu/~amir/ for some related activity and preprints). <br/>"

One unifying theme is that the evaluation of probabilities of rare events leads to an understanding of the mechanisms by which they can occur, and when many different rare events are possible, it leads to the identification of the mechanism causing one of them to actually occur.  Two specific lines of research are planned: (i) Mathematical study and understanding of ""aging"" phenomenon in the large time behavior of dynamical systems for statistical physics models out of equilibrium; and (ii) Study of exceptional points on the sample path of stochastic processes such as Brownian motion, random walks and stable processes.  Emphasis is put on points defined by means of the corresponding occupation measures of sets of shrinking diameters.  Other directions of proposed research involving these ingredients are applicable among other things to universal lossy coding, a problem of relevance and much interest for communication theory and to biomolecular data analysis.<br/><br/> The theory of large deviations is mainly concerned with rare events or tail estimates on an exponential scale.  This theory has proven to be successful as a tool for deriving almost sure asymptotic limits when two levels of randomness are present.  Of particular interest are problems in which large deviations estimates and ideas play a decisive role in determining a limit law that holds with probability one.<br/>"

In the last decade, computer scientists and probabilists have brought new perspectives and methods to this study and showed its applicability to approximately uniform sampling, and approximate counting of combinatorial structures. The key factor controlling the running time of such sampling schemes is the mixing time of the dynamics, which can change dramatically when the underlying stationary measure undergoes a phase transition. A central aim of this FRG project is to explore systematically the connections between information theory, large deviations, and mixing times for Markov chains. Certain fundamental optimization and search problems (e.g., k-satisfiability with random clauses) exhibit a radical change as the ratio between the input size and the number of unknown parameters is tuned. Understanding these thresholds quantitatively is another focus of the project.<br/> A system undergoes a ""phase transition"" when a small change in its input has a profound, qualitative effect on its behavior. Examples of phase transitions have been studied for decades in physics; more recently, this notion has become important in other areas, notably in connection with the performance of search and optimization techniques. Further progress on the hard problems of the subject requires long-term cooperation of researchers in probability and algorithms, as well as consultation with experts in the adjoining areas of combinatorics and statistical physics. The project is expected to have an impact on the design and analysis of randomized algorithms and provide insight on key scheduling and optimization problems. Significant effects on graduate training of students in discrete probability and computer science are expected, as they learn the language and tools of the different disciplines involved. <br/>"

These are usually characterized by two levels of randomness, one of whom frozen (quenched), in the form of dependence graph or weights for the resulting stochastic process, whose distribution is exchangeable (hence being a mean field model).  In connection with such models we focus on the following directions. The rigorous study of probabilistic models for large systems of discrete variables that are strongly interacting according to a random graph structure.  The aim is to develop a better mathematical understanding of their phase transitions and the existence of multiple Gibbs measures. A related effort has to do with the development of  novel connections between the asymptotic behavior of the  spectrum of structured models of random matrices  and properties of the corresponding random graphs and graph embeddings.<br/>Understanding the scope and reasons behind some unexpected asymptotic behavior of stochastic dynamics for spin systems out of equilibrium. A prominent example is the aging phenomenon where memory accumulates in the system with time and its relation to a yet to be understood specific form of breakup of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (which relates the time derivative of the correlation function at equilibrium to the effect of small perturbations in Markovian dynamics).<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Over the past three decades, physicists have developed sophisticated  non-rigorous techniques for accurately predicting the asymptotic behavior of large complex random systems. Their studies were motivated by the desire to understand the collective behavior of various states of the matter, and the phase transitions connecting them. For instance, the objective of understanding water at the critical temperature at which it turns into vapor, or magnets at the critical temperature at which they lose spontaneous magnetization, has motivated the development of a sophisticated unified theory of critical phenomena.<br/>Over time, it has become apparent that the models and intuitions developed by physicists rest on deep mathematical principles, whose reach is much broader than simply physical systems. <br/>More recently, mathematicians are making significant progress in developing the corresponding rigorous theories and proving some of these predictions. Probability theory is at the forefront of this convergence, starting with the theory of large deviations and continuing with the emerging vibrant activity in the study of stochastic dynamics of interacting particles, large random matrices, Gibbs measures and planar objects with conformal symmetries.<br/><br/>This project focuses on developing this line of research, in particular to develop the mathematics of large random systems without (finite-dimensional) geometric structures. These are called by physicists `mean field systems' and enjoy a remarkable degree of universality."

Probability theory is at the forefront of this convergence, starting with the theory of large deviations and continuing with the emerging vibrant activity in the study of stochastic dynamics of interacting particles, large random matrices, Gibbs measures and planar objects with conformal symmetries. A particular success story from a physics point of view are mean field(disordered) models, where two levels of randomness are often present, one of whom frozen (quenched), in the form of dependence graph or weights for the resulting stochastic process, whose distribution is exchangeable when averaged over the disorder. Specific directions we plan to pursue are (1) Rigorous study of large systems of discrete variables that are strongly interacting according to a mean field model determined by an ensemble of (randomly chosen) graphs, (2) novel connections between the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum of structured models of random matrices and properties of the corresponding random graphs and graph embeddings,(3) properties of stochastic dynamics for spin systems out of equilibrium, such as aging and the finite size scaling associated with their phase transitions.<br/><br/>This project is expected to yield new mathematical ideas and techniques that resolve challenging problems in probability theory, impact its interface with statistical physics, and provide insight to the analysis of typical behavior of large constraint satisfaction networks, thus advancing progress at the core of the NSF cyber-enabled discovery and innovation initiative.

A one-parameter family of random surfaces, called Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces, has emerged as a fruitful setting to study such structures. LQG originated from the study of 2D quantum gravity and string theory in theoretical physics. Subsequently, LQG has become an active and deep mathematical subject in probability. The research part of the project funded by this award aims to address outstanding challenges in the mathematical theory of LQG, thereby providing a firm foundation for several assumptions in theoretical physics. The educational part of the project aims to make high quality mathematical education and research more accessible, in particular, to students from underrepresented groups, researchers from geographically disadvantaged areas, and high school mathematics teachers.<br/><br/>Quantum gravity is the physics counterpart of random geometry. It is believed in physics that 2D quantum gravity coupled with conformal matter is described by LQG, governed by a conformal field theory (CFT) called Liouville CFT. The most intuitive formulation of 2D quantum gravity is through its microscopic description, namely random planar maps. The primary research goal of the project is to show that certain classical random planar map models converge to LQG in the scaling limit, laying a mathematical foundation for this physical picture. The two most challenging cases are when the random geometry is non-uniform or when the underlying surface is non-simply-connected. The project aims to address open questions in both cases. Besides the geometric aspect, the correlation functions of Liouville CFT possess deep algebraic structures, which are expected to be computed by a schematic program called the conformal bootstrap. Another major goal of the research is to rigorously establish the conformal bootstrap program for Liouville CFT. To achieve these goals, the PI will rely on the rich interplay between LQG and a family of random planar curves called the Schramm-Loewner evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This line of research will shed light on what type of behavior one can expect to see in a typical system. From the statistical perspective, the project focuses on the ``inverse problem,"" in which one would like to learn or draw inferences from observations of a (possibly unknown) dynamical system. More specifically, the project involves analyzing the performance of statistical inference methods when applied to observations of a dynamical system or group action. Results in this direction will provide theoretical guidance on when statistical procedures may be successfully applied in the context of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator uses these systems to model several biological phenomena. Many of these models have already been considered in  the mathematical biology and physics literature but very few rigorous results have been proved. So far most of the mathematical theory about interacting particle systems deals with monotone (or attractive) systems. When one deals with epidemics, monotonicity does not hold. To prove results for non-monotone systems is crucial since so many phenomena in our world are not monotone in any (mathematically ) useful way.   Interacting particle systems are very useful in studying epidemics. For instance, The investigator proposes the following model for the spread of an  epidemic. There is a grid of sites and each site is either empty, healthy or infected. Healthy and infected individuals give birth to healthy individuals on empty nearest neighbor sites. Healthy individuals get infected by infected nearest neighbors. Healthy and infected individuals die at different rates. This seems adequate for epidemics like the AIDS epidemic for which infected individuals may give birth to healthy individuals. One of the results proved by The investigator is that, given an infection rate which is large enough, the epidemic will persist if and only if the rate at which infected individuals give birth is high enough. While the model considered is a gross simplification of the real world it does give an interesting idea to test. Namely, is it true that the countries where the AIDS epidemic is the most devastating are the countries where the rate at which infected individuals give birth is the highest?"

The CLT approximation is a cornerstone of statistical inference, as it provides the theoretical underpinning of the vast majority of statistical methods for estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. It is also routinely used for uncertainty assessment across the sciences and in many industrial applications. Despite the immense popularity, most existing CLT results are unable to fully express mathematically the degree of complexity that is typical of modern, large datasets. In addition, they are inadequate for high-dimensional statistical modeling. As a result, reliance on classic CLT approximations to verify the validity of statistical procedures is no longer justifiable in high-dimensional settings. Instead, new, more refined CLT guarantees are in order. Recent breakthrough advances have led to the formulation of new high-dimensional CLTs (HDCLTs), whose validity holds but only under fairly restrictive assumptions. The broad goal of this project is to develop new HDCLT approximations that are applicable across a significantly wider range of conditions and settings and to elucidate their uses in high-dimensional statistical problems involving large and complex data.<br/><br/>The research components of this project include five main research aims: (1) to produce HDCLTs for independent observations under weak conditions that allow for heavy-tail data and singular covariances; (2) to derive new high-dimensional Edgeworth expansions; (3) to obtain new HDCLTs for sums of dependent random vectors and time series processes; (4) to study HDCLTs for high-dimensional random matrices, such as the sample covariance matrix, and their spectra; and (5) to deploy HDCLTs in multiple-testing problems targeting FDR and FWER control.

In his recent work, the PI has focused on the study of random polymer models, both in positive and zero temperature. The overarching theme was establishing energy-entropy duality, producing solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions, then using these solutions to describe the large-volume systems. The PI already constructed the Busemann functions in a variety of models and used them to analyze infinite geodesics (or Gibbs measures, in the positive temperature case), establish one-force one-solution principles, and study the stability and instability of the related dynamical systems. In this project, the PI will work on extending these results to a quite general setting that will cover zero and positive temperature, directed and undirected, discrete and continuous, as well as higher-dimensional models. The PI will also develop methods to use Busemann functions to study the regularity of the limiting shape function, prove localization, study the size of the polymer and shape fluctuations, and, for random walk in random environment, describe the structure of the Martin boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our work on probabilistic comparison inequalities, involving analytic and probabilistic techniques such as chaining, will help us understand the concentration of measure phenomena for random sums, with applications to the geometry of Banach spaces. Volume threshold phenomena of random polytopes in high dimensions have been established and satisfactorily understood only in the presence of a product structure or rotational symmetry. The lack of these two in our problems creates a need for new, more robust techniques and approaches.

Although some remarkable bijections to algebraic objects such as random matrices, Young diagrams and so on have led to a series of breakthroughs in the mathematical verification of some of the predictions, many of the current techniques  based on integrable probability are not sufficient by themselves to analyze some of the fundamental geometric properties of such systems. Continuing an ongoing program to couple the integrable approach with a primarily probabilistic and geometric perspective, the PI lays down a comprehensive  plan to investigate several aspects of such models which will fundamentally improve our understanding and initiate new research directions. The program also has a strong education component including mentoring graduate students and postdocs, and curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, aiming to create multiple advanced research topics courses, and design the probability content in foundational undergraduate courses. Various educational and dissemination strategies including workshop organizing, writing survey articles, teaching summer courses will be carried out as well.  <br/><br/>A canonical model of growth predicted to be in the KPZ universality class is the model of planar Last Passage Percolation (LPP) which puts random weights on the vertices of a planar lattice and considers paths between vertices which accrue maximum weights. Such maximal paths called geodesics are fundamental objects of study. Besides further developing the picture of coalescence of geodesics in LPP models, the project aims to study the entire energy landscape of paths and their associated weights, with a focus on the geometry of almost maximal paths or near geodesics.  The PI will also investigate  interlacing properties of geodesic watermelons (collections of disjoint paths with maximal cumulative weight) and their consequences with connections to various line ensembles and determinantal point processes, as well as large deviation behaviors of geodesics.

Particular topics include studying Hausdorff dimensions of  various endpoint pairs admitting exceptional geodesic behavior as well as computing exponents marking the onset of chaos in natural dynamical versions of LPP.

While one can try to directly model such systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.<br/><br/>Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems, observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model, Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur / Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently, these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately. The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena."

It   deals with optimal control of diffusion processes by means of a free   boundary as well as optimal control at a reflection boundary of the   stochastic process.  This type of control naturally appears in the problems in   which there is no natural restriction on the rates of control and the optimal   control rates are infinite. (This type of control model serves also as a good   approximation for the situations when the rates are bounded but very large.)    The optimal policy is then to reflect the process from an a priori unknown   boundary. Natural models where such type of action arises are related to the    problems with additive input, where there are no a priori limits on the   control rates or as an approximation for the problems with optimal policy of   a ""bang-bang"" type. The proposed research consists of developing the   theory of the related PDE with gradient constraints, studying optimal   reflecting barriers in multidimensional cases, and applying the results to   different mechanical, manufacturing and financial models.    This research should provide a sound theoretical base for developing   optimal control algorithms for an automatic cruise control of a missile    subject to uncertain wind conditions or a space vehicle subject to small   perturbations in mechanical units. The developed technique will enable one   to calculate the position when the maximal correction force should be   applied as well as the optimal direction of this force. At the ""ground level""   this theory will give a tool to derive optimal inventory levels for complex   flexible manufacturing systems as well as optimal timings for changes in   the  manufacturing processes. In the financial world this theory will provide   a method for finding optimal levels of funds for financial companies whose   assets are subject to random fluctuations. For example, in the case of a large   insurance company whose liquid assets  are constantly fluctuating due to   uncertainty in the times and amounts of incoming claims, it will be  possible   to calculate the optimal level of the reserve which should be maintained in   order to have the optimal balance between the risk and profit potential."

One aspect of this project refines the analysis to study the related odd covering problem.  Techniques used in analytic number theory can be employed to study models in statistical physics that are governed by Markov chains.  Often these techniques give rigorous proofs of phenomena observed in computer models, and sometimes the rigorous analysis uncovers errors from model predictions that result from a limited model size.  The project aims to extend recent strong estimates on the spectral expansion of the shape of cubic fields to similar spectral estimates for the shapes of quartic and quintic fields.<br/><br/>The solution of the minimum modulus problem combines the method of moments with techniques from probabilistic combinatorics, including the Lovasz local lemma and the use of pseudo-random measures.  In developing quantitative results regarding covering systems, this project will apply structural decomposition techniques currently in use in additive combinatorics.  Oscillatory integrals, the method of stationary phase, and van der Corput's method are used frequently in analytic number theory to obtain sharp estimates.  These techniques are often useful also in the asymptotic analysis of the mixing time of Markov chains, and will be employed in continued work on analysis of the two-dimensional abelian sandpile model and a new local limit theorem on nilpotent groups."

Study of various spatial and non-spatial random graph models, stochastic spatial models, and stochastic processes taking place on random graphs, and network-based algorithms are key to these efforts. Although these problems have received significant attention in the literature, rigorous analysis and foundational work is needed in many areas to have reliable results and to cope with upcoming challenges and the complexity of real-world data. This research addresses several theoretical and some empirical challenges involving a wide class of questions arising in physics, social sciences, and biosciences. Specific research areas that would benefit from this research include determining functional connectivity within neural networks in brains, pandemic management, pest control strategies, and the evolution of social interactions. This research will provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinning of the underlying complex structures and associated covariates on different social and biological phenomena which are the central objective of research in many disciplines. This analysis will help scientists to understand experimental and observational data in biosciences and social sciences and develop suitable control strategies.  Community detection for temporal networks would enhance the understanding of brain function across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The proposed work also has significant potential to increase our capacity to develop efficient and cost-effective intervention strategies to mitigate some of the most potentially damaging and fastest-spreading invasive epidemics of humans, livestock, and plants (including wheat, soybean, citrus, and hop).  To guarantee that the results are relevant to scientists, parts of the project will be carried out in collaboration with scientists of different fields. Presentations on the relevant research will be given in stakeholder meetings and community outreach events. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research activities at the intersection of mathematics and other disciplines. Opportunities to learn theoretical and empirical analysis of various probabilistic models, and interactions with scientists will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and various related areas. <br/> <br/>One of the primary goals of this project is to understand and analyze different structural properties and limiting behavior of various spatial and non-spatial random graph models, and several stochastic dynamics taking place on graphs. The random graph models include open clusters of percolation and related models, multi-layer, and temporal network models. Percolation models originated in the physics literature as a model for a porous medium. There are many useful tools and a well-developed theory for studying the percolation models on two-dimensional lattices. However, for higher dimensional lattices, several key aspects, including the near-critical regime and the behavior of the model in subgraphs such as sectors, are poorly understood. This project will address some of these issues. Multi-layer networks are natural models for numerous datasets arising in various scientific fields, including genomics, biomedical sciences, neuroscience, economics, sociology, ecology, epidemiology, and technological networks. Depending on the context, various parametric probabilistic models have been used for the formation of multi-layer, multiplex, and temporal networks. For the estimation of those parameters from data, and for model selection purposes, it is very important to understand the behavior of some key functionals (e.g., subgraph counts or the concentration of aggregated adjacency matrices). These functionals will be analyzed for a wide variety of temporal network models, particularly where the snapshots have some correlation structure. The stochastic dynamics include some important variants of the standard models for infection spreading and opinion evolution in presence of additional restrictions (e.g., temporary isolation). The project also includes studying several theoretical and empirical aspects (e.g., bounds for detectability threshold, efficient detection algorithms) of various detection problems, which includes detection of anomalous structures, community detection from a correlated sequence of networks, detection of the source of the epidemic. The rigorous analyses of the models discussed above will require the development of novel mathematical techniques and research tools.

This is currently an active research area in contemporary probability theory and has important connections to statistical physics. Part of the workshop will be devoted to training graduate students and early career researchers in those topics. This award will provide travel support for the US based participants in the workshop.<br/><br/><br/>In two dimensions, FPP is a model that is conjecturally in the KPZ universality class, which consists of several models describing surface growth processes. Models in the KPZ class are intimately related with random matrix theory, asymptotic representation theory and number theory. FPP and related models have also been studied by physicists as a model for polymers in a random medium or as model of magnetic interfaces, and by biologists as the Eden model of bacterial growth. Much progress has been made on a class of these relatives which are in some senses ""exactly solvable"" by the methods of integrable probability. However, even at the physics level of heuristic, these models are poorly understood outside of solvable special cases; for instance, there are hardly any results for dimensions larger than 2. Unlike other conferences on FPP-type models, the ICTS workshop will emphasize methods outside of the integrable or exactly solvable framework. By focusing on techniques beyond exact solvability, the workshop will unify participants around solving fundamental problems of interest to the broader scientific community.

The random projection of high-dimensional data is a simple and computationally efficient technique to reduce the dimensionality of a data set by trading a controlled amount of error for faster processing times and smaller model sizes.  While several properties of random projections have been studied, the question of what random projections do to outliers in the data, which appear in the tails of the data distribution, is not well understood.   This project is to rigorously characterize the tails of random projections of high-dimensional distributions. Understanding such tail behavior will also provide insight into how to distinguish between high-dimensional distributions by looking at their lower-dimensional projections.  This has potential applications in a variety of fields including computer science, data analysis, statistics, and convex geometry.  Another set of data analysis techniques used for data classification include spectral clustering and correlation clustering. Both these techniques are related to certain operator norms of associated matrices. This project will characterize the asymptotics of operator norms, in the limit of high dimensions, and study potential applications to the stability of numerical methods (for example, matrix condition number estimation) as well as clustering problems.  The project has a strong educational component, with provisions for math outreach, research training of graduate students, and development of new courses.<br/><br/>The project has two themes.  The first theme relates to the study of large deviations or the tail behavior of random projections of high-dimensional measures.  These are of interest in high-dimensional statistics and probability, as well as asymptotic convex geometry, where the object of interest is the volume or surface measure of a convex body in high dimensions.  While fluctuations of random projections have been well studied, culminating in the celebrated central limit theorem for convex sets, large deviations or tail probabilities of random projections are less well understood.  A goal of the project is to establish large deviations principles, both averaged over the direction of projection (the annealed setting) and conditioned on the direction of projection, as well as sharp large deviation estimates, and understand their ramifications for high-dimensional statistics and asymptotic convex geometry.  The second theme relates to the study of the asymptotics of operator norms for high-dimensional random matrices, which are relevant in a variety of contexts, including optimization theory, theoretical computer science and functional analysis, with applications to machine learning and data analysis.   While the two-to-two norm, which coincides with the singular value, has been well studied, the focus will be to study more general r-to-p norms, where spectral theory can no longer be used and thus will require the development of fundamentally new techniques, involving a combination of tools from algebra, analysis and probability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SOC has been used to explain commonalities between such apparently dissimilar phenomena as solar flares and neuron firing. Many of the most successful approaches to problems in these areas are valid only in certain special cases; for instance, certain two-dimensional percolative models with particular symmetry properties. A main goal of the project is the development of robust mathematical techniques which explain the behavior of such systems -- for instance, how smooth is the surface of a spreading drop of fluid -- in a broad range of physically interesting cases.<br/><br/>The specific research problems to be studied include the following. In critical Bernoulli percolation (where one randomly removes just enough edges to make an infinite graph finite), the PI will study scaling limits of graph components and give sharp asymptotics for graph distances and electrical resistances. In first-passage percolation (where one randomly perturbs edge lengths in a graph), the PI will study fluctuations of graph distances and the tortuosity of long geodesics. In the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model (an interacting particle system), the PI will study the correlation between particle movements at different moments of time. Some related problems have previously seemed more tractable in special settings like certain ""solvable"" growth models or in certain dimensions.

This construction, motivated by a purely probabilistic approach to the problem, has the potential to achieve the best possible overall rate of such approximations. In statistics, the investigator studies three different and unrelated groups of problems. One of these is concerned with the overall asymptotic normality, at the best possible rate of convergence, of certain least squares estimators for the exponent of a regularly varying tail of a distribution function, by means of the quantile-transformation method. The second is the exploration of universal large-sample Gaussian approximations to cumulative-hazard and product-limit processes under random censorship without any conditions on the estimated distribution or the censoring mechanism, where the investigator uses a combination of strong-approximation and martingale-theoretic analyses. The third group of problems is concerned with rounding off a recent theory of nonparametric curve estimation under short- and long-range dependent Gaussian subordination by answering the outstanding questions for random-design regression.   The investigator's Probability project studies an approximation to sums of independent observations, which, unlike the usual approximations in terms of bell-shaped curves-- responsible only for the middle portions of the data -- attempts to incorporate the effects of the extremes as well. In Statistics, the investigator is studying three different groups of problems. The first one is concerned with the robust estimation of measures of ""thickness of the tails"" of data sets. This problem is important in various applied statistical and actuarial situations, such as the assessment of the variability of stock-price changes and the distribution of large claims in insuran ce business, particularly in bankruptcy re-insurance. The second group of statistical problems is to investigate the basic large-sample behavior of estimation when the observed data are incomplete due to the presence of nuisance effects and/or the necessity of an early termination of data collection; situations commonly referred to as random censorship. Here the investigator's anticipated results aim at greatly stretching the limits of concrete applicability of statistical estimation techniques for survival analyses with randomly censored data. These are of great interest in medical follow-up studies and reliability engineering. In the third group of problems in Statistics, the investigator extends his recent theory to cover all major curve-estimation patterns (density estimation, fixed-design and random-design regression) with long-memory data sets. The complete theory will explore the basic distributional properties of commonly used curve-estimation methods in time series analysis when the observations may be long-range dependent, as in many typical applied problems in geophysics and hydrology."

The proposed activity aims at investigating the evolution of systems with complex interactions, such as particles moving in a disordered environment, cars navigating their way through traffic, the surface of a growing crystal, or the boundary of an infected tissue. Complexity is captured by the randomness in the model, both in the environment in which the particles interact or the crystal grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim of the project is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To have a very simple example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of Heads in a large number of tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of getting Heads in one toss. (The mathematical law behind this basic phenomenon is known as the Law of Large Numbers.) Besides its impact on probability theory and mathematics in general, the proposed activity is expected to have a direct impact on the understanding of many physical systems involving random motion in random or disordered media. Understanding complex interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for society.<br/><br/>The proposed activity is on the subject of random motion in random media. Models in this field have been intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers. Their importance arises from rigorous mathematical connections to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, and the KPZ universality class. The PI has already established energy-entropy duality and produced solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions. In particular, the PI proved almost sure existence of Busemann functions for the growth model with general weight distribution. The PI will work on generalizing this existence result to positive temperature polymers, random walk in random environment, higher dimensional models, and to the continuum setting of the stochastic heat equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3. <br/>Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.<br/><br/>Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component."

This project supports fundamental research into mathematical models of this type, both in the two dimensional settings which have been the focus of much recent work and in higher dimensions where much less is known.

This class of models is broad. On the lattice, it includes first passage percolation and directed last passage percolation, directed polymers in random media, as well as random walks in both static and dynamic random environments, with general admissible steps. Continuum models like the continuum directed polymer and the associated stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise will also be considered. The main goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the infinite volume structure of such models through specific examples and to work toward a unified treatment of that structure in the greatest generality that can be achieved.  Concretely, the main goal of the project will be to characterize the existence and uniqueness properties of semi-infinite and bi-infinite volume measures (respectively geodesics). The work will also consider related problems, including investigating how infinite volume measures relate to the regularity properties of the limiting free energy (respectively shape function), developing computational tools in exactly solvable models and on understanding the structure of the environment viewed from the perspective of paths drawn from the infinite volume measure (respectively a geodesic).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many networks evolve and grow over time and this leaves a mark on their underlying structure. The broad goal of this project is to understand how the growth of a network interacts with other underlying structures such as community structure. The project focuses on a mathematical understanding of fundamental network models that are common to many applications. Developing such a mathematical theory can lead to fundamental insights that can be applied across multiple disciplines, as well as to connections between disciplines that can lead to further cross-disciplinary explorations. <br/><br/>This project studies a wide range of problems involving probabilistic models of dynamic networks. The project aims to build novel probabilistic theory to analyze and provide insight into such models, as well as to build and analyze novel models that shed light on new phenomena. A main focus is on models of growing networks, which are abundant in the social sciences, economics, and biology. In particular, the project will investigate the influence of the seed graph in growing random graph models. In doing so, the award will develop novel probabilistic tools to obtain quantitative results on the limits of branching processes, which are of independent interest more widely in probability theory and related fields. A second theme of the project will be the study of community detection in growing networks by introducing probabilistic models of growing networks with community structure. This perspective lends itself to relevant new questions, such as detecting communities from networks observed at multiple time points. Finally, the award will also study stochastic processes on networks, resulting in enhanced understanding of how information spreads on networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the age of large data, classical probability theory does not offer sufficient tools for current applications in large data. One of the most basic objects in data analysis is large random matrices representing data and noise. The statistics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices essentially determine the real information contained in the data matrices. In this work, we aim to develop tools in understanding the eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics of the large class of random matrices. Besides data matrices, the research also investigates the spectral properties of the associated matrices of large random graphs. In order to enhance the exchange of ideas among different groups of researchers, we have been running seminars jointly with the Statistics and Computer Science departments at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications at Harvard University. We also co-organize the Charles River Lectures in Probability (jointly with MIT and Microsoft Research), the Current Development in Mathematics conference (jointly with MIT), and the CMSA's annual conference on Big Data. These programs will bring researchers from probability theory, statistics, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and computer science to work together. We are actively formulating mathematical questions that are interesting to statisticians and computer scientists. It is clear that the analysis of large random matrices is of great interest to these scientists and we expect fruitful results from these collaborations. <br/><br/>This research aims to extend random matrix statistics to large classes of matrix models, including band matrices, adjacency matrices of sparse random graphs, and heavy-tailed random matrices. Our goal is to understand to what extent random matrix statistics, in particular the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, can be shown to hold independent of the matrix law. Our work is driven by the grand vision of E. Wigner, asserting that random matrix statistics are universal laws for systems of high complexity. More precisely, we choose the following five projects: 1. Delocalization and universality of band matrices. 2. Quantum unique ergodicity and data analysis. 3. Edge statistics of sparse random graphs. 4. Levy matrices and heavy-tailed random matrices. 5. Spin glass dynamics on hypercubes. The first project aims to extend the current random matrix theory to non mean-field models since most basic physics laws are short-ranged and thus far from the mean field type. Project 1 concerning non mean-field band matrices is in our view one of the most important questions regarding <br/>Wigner's original vision. Projects 2 and 3 concern edge statistics of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of random sparse graphs. Due to a Gaussian to Tracy-Widom transition in the edge statistics for the Erdos-Renyi graphs, we expect this project to clarify the role of sparsity in random graphs. In addition, our understanding of eigenvector statistics will have applications in restricted minimum singular value problems and signal recovery algorithms. Project 4 aims to classify the phase diagrams of heavy-tailed random matrices according to their spectral statistics. The last project aims to develop methods to prove spectral gaps and logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the Glauber dynamics of spin glasses on hypercubes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such processes can be good models for the dynamics of real-world phenomenon, like the spread of a disease in a network, the evolution of social networks such as facebook or twitter, or phase transitions in materials.  We are particularly interested in the solution of challenging computational problems in the context of random structures, and this work will hopefully be useful in drawing back the shadow of the negative results of complexity theory.<br/><br/><br/>The study of random combinatorial structures has emerged as an important component of Discrete Mathematics.  This research project focuses on various structural properties of random graphs and hypergraphs. One area of emphasis is the study of the existence of Hamilton cycles in various sparse random graph models. It is natural to conjecture that any suitably random model that ensures that a graph has minimum degree 3 will have a Hamilton cycle with high probability.  While this has been established in a few setting, a number of very natural open questions remain, and the development of a unified theory of Hamiltonicity of sparse random graphs is a long range goal of this research.  This project also includes the study of algorithmic questions.  For example, we will put significant effort into the study of Cuckoo hashing.  Here the main question is whether or not the insertion of a new item into the hash table takes constant expected time. Our approach here will be to show that an associated graph has a fast mixing time, applying the theory of mixing times for Markov chains."

This conference represents the Annual International Meeting of the Association of Quantum Probability and Infinite Dimensional Analysis (AQPIDA). It will be the first Quantum Probability Meeting organized in the United States. AQPIDA was established with the intention of promoting the area of Quantum Probability, a mathematical field started by the efforts of John von Neumann, almost simultaneously as Classic Probability was founded by Andrey Kolmogorov. The development of Classic Probability was very fast, but the progress in Quantum Probability was much slower. In the last two decades, great advancement was made in Quantum Probability, specially by mathematicians from Italy, Japan, Korea, and Poland. Our main objective, for organizing this meeting in the United States, is to promote Quantum  Probability among the American mathematicians and scientists. This conference will also give the opportunity to mathematicians working in Classic and Quantum Probability to come together, discuss problems that are of common interest for both groups of people, and eliminate the artificial barriers that separate the two fields. Among the invited people, there are also several physicists, and this will contribute to the refreshing of the traditional collaboration that existed in the past among mathematicians and physicists. <br/><br/>Strict mathematical objectives  include: codifying properties of probability measures, having finite moments of all orders, in terms of their quantum operators: creation, annihilation, and preservation operators, understanding how the commutation relationships that exist among the quantum operators can lead to new physical interpretations about interacting systems, making progress in understanding the quantum Markov chains or fields, understanding how the commutation relationships among the quantum operators affect the kernels of second quantization operators and Wick products, using the kernels to prove sharp inequalities about the norms of Wick products and hypercontractivity inequalities involving the second quantization operators, making progress in understanding the connections of instantons with the ``exotic Laplacians"" (higher order Levy Laplacians), making progress in the development of the theory of quantum Markov semi-groups and of their generators, making progress in the study of quantum networks, and making progress toward building a reliable quantum computer. <br/><br/>The web-site of the conference is the following: https://osumarion.osu.edu/events/icqp.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, we will study new mathematical problems which are important for applications, as well as new effects in classical problems. The treatment of these problems for systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom is a relatively new field of investigation, which has already stirred up a vivid interest in many fields, also because these are very complex objects and any effort that goes in the direction of their simplification is important for a deeper understanding of the main features of the models and for a better effectiveness in applications.

As a matter of fact, small perturbations, which are negligible on one time scale, can become crucial on a larger time scale. The long-time influence of small perturbations has been considered in a number of our previous papers, and the present project has to be  considered as a continuation of this program. Limit theorems, especially the large deviation theory, the averaging principle and the interplay between them, as well as several generalizations of the Smoluchowskii-Kramers approximation are our main tools. Systems with many/infinite degrees of freedom often have perturbations of different origin  and different order. Long-time behavior of such perturbed systems should be described by a hierarchy of approximations. On the other hand, long-time behavior of pure deterministic systems with instabilities, under certain conditions, should be described by a stochastic process. Therefore, the natural generality for the problem is in considering both deterministic and stochastic perturbations of stochastic systems (not necessarily deterministic dynamical systems)."

The limiting processes will be described explicitly in terms of the distribution of the force field. We shall also study measures carried by random velocity fields and describe their limiting behavior as time tends to infinity. Another set of problems concerns random perturbations of Hamiltonian flows. We shall strive to obtain a description of the effective behavior of randomly perturbed Hamiltonian flows on compact symplectic manifolds. A separate part of the proposal is devoted to an inverse problem for Gibbs fields. We shall prove that there always exist Gibbs fields with prescribed correlation functions, provided that the correlation functions satisfy certain consistency conditions.    <br/><br/>Most of the proposed problems naturally arise in the study of various phenomena in physics, oceanography, theory of turbulence, and statistical mechanics. Consider, for example, a particle moving in a force field, such as a charged particle in an electro-magnetic field.

The main assumption is that the time at which the particle is observed is much larger than the typical size of the force field. We shall also study the transport properties of random flows. One could think of a pollutant carried by atmospheric currents as a physical model for this type of problems. Based on the probabilistic properties of the flow, one wishes to describe the long time behavior of the substance carried by it. Many results in this direction have been obtained be several groups of researchers under various simplifying assumptions, such as the periodicity of the flow.

The general approach to metastability and stochastic resonance in the framework of large deviations was developed in our previous papers. In the case of multiscale systems these notions should be modified. In particular, new effects appear in systems which are close to Hamiltonian and in systems with a small delay. Another class consists of new problems for PDE's with a small parameter and related stochastic processes. To describe the limiting behavior in these classical problems one should consider equations on graphs or open book spaces related to the original problam. Reaction-Diffusion-Advection equations in incompressible fluids, in strongly unisotropic media, and in narrow tubes will be considered.

This is the case for a large class of systems in condensed matter physics, data science, finance, computer science, and pure mathematics. The behavior of such complex systems depends crucially on rare events, or extrema, that may have a large impact on their dynamics. This project is a rigorous study of the fundamental patterns that arise in a wide range of complex systems exhibiting many different extrema. The aim is to develop general quantitative methods to understand the statistics of extrema of these systems and to draw new connections with related problems in mathematics and physics. It also involves the advanced training of students in the applications of probability in data science, finance, and computer science in partnership with practitioners in academia and in industry. <br/><br/>More precisely, complex systems can be viewed as stochastic processes with strongly correlated random variables. The statistics of extrema of such processes are still poorly understood from a rigorous point of view. Important examples include disordered systems in statistical mechanics (e.g., spin glasses), which are closely related to optimization problems in computer and data sciences. The focus of the project is on developing new probability methods in two instances: realistic spin glasses in statistical mechanics and the Riemann zeta function in number theory. In particular, it builds on recent progress in the description of infinite-dimensional models of spin glasses to propose a new rigorous method to investigate the behavior of realistic (finite-dimensional) spin glasses, which exhibit unusual magnetic behavior due to the presence of many extremal energies. The program also outlines new directions of research in pure mathematics by studying the Riemann zeta function as a disordered system. The objectives are to develop methods of statistical mechanics to study the extreme values of the Riemann zeta function in a short interval of the critical strip, and to explore the implications in number theory."

Such systems can be used to describe chemical reactions, as well as the spread of disease, information, and species through a network. These models often become more meaningful when multiple particle types are incorporated. For example, the celebrated First Passage Percolation model describes the spread of a single species through an environment; the incorporation of competing species enriches the model. This project seeks to study more realistic variants of well-known models for chemical reactions, epidemic outbreaks, and the spread of information as to deepen our understanding of important phenomena from across the sciences and further develop the mathematics that helps explain them. The project will involve the undergraduate students training.<br/><br/>This project will consider five different stochastic multi-type interacting particle systems: (1) The Diffusion-Limited Annihilation model is an annihilating particle system in which collisions between opposite type particles result in mutual annihilation. The version in which particles have different speeds is difficult to study and conjectured to exhibit anomalous behavior when different particle types are initially balanced. (2) The Ballistic Annihilation model has three particle types and all collisions result in annihilation. The limiting particle density in different regimes will be characterized. (3) The Chase-Escape model is a competitive stochastic growth model conjectured to have a coexistence phase even when the predatory species is fitter than the prey. The effect of the environment and fitness of the different species on coexistence will be investigated. (4) The A+B->2A model describes a growing system of infected particles. This process was recently generalized to the continuum, which leads to several new questions at the intersection of discrete and continuous probability, which will be addressed. (5) Lastly, the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model is well-understood on random graphs near the critical connectivity threshold. A natural extension is to have susceptible individuals rewire their connections away from infected individuals. This more realistic modification may change the size of epidemics.

The occurrence of different cell types in different parts of a tumor, the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor, can lead to failure of therapy that is directed only against one type of cancer cell. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity is associated with a worse prognosis in many cancer types, and the spatial distribution of nutrients and oxygen can favor the development of more aggressive tumor cell populations. By analyzing spatial cancer models, this research will provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of intra-tumor heterogeneity in solid tumors, and into the role of cellular mobility in shaping tumor phenotypes with poor prognosis. To guarantee that the results are relevant to treatment, the project will be carried out in collaboration with physicians and a cancer biologist. The involvement of graduate students in this research will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and biology. <br/><br/>This project addresses critical challenges in the quest for more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches in the fight against cancer. Complex agent-based models have often been employed to investigate the impact of space on cancer evolution. However, even if a simulation successfully reproduces observed phenomena, it does not mean that the true underlying mechanism has been found. For this project the investigators plan to extend prior work on spatial Moran models by adding new features to the basic model. To further reduce the gap between analytically tractable and complex computational models, the behavior of the new systems will be analyzed mathematically. The biological questions to be addressed by the project are motivated by recent experimental findings, including studies of the impact of cancer cell migration on solid tumor growth and elucidation of the role of cancer stem cells in driving cancer evolution. Mathematical models that can include genomic data will be used to study genealogies and intra-tumor heterogeneity in colon cancer. Rigorous results for hybrid models that describe tumor-microenvironment interactions will also be derived. More generally, the rigorous analyses of the models will require the development of novel mathematical techniques that will contribute to a deeper understanding of spatial stochastic systems and the behavior of genealogies in an expanding population."

In the second topic one interesting mathematical problem concerns ""explosive percolation"" conjectured to have a discontinuous transition, while the more biologically important question concerns how the outcomes of epidemics and ecological competitions change when they take place on random graphs, which arguably provide better models of the real social networks. The third topic concern situations in which the characteristics of individuals in ecological competitions are also not static but evolve in response to their environment. My first steps in the area ""adaptive dynamics"" were taken in a study of predator-prey systems with John Mayberry. Here, we propose to study more complex examples that lead to evolutionary cycling and a second problem on the evolution of virulence, which leads to consideration of the role of spatial structure in increasing the virulence of diseases.<br/><br/>Many interesting mathematical questions arise from biology. Here we address some questions that arise from ecology and evolution. Three examples should illustrate the nature of our work. (1) At the turn of the century, observations of social networks revealed that we live in a small world in which everyone on the planet is separated by six degrees of separation. Now we need to understand how this geometry of social networks effects the spread of epidemics and the other biological and social processes. (2) The world shows much more biodiversity than mathematical models predict, so it is important to understand the mechanisms which allow for species coexistence. More generally, we will also be interested in how spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological competition. (3) In most situations the characteristics of individuals involved in competition with other species or with infectious agents are not static but evolve in time. <br/>For example, in most cases diseases evolve to be less virulent, but in a spatially structured population the opposite may occur.

Convex geometry is the bedrock for studying isoperimetric principles, laws that govern fundamental relationships between shapes and their size. The most famous such example is the classical isoperimetric inequality asserting that among all shapes of a given perimeter, circles enclose the largest area. Such principles underlie a wealth of extremal problems, e.g., in mathematical physics, information theory, optimization, among others. The PI and his coauthors have shown that global geometric features can be consequences of local random structure; his probabilistic tools reveal new and more quantitative information than is apparent from the standard principles. Conversely, the geometry of the underlying shapes can have implications in probability. This arises, for example, by replacing independence conditions by broader dependence structures, thereby making probabilistic results more broadly applicable. A major goal of the research is to use geometric considerations such as the presence of many symmetries as a guide for the replacement of independence. In a closely related direction, in applied sciences the ""curse of dimensionality"" refers to the notion that increasing a system's dimension comes with an unwieldy increase in complexity. On the other hand, a distinguishing feature of modern probability and convex geometry is that increasing the dimension brings unexpected benefits: patterns must arise simply by virtue of high-dimensionality. Mathematically, this is referred to as the ""concentration of measure phenomenon"" and it is fundamental in dealing effectively with large data sets, compression of signals, reducing complexity of algorithms, to name a few. The PI and co-PI will develop new tools to give considerably more accurate information on refined asymptotic scales, which are especially needed for applications. Here, as above, isoperimetric principles guide the development of the theory. The PI and co-PI will teach graduate courses on these topics, which will serve as excellent venues for engaging students in current research. Such courses may be of interest to students in computer science, statistics, or engineering whose research depends vitally on mathematics.<br/><br/>The project centers on concentration properties of high-dimensional probability laws, particularly for marginal laws due to their connection to small deviation inequalities and non-asymptotic random matrix theory. Using affine isoperimetric principles, the PIs will investigate criteria for well-boundedness of marginal distributions, especially under non-independence regularity assumptions such as affine invariance properties. They will also study concentration properties of norms on high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, building on the co-PI's refinements of Milman's random version of Dvoretzky's theorem for some classical normed spaces, circumvent the standard approach via Lipschitz constants by using super-concentration techniques and other refined tools. The PI and co-PI will extend the study of concentration of functionals to the multi-dimensional setting of Grassmannian manifold of linear subspaces of Euclidean space. This is a natural unified setting for the various problems above: marginals of probability distributions, the asymptotic theory of convex bodies, stochastic geometry and randomized isoperimetric inequalities. Consequently, a better understanding of the associated randomness on the Grassmannian will have diverse applications."

LDT is concerned with estimating the probabilities of rare events, and understanding the mechanisms by which these events arise. One of the main focuses of the project is on rare events for random networks. Random networks are large collections of nodes (or individuals) where pairs of nodes are connected at random. The  project aims to describe the large-scale structure of random networks with an atypical number of instances of some small-scale pattern, such as three mutual friends. Such an understanding would have implications for statistical estimation of the structure of large social networks. The second aim of the project concerns extreme values for logarithmically correlated fields (LCFs), which arise in problems ranging from analytic number theory to mathematical ecology. The project aims to advance the understanding of universal and non-universal aspects of LCFs in the context of random matrices and reaction-diffusion systems. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/> <br/>The problems concerning LDT focus on questions about nonlinear functions of random hypergraphs and random matrices. The project will further develop a recent approach to LDT for random hypergraphs based on tensor decompositions, with connections to the regularity method in extremal graph theory and the mean-field approximation in statistical physics, and with applications to the study of Gibbs measures used to model social networks. In the context of random matrices, the project will further advance a recent approach to large deviations of extremal eigenvalues through the analysis of spherical integrals, in order to address models with general entry distributions, including sparse models. The project on extreme values for LCFs aims to develop flexible tools to study a broad class of models in random matrix theory, where the strongest results to date are confined to classical ensembles with smooth symmetries. In a different direction, the project will extend a probabilistic approach to the study of reaction-diffusion equations in order to study coupled systems of partial differential equations in higher dimensions with boundary interactions, with particular attention to systems used to model the propagation of invasive species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stochastic spatial models are important for applications, so it is important to develop methods to understand their qualitative behavior. For many systems like the contact process, which is a simple model of the spread and competition of species, the nontrivial stationary distribution is unique and its density is a continuous function of its parameters. The research carried out in this project will investigate some systems that are exceptions to this rule. The PI's work on nonlinear voter models seeks to produce examples that can be rigorously shown to have two nontrivial translation invariant equilibrium states. The PI has recently shown that a susceptible-infected epidemics in which individuals drop connections to infected individuals can have a discontinuous phase transition. One of the goals is to extend this to the more realistic SIR model. In the other direction there is a process called explosive percolation that was conjectured in 2009 based on simulation to have a discontinuous transition, but one year later a rigorous mathematical proof showed that this system and a number of similar systems have continuous phase transitions. One of the goals of this project will seek to prove qualitative results about the phase transition in the explosive percolation model. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Work will be carried out on four challenging and long-studied problems in probability. For brevity only three are mentioned here: (i) Explosive percolation occurs on a dynamically grown random graph in which m potential new edges are chosen on each step but only is chosen to be added. Achlioptas, D?Souza and Spencer claimed in 2009 that these models could have discontinuous transitions, but one year later Riordan and Warnke showed that for a broad class of rules the transition is continuous. One of the goals of this project is to extend their results to other systems and to obtain more detailed information about the phase transition. (ii) In many cases the existence of stationary distributions for a stochastic spatial model has been proved by showing that the particle systems converge to reaction diffusion equations with positive wave speed. Recently Huang and Durrett have shown that several particle systems that converge to reaction-diffusion equations with zero wave speeds converge to motion by mean curvature as time is further sped-up. This opens up the possibility of proving the existence of discontinuous phase transitions. (iii) Durrett and Yao have recently given an almost necessary and sufficient condition for a discontinuous phase transition in the SI model on an evolving configuration model graph. One of the aims of this project is to extend this result to more realistic SIR and SIS epidemics. The latter question is a long standing open problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inclusion of random effects can serve a number of distinct purposes. On one hand, randomness can be used to compensate for elements of a system not fully modeled or for insufficiently resolved scales in the system. This research proposal concentrates on the analysis of how randomness spreads through large dimensional, extended dynamical systems.  One of the central questions is how passing through many nonlinear interactions or scales shapes the randomness. Stochastically forced partial differential equations (SPDEs) such as stochastic fluid equations or stochastically forced reaction diffusion equations will be a focus of the proposed work. These systems are often agitated at one scale and it is of both mathematical and modeling interest to understand the effect of this agitation at other scales. In particular, this proposal hopes to shed light on the transfer of randomness between different scales in turbulent fluid flow. In addition to SPDEs, the proposal will study related questions in large chemical networks arising in cell regulation and nutrient flow in forest environments. The emphasis will be on the pathwise dynamics, novel stochastic numerical methods, and estimation problems.<br/><br/>Quantifying and modeling uncertainty is increasingly important in our attempts to understand and predict our complex and changing world.  From the financial markets, to weather prediction, to environmental engendering, to neuroscience, to aeronautics, models including random influences have become central to the physical sciences, to the social sciences and to engineering.  Of particular significance is understanding how pure randomness is shaped into the structures we observe, especially when the randomness is transferred across disparate spatial scales. This understanding is the key to producing effective models with which to predict complex real systems. This proposal specifically addresses questions central to turbulent water flow and complicated biochemical pathways in cells. More broadly, applied mathematicians are on the leading edge of<br/>our scientific and technological future.  Because of their broad training, they are the best equipped to move into new, non-traditional fields as they appear, build the bridges between classical disciplines, and disseminate the understanding gained in purer mathematical studies to larger scientific and social endeavors. America's leadership in science and technology requires us<br/>to continue producing world-class researchers and students in applied mathematics. This proposal includes an undergraduate research component to encourage interested students to choose a science-related career. It includes outreach to local high schools to expose students at an earlier age to modern mathematics and the myriad of career possibilities it presents.<br/>"

The significant interaction between these areas has recently begun with ""applied"" algebraic topology, finding a wide range of applications in sensor networks, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, manifold learning, linguistics, and cosmology. This is due to the fact that many of the data set handled by applied topologists are based on a random sample from a larger population or contain different types of errors. Failure to capture the stochastic nature of topological data can result in a serious misunderstanding of the topology of the system. For example, the layer of extraneous topologies triggered by heavy-tailed errors, as a phenomena analogous to that of audio crackle in temporal signal analysis, will make it very hard to recover an underlying topology of the system. Another example includes topology on non-Euclidean spaces, especially those negatively curved. One good motivation for this study lies in its tree-like structure as a result of negative curvature. By virtue of this structure, the resulting non-Euclidean model can potentially be employed for analyses of various complex networks in physics, computer science, and cosmology. Combining topological concepts with the notion of randomness, this projects aims to properly understand random topology of the system. <br/> <br/>This project addresses research questions on random algebraic topology. Despite its recent development, most of the studies on random algebraic topology do not pay sufficient attentions to how heaviness or lightness of the tail of probability distributions affects the topology. One of the main focuses is on topological crackle - the layered structure of topological elements, typically caused by a heavy-tailed distribution. Although topological crackle has been recognized, at least empirically, in the statistical manifold learning, this project investigates it thoroughly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In light of the involvement of heavy-tailed distributions, extreme value theory (EVT) will be selected as a main tool for this study. Relying on EVT, the PI aims to establish a theoretical foundation for a graphical descriptor of the birth and death of topological cycles, called persistence diagram. One of the main focuses is on the random configuration of points in the persistence diagram by regarding them as a random closed set and discussing their asymptotics in terms of the Fell topology. As the second main topic, the project attempts to investigate random topology on the negatively curved non-Euclidean space. The PI mainly deals with a theoretical question: How do the parameters of the hyperbolic space, including its negative curvature, characterize the random topology? As expected, new phenomena will be uncovered that are never seen in the usual Euclidean setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In biological systems, organisms and infections only spread over short distances. Social systems have a network structure that is described by a graph with vertices being individuals and edges between those that interact. Connections between individuals may extend over large physical distances, but diseases, opinions, and new technologies spreading due to the interactions between an individual and their neighbors in the graph. Most mathematical analyses ignore spatial or network structure because its inclusion greatly complicates the analysis. However, as our past work with Simon Levin and others has shown, incorporating spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological competition. Our new work will focus on how spatial structure changes the impact of frequency dependent selection, and how the network structure of a social system changes the behavior of processes that occur in it. The models are idealized but the results give valuable insights about real systems."

The theme of this research is to see how predictions change when systems previously studied under the assumption that each individual interacts with all the others are made more realistic by incorporating space. The four main examples are the following: (i) the Staver-Levin forest model, which predicts that forest and savannah (grassland with isolated trees) are alternative stable states; (ii) evolutionary games, which have long been used in ecology to explain phenomena such as the persistence of altruistic behavior; (iii) Axelrod's model, which studies the spread of opinions when individuals interact with a probability based on the number of the number of opinions they share; (iv) the latent voter model, which studies the spread of technology in a social network when consumers who have just acquired a new product will wait some time before they are willing to purchase a new one. The general goal of studying these idealized models is to understand how properties of the equilibrium of the system depend on the details of the interactions. When each individual interacts with all the others, the system is an ordinary differential equation and is easily studied. However, when space is explicitly taken into account the problems become very difficult. <br/><br/>This project has the following specific goals: (i) show that in the Staver-Levin model, the direction of movement of a boundary between forest and savannah indicates the one state that is the true equilibrium in the spatial model; (ii) show that evolutionary games have three separate weak selection regimes that can lead to a PDE, ODE, or a regime in which Tarnita's formulas are valid; (ii) complete Junchi Li's thesis work studying Axelrod's model in the situation in which there are a large number of issues about which there are a large number of opinions (this would provide the first rigorous result for that model in two dimensions); (iv) show that even if latent period is brief, it changes the dynamics so that there is only one nontrivial stationary distribution, in contrast to the one parameter family in the voter model without latency."

It is hoped to establish the existence of a nontrivial multifractal spectrum for harmonic measure of a Brownian path, where the spectrum is given in terms of certain critical exponents for Brownian motion.  The proposer will also continue the program of investigating nonintersecting Brownian motions with the aim to establish rigorously the predictions of two-dimensional exponents given by nonrigorous conformal field theory.  Random walk analogues will be studied at the same time.  Other geometric properties of paths will be studied, such as the percolation exponent for Brownian motion which quantifies the notion of the thinnest subpath.  Study of the percolation exponent will lead to the study of processes obtained by removing loops from the Brownian path.  The path of a Brownian motion is an example of a random multifractal, a set whose ``dimension'' looks different at different points.  It is the path traversed by a randomly moving particle.  Multifractals have been studied in a number of contexts in science, but there are very few examples where one can establish rigorously the multifractal behavior. The proposer intends to try to analyze rigorously the multifractal behavior for the Brownian motion path.  Related to this project is the attempt to understand ``nonconformal field theory''---a powerful tool in theoretical physics which is not sufficiently understood on a mathematical level to allow for rigorous analysis."

As one example, in<br/>        determining whether there is gender bias in the promotion of<br/>        employees, it is common to use a statistical test called the<br/>        chi-squared test. As a second example, work on DNA sequences of<br/>        interest to biotechnology and health uses Poisson approximations<br/>        from probability theory. As a third example, in physics and<br/>        chemistry one uses Markov chain methods to test theoretical<br/>        models. These methods are routinely applied so it is important to<br/>        quantify their validity. A remarkable technique, introduced by Charles<br/>        Stein at Stanford, offers hope of better quantifying the accuracy<br/>        of such procedures. Stein's method has proven successful in<br/>        applications to DNA sequencing, but the technique is largely<br/>        unexplored. The investigator plans to extend the scope and<br/>        applicability of this method. As a final goal, the investigator<br/>        plans to study the use of Stein's method in Markov chain theory,<br/>        which as mentioned above, is crucial to drawing reliable<br/>        conclusions from computer simulations.<br/><br/>"

In data sciences, rectangular arrays appear whenever the observations are naturally arranged in two dimensions, for instance, in time and space. In quantum mechanics, matrices and related operators appear in modelling of a physical system. When the amount of available information about such a system is limited, a proper modelling is by taking the matrix to be random. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Random matrices and their eigenvalues play a central role in many research areas, including high-energy physics, growth models, number theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The project revolves around exactly solvable or integrable families of random matrices, for which the eigenvalues are accessible through explicit formulas, actions of differential operations, orthogonal polynomials, and other essentially algebraic techniques. The goal of this project is three-fold: to search for these families, develop delicate asymptotic results about them (which usually go far beyond theorems available for generic systems), and use them for obtaining asymptotic predictions for much wider classes of random matrices and related objects of applied interest. The central objects gluing together different parts of the project are beta-ensembles, which are N-dimensional distributions uniting and generalizing the laws of eigenvalues of various random matrices. While in classical contexts the parameter beta takes values 1, 2, or 4, depending on whether the matrices under consideration are real, complex, or are quaternion matrices, this project emphasize a point of view  in which beta is allowed to take arbitrary positive real values and should be interpreted as the inverse temperature in the terminology of statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the area of stochastic flows, the PI will continue efforts on the distribution of passive tracers under the motion of stochastic flows. Here, the goal will be to investigate the joint asymptotic distribution of two disjoint bodies of passive tracers moving under the flow. This will also be investigated for the case of turbulence where the tracers are carried by Kolmogorov velocity fields. Other research will be carried out involving the behavior of the singular flows called Kraichnan flows. In the area roughly labeled the parabolic Anderson model, the PI will investigate the so-called dynamo problem. This involves a model for the generation of magnetic fields in turbulent media such as on the surface of a star. The dynamo conjecture is that the magnetic field of a star will exhibit exponential growth. The PI will attempt to establish this exponential growth and examine the asymptotics of the exponential constant as the inverse Reynolds number goes to zero.<br/><br/>The general spirit of this proposal is to pursue a mathematical investigation of<br/>physical phenomena in the presence of random and chaotic media. Examples of this<br/>in the investigations in stochastic flows are provided by the distribution of plankton particles when carried by ocean currents or the spread of oil as in the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The goal of this study is to give information on the distribution and shape of a body of particles being carried by a random current. Another example of phenomena in chaotic media is the creation of magnetic fields in young stars. The field strength is conjectured to exhibit rapid growth and the mathematical model should also have the high focusing of the magnetic field strength in small regions which are sun spots. This will lead to more understanding of the development of these spots which have an effect on events on earth. Another project relates to behavior of polymer chains. One aspect of this work will be to make a detailed study of the phase transitions of polymers and the effect the relation of length to temperature has on the nature of the transition. Another aspect of the polymer study is to gauge the effect that a random environment has on the shape of a polymer. So far, very noisy environments have been shown to force the polymer into a particular shape, that is intense randomness reduces the degrees of freedom of the polymer in the model. We aim to gain more insight into the nature of this particular shape."

Examples of such systems include random stepped surfaces in three-dimensional space which, in particular, model melting crystals; square-ice model which is a mathematical two-dimensional approximation for a thin layer of ice; and interacting particle systems used for modeling (e.g., a one-lane highway, the growth of plankton in the ocean). Our aim is to extract macroscopic properties of very large systems starting from their microscopic definitions, with main accents on the appearance of the universal random fields and distributions.<br/><br/>There are two main distinctions of the systems we study. First is that we concentrate on and explore 2d structures which generalize many classical 1d probabilistic models such as eigenvalues of a random matrix. The two-dimensional extensions that we consider give new and often more natural interpretations of earlier one-dimensional results and also pave the way to prove new interesting asymptotic results about well-known one-dimensional models. Second, most models in this research enjoy a rich algebraic structure, which usually means that expectations of many observables can be computed in a concise manner. The techniques include usage of symmetric functions of representation-theoretic origin, eigenfunctions of difference operators, orthogonal polynomials, etc. This exact solvability provides tools for delicate asymptotic analysis and gives access to the properties of the universal objects appearing in the limit, such as Tracy-Widom distributions, the GUE-eigenvalues distribution, the GUE-corners process (its two-dimensional extension), and the Gaussian Free Field. The results obtained for the exactly solvable models are generally believed to extend to a large variety of similar stochastic systems."

They discovered that they can define a Maximum Likelihood Estimator U of the unknown u even if u appeared in the diffusion coefficient. They are going to find the rate of convergence of U to the true parameter u under reasonable assumptions when the observation time is relatively long enough. Since in the real applications, x(t) can be only recorded at discrete time spots, they are particularly interested in the problems of error estimates related to discretizations of their models. <br/> The Principle Investigator and his students' research has its interests in the real applications. There are many examples of parameter estimates of diffusion processes in the applications. For example, it may be related to the trace of a military missile, or the price of a stock. All those models contain some unknown parameters. Moreover, any observation of the real path contains errors. Assuming that the observation error can be only bounded by a constant c, then no matter how one increases the computation steps in the time discretization method, the error of the estimate can not be significantly reduced beyond some number. In other words, the Principle Investigator and his students will find out the minimum steps needed for a computer to get enough accurate result when an observation error is recognized.

The research questions are combined with educational activities, like summer workshops on probability theory for young researchers, summer projects with undergraduates, and funding for a postdoctoral researcher. The proposed work has connections to other areas of mathematical physics, like the structure of disordered magnets, and satisfaction problems from computer science.<br/><br/>This proposal details projects in probability theory and mathematical physics, specifically in statistical mechanics. The main models are percolation models and first-passage percolation (FPP), and the questions are to analyze the extreme values of collections of random variables that are highly correlated. In FPP, the main observable is the travel time from one node of a network to another one in a random environment, and we plan to study the asymptotics and fluctuations of this travel time, along with the structure of minimizers (geodesics) and near-minimizers. Much of the research will involve Busemann functions, which are tools from metric geometry used to study parallelism of geodesic rays. It is expected that results obtained in these studies will have consequences in spatial growth and epidemic models, other percolation problems, disordered spin systems, and polymer models.

Queueing models are probabilistic models that capture the inherent randomness in a variety of modern networks, such as those that arise in customer service systems, computing and telecommunications, as well as transportation and hi-tech manufacturing.  The network structure is typically deterministic and the scheduling policy is usually specified.  Randomness results from exogenous arrival times, service times, and internal routing.  Feedback and non-head-of-the-line (HL) scheduling policies are common in such networks.  These local dynamics interact to produce aggregate behavior that is complex and often evades closed form analysis.  Hence, tractable approximations are needed.  The project involves specifying and validating various model approximations, analyzing their performance and/or optimal control and interpreting those results for the original system.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project concerns the study of three queueing models with distinct features presenting unique mathematical challenges as follows:<br/><br/>(1) to develop a diffusion approximation for networks of processor sharing queues, under general distributional assumptions in the presence of feedback;<br/><br/>(2) to employ nonstandard, distribution dependent scaling to obtain a diffusion approximation for shortest remaining processing time queues;<br/><br/>(3) to obtain asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for multiclass queues with abandonment under general distributional assumptions through the study of fluid control problems.<br/><br/>Each model has been analyzed in various forms that include some Markovian distributional assumptions (i.e., exponentially distributed interarrival, service, and/or abandonment times). Such assumptions aren't particularly realistic for modeling the behavior of modern applications.  Furthermore, the performance can be dramatically different for such systems in the presence of non-Markovian distributional assumptions. Therefore, system performance needs to be understood more fully. From a mathematical point of view, general distributional assumptions result in the need to track significantly more information in order to track the system state. For example, residual service times or residual abandonment times for each job in the system must be tracked in some form. This naturally leads to an infinite dimensional system where measure-valued state descriptors provide an effective tool for tracking the system state. In spite of employing this common modeling tool, the nature of the mathematical challenges are distinct for each model due to the distinct system dynamics. For processor sharing networks, a new strategy for analyzing the long time behavior of fluid model solutions will be developed. We anticipate that this methodology will translate to other systems where time-sharing is present. For shortest remaining processing time queues, nonstandard distribution dependent scaling is required to account for the order of magnitude difference between the queue length and workload processes in heavy traffic. Such behavior has not been observed for other scheduling policies. For the control of multiclass queues, new frameworks need to be developed to provide an analysis of the fluid control problem for generally distributed abandonment times. Such advances should further help in the analysis of a diffusion control problem."

For many problems of Convex Geometry, like finding sections of a convex body with certain nice properties or approximating a convex body by another body, having a better structure, the explicit constructions are unknown. In these cases random constructions were proved to be very effective. It is often possible to define a random section or approximation and to show that it has the desired property with high probability. This approach combined with advanced probabilistic tools, like measure concentration, led to major discoveries in Convex geometry and Functional Analysis, including Dvoretzky's Theorem and inverse Santalo Inequality. The PI intends to apply the probabilistic method to study embeddings of different metric spaces, such as groups, graphs etc., into Banach spaces. These metric spaces are often equipped with a probability measure, which has strong concentration properties. Then it is possible to obtain significant information about the embedding of such metric space into a Banach space by studying the distribution of the image of a random point. Another direction of the proposed research is related to the study of convex bodies, which are not necessary symmetric. The results obtained in the last 3 years by several researchers, including the PI, show that many properties, previously known only for convex symmetric bodies, hold without the assumption of symmetry. The PI plans to continue his work in this area with the aim of constructing a theory of general convex bodies, which would be parallel to the existing theory of convex symmetric bodies.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will provide new connections between Functional Analysis, Convex Geometry and Probability. The results on embedding graphs into Banach spaces will be useful for finding small separators of graphs. This can lead to construction of more effective algorithms in several Computer Science problems, in particular in numerical solution of partial differential equations. The non-symmetric convex sets, which are one of the main objects of the proposed research, arise naturally in a broad class of optimization problems. So, better understanding of the structure of such bodies will result in constructing more effective optimization algorithms. The stochastic processes related to a convex body are also of considerable interest for the Control Theory.<br/><br/>"

(3) ""How can we understand the geometry of networks?""  Questions (1) and (2) can be reformulated as isoperimetric problems.  One example of an isoperimetric problem asks for the shape of a fence of fixed length that encloses the most area (the answer being a circular fence, which was known since ancient times).  The specific isoperimetric problems the principal investigator studies can be phrased as probabilistic problems, and this project develops some new tools from calculus to deal with these problems.  Different versions of Question (1) have been studied extensively by game theorists in the 1950s and 1960s, but investigations in theoretical computer science in the last two decades have given renewed interest for Questions (1), (2), and (3).  Generally speaking, theoretical computer science finds ways for computers to solve problems as quickly and as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>This project develops two analytic tools in probability: the calculus of variations and curvature.  Several recent isoperimetric problems in probability and theoretical computer science such as (1) and (2) ask for the Euclidean sets of smallest Gaussian perimeter and fixed Gaussian volume.  A breakthrough result of Choksi and Sternberg from 2007 allows the calculus of variations to be applied to these optimization problems, though others have not yet used variational tools for these problems.  The principal investigator will also develop theories of curvature for hypercontractive and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.  For a Riemannian manifold, Ricci curvature bounds imply logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, a result of Bakry and Emery from 1985.  In this project, different notions of Ricci curvature on random graphs will be investigated. Theories of Ricci curvature for noncommutative logarithmic Sobolev inequalities will also be investigated."

The goal of nonlinear filtering is to obtain best statistical estimate of the state, which can be the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle, of a stochastic dynamical system based on noisy partial observations of the state.  As a key tool for data assimilation, nonlinear filtering has applications in vastly diverse research areas including biology, mathematical finance, signal processing and target tracking. A particular example of target tracking is the guidance and surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) which have been playing an essential role in national security and defense.  Through nonlinear estimates  of target location based on the observations from multiple sensors, nonlinear filtering forms a core component in unmanned aerial vehicle targeting and navigation systems.  Because of vast amount data at an increasing rate of availability, traditional nonlinear filtering methods such as Kalman filter and particle filter are often inadequate to handle high dimensional and highly nonlinear problems.  This research project aims to develop fast and adaptive numerical algorithms to attack such nonlinear filtering problems. Several graduate students will participate in this project. <br/><br/>This project is to conduct research in developing high order and adaptive numerical algorithms and the corresponding numerical analysis on nonlinear filtering problems.  The focus is on the PDF filter, which solves the nonlinear filtering problem by solving the conditional probability density function (PDF) for the optimal filter through a stochastic partial differential equation or a backward stochastic differential equation.   We will develop two classes of algorithms: the first solves the Zakai equation on adaptively constructed computational domains and on sparse grids; and the second solves a class of backward stochastic differential equations. Both algorithms overcome three difficulties for the PDF filter: i) high dimensionality; ii) low regularity; iii) unbounded domains. The overarching objective of this proposal is to make the PDF filter a highly competitive numerical method for nonlinear filtering problems. In particular, the novel BSDE based PDF filter studied in this proposal achieves a high order of convergence, which is much faster than all other existing nonlinear filtering methods.<br/>"

These processes are useful to model the complex systems that arise in the study of sociology, biology, criminology, seismology, finance, and many other fields. The most standard point process is the Poisson process that has independent time increments, which means that future jumps are independent of what has occurred in the past. However, one does not often observe independent time increments in real-world data. For example, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis, credit defaults have a contagion effect -- a default of one company can trigger more companies to default. In social networks, the possibility for users to re-share the content posted by their social connections may cascade across the system. In seismology, after an earthquake hits, the area often experiences aftershocks. In criminology, gang-related violence has the property that a murder or shooting by one gang often provokes retaliation by another gang. All these examples have in common the self-exciting property: an event can trigger more events to come. Self-exciting point processes, the subject of this research project, constitute a class of point processes that can describe such phenomena. Despite their importance in applications, many key central facts are still unknown. This project will investigate the theoretical aspects of self-exciting point processes, as well as their applications. It aims to advance understanding of how complex and large stochastic systems self and mutually excite, interact, cluster, and effect contagion. The results derived from this framework will be applied to better understand the big data sets arising from complex systems in the real world. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project studies a class of self-exciting point processes, with a focus on the Hawkes process and its extensions, including the nonlinear Hawkes process. To date, the limit theorems for this model are restricted to large time asymptotics, and they have been well studied except the multivariate nonlinear case, which will be investigated in this research. The investigator intends to understand the large asymptotics on a fixed time interval, which will be very useful in the context of many applications. These large asymptotics will differ from the Poisson process and phase transitions are anticipated. The investigator will also study the fluctuations and large deviations of the mean-field limit of a multivariate Hawkes process when the dimension is large, which is useful in applications to neural networks, financial networks, and others. The project will also explore the spatial Hawkes processes, the space-time Hawkes processes, and other types of self-exciting point processes that have been suggested for modeling but still lack some key theoretical results. The investigator also aims to study applications of the self-exciting point processes, including theoretical applications to queueing theory and to fitting these models to real world big data sets, which requires a better understanding of some theoretical aspects of the simulations and calibrations of self-exciting point processes."

Examples of such models are given by random three-dimensional stepped surfaces, interacting particles systems, the six-vertex model (used to describe the structure of a thin film of water molecules), and interacting avoiding random walkers (sometimes called line ensembles). Many of these models have remarkable algebraic and combinatorial properties, which makes their study tractable. The main goal of the project is to obtain a detailed description (involving exact mathematical formulas) of the asymptotic behavior of these random systems as their size (volume and/or the number of particles) grows.  <br/><br/>The project involves three interwined directions of research. The first involves the derivation and asymptotic analysis of joint observables for integrable models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A distinguished feature of integrable models is that they allow for various exact formulas of different observables. A notorious problem with many of these formulas is that they are difficult to study asymptotically, due to the presence of hard to control cross-terms, and one of the goals of the project is to develop a framework for analyzing these cross-terms. The second direction of the project is to establish universal scaling limits for Gibbsian line ensembles. Various integrable models, such as Hall-Littlewood processes and the log-gamma polymer, naturally carry a structure of a line ensemble and it is expected that these ensembles converge to the parabolic Airy line ensemble (one of the universal scaling limits in the KPZ universality class) -- the project seeks to establish this statement. The third direction of the project is to utilize loop equations to understand the scaling limits of multi-level interacting particle systems, which are discrete analogues of the beta-corners processes from random matrix theory and are related to Jack symmetric functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The systems studied in this project are representative of natural phenomena, such as crystal growths, evolution of magnetic domains, paths evolving in a noisy environment, and randomly stirred fluids. Often these systems exhibit nonlinearity and criticality. Nonlinearity refers to the behavior that the randomness of the macroscopic observables are related to the underlying microscopic randomness in a nonlinear fashion. Criticality refers to the phenomenon that a given system exhibits drastically distinct macroscopic behaviors when certain parameters in the underlying microscopic model reach some critical values. Time-evolutionary stochastic systems form a large body of probability theory, yet the type of phenomena considered here sits on the frontiers of current standard theories. The goal of this project is to unveil the mathematical structure pertaining to the aforementioned scopes, and to refine the existing theories to study these systems.<br/><br/>In concrete terms, the project studies three types of models: interacting particles with moving boundaries, stochastic partial differential equaitons (SPDEs) at their criticality, and stochastic six vertex-types models. Particle systems with moving boundaries give rise to Stefan?s problem in PDE, and in one particular case those systems relate to the critical point of a reaction-diffusion particle system. The principal investigator seeks to develop more robust tools that do not require explicit stationary distributions and apply to the aforementioned critical point. SPDEs exhibit criticality for certain parameters, where the solutions become non-measurable with respect to the driving noise. This research aims at studying the correlation functions, regularity, and local properties of a few specific examples of such SPDEs. The stochastic six-vertex model is a specialization of the ice-type models that can be formulated as a Markov process. It hosts a number of degenerations, including the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. As a first step toward understanding the limiting shape of these models, the principal investigator plans to study the large deviations utilizing the Markov structures of these models."

A central task of the rigorous theory of statistical mechanics is to analyze which features of physical systems are universal, shared by many models with apparently very different microscopic specifications. Understanding of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, which concerns many surfaces growing with local randomness, has been greatly advanced by many mathematicians and physicists over the last forty years. Often these advances have been aided by the use of integrable techniques, in which sometimes rather special models are analyzed via algebraic tools or exact formulas. The Principal Investigator will analyze certain important universality classes, including the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class, by using probabilistic proof methods in unison with limited but crucial integrable inputs. The structure of certain random fractal  geometries arising in scaling limits of dynamics on random media will thus be explicated.<br/> <br/><br/>The proposed probabilistic investigation of fractal geometries has three principal components. The first concerns anomalous transport in disordered random media. Namely, when a particle with a uniform tendency to move in a preferred direction does so in a milieu that is random and strongly disordered,  trapping is a vital phenomenon that interrupts and sometimes eliminates linear progress. The phenomenon will be elucidated by a detailed inquiry into biased motion on the infinite cluster of supercritical percolation in the integer lattice of dimensions at least two. The second direction concerns scaled last passage percolation. Rich aspects of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality will be explored by studying the scaled random geometry of extremal paths moving through random fields using probabilistic modes of proof such as resampling of random energy profiles and surgery on paths. The final principal component will address noise sensitivity and last passage percolation. The stability and sensitivity of last passage percolation paths under perturbation by noise of the random environment will be studied, strengthening the bridge between two key theories: Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality and discrete harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Queueing models are probabilistic models that capture the inherent randomness in a variety of modern networks, such as those that arise in customer service systems, computing and telecommunications, transportation, and hi-tech manufacturing.  The network structure is typically deterministic, and the scheduling policy is usually specified.  Randomness results from exogenous arrival times, service times, and internal routing.  Feedback and non-head-of-the-line scheduling policies are common in such networks.  These local dynamics interact to produce aggregate behavior that is complex and often evades closed form analysis.  Hence, tractable approximations are needed.  In this project the PI will specify and validate various model approximations, analyzing their performance and/or optimal control, and interpreting those results for the original system. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project concerns the study of three queueing models operating under general distributional assumptions with distinct features presenting unique mathematical challenges as follows: (1) Develop a diffusion approximation for networks of processor sharing queues in the presence of feedback; (2) Obtain asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for multi-class many server queues with abandonment through the study of fluid and diffusion control problems; and (3) Prove limit theorems to justify fluid invariant states as approximations of stationary distributions for randomize load balancing algorithms. These models have been analyzed in various forms that include Markovian distributional assumptions, i.e., exponentially distributed inter-arrival, service, and/or abandonment times. However, such assumptions are not particularly realistic for modeling the behavior of modern computers, communications, and customer service systems. Furthermore, the performance can be dramatically different for such systems in the presence of non-Markovian distributional assumptions. Therefore, system performance needs to be understood more fully. From a mathematical point of view, general distributional assumptions result in the need to track significantly more information in order to represent the system state. For example, residual service times, age-in-service, and/or age-in-system must be tracked for each job in the system. This leads to an infinite dimensional system where measure-valued state descriptors provide an effective representation. Despite this common descriptor, the mathematical challenges are different for each model due to distinct system dynamics. For processor sharing networks, a new methodology for analyzing the long-time behavior of fluid model solutions will be developed. It is anticipated that this methodology will translate to other systems where time sharing is present. For the control of multi-class queues, non-linearity that arises in the fluid control problem for non-exponentially distributed abandonment times presents new challenges for demonstrating asymptotic optimality. Such non-linearities are expected to introduce further difficulties to be overcome in the analysis of a second order, diffusion control problem. For randomized load balancing algorithms, a methodology for proving the convergence of fluid model solutions to invariant states as time approaches infinity will be developed. A challenge here is to devise strategies equipped to handle the countable system of couple measure-valued equations satisfied by fluid model solutions. Such strategies are expected to be relevant for the analysis of other models with load balancing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The phase transition that both the dynamical and static models undergo has received much attention, yet various basic problems have so far been out of reach of rigorous analysis in all three temperature regimes (high/low/critical). The PI proposes to study several such problems, including a power-law for mixing at criticality for the extremal 4-color Potts model in 2D vs. slow mixing in 3D, and establishing the cutoff phenomenon for the FK model off-criticality. A second research direction aims to understand properties of cluster interfaces in these models under various boundary conditions (b.c.): The PI plans to study rigidity and fluctuations of 3D Ising and 2D Potts interfaces under prescribed b.c., towards showing fast mixing for the 3D Ising model with plus b.c. and critical 2D q-state Potts model with free b.c. for all q. The final proposed topic compares the behavior of systems of interacting particles on lattices to other environments. For the SK spin glass model, various features of the static measure are known to be universal in the law of the interactions, and the PI proposes to establish an analogous statement for Langevin dynamics; for branching Brownian motion, the PI will investigate the law of the maximum in the presence of a periodic environment affecting the particles; and for the stochastic Ising model, the PI aims to show an aspect of sensitivity to initial conditions that is special to lattices, contrary to the behavior on typical random regular graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another will be to find out the extend of the so-called Sherrington-Kirkpatrick universality class for spin systems in random media, and to determine behaviors when heavy tails and long-range correlations cause spin systems to exit this class. A third consequence should be to understand the critical cases for hitting probabilities of fractional Brownian motion."

It focuses on models in continuous space and time, with turbulent<br/>or otherwise chaotic behavior, and makes heavy use of infinite-dimensional<br/>random objects, especially stochastic partial differential equations<br/>(SPDEs) which feature white-noise behavior in time and various irregular<br/>spatial behaviors, as well as non-white-noise-based objects which fail to<br/>have the martingale or the Markov properties (e.g. fractional Brownian<br/>noise). Specific topics to be covered, with corresponding physical<br/>applications, are divided in three categories: (i) problems based on SPDEs<br/>and their probabilistic representations, including Feynman-Kac approaches,<br/>ranging from very basic questions of existence and uniqueness for highly<br/>irregular coefficients, to quantitative questions on the asymptotic<br/>behavior of linear multiplicative stochastic heat equations including the<br/>Anderson model and directed polymers measures in Gaussian environments, to<br/>questions of diffusive behavior around random Gibbsian<br/>impurities/obstacles; (ii) specific physically motivated SPDEs:<br/>magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) in a turbulent environment, based on a<br/>Feynman-Kac formulation and its connection to products of random matrices;<br/>a framework for self-organized criticality unifying microscopic and<br/>macroscopic time scales; (iii) extensions of the Russo-Vallois theory of<br/>stochastic integration to general Gaussian and even highly non-Gaussian<br/>processes, with SPDE applications to a genealogical framework for<br/>connecting fractional Brownian motion to Kolmogorov operators.<br/><br/>    The PIs' purpose for studying these topics is to come to a better<br/>understanding of complex random (""stochastic"") phenomena that change<br/>simultaneously in space and time. While many typically think of chaotic<br/>phenomena as being devoid of the possibility of predictable behavior, the<br/>PIs choice of complex models is designed to illustrate how specific<br/>inputs, no matter how random, invariably cause outputs which, while they<br/>may look very random on a short time scale, do show extremely predictable<br/>behavior in other scales of space and time, with important physical<br/>consequences. For instance, the MHD model should be capable of exhibiting<br/>the so-called ""fast dynamo"" effect, by which a magnetic fluid with low<br/>viscosity (the earth's oceans, or its atmosphere, or the sun), when<br/>subjected to a uniformly random energy input, will exhibit a magnetic<br/>intensity which grows at a specific exponentially rate; this effect could<br/>have applications to non-mechanical locomotion. Also of note is the model<br/>for self-organized criticality, which can help understand two-time-phased<br/>systems, such as avalanches: rather than being considered as events which<br/>occurs instantaneously when a threshold is reached, the model will take<br/>advantage of a heat-transfer setting reacting to a random environment in a<br/>short time scale. Many of the project's other models are also based on the<br/>idea that a random environment can have predictable effects, such as<br/>non-diffusive behavior for polymers or particles around random impurities<br/>or force fields. As mathematicians, the PIs are motivated by the beauty of<br/>the continuous-time continuous-space probabilistic tools needed to study<br/>these physical models, and remain true to their commitment to bridging the<br/>gap between theory and applications. Graduate students working with the<br/>PIs will take part in this project's fundamental aspects, and in<br/>investigating quantitative issues via calculations or numerical computer<br/>work. The PIs will encourage students from underrepresented groups to join<br/>their research program.<br/>"

Specifically, in the context of the Wiener process W (standard Brownian motion), if a random variable X can be written as a function of the path of W which is differentiable in the sense of Malliavin, meaning that its Frechet derivative DX in the direction of any appropriate perturbation exists, then it is possible to form a function g, equal to an averaged inner product of DX and of an exponentially correlated copy of DX, and use this function g to write estimates for the tails and even the density of X. An indication of this methodology is recorded in an article by the PI and Ivan Nourdin. The PI plan to apply the methodology to find sharp upper and lower bounds on densities of random variables of interest to probabilists, including the maxima of Gaussian fields, and also to tackle related problems such as small ball probabilities for fractional Brownian motion.  A connection between Malliavin derivatives and Stein's method, which was discovered by Nourdin and Peccati, will also be investigated, and may help in analyzing random variables whose behavior is closer to non Gaussian distributions, including Gamma distributions, within the so-called Pearson class.<br/><br/>The broader scientific significance of the proposed research begins with applications to the effect of chaotic environments on the stabilization or destabilization of physical or chemical systems, including polymers in random media. There should be a range of spatial correlation lengths in the medium which imply a continuum of behaviors, exhibiting richer phenomena than what theoretical physicists have predicted. Taking the modeling further, the PI plans to analyze the practical consequences of the project in those areas where long memory is an empirical fact, including financial econometrics, internet traffic, and climate prediction. Ph.D. students will take part in the fundamental aspects of the research. Some theoretical quantitative issues, such as small ball constants, fluctuation exponents, and long-memory parameter estimation, will be complemented with numerical simulations conducted by MS and undergraduate students.

This proposal aims to further develop the theory of such processes, with three concrete application areas in mind.   The first area concerns random networks that arise in biology, manufacturing, and other service systems when they operate near capacity.  The performance of these networks can often be described by diffusions that are constrained to have nonnegative components.  A second area is in mathematical finance, where the advent of electronic exchanges driven purely by the flow of orders has revolutionized the method by which prices are formed.  The price process in a model of strategic agents who place buy and sell limit orders can be better understood by studying a class of constrained processes.  The third area involves the study of scaling limits of random matrices, which arise in many areas, including physics and engineering.  The gaps between the eigenvalues of some classes of high-dimensional random matrices, when properly scaled, can be shown to be approximated by constrained multi-dimensional diffusions with singular drift.  The proposal seeks to develop a unified theory for the construction and study of these processes, and to examine their implications for the described applications.   Another theme of the proposal involves the study of planar obliquely reflected diffusions.  Planar stochastic processes have been the focus of active research over the last two decades.  Finally, the proposal also has a substantial educational component that includes training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students, as well as new course development.  It also entails a broader effort that coordinates several graduate students in outreach activities aimed at communicating mathematics to a broader audience.<br/><br/>This is an interdisciplinary proposal that focuses on several problems in probability that require substantial use of analytical techniques.   The first theme concerns various aspects of obliquely reflected diffusions, including the construction and properties of obliquely reflected Brownian motions in bounded planar domains, and also excursion reflected Brownian motion which arises in the boundary theory of Markov processes.  It also involves the development of a common framework for the analysis of diffusions with both reflection and singular drift, large deviations of semimartingale reflected Brownian motions and a free boundary problem related to a two-dimensional reflected Brownian motion.  These are motivated by applications in queuing networks, biology, and mathematical finance.   The tools that will be used intersect with several areas of mathematics including analysis (in particular, complex analysis, conformal mappings, harmonic analysis, functional analysis,  partial differential equations and free-boundary problems).  There are also implications of this work for mathematical physics, specifically the study of repulsive particle models associated with random matrices."

Many of the questions under study remain open, despite extensive studies offering detailed heuristics and corroborating experiments; the goal of this project is to make progress on these via new methods of analysis, which are expected to find further applications in probability theory as well as in other areas. <br/><br/>The first research project focuses on the interplay between a spin system, such as the Ising or Potts model, and a natural Markov chain modelling its evolution, for example Metropolis or heat-bath Glauber dynamics. The phase transition that both the dynamical and static models undergo has received much attention, yet various basic problems have so far been out of reach of rigorous analysis in all three (high, low, and critical) temperature regimes.  This project studies several such problems, as well as newer ones  suggested by recent advances, including understanding the effect of the initial configurations (random or deterministic, balanced or alternating, etc.) on the mixing time at high temperature and establishing a power-law for mixing at criticality in dimension 3 and higher.  A second research direction focuses on random surface models, as well as their evolution, with ramifications for the Ising model and the roughening transition in crystals. The final research topic addresses random walks on the Erdos-Renyi random graph: the project aims to study the effect of the initial state on the mixing time of random walks, and in different regimes to establish typical structural properties, such as robustness of its features to noise, and atypical ones, such as whether the system organizes to asymmetric structures when conditioned on an atypical event (large deviations)."

Vast stores of information can efficiently be analyzed for underlying patterns by machine learning algorithms, leading to remarkable progress in applications ranging from self-driving cars to automatic drug discovery and machine translation. Underpinning many of these exciting practical developments is a class of computational models called neural networks. Originally developed in the 1940's and 1950's, the neural nets used today are as complex as they are powerful. The purpose of this project is to develop a range of principled techniques for understanding key aspects of how neural networks work in practice and how to make them better. The approach taken by this project is probabilistic and statistical in nature. Just as the ideal gas law accurately describes the large-scale properties of a gas directly through pressure, volume, and temperature without the need specify the state of each individual gas molecule, this project will explore and identify emergent statistical behaviors of large neural networks that provably explain many of their key properties observed in practice. The project will also provide research training and educational opportunities through organization of summer schools in machine learning for graduate students.<br/> <br/>At a high level, a neural network is a family of functions given by composing affine transformations with elementary non-linear operations. The simplest important kind of neural networks are roughly described by two parameters called depth and width. The former is the dimension of the spaces on which the affine transformations act and the latter is the number of compositions. The technical heart of this project is to understand the statistical behavior of such networks when the affine transformations are chosen at random. The starting point is an analytically tractable regime in which the network width is sent to infinity at fixed depth. In this infinite width limit, random networks converge to Gaussian processes and optimization of network parameters from their randomly chosen starting points reduces to a kernel method. Unfortunately, this concise description cannot capture what is perhaps the most important empirical property of neural networks, namely their ability to learn data-dependent features. Understanding how feature learning occurs is at the core of this project and requires new probabilistic and analytic tools for studying random neural networks at finite width. The basic idea is to perform perturbation theory around the infinite width limit, treating the reciprocal of the network width as a small parameter. The goal is then to obtain, to all orders in this reciprocal, the expressions for joint distribution of the values and derivatives (with respect to both model inputs and model parameters) of a random neural network. Such formulas have practical consequences for understanding the numerical stability of neural network training, suggesting principled settings for optimization hyper-parameters, and quantifying feature learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the considerable attention devoted to free boundary problems, the understanding of the solutions they generate is still very limited. In this project, the investigator will use a novel approach on free boundary problems, grounded in modern probability theory to advance the understanding of this important class of mathematical models. A particular focus of the project will be on the desirable irregularities present in these models capturing, for example, the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, as well as the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. Integral parts of the project are supervision of graduate and undergraduate research, and graduate and undergraduate training in probability theory and stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems provide a universal mathematical framework for many phenomena in the natural and social sciences as well as engineering. While the mathematical formulation of free boundary problems dates back to the 19th century and their analysis has received much attention in the 20th century, the understanding of their solutions is still limited. This is largely due to the singularities oftentimes exhibited by the solutions, either in time, capturing for example the rapid growth of a crystal or neural synchronization, or in space, encapsulating for example the non-smooth nature of the surface of a tumor or between the components of an alloy. This project builds on the analysis for the one phase supercooled Stefan problem in one space dimension, a prototypical example of a singular free boundary problem. The aim is to expand the scope of the novel probabilistic solution concept they introduced to include a large set of singular free boundary problems, such as the one phase supercooled Stefan problem for the nonlinear heat equation and its two-phase analogue in one space dimension, the supercooled Stefan problem in multiple space dimensions, possibly with kinetic undercooling and/or surface tension, and the Hele-Shaw problem in multiple space dimensions. In addition, the investigator intends to identify these solutions with large scale limits of random growth models defined by means of interacting particle systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it. In graph theory, probabilistic thinking leads to new questions and results involving inequalities for finite graphs.  Namely, one often finds when counting combinatorial objects that a subgraph contains fewer of them than the whole graph. But if the subgraph is based on fewer vertices, then one ought to normalize the counts to reflect this.  The PI has some partial results in this direction and proposes to find more.  In ergodic theory, questions involve graphings, colorings, and factors. In fact, it may be that these investigations will lead to progress in the theory of percolation on groups.

Among these are nonlinear                          autoregressive (-moving average) processes of much interest in                  time series analysis, and random perturbations of dynamical                     systems and flows which exhibit various phase transitions as a                  parameter changes.  The interplay between Markov processes and                  dynamical systems that this proposal explores has significant                   consequences to both fields.  For those Markov processes which                  approach a unique steady state as time progresses, a further                    object of study is the central limit theorem and its refinement                 by asymptotic expansions.  These refinements have applications in               diverse areas such as bootstrapping in time series, and singular                perturbation expansions of large time solutions of a class of                   partial differential equations which arise in the prediction of                 the spread of contaminants in an aquifer.

All these phenomena are governed by nonlinear dynamics with a hierarchy of scales in space and time, which make their analysis and prediction complex and challenging.  Of the three broad topics considered here, Topic 1 is devoted to the problem of contaminant transport in natural media such as aquifers.  The class of Fokker-Planck equations which govern this transport involve multiple spatial scales of heterogeneity. Topic 2  concerns the fine scale structure of a class of random measures which arise in the statistical theories of turbulence and rainfall.  The mathematical theory to be employed for such highly singular phenomena is that of random cascades. Topic 3  is concerned with climatic changes and global change phenomena over much larger scales of time than envisaged under Topic 2.  Here the aim is to analyze interannual climatic events using randomly perturbed dynamical systems.    The main objective of the proposal is the development of nonlinear stochastic dynamical theories for (1) the prediction of the spread of pollutants in the environment with time, (2) making improvements in short-term weather forecasting, and (3) the understanding and eventual prediction of long-term climatic and global change phenomena.  An important example under Topic 1 is the problem of the spread of chemical and other pollutants in natural underground water systems.  Since even slightly different velocity fields of water in these systems often lead to dramatically different rates of spread of the pollution in the long run, careful and precise modeling and analysis are required and proposed here.  With regard to Topic 2, different techniques are needed for the study of the space-time distribution of thunderstorms and rainfall.  These are expected to provide better inputs into the numerical models which are generally used for we ather forecasts, thus improving their predictability. Although scientists have been somewhat successful in such short-term weather forecasting, they have had little success in the understanding and prediction of long-term climatic phenomena.  Since it is impossible to provide an adequate deterministic model for the latter, the main aim under Topic 3 is the analysis of these long-term phenomena using models with random perturbations.  An example considered is the prediction of the advent and intensity of the El Nino--a warming of the Tropical Pacific causing extensive rainfall and flooding--and its  opposite the dry La Nina.  Realistic nonlinear stochastic models are sought here and their analysis is proposed."

The work in area (1) is motivated by some recent universal results on the almost sure behavior of sums of independent random variables. Contrary to the classical results in this direction, these results do not require moment type conditions. The main difficulty is to find suitable norming and centering sequences which are specific to the particular situations under investigation. Among other things, quantile transformations will be used. The work from area (2) is mainly devoted to the limit behavior of local empirical processes which have useful applications in density and regression function estimation. The third part of this proposal finally addresses a number of questions in connection with a recent general law of the iterated logarithm in Banach space.    This proposal addresses a number of questions on limit theorems in probability and empirical processes. Limit theorems in probability such as the central limit theorem, and laws of large numbers provide the basis for many widely used statistical techniques to handle large data sets. Some of these  results, however, can only be applied under relatively restrictive conditions. Over the last decade, powerful methods have been developed in probability. It is proposed to use these new techniques to further extend the applicability of the basic limit theorems, and, at the same time, to gain some insight into situations, where the classical techniques have failed. Some applications to statistical estimation theory will be considered as well, where the main emphasis will be on so-called empirical processes."

All these areas undergird much of science and technology. The public is familiar with probability from everyday life, but often is not aware of how crucial it is in today's economy, for example, or in today's computer algorithms in common smartphone apps. Group theory studies symmetries and lies behind much of modern physics. Analysis is familiar from calculus, invented to study moving bodies and now used throughout science and engineering. Ergodic theory is the least known of these branches of mathematics; it began in physics with the study of systems of many particles, such as gases. It now provides a unifying framework to study many disparate questions, including some in computer science. As one example of these connections to be studied, we recall that in the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.  It is always desirable to have finite approximations to infinite objects, and the same holds for infinite groups.  Gromov and Weiss suggested a way to use finite networks for this purpose, at least for those groups known as ""sofic"". It is not known how widely this approach works. The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it.  If one can actually succeed in making such approximations for all groups, then this would resolve a host of important conjectures in a variety of fields of mathematics.  The PI will continue his work on this question. Graduate students will be trained through research related to this project.<br/><br/>Other directions concern a class of random processes of points, known as determinantal.  These processes were first considered in physics, then found much use in probability theory, and recently have become of interest in computer science (in order to find representative, diverse samples from large data sets).  One of the goals of this project is to understand better how close two determinantal probability measures are when their generating matrices are close. Such a result in the finite case is very likely to extend to the infinite case as well, at least in the infinite ""sofic"" situation. In another direction, random walks are a basic object of study in probability, whether in discrete time or continuous time. The PI has discovered much very puzzling behavior of continuous-time random walks, especially on Cayley graphs. It is proposed to determine whether such puzzling behavior is limited in how much it can contradict intuition. As a final example, the notion of ""factor"" is basic to ergodic theory. Factors maps are very well understood when the acting group is amenable, but not when the group is larger. Yet factors on trees are also important in combinatorics and computer science.  It is proposed to understand better which maps are factors of IID (independent and identically distributed) processes and which are not.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such question we will address involves analysing algorithms for detecting sub-communities within a social network by investigating the graph of friendship relations. The proposal addresses questions from combinatorics and computer science about when random combinatorial and computational problems have solutions, such as when there is a colouring in a random graph.  Ideas from statistical physics give predictions for these thresholds which we will mathematically prove.  It also studies questions of how long it takes random processes on networks, such as the Glauber dynamics Markov chain, to reach their equilibrium distribution and how this depends on their initial starting position.  Such processes are used as algorithms for sampling high dimensional distributions.  The proposal focuses on development of mathematical theory with a view to better understanding these problems.  Finally the proposal will support the development of new graduate courses in discrete probability and stochastic process on random graphs as well as providing research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications across a range of stochastic processes on networks. One aspect involves studying phase transitions of Gibbs measures on random graphs, particularly random constraint satisfaction problems.  Here we hope to establish conjectures from statistical physics for a range of models such as the chromatic and independence numbers on random graphs.  A second theme is the development of new tools for establishing rough isometries and other geometric notions of closeness between random metric spaces.  In particular we will consider whether independent copies of Poisson processes, percolation clusters and SLE curves are rough isometries or quasi-symmetries.  Finally the proposal will consider Markov random fields such as the Ising model on lattices.  At high temperatures it will consider the question of universality of the cutoff phenomena as well as the effect of different initial conditions on the mixing time.  At low temperatures it will pursue a better understanding of Ising interfaces in order to establish rapid mixing results."

The class of integrable systems includes several fundamental equations of nature and the mathematical foundations of integrable systems go back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and Poincare.  Currently, the theory of integrable systems has become an expanding area which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics.  Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in modern nonlinear science and technology.  In addition to the traditional domain of differential equations, integrable techniques are becoming common in  such diverse fields as orthogonal polynomials, string theory, enumerative topology, statistical mechanics, random processes, quantum informatics, and number theory.  Many of the problems considered in the project have direct connections with these disciplines. <br/><br/>This research project continuous the principal investigator's long term research efforts in the theory of integrable systems. The principal goal of the project is to address the following two directions which have emerged from  recent developments in random matrix theory and in the theory of exactly solvable quantum models: (a) The study of  the isomonodromic tau functions, their asymptotics, Fredholm determinant representations and their relations to the conformal  field theory; (b) The asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz, Hankel, and Fredholm determinants arising in the study of critical phenomena in random matrices and statistical mechanics.  Each of these directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems, and they will be investigated within the same analytical framework, viz., the Riemann-Hilbert method.  The main focus of the first direction is on the long standing question of evaluation the asymptotic connection formulae, including the constant pre-factors,  for the generic families of Painleve tau functions. The principal concern  of the second direction is various types of double scaling and transitional limits - topics which are among the principal questions in both the theory of random matrices and in  statistical mechanics."

All these areas undergird much of science and technology. The public is familiar with probability from everyday life, but often is not aware of how crucial it is in today's economy, for example, or in today's computer algorithms in common smartphone apps. Group theory studies symmetries and lies behind much of modern physics. Analysis started from calculus, invented to study moving bodies and now used throughout science and engineering. Ergodic theory is the least known of these branches of mathematics; it began in physics with the study of systems of many particles, such as gases. It now provides a unifying framework to study many disparate questions, including some in computer science. As one example, in the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.  It is always desirable to have finite approximations to infinite objects, and the same holds for infinite groups.  Gromov and Weiss suggested a way to use finite networks for this purpose, at least for those groups known as ``sofic"". It is not known how widely this approach works.  The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it.  If one can actually succeed in making such approximations for all groups, then this would resolve a host of important conjectures in a variety of fields of mathematics.  The PI will continue work on this fundamental question. One of the project's most important broader impacts is on the strengthening of STEM education, by training of undergraduate and graduate students at Indiana University, who will profit form working closely with the PI on the project's cutting-edge mathematical topics of the highest caliber. Conversely, the PI will work with a talented cohort of students who will contribute significantly to his research agenda to understand finite group approximations, particularly in analyzing the behavior of probabilistic objects on Cayley graphs.<br/><br/>Among the analysis of probabilistic objects on Cayley graphs, some of the topics which the PI will investigate with his graduate students include a class of random processes of points, known as determinantal.  Certain of these arise from Hilbert spaces via orthogonal projections.  The resulting processes seem to provide random spanning sets. Especially interesting applications are in complex analysis. The analogue for an infinite discrete ground set was established earlier by the PI. It is proposed to make the same connection in general, which would establish a conjecture of the PI and Peres.  It is also proposed to understand better how close two determinantal probability measures are when their generating matrices are close. Such a result in the finite case is very likely to extend to the infinite case as well, at least in the infinite ""sofic"" situation studied in the first problem above. Other problems on which the PI will collaborate with his graduate students include continuous-time non-colliding random walks on graphs beyond the one-dimensional lattice and cycle, first passage percolation, and random walks on Galton-Watson trees."

The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of solutions to the parabolic Anderson problem, the solutions to the equation of the evolution of a magnetic field in a random flow, and a variety of probabilistic aspects of transport phenomena. For the Anderson problem the study focuses on the equations with random time-dependent potential. In the scalar case this problem can be looked upon as a scalar model for the equation of the evolution of the magnetic field in a random flow. In the vector case the Anderson model is related to passive transport by random flows, which is also a subject of the current project. The study of transport phenomena is concerned with the long-time behavior of ensembles of points as well as connected sets under the action of a large class of physically relevant flows. <br/> Most of the proposed problems arise naturally in the study of various physical phenomena in meteorology, oceanography, and the theory of turbulence. In particular, when studying passive transport, one assumes that certain properties of the media are known (for example, while the temperatures or velocities on the surface of the ocean can not be measured in every single point exactly, certain statistical information is assumed to be available). The problem then consists of trying to predict the long-time behavior of a passive scalar (such as an oil spill carried by the currents on the surface of the ocean) based on the statistical properties of the underlying media. Several such problems can be formulated in relatively simple terms, yet the solutions are very non-trivial, and at times surprising. <br/>"

This representation, which was recently discovered by LeJan and Sznitman in France, is clearly intrinsic to the structure of the Navier-Stokes equations. While this is not the first attempt to use stochastic methods in connection with the flows associated with the Navier-Stokes equations, it does represent an entirely new direction which has the potential to transcend much of existing theory. Specific problems considered in this proposal seek to provide a better understanding of the role of spatial dimensions, boundary conditions, multi-scaling exponents and singularities, viscosity, homogeneity, isotropy and rotational accelerations, stationary flows and long-time evolution.<br/> The Navier-Stokes equations describe the basic physics governing the motion of fluid in its various forms of air, water, oil, etc. As such these equations play a fundamental role in science and engineering through the modeling of all varieties of fluid flow, from atmospheric and oceanic circulation to the flow of water beneath the earth's surface. Improved understanding of these equations and their solutions is essential to applications which range from tracking climate change and dispersion of contaminants in the Earth's environment, to more stable aerospace and sea vessel designs. The nonlinearity inherent in these equations makes explicit solutions possible only for the simplest of flows.

The goal of this project is to provide a mathematical framework for the quantification and management of risk in different contexts. Formally, a risk measure is a functional on a space of random variables or stochastic processes. An important aspect of the project will be the study of the mathematical structure of such functionals with a view towards important properties like monotonicity, convexity or time-consistency. But also the tractability of related optimization problems, practical applications and numerical implementations will be investigated. This will involve methods from probability theory, statistics, convex analysis, locally convex vector spaces and numerical mathematics.<br/><br/>The project explores the quantification and management of risks faced by individuals, companies and society in different situations of uncertainty. The main focus of the project is to provide mathematical tools for the assessment, control, mitigation and minimization of risk. Practical problems to be addressed are optimal portfolio allocation; the pricing, hedging and design of financial derivatives; the valuation of complex insurance products such as equity-linked insurance contracts; the determination of capital requirements for banks and insurance companies; coherent attribution of risks; optimal risk transfer between financial institutions; the securitization of risks; integrated risk management; the valuation of energy contracts; the optimal operation of power plants; and the assessment of risk faced by society through financial crises, under-funded pension plans or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. The general treatment of risk and the investigation of different concrete problems are expected to motivate new concepts and the transfer of expertise between different fields. <br/>"

A random sequence is said to satisfy a ""strong mixing condition"" if (according to an appropriate criterion) the amount of stochastic ""dependence"" between the ""past"" and  the ""future"" becomes uniformly arbitrarily small as the amount of ""time"" between past and future becomes sufficiently large.  For random fields, the notions of ""strong mixing"" are similar, involving the uniform asymptotic independence between sets of observations as the ""distance"" between them becomes large.  For such random sequences and random fields, both ""structural properties"" and limit theorems are investigated.  In particular, this proposal involves a continuation of some recent work by the principal investigator in which the central limit theorem is proved for a certain class of random fields under strong mixing  assumptions considerably weaker than in earlier similar theorems by other researchers.    This proposal concerns the study of probabilistic models that involve ""weak dependence,"" in which the ""past"" and ""present"" might have considerable influence on the ""near future"" but much less influence on the ""far future."" For example, the average annual national unemployment rate is one of many phenomena which appear to fit such a model; the unemployment rate for the year 1995 could presumably have considerable effect on the rate for the year 1996 or 1997 but not much effect on the rate for the year 2050.  This proposal involves an investigation into various kinds of ""structural properties"" of probabilistic models of weak dependence, and also various long-term ""laws of averages"" that such models might satisfy.  In particular, part of this proposal involves a continuation of some recent work by the principal investigator which considerably enlarges the class of weak dependence models that are known to satisfy a certain important law of averages. This proposal also concerns the study of  similar types of probabilistic models in which observations are separated by location instead of time."

Many of these questions are set in a group-invariant context and the goal is to understand how geometric or algebraic properties of the group are reflected in probabilistic properties of the processes. The PI is working to establish basic topological properties of higher-dimensional analogues of random forests and to establish conjectures that arise by analogy to percolation. Phase transitions and entropy of other determinantal dynamical systems are also under investigation. Coupling questions are also at the heart of some stochastic comparison inequalities being studied. Basic questions concern comparison of the behavior of random walks in two random environments. <br/> The field of statistical physics is concerned to a great extent with mathematical models of phase transitions (e.g., water to ice). Typically the model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions. This lattice is infinite and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group. The simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in the ground and gas flow through a gas mask. One asks how far fluid can flow, in particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far. This, of course, depends on the density of particles that block the flow; there is a phase transition as the density increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can no longer flow arbitrarily far. One would like to know where that point is and how the probability changes as this critical point is approached. About 15 years ago, several researchers began investigating lattices that are quite different from the usual Euclidean ones that are most familiar and that most closely correspond to our physical world. These new lattices, called nonamenable, are also usually based on groups. Such investigations began out of the usual scientific and mathematical curiosity that drives fundamental research. Within the last 8 years, this area of research, statistical physics on nonamenable groups, has seen an explosion of interest. This area of research turns out to be quite rich and to contain a large number of important fundamental questions whose answers remain unknown. Already, there have been applications to Euclidean lattices of some of the new ideas that have arisen in response to the need to develop new tools for nonamenable groups. <br/>"

Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory.

In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

Such systems can be used to describe chemical reactions, as well as the spread of disease, information, and species through a network. These models often become more meaningful when multiple particle types are incorporated. For example, the celebrated First Passage Percolation model describes the spread of a single species through an environment; the incorporation of competing species enriches the model. This project seeks to study more realistic variants of well-known models for chemical reactions, epidemic outbreaks, and the spread of information as to deepen our understanding of important phenomena from across the sciences and further develop the mathematics that helps explain them. The project will involve the undergraduate students training.<br/><br/>This project will consider five different stochastic multi-type interacting particle systems: (1) The Diffusion-Limited Annihilation model is an annihilating particle system in which collisions between opposite type particles result in mutual annihilation. The version in which particles have different speeds is difficult to study and conjectured to exhibit anomalous behavior when different particle types are initially balanced. (2) The Ballistic Annihilation model has three particle types and all collisions result in annihilation. The limiting particle density in different regimes will be characterized. (3) The Chase-Escape model is a competitive stochastic growth model conjectured to have a coexistence phase even when the predatory species is fitter than the prey. The effect of the environment and fitness of the different species on coexistence will be investigated. (4) The A+B->2A model describes a growing system of infected particles. This process was recently generalized to the continuum, which leads to several new questions at the intersection of discrete and continuous probability, which will be addressed. (5) Lastly, the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model is well-understood on random graphs near the critical connectivity threshold. A natural extension is to have susceptible individuals rewire their connections away from infected individuals. This more realistic modification may change the size of epidemics.

A dramatic change in physical properties may occur as a   critical parameter value is passed. For example, suppose we immerse a large porous solid   in a bucket water. Clearly, how water penetrates the solid depends on the size of the pores    of the solid. A simple mathematical model of such a process is  defined by taking the pores   to be distributed in some regular manner, and to be open or closed with probabilities p or   1-p. There is a critical threshold, for the probability p at which the behavior changes   abruptly. For values of p below the critical value the water penetration is only superficial   and above  it the penetration is arbitrarily deep. The specific behavior near the critical   threshold is more complicated. One of the most challenging problems is to give a   mathematical description of deep penetration near the critical threshold. The research will   focus on three areas: the behaviors of percolation near the critical threshold, above the   critical threshold and below the critical threshold.

In fact, issues and open questions in percolation theory are easy to state, but whose solutions are apparently difficult and require innovative methods. Furthermore, percolation theory is also directly applicable in biology, industry, and computer science. Zhang presents six traditional problems in this field and proposed new methods to solve them. Second, the proposal promotes teaching experiences for Zhang's undergraduate students in areas of engineering, computer science and mathematics. It also offers an opportunity for the students to conduct research activities on percolation problems. Moreover, the proposal also enhances scientific and technological understanding.

The questions proposed here are of value in establishing connections between the theory of Gibbs measures and theoretical computer science which attempts to understand efficiency of algorithms, including those which make use of randomness. Permutations are well studied objects in combinatorics and probability. The investigator hopes that their study under distributions that are not uniformly random will contribute new<br/>methods of analysis and results to this classical subject.

The symposium will include several mathematical talks, including a keynote address given by Lenore Blum of Carnegie Mellon University. There will be parallel sessions in algebra, dynamical systems, geometry and topology, logic, mathematical biology, partial differential equations, and statistics. In addition, there will be a problem session to encourage new collaborations; problems that cut across disciplines are particularly encouraged. The symposium encourages participation of women in various stages of their academic careers, ranging from graduate students to full faculty. <br/><br/>It is not uncommon for women with research talent to drop out of the research community. The talks and the problem session will lead women to new and exciting projects. An extended lunch and other breaks will give participants at various stages in their careers the opportunity discuss mathematical problems, or simply exchange stories. The PI expects that some participants will, in discussions that are not strictly mathematical, learn strategies for staying active in research.<br/><br/>The conference website is at http://www3.nd.edu/~wims/"

In addition to talks by invited speakers on key recent themes in stochastic process research and their important connections to other parts of mathematics and the sciences, there will be opportunities for new researchers to present their research, and for the discussion of open problems, as well as a tutorial on major recent developments in probability.<br/><br/>Stochastic processes are basic building blocks of the way that randomness exhibits itself in the real world, and are used to model a wide range of physical, biological, ecological, and financial phenomena. The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many of the most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year. The morning invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives graduate students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by offering the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found in more traditional meetings. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.<br/><br/>More details are available at the conference website <br/>http://www.mathsci.udel.edu/events/conferences/ssp/Pages/default.aspx"

One can roughly divide  these rates into two categories: the exponential relaxation and  the power law relaxation. The main objective of this research is  to study dynamics with the power law decay. The first goal is to  derive the macroscopic scaling limiting equations rigorously and  then to study various corrections to these equations. In the past  few years, several methods have been developed for these  problems. One of the major restrictions to these methods is a  technical condition called the gradient condition. The  investigator will study several nongradient models, in  particular, the hydrodynamical limit and the rate of relaxation  to equilibrium of lattice gas at finite temperature. A related  problem for lattice gas with random field will also be  considered. Finally, the investigator will study problems related  to a time scale longer than the hydrodynamical scale. These are  particularly important because the incompressible Navier-Stokes  equation is believed to be the long time (diffusive) scaling  limit of Hamiltonian systems.       A basic problem concerning dynamical system is to determine  the rate of approach to the equilibrium. In this research the  investigator will study dynamics with slow relaxation to  equilibrium, which most natural processes follow. Major goals are  to determine the precise rate of relaxation to the equilibrium of  these processes and to derive macroscopic equations governing the  macroscopic behavior of relaxations and then to study various  corrections to these equations. In the past few years, several  methods  have been developed for these problems for several types  of models. But some major restrictions of these methods prohibit  the study of more realistic models. The investigator will study  several models to extend the current technology and to address  some key technical difficulties. Models of interest include: the  lattice gases at finite  temperature, the effect of random  impurities in a lattice gas, and the discrete velocity model  which simulates the  incompressible Navier-Stokes equation."

The first part of the project proposes to change the underlying dynamics to quantum mechanics.  The aim is to show that the Euler equations obtained in the quantum case are similar to the classical ones except all physical quantities should be computed quantum mechanically.  The approach will be based on the relative entropy method and certain extension of large deviation theory to the quantum case.  The second part of the project concerns the dynamics of an electron interacting with a lattice structure, modeled by a phonon field.  Therefore, its dynamics is governed by a Schrodinger equation of an electron coupled to a scalar quantum field.  The goal is to prove that the phase space density of the electron converges to a Boltzmann equation in the weak coupling limit.<br/><br/> The underlying dynamics for electrons in a material are governed by quantum mechanics, or more precisely the Schrodinger equations.  Since the Schrodinger equations are difficult to solve no matter analytically or numerically, most models in use nowadays for transport behavior of electrons are semi-classical ones based on classical particles and diffusions.  Although these semi-classical models are valid approximations for large distance behavior, they neglect crucial quantum effects in small scales.  The aim of this project is to study the transport behavior starting from the first principle---the Schrodinger equations.  In particular, the validity of the Euler and Boltzmann equations will be established from the Schrodinger equations.  This is the first step toward understanding the quantum effects in transport behavior.  The long term goal is to understand quantum corrections to these equations. <br/>"

The unifying thrust is the study of mathematical models of biological systems at the population level. The interplay between various genetic influences such as mutation, selection, and population structure can sometimes confound one's ability to draw valid inference. The first goal is to develop methods of estimation and inference for complex molecular genetic data arising from populations with various kinds of structure. The investigators explore sampling distributions and likelihood methods in the presence of these confounding effects. The second goal involves the study of genealogical processes (i.e., coalescent theory) for populations which are subject to various selective forces, geographical segregation, or other hierarchical structuring. Both sampling theory and coalescent methods provide a framework for computational methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling. The third goal is to study spatial interactions which arise in ecology and epidemiology using interacting particle systems. The problems addressed include several new nonlinear voter models with a cluster-breaking feature and new work on the two-stage contact process, with applications to metapopulation models.<br/> Previous models of the ecology and genetics of natural populations have been based on many simplifying assumptions. It is now important to produce more realistic models to address ecological and evolutionary problems that impact society. In addition to the inherent randomness in real biological systems, spatial structure is often of critical importance. Examples of these problems include the evolution and spread of infectious diseases, invasions of exotic species, and survival of species in fragmented habitats. Furthermore, the technical revolution in gene sequencing is producing huge data sets that can only be deciphered in a sophisticated mathematical framework. The new field of bioinformatics relies heavily on an evolutionary perspective. This interdisciplinary work is part of an ongoing effort to develop and employ new mathematical methods for the purpose of addressing these complex biological problems at the population level. <br/>"

The fundamental questions in these subjects are the Wigner-Dyson universality for the  eigenvalue gap distribution and the extended state conjecture for the  random Schrodinger equations. Since the extended state conjecture is out of the reach of the current technique, we propose to estimate the mean square displacement for the random Schrodinger equations in long time scaling limits in two cases: 1. The random potential is time dependent and has a short time memory. 2. The random potential is given by a phonon field in equilibrium.  Inspired by the same extended state conjecture, we propose to study the localization/delocalization property of eigenvectors of random matrices. Finally, as the first step toward the Wigner-Dyson universality, we propose to estimate the difference between the density of eigenvalues of random matrices in microscopic windows and the Wigner semicircle law. The second project, dynamics of Bose gas, concerns the derivation of the the phenomenological Gross-Pitaevskii equation from the many-body Schrodinger equations. We also propose to estimate precisely the errors between the Gross-Pitaevskii  equation and the many-body Schrodinger equation.

The mathematical model for these systems in the simplest form is given by matrices with random entries. Our first project is designed to provide rigorous proof that conduction does occur in the random matrix models. The second project aim to establish the Gross-Pitaevskii equation---the fundamental equation governing the dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensate (a recent discovered material but was theorized by Bose and Einstein almost a century ago). This project aims to lay rigorous foundation for the description of the dynamics of these systems. The third project concerns regularity of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for axisymmetric flow. This project will not only lead to deeper understanding of the INS equations in general, but the axisymmetric flow is important for modeling atmospheric events such as hurricanes and tornados. Most problems covered in this proposal were studied in their own traditionally fields such as random matrix, mathematical physics, condense matter physics or partial differential equations.  This proposal aims to establish connections between these subjects and to train students and postdoctors with interdiscipline technique and broad scientific perspectives.

RL is also increasingly being used in the physical sciences, for instance for discovering new materials and/or exploring the properties of known materials.

The aim of this project is to develop new probabilistic techniques to describe at various scales the fine statistics of extrema of number-theoretic functions. These techniques will then be applied to related problems in physics and mathematics. The project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate students and graduate students in computer programming, data science and mathematics.<br/><br/>More precisely, the Riemann zeta function (and to a larger extent the Dirichlet L-functions) is a fundamental function in number theory as it encodes the distribution of prime numbers among the integers.

This research project builds on recent progress to describe the large values of the zeta function in short intervals. The current project aims at developing new probabilistic techniques to describe the precise statistics of the large values of the zeta function as the size of the observation interval is varied.  In particular, the research carried out in this project is expected to reveal new hybrid statistics at small scales. The project also seeks to extend the techniques to Dirichlet L-functions, where few results are currently available. The ultimate goal is to build better tools of extreme value theory.

On the other hand OT has established itself as a viable alternative to classical maximum likelihood based methods in analyzing high-dimensional data coming from a manifold. Other notable applications include analysis of neural networks and adversarial networks in machine learning and artificial intelligence, new applications to stem cell biology, and economic applications such as generalizations of the Nobel prize winning Gale-Shapely algorithm, online auctions, and option pricing. Much of these are due to impressive leaps in computational methods in OT that hinge on entropy based regularizations. This project focuses on new probability questions in this area of entropic regularization of optimal transport problems and their applications. The project also provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes problems at the intersection of probability and Monge-Kantorovich OT that are broad and cut across several mathematical and applied disciplines. It brings new probabilistic tools and perspectives (such as exchangeability, Gaussian chaos expansions, Metropolis algorithm, mean-field particle interactions) to problems of mass transport that are of interest to statisticians, computer scientists, analysts and geometers. The primary focus is on the asymptotic analysis of both discrete and continuous entropy-regularized OT, also called Schroedinger bridges, either as the temperature goes to zero or as the data size goes to infinity or both. One of the proposed problems involves Markov chain based computational method for OT, which, if resolved, will have immediate applications to various applied disciplines that depend on OT computations. Other applications involve analysis of transaction costs in mathematical finance and robotics where the dynamics of a large number of interacting drones is described by a novel McKean-Vlasov type limit. A large mathematical audience will find the material close to their interests and the project is expected to spur further cross-disciplinary collaborations between probabilists and non-probabilists working in OT. This is also facilitated by the PI-led PIMS Kantorovich Initiative that creates an infrastructure for interdisciplinary work based on OT located in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Random matrices naturally appear in problems within computer science, statistics, and mathematical physics. Studying random matrices enables one to develop better tools to analyze data, to understand properties of complex quantum systems, and to estimate performance of algorithms. The Principal Investigator (PI) will consider various models of random matrices with the goal of obtaining results that hold with very high probability. Graphs (collections of points connected by edges) have been extensively used as models of communication networks and of data organization. For example, social networks and the World Wide Web can be efficiently modeled as random graphs. Understanding characteristics of random walks on graphs helps to evaluate the speed of information exchange in networks. Moreover, random walks on certain graphs have been used for sampling, that is, constructing typical instances of complex objects. The PI will study properties of random walks on graphs by employing tools of functional analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>The two main parts of this research are analysis of singular spectrum and eigenvalues of certain models of square random matrices, and functional inequalities on graphs. The PI will focus on studying the singularity probability of random square matrices, which is of interest in numerical analysis and combinatorics. Further, the PI will consider limiting laws for the spectrum of random matrices for previously unexplored models. The tools developed as part of this research should find applications in other problems within combinatorial and non-asymptotic random matrix theory. Secondly, the PI will apply functional analytic tools to study concentration and mixing on various graphs, including spaces of regular graphs, and Catalan structures. The goal of this part of the project is to obtain sharp estimates for mixing and relaxation times for random walks on those graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such degenerate diffusions in high or infinite dimensions have many applications in different fields including  quantum field theory (QFT), turbulence, chemical dynamics, and large data environments. While they are useful in modelling many of such phenomena, degenerate and high-dimensional nature of the setting pose mathematical challenges. A number of the projects are for graduate and possibly undergraduate students. In addition, the results will be used for mentoring and educational activities at the local middle school and at the undergraduate level.<br/><br/>One of the directions of research is to study Cameron-Martin-Girsanov type quasi-invariance in hypoelliptic settings, and its applications to functional inequalities, smoothness of probability laws in subelliptic and singular settings. This is closely related to asymptotic behavior of such diffusions, namely, large deviations, the Onsager?Machlup functional which can be viewed as an analog of the Lagrangian of a dynamical system, and convergence to equilibrium of a large particle system with singular potentials. Both degeneracy (lack of ellipticity) and high dimensions have to be dealt with new techniques coming from different fields such as probability,  ergodic theory and sub-Riemannian geometry. While many of these settings arise naturally in applications, their mathematical analysis is not easy. In addition to theoretical significance of such questions, some answers have practical uses.

At the transition point, the properties of the system such as the volume or heat capacity may change discontinuously. The aim of our research is to study phase transitions in mathematical models using probabilistic tools in the following three directions. (1) The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a permutation is the length of a maximal subsequence of the permutation in which the elements increase. How long is the LIS for a uniformly random permutation? This question has been studied in connection with practical applications such as sorting sequences, disk drive scheduling and airplane boarding times. The mathematical study of the LIS has revealed deep and unexpected connections of the problem with areas such as the theory of random matrices, analytic combinatorics and random polymer models.  The proposed research aims to study the LIS when the permutation is drawn from certain non-uniform distributions and associated phase transitions. (2) Many computational problems can be phrased as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) where one wants to find a solution to a number of variables with a set of constraints imposed on them. CSPs were first studied in computer science motivated by applications to artificial intelligence. To study the difficulty of finding solutions in typical rather than worst case scenarios, researchers study random CSPs. Using sophisticated heuristics, physicists have made detailed predictions about the location and nature of phase transitions in random CSPs. The accuracy of these heuristic predictions motivates the importance of discovering the rigorous mathematical foundations of these techniques. (3) Interacting particle processes are used to model large, randomly evolving interacting systems of agents that arise in the natural sciences including in physics and in biology. The exclusion and interchange random walks are examples of such interacting particle processes. In the symmetric case the long term mixing behavior of the random walk and the nature of phase transitions is well studied. The goal of this research is to understand the mixing properties of natural asymmetric and weighted versions of these processes. While achieving these three goals, the principal investigator will create exciting research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in probability, mentoring programs with the goal of retention of women in mathematics, and the development of online curricular material.<br/><br/>The main aim of this project is to develop new theory and analysis for phase transitions in certain discrete probabilistic models. The first problem is to study the limiting distribution of the LIS in non-uniformly random permutations by way of analyzing the fluctuations of the LIS as the parameter of the distribution is varied. The distribution is known to be Gaussian in one regime of the parameter and Tracy-Widom in another and we aim to study this transition. The second problem is to study the condensation and clustering transitions in random CSPs such as the hardcore model on random graphs. The research aims to identify the location of the reconstruction threshold more precisely in these models and to explore the connection to the clustering transition. Finally, the proposal will consider Markov processes such as asymmetric exclusion and interchange and attempt to relate the mixing times and spectral gaps of these processes to the corresponding quantities for a single particle and to understand the cutoff phenomenon for these processes."

The first is on random interacting systems of particles, which serve as probabilistic models for phenomena ranging from the spread of infections to the growth of populations of competing organisms. Even the simplest examples of such particle systems are not fully understood. This project is focused on a system in a larger family known as A + B -> 2B models studied by physicists as models for combustion. The system has recently been shown to display surprising behavior on finite and infinite trees, which this project will explore further. The other major question to be pursued is on random trees, another common model throughout the sciences. This project investigates equations arising from random trees whose solutions are related to the existence or nonexistence of certain classifications of trees into categories.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is to study a system of interacting random walks known as the frog model. In this process, inactive particles are placed on a graph. One particle then becomes active and performs a random walk, waking any particles it encounters. These particles then start their own random walks, waking any particles they encounter, and so on. Recent work by the PI has shown that the model exhibits phase transitions between transience and recurrence on infinite trees and between different cover time regimes on finite trees. The project proposes proving the existence of an additional weak recurrence phase on the infinite tree and an intermediate cover time phase on the finite tree. A potential route to this lies in further finer analysis of recursive distributional equations, working first with toy models. The other proposed project explores classifications of trees that follow rules given by automata. The prototypical example is the classification of trees according to whether they contain an infinite binary subtree starting at the root. This classification obeys a recursive rule (namely that a tree is in the class if and only if at least two root child subtrees are) that can be described by a tree automaton. This rule induces a fixed-point equation that one can use to compute the probability of a Galton-Watson tree being in this class. This project will investigate further the relationship between the classifications, the tree automata, and the fixed-point equations. Two approaches to the problem are probabilistic investigation of the random trees and other branching processes arising from them, and the direct analytic investigation of the fixed-point equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focal points of this proposal - smoothness, quasi-invariance, and Taylor isomorphisms - are fundamental principles in the study of measures in infinite dimensions. Although these concepts have their own intrinsic interest, one may motivate their study by physical applications. For example, in quantized classical mechanics, it is standard practice to perform integration over certain infinite-dimensional spaces with respect to ""infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure."" Of course, this measure does not exist, and the appropriate replacement is Wiener measure or, for an infinite-dimensional curved space, heat kernel measure. As the integral computations physicists perform routinely involve changes of variable and differentiation, quasi-invariance and more general smoothness results for heat kernel measures are critical in giving a mathematical foundation to these formal computations. Taylor isomorphism theorems are also significant to physical applications as they are related to the important problem of quantizing Yang-Mills fields which form a key part of the ""standard model"" of particle physics. The study of hypoelliptic heat kernel measures are important in the study of sub-Riemannian geometries that appear in physical models.<br/><br/>This is an integrated project of research and training in probability. The research program focuses on the study of so-called ?heat kernel measures? in infinite dimensions. Consider a curved surface (like the Earth) to which one applies a unit of heat at a fixed point and then steps away and allows the heat to propagate. The heat kernel measure describes the evolution of the proportion of heat in subsets of the surface at some later time. As the manner in which heat diffuses relies heavily on the geometric and topological properties of the relevant space, the heat kernel measure reflects these properties and analysis of this measure reveals much about the space on which it lives. Heat kernel measures are the natural generalization to curved spaces of Gaussian measures (higher dimensional analogues of the normal distribution) which have for many decades been recognized as the appropriate measures to conduct infinite-dimensional analysis. Infinite-dimensional spaces often show up in physical models; in particular, infinite-dimensional groups appear in quantum field theory and quantum mechanics. Thus, this research program contributes to solidifying a rigorous mathematical framework for the study of quantum physics. Many of the applications have finite-dimensional models which are accessible to undergraduates or beginning graduate students.  Thus, this project has a significant training component, including involving undergraduates in research on related problems in finite dimensions.  The training program also includes mentoring of graduate students in an introduction to math outreach and promoting the retention and visibility of women researchers in probability."

Both workshops are part of a larger interdisciplinary thematic program on ""Probabilities and PDEs"" held at CRM from January to July 2022. Probability theory and the theory of partial differential equations (PDEs) are important areas of mathematics with substantial overlap in their methods and goals. In both fields, one of the major aims is to provide accurate models of how engineered, physical, chemical and biological systems change over time. Probability frequently focuses on how systems which are random and/or unpredictable at the microscopic level can become highly ordered at the macroscopic level. PDE theory frequently focuses on the spatial and temporal evolution of such macroscopic systems. For decades there has been a fruitful interplay between the two fields probability and PDEs, with both intuitions and mathematical techniques from each area finding application in the other. <br/><br/>This project focuses on two aspects of that interplay, which are both related to how probabilistic particle systems resemble PDEs when sufficiently ""zoomed out"". One of these, the area of mean-field games, describes scaling limits of strategically controlled interacting agents evolving as diffusions coupled via a graph structure (often the complete graph).

The goal of the work is to understand the behavior of such systems as the number of particles becomes large and/or when the system is in operation for a long time. One is interested in characterizing typical behavior, probabilities of fluctuations from the typical behavior, and also of non-typical large deviations from the expected behavior. The work will lead to an understanding of divergence of predictions based on deterministic models from the actual noisy systems and provide guidance for operating procedures that incorporate the associated uncertainties. It will also provide insight on properties of these systems over suitable spatial and temporal scales. The project includes research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>Under suitable scaling, hydrodynamical limits of empirical measures of such particle systems can be characterized through partial differential equations (PDE) for Stefan type free boundary problems (FBP). Several types of asymptotic problems associated with such particle systems will be studied. These include hydrodynamic limits, diffusion approximations, large deviation principles, and ergodicity behavior under suitable scaling of space, volume and time. Work on large deviations will require the development of the theory for families of measure valued processes whose scaling limits are described through FBP. A key component will be the development of the uniqueness theory for families of controlled FBP and an analysis of Euler-Lagrange equations associated with certain calculus of variations problems. In another direction, the local stability structure of extremal invariant distributions of some infinite particle versions of these systems will be studied. In addition to this being a fundamental problem in the ergodic theory of infinite dimensional Markov processes, here it also arises from applications to load balancing algorithms for large queuing systems. The behavior of multiplicity of invariant distributions for infinite particle systems has counterparts in other interacting particle systems. Examples include multiplicity of traveling wave solutions of FBP associated with scaling limits of certain types of particle systems, and multiplicity of quasi-stationary distributions associated with Markov processes with absorption approximated by Fleming-Viot type particle systems.

The version in which particles have different speeds is difficult to study and conjectured to exhibit anomalous behavior when different particle types are initially balanced. (2) The Ballistic Annihilation model has three particle types and all collisions result in annihilation. The limiting particle density in different regimes will be characterized. (3) The Chase-Escape model is a competitive stochastic growth model conjectured to have a coexistence phase even when the predatory species is fitter than the prey. The effect of the environment and fitness of the different species on coexistence will be investigated. (4) The A+B->2A model describes a growing system of infected particles. This process was recently generalized to the continuum, which leads to several new questions at the intersection of discrete and continuous probability, which will be addressed.

These give rise rise to an interface, a random surface separating the plus/minus phases, and the PI aims to study the entropic repulsion effect conditioned on this interface being positive. The main goal is to show that, in order to gain entropy, the surface gradually rises, and its level lines eventually form a single plateau with an a.s. scaling limit given by a Wulff shape; the level line exhibit cube-root fluctuations away from the boundary; and started at a flat initial state, the evolution of the surface towards equilibrium goes through a sequence of meta-stable plateaus, each with a waiting time doubly-exponential in its height. A related research direction aims to study a class of crystal models that approximate 3D Ising, and show that the scaling limit in terms of a Wulff shape and cube-root fluctuations are universal for that entire class. For the (2+1)D Solid-On-Solid, the goal is to refine our understanding and obtain the order of the fluctuations in the top level line. The final topic to be studied concerns crystal models such as Solid-On-Solid at low temperature when the boundary condition is tilted, which is known to cause the (otherwise flat) surface to become de-localized. Here the goal is to give quantitative bounds on the height fluctuations, and show that Glauber dynamics is no longer exponentially slow due to meta-stable states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a framework to assess properties of estimators and statistical tests, necessary for a high level of confidence in predictions. The large sample theory, first developed for independent variables, is considerably more difficult when data is dependent, that is, when quantities have dependencies that relate their values. The questions become even more challenging when the random variations are changing with time. The goal of this research is to address these questions by developing new methods to analyze large samples selected from classes of dependent structures arising in many applied fields, such as data from economics or engineering.  <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to develop new techniques for studying sequences and fields of dependent random variables, which will lead to sharp inequalities and general limit theorems for both stationary and non-stationary additive functionals of Markov chains and other dependent structures. The PI plans to develop a new type of approximation with martingales for Markov chains and fields based on the fruitful idea of conditioning with respect to both past and future of the process. The advantage of this new, surprising method is that no restrictions on the rate of convergence to zero of the dependence coefficients is required for obtaining various limit theorems. The PI also aims to develop operator perturbation theory for non-stationary Markov chains and functions of independent random elements.

For example, cellular processes, fluctuations in stock prices, weather patterns, movement of microscopic particles exhibit different types of random behaviors. Furthermore, randomness is a vital ingredient in most modern algorithms that are popular in data-science.  Hence, it is of fundamental importance that various types of randomness are properly characterized for detailed understanding of system properties. Mathematical models incorporating such randomness are typically expressed in terms of stochastic equations, which often have complex dynamics.  An important component of mathematical studies of these equations includes computer simulations of their temporal evolution, which are necessary for understanding their behavioral patterns over time. Accurate statistical estimation of some key parameters of these stochastic equations from observed data is also crucial, as it leads to the ""most appropriate mathematical model"" underlying these data points. This in turn leads to better predictive power of such models. The research supported by this award will undertake proper mathematical analyses of various numerical schemes that are used for these purposes. More specifically, research in this direction will involve precise calculations of probabilities of getting accurate results from these schemes and will describe conditions under which these probabilities are very high. There is a critical need for such theoretical results, since they will inevitably lead to design of faster and more efficient algorithms, which in turn will be beneficial to society. The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will help them to gain valuable analytical and computational skills. The results of the project will be published in well-known scientific journals and will also be presented at domestic and international conferences. <br/> <br/>The research will focus on the limiting behaviors of complex stochastic systems discretized by properly scaled step sizes. Discretization is at the heart of various numerical schemes, but its effect on the desired convergence properties is not always clearly understood. For example, it is well known that approximating stationary distribution of an ergodic stochastic differential equation (SDE) by time averages of sample paths obtained from an Euler-Maruyama type discretization scheme (using fixed step-size) could be problematic. In particular, such an estimator will have a bias, which may or may not be quantifiable. These are infinite-time horizon problems, and there is a deficit of proper asymptotic results in this direction even for regular Ito-diffusions. Exploring proper scaling techniques to get desired convergence along with convergence rates for such discretization-based schemes is the central goal of this project. Stochastic models that will be considered covers switching jump-diffusion models, multiscale systems and systems of interacting SDEs with possible jumps. The last class is particularly important for understanding particle-based methods for approximating nonlinear integro-differential equations including Boltzmann-type equations. These equations are connected to appropriate systems of interacting SDEs with jumps through McKean-Vlasov type limits. The stochastic equations of interest will also include Langevin SDEs, which model dynamics of molecular systems in presence of particle interaction potential, damping and random forces, and which also play a pivotal role in certain Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms.  The research puts special emphasis on large deviation asymptotics of error probabilities, which, importantly, because of presence of both upper and lower bounds, give the optimal exponential decay rate. <br/> <br/>This project is jointly funded by Probability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these models have remarkable algebraic and combinatorial properties, which makes their study tractable. The main goal of the project is to obtain a detailed description (involving exact mathematical formulas) of the asymptotic behavior of these random systems as their size (volume and/or the number of particles) grows.  <br/><br/>The project involves three interwined directions of research. The first involves the derivation and asymptotic analysis of joint observables for integrable models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A distinguished feature of integrable models is that they allow for various exact formulas of different observables. A notorious problem with many of these formulas is that they are difficult to study asymptotically, due to the presence of hard to control cross-terms, and one of the goals of the project is to develop a framework for analyzing these cross-terms. The second direction of the project is to establish universal scaling limits for Gibbsian line ensembles. Various integrable models, such as Hall-Littlewood processes and the log-gamma polymer, naturally carry a structure of a line ensemble and it is expected that these ensembles converge to the parabolic Airy line ensemble (one of the universal scaling limits in the KPZ universality class) -- the project seeks to establish this statement.

This research project aims to broaden understanding of the universality phenomenon of random matrices and to develop new tools and techniques for more applications of random matrix theory.  <br/><br/>The project will explore two research directions related to random matrix theory. In the first direction, the project aims to understand the spectral properties of adjacency matrices of random d-regular graphs.

The transformations in question include several versions of the Hilbert transform on the integers in dimension one and on the lattice in several dimensions. These basic transformations were introduced by David Hilbert at the beginning of the 20th century as simpler models of their continuous counterparts. For many applications, discrete models are much simpler from the point of view of computations. One of the goals of the project is to show that the magnitudes of the discrete transformations, as measured by certain summability properties of the sequences they transform, coincide with those of their continuous counterparts. Related geometric problems concerning the long time behavior of Brownian motion and more general stochastic processes under certain natural constrains, will be studied as well.<br/><br/>The project deals with several problems and conjectures for sharp inequalities which lie at the interface of probability, harmonic analysis and spectral, potential theoretic, and geometric properties of the Laplacian and the fractional Laplacian. A problem of significant interest in the early part of the 20th century was the question of how the size of a periodic function controls the size of its conjugate, where the size is measured by the Lebesgue Lp-norm, where p is strictly between 1 and infinity. In 1925, M. Riesz answered this question in his celebrated paper on the Lp boundedness of the Hilbert transform and showed that this implies the same for the discrete version acting on the space of doubly infinite sequences in little lp. Shortly thereafter, E.C. Titchmarsh gave a direct proof of the boundedness of the discrete Hilbert transform and showed that the norms of these two operators are equal. The following year Titchmarsh pointed out that his argument for equality was incorrect. The question of equality had been a long-standing open problem since 1927. In a recent publication, M. Kwasnicki and the PI solved this problem by identifying the sharp lp bound for the discrete Hilbert transform which turns out to be the same as the sharp Lp bound found for the continuous version found by Pichorides in the early 70's. The first part of this project discusses closely related problems for discrete operators in one and several dimensions.

Of particular importance is understanding the precise nature of convergence in high dimensions in the presence of singular coefficients in the equations.  Such singularities arise naturally in the context of molecular dynamics (e.g. Lennard-Jones, Coloumb potential functions) as they are used to describe repulsive effects as particles approach one another.  Although natural from a modeling and statistical standpoint, the singularities lead to challenges in both analyzing the dynamics itself as well as in analyzing the corresponding numerical simulation due to energy spikes generated by the singular interactions.  The second part focuses on studying large-time properties of various statistical models in turbulence.  In each of these models, there is also a source of energy often leading to interesting effects in equilibrium such as, for example, heavy-tailed invariant measures.  Understanding how randomness, nonlinearities, dissipation as well as the excitation balance out to produce these interesting effects is of central importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Probability densities for this stochastic process solve the classical diffusion equation. A continuous time random walk is a simple random walk subordinated to a renewal process, used in physics to model anomalous diffusion. Increments of the simple random walk represents particle jumps, and the renewal epochs represent the particle jump times. Infinite variance particle jumps cause superdiffusion, in which a cloud of particles spreads faster than the classical model predicts. Infinite mean waiting times lead to subdiffusion. Scaling limits of continuous time random walks are stochastic processes whose densities solve fractional partial differential equations. Infinite variance particle jumps lead to operator stable Levy motions, while infinite mean waiting times induce subordination to an inverse stable subordinator. Fractional derivatives are generators of stable continuous convolution semigroups. The research funded by this grant is developing a sound mathematical basis for this physical theory, and pursuing practical applications to problems in contaminant transport. The goals of this research include limit theory for continuous time random walks with possible dependence between the jump sizes and the waiting times, extension to more realistic multidimensional jump vectors with matrix scaling to allow different rates of particle spreading in each coordinate, parallel development of multiscaling fractional derivative operators in space, analysis of the fundamental physical basis of fractional diffusion to elucidate the physical meaning of the model parameters, development of useful statistical methods for parameter estimation, numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations, and application of these methods to real data from laboratory and field experiments and remediation efforts involving porous media and fracture flow. <br/> Movement of contaminants in a mountain stream takes place over a vast range of time scales. A majority will move away quickly, but a small amount can be caught in eddies for minutes or days. Another fraction may move into the relatively motionless water beneath the streambed, and it may take months or years for the last molecules to disappear completely. The movement of contaminants in underground water spreads over a similar range of time scales. Our team of mathematicians and hydrogeologists uses modern interdisciplinary research methods to develop accurate models for the movement and spread of these contaminants. Much more than an academic exercise, this work is needed for realistic models of contaminant and nutrient movement in drinking water supplies. The research is necessary because existing diffusion models greatly underestimate the time and concentration at which contaminants arrive downstream, when compared to actual data."

Study of nonequilibrium stationary states for systems in classical mechanics coupled to heat reservoirs, - in particular the study of stochastic partial differential equations arising from a model of semilinear wave equations coupled to one or several reservoirs described by linear wave equations at positive temperature. The goal is to prove existence and uniqueness of the stationary state, determine the rate of convergence and study the transport properties of the system. 2. Development of probabilistic methods to study the ergodic properties of open quantum systems coupled to reservoirs of bosons and fermions - in particular investigating and developing tools to study the ergodic properties of quantum Markov semigroups and quantum stochastic differential equations and combining them with spectral methods to prove ergodic properties for open quantum systems. 3.

The proposal addresses some of these questions, which are related for example to material sciences. Also a new field, loosely speaking ``quantum probability'', has emerged in the last few years, driven by applications such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing.

One of the more striking examples is that we still lack a fully rigorous understanding how fluid equations arise from molecular interactions.  The investigator will attempt to make progress on this problem and others by applying recently-developed techniques in the theory of stochastic homogenization.  The work will have an interdisciplinary character, mixing results from probability and analysis.  The project will make use of computer simulation to empirically test ideas during development of the theory.<br/><br/>Techniques in quantitative stochastic homogenization, particularly those used to obtain optimal rates in the elliptic setting, are now mature enough to attack problems that previously did not seem to be amenable to this approach.  The basic homogenization idea remains the same, namely, to view the microscopic models as perturbations of their smooth macroscopic limits.  The key new insight is that the regularity theory of the macroscopic limit often has a microscopic analogue.  Examples of possible applications include the derivation of the Landau equation as a scaling limit of interacting particles and Anderson localization for a Bernoulli potential on the lattice.  This approach has already proved successful, and the investigator expects it to continue to yield new results."

Recent study on this topic by the PI and his collaborators has led to solutions for a number of long-standing open problems including an approximation of cover times up to multiplicative constant posed by Aldous-Fill, the Winkler-Zukerman blanket time conjecture, the asymptotic relation between cover times and discrete Gaussian free fields for bounded degree graphs, the order of the variance for the maximum of the two-dimensional discrete Gaussian free field, and the critical behavior for Aldous' percolation of averages in the mean-field setting. A general underlying principle in the aforementioned works is to employ tree structures associated with the random processes, highlighted by an application of Fernique-Talagrand majorizing measure theory in the study of cover times of random walks. The main focus of the project is to understand extreme values of various processes via further exploring associated tree structures.  Despite efforts by the PI and a list of other researchers, a number of outstanding questions remain open in this area, such as the asymptotics and concentration phenomenon for cover times in general graphs, the limiting law for the centered maximum and the scaling limit of the extremal process for 2D discrete Gaussian free field, as well as percolation of averages in high dimensions and first passage percolation on social networks.<br/><br/>The research on extreme values has a number of facets including the typical magnitude, the concentration phenomenon, and the limit in law.

Special attention will be devoted to cover times of random walks, discrete Gaussian free field, percolation of averages, as well as first passage percolation on social networks.  From a theoretical perspective, our study reveals conceptual connections among topics that have been studied separately, and further understand interesting aspects of important random processes such as random walks (arguably the most studied stochastic processes by mathematicians) and Gaussian free fields (an object that is of fundamental interest in statistical physics). From a practical perspective, the research is motivated by applications in areas including computer science, operation research and social network. For instances, the cover time of a random walk has applications in computer science such as testing graph connectivity and protocol testing; studying first passage percolation on social networks is of significance to understand the spread of information/epidemics, and in turn is likely to provide insight on optimal strategies to manage the flow of information or to preclude infections of diseases."

Second, there are models of electrical properties of randomly composited materials.  Third, there are models which lie in the intersection of the previous two categories, such as those for fluid flow in porous media.

The PI is primarily interested in three models: the Abelian sandpile, random walks in random environments, and first passage percolation.  The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena."

The dominant theme of the research will be the effect of the network geometry on the behavior of the epidemic processes, especially near critical values of the transmission rate parameter(s). Two large classes of network geometries, Euclidean and hyperbolic, will be studied. Euclidean geometries are appropriate for models of geographically structured populations, such as plants along a river bed; here, for instance, the network might consist of individual nodes arranged in communities placed at the vertices of a regular lattice, with interactions restricted to nodes in the same or neighboring communities. Hyperbolic geometries (such as those arising in expander graphs or ?small worlds? models) are in many instances more appropriate for human populations and computer networks, where interactions do not follow a regular geographic pattern. Both finite and infinite networks will be studied. The primary objective will be the description of large-population and/or large network limiting behavior.<br/><br/>Stochastic epidemic models are closely related to a number of other large classes of stochastic processes, and these will play a large role in the research project. Epidemics of SIR type (susceptible, infected, removed) are at least in simple cases equivalent to bond percolation on the network. Epidemics of SIS type are contact processes. In Euclidean geometries, many of these processes have measure-valued scaling limits that obey stochastic partial differential equations of reaction-diffusion type. A secondary objective of the research will be to understand the threshold phenomena and phase transitions that occur in some of these related processes, and to explore how these are mirrored in epidemic models.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Epidemics -- in human and animal populations, but also in computer and communications networks -- arise from chance events. These are, in many cases, simple but uncontrollable events: A passenger on a bus might or might not touch a guard rail that has been contaminated by MIRSA bacteria; a computer user might or might not click on an attachment to an email message informing him that a wealthy businessman in Nigeria is asking for his help in transferring 30 million dollars out of the country. These chance encounters are, however, repeated in large numbers, by thousands of people, hundreds of times, and so they occur with statistically predictable frequencies. This makes it possible -- at least in principle -- to predict the course of an epidemic in a large population.<br/><br/>This research project is concerned with the study of simple mathematical models of epidemic processes. The particular emphasis of the study will be on understanding how the underlying geometry of the network of individuals or communications nodes through which the epidemic propagates affects its course."

The research is intended to improve the way statisticians                  interpret data from processes that evolve over time.  Main cases                are (1) long term medical data, where patients are followed over                a period of time, and (2) economic data.  These quite different                 types of settings can be studied with a relatively unified                      technology, which relates to the theory of fair games.                          Substantial gains in how data are interpreted can be obtained by                further exploiting this connection."

In the first part, the limit order book of an electronic exchange will be modeled as a queueing system, evolving as a measure-valued process, where the measure in question is the set of order sizes located on the price axis. Like many queueing systems, the evolution of the order book at the level of discrete orders is prohibitively complex. Therefore, the theory of heavy traffic limits for queueing systems will be used to obtain continuous approximations to the discrete systems. In the second part of the proposal, models for asset price volatility will be developed. Local volatility models currently in use describe volatility as a function of time and the underlying asset price. We propose to extend this concept to models in which volatility is a function of time, the underlying asset price, and one or more factors that determine the payoff of derivative securities written on the underlying asset. The third part of the proposal continues work on optimal investment and consumption in the presence of transaction costs. These problems are well understood and there are closed-form solutions in cases where transaction costs are zero, but there are no closed-form solutions in the more realistic case when transaction costs are positive.<br/>It is proposed to develop asymptotic expansions in the small transaction cost parameter of the unknown solution around the zero-transaction-cost known solution.<br/><br/>In overview, it is proposed to build mathematical models designed to reduce risk and increase efficiency in financial markets. Innovations in the financial markets have changed their structure, and analysis needs to keep pace. In particular, the advent of order-driven electronic exchanges has spawned the growth of algorithmic trading, whereby firms trade large quantities of assets quickly. Does this make markets liquid? Does it dampen or amplify volatility? It is difficult to answer these questions because we do not have good mathematical models for these exchanges. Neither can we predict with any accuracy how various order-matching protocols on these exchanges will affect volatility, bid-ask spreads, and general market efficiency. A major part of this proposal is the development of mathematical models for electronic exchanges. A second aspect of this proposal is to improve mathematical models for asset price volatility. The celebrated Black-Scholes model assumes that volatility is constant, but departures from this assumption in financial markets are too significant to ignore. The third part of this proposal is to better understand the effect of transaction costs on problems of optimal investment and consumption. This problem is at the heart of equilibrium analysis of financial markets, but most studies to date make the unrealistic assumption that transaction costs are zero."

The rules of the sandpile are simple: given a configuration of ""chips"" on an infinite chessboard (i.e., the integer lattice), one can ""topple"" any square with at least 4 chips, by sending one chip from this square to each of its four neighboring squares.  When begun from a single large stack of chips and continued until no square has more than 3 chips, the result is a striking fractal configuration.  Studying this process has lead to the discovery of surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics, and this project aims to leverage these new connections both for the sake of a deeper understanding of the sandpile process, and to enrich our understandings of these other areas as well.  This area of mathematics has connections with phase transitions and conformal field theory in physics as well.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project concerns the so-called Abelian sandpile model of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld.  By identifying new connections between integer superharmonic functions, Apollonian circle packings, and certain regular tilings of the Euclidean plane, we are now able to characterize the scaling limit of the sandpile and analyze its local fractal structure. This project has two primary goals.  The first is to extend our knowledge of the sandpile: for example, we would like to strengthen the kind of convergence we can prove the sandpile process admits, characterize solutions to long-studied instances of the Dirichlet problem for the sandpile, and extend our knowledge of the scaling limit of the sandpile process beyond the universe of the square lattice.  On the other hand, we would like to bring new perspectives developed for our analysis of the sandpile to bear on other areas, with the possibility of confirming number-theoretic conjectures regarding Apollonian circle packings, or characterizing tilings of the plane with certain symmetry properties."

This is a two-person game, played by a<br/>bond-holder, who can convert the bond for stock, and the issuing firm,<br/>which can call the bond and thereby force conversion or surrender.<br/>(2) Contingent claim replication under portfolio constraints.  A<br/>financial institution takes a position in assets which produce a risky<br/>cash flow, and wishes to offset this risk by taking opposing positions. <br/>However, there may be constraints on its actions, or the offsetting<br/>positions mandated by the model employed may be too unstable to actually<br/>implement.  The effect of such constraints can be studied via a dual<br/>problem.<br/>(3) Passport options.  A passport option entitles its owner to actively<br/>manage a fund, receive any profit which accrues, and be forgiven any<br/>loss which occurs.  The institution selling this option must observe the<br/>trading activity of the option owner and solve a stochastic control<br/>problem to determine how to react to the owner's trading so as to be<br/>able to cover losses the owner incurs.<br/>(4) Credit derivatives.

In a further project the relation between characteristic length and renormalization will be investigated. A project focuses on phase coexistence in Ising-Potts models and it is concerned with the microscopic properties of the Wulff droplet and of other interfaces, and with the analysis of phase coexistence in the presence of several phases. Decay of correlations and the relaxation of boundary effects in FK percolation (and indirectly in Potts models) is the target of two further projects.  The study of capacitated networks is proposed by using sophisticated large deviation methods which have proven to be decisive in other context.<br/><br/> The aim of this project is to gain insight and achieve understanding of certain fundamental systems having their origin in statistical and condensed matter physics, materials science, chemistry and earth sciences.  Success in solving some of the proposed problems would lead to some of the following benefits: 1) the derivation of rigorous knowledge about fundamental physical systems of theoretical and practical relevance, 2) a deeper insight into the mechanisms responsible for the behavior of such systems, 3) the development of new mathematical methods and tools which, apart from yielding answers to questions raised in other fields, might benefit and enrich probability theory itself. <br/>"

Shreve<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Work is proposed in two areas.  The first is the analysis of queueing<br/>systems with deadlines under heavy traffic conditions.  Consider a<br/>queueing system with renewal process arrival streams.  Suppose that<br/>upon arrival, each customer is assigned a lead time, the amount of time<br/>until the customer's deadline for service elapses.  One can model the lead<br/>times of the customers in queue at a station as a counting measure on the<br/>real line, the location of the point masses corresponding to customer lead<br/>times.  Research will address the convergence of these measure-valued<br/>processes under heavy-traffic scaling.  Research will also be directed to<br/>mathematical models for finance.  On such model is for an option on a<br/>traded account.  For the simplest of these, an account trading one<br/>underlying geometric Brownian motion and a constant-interest-rate money<br/>market, there is a strikingly simple optimal rule: hold the geometric<br/>Brownian motion long when the account value is negative and short when<br/>the account value is positive.  For an option on two geometric Brownian<br/>motions, there is a conjectured optimal rule, which is supported by<br/>numerical analysis.  The proof appears to require the development of new<br/>mathematics.  A second mathematical finance problem concerns the<br/>development of a unifying model for risk-neutral pricing of credit<br/>derivatives.<br/><br/>This research has two parts.  The subject of the first part, queueing<br/>systems with deadlines, arise in communication networks, especially<br/>networks used to transmit digitized video or audio signals.  Data which<br/>are too long delayed can cause unacceptable disruption  of the signal.<br/>The proposed research  will provide a basis for performance analysis of<br/>heavily-loaded communication networks which take deadlines into account.<br/>The subject of the second part, mathematical models for finance, builds on<br/>the revolution in finance begun by the Black-Scholes option pricing <br/>formula.  The particular work proposed here  is concerned with proper<br/>pricing and usage of financial instruments whose purpose is to insure<br/>against loss, either due to drastic reduction in market value (options on<br/>a traded account) or default (credit derivatives)."

The broad array of topics covered should provide a wonderful overview of the field of probability to the younger participants in attendance, and will also offer opportunities for researchers to form connections between different areas of research within probability theory. <br/><br/>The website for the conference is http://stochasticconference.wordpress.com/."

These notions will be  studied from two interlaced viewpoints. One is that of various dynamical systems and the other is that of geometric measure theory as applied to recursively generated objects. These approaches naturally meld with one another and lead to some interesting mixtures of ideas. During the last few years we have developed a fairly extensive theory of the iteration of infinitely many uniformly contracting conformal maps(hyperbolic systems) and have made some applications of it to some well known problems. We would like to extend this theory to cover a more structured iteration of maps-whose governed by directed graphs or  substitutions and random iterations. We also wish to apply our theory to  geometric object obtained as limit sets of Kleinian groups or more generally a system of maps which are not uniformly contracting(parabolic systems). We intend to develop the tools necessary to  apply our theory to continue obtaining new results about the geometric structure of sets of continued fractions and relationships to classical arithmetic density results. We also plan to develop an appropriate multifractal formalism for our systems. We want to use these tools to describe some aspects of the geometry of the Julia sets of Collett-Eckmann rational functions. Finally, we want to obtain some approximation theorems which should be useful for obtaining analogues of known section and projection theorems concerning Hausdorff measures and dimension to packing measures and dimension and other mixed geometric measures. The specific problems of this proposal arise from many contexts and their solutions will involve a mixture of techniques from various areas: complex analysis, dynamics, functional  analysis-theory of positive operators of the Reulle-Perron-Frobeni us type(transfer operators), measure theory and probability, statistical physics-equilibrium states, and thermodynamic formalism.    This work arises from problems occurring in several diverse areas-statistical physics, thermodynamics, the theory of turbulence, geometry, algorithms or recipes for generating various geometric objects which are subject to random  errors and finally, to dynamical systems where the long term behavior of   the system is governed by some seemingly strange object. Our work focuses  on some common features of all of these systems. First, we intend to show  how, in a natural way, to produce measures associated with each system.  For some systems, these measures give us a means of measuring the long term behavior of the system. For some systems, it gives us a means of quantifying the fine scale geometric structure of the object produced or of stating what the geometric structure will be like on average. To each of these measures is associated a dimension, a number which might not be an integer-a fractal dimension. These dimension numbers can be computed or estimated by some basic  formulas which we have developed. This is useful for applications. This part can be carried out with the aid of computer studies and thus is of direct interest for pratical reasons.  We intend to continue to develop applicable formulas for determining these dimensions and from that how to produce the associated measures which yield so much information about the system."

Network of integrated molecular reactions tend to involve many different molecular species, thus posing complex analytical problems.  For prediction and simulation purposes it is essential to reduce both the model and computational complexity of the problem, while still capturing all the essential characteristics and potential behavior of the network. This project will systematically develop stochastic models for chemical reaction networks, beginning with classical Markov chain models and developing new models that take into account the stepwise development of reactions involving RNA and DNA molecules.  Specific issues to be addressed include scaling limits based on the wide range of time and other quantitative scales in the system, model reduction through scaling limit approximations and other approaches, the implications of the combinatorial restrictions the reaction structure places on the system, sensitivity analysis for the parameters of the stochastic models, and statistical methods for model validation based on data that is frequently obtained through indirect and/or aggregated measurements.<br/><br/>At the level of the cell, the chemical dynamics may well be dominated by the action of regulatory molecules that are present at levels of only a few copies per cell.  Therefore, the molecular fluctuations of these components may determine the dynamics of the reaction network.  These molecular fluctuations appear to have significant consequences; the observed large variation in rates of development, morphology and concentration of molecular species in a cell often lead to a randomization of phenotypic outcomes and non-genetic population heterogeneity.  Since these fluctuations may have profound effects on the physiology of the cell, stochastic models for the intra-cellular reaction networks and careful statistical analysis appear to be essential if the system is to be well understood.  The project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  There is a high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of problems arising in cell and molecular biology."

Probability turns out to be a particularly useful tool as it has, by its very nature, the means to deal with systems consisting of a large number of individual constituents. The present project addresses questions that arise at the interface of probability and statistical mechanics whose common feature is a simple definition, interesting physical phenomena and a substantive challenge for mathematics. The specific problems start with the consideration of complex microscopic systems such as interacting random fields, random walks, local times and percolation. Their analysis aims to demonstrate that, under the conditions when the system size tends to infinity, a new structure, or a new degree of regularity, naturally emerges. The resulting object, often referred to as the scaling limit, is then studied using the methods of analysis. A crucial point is that many microscopic systems lead to the same scaling limit. This fact, sometimes referred to as universality, is one of the cornerstones of our understanding of large systems. The project also includes education and training of students.<br/><br/>The project is naturally divided into three specific subject areas. The first of these concerns the extrema of logarithmically-correlated spatial processes. The goal here is to establish a level of universality of the recent findings for the Gaussian Free Field by extending them to other processes such as the local time of random walks and gradient fields. Gradient fields are then to be studied also in their own right in a number of specific contexts. The unifying theme here is to find ways to get around the restriction of the existing theory to strictly convex interactions. The third area focuses on more traditional subjects of bootstrap percolation, where the goal is to use scaling-limit ideas to establish a sharp threshold in a disordered model, and positional long-range order, where the aim is to prove crystallization in a specific model of an interacting gas. The stated problems draw on recent advances in the field, some of which are due to PI, and they bear strong connections to the theory of disordered systems, extreme-order statistics, random geometry, homogenization, etc. Each of the subareas has clearly delineated objectives of varied level of difficulty. Many of these have been designed with the aim to include graduate students and postdocs in research."

The problems selected are motivated primarily by applications in mathematical finance, but the results will be of more general theoretical significance. In stochastic calculus, new results about stopping times will lead to better models of credit risk and a deeper understanding of what makes possible successful hedging of financial risks. New progress in stochastic calculus will help extend theories of incomplete markets, i.e. markets containing risks that can not be perfectly hedged, as is true in practice. One Monte Carlo issue to be addressed is the optimal use of an algorithm that has recently become popular in option pricing. Another line of research will involve improving numerical techniques for solutions of stochastic differential equations in connection with simulation. A third Monte Carlo topic is the optimal application of some variance reduction techniques that are well suited to problems in nuclear physics, estimation of rare events probabilities, and some option pricing problems. The recent development of a new model for stock prices that incorporates sizes of trade will lead to new pricing technology for financial derivatives. <br/> The application of probability to finance has revolutionized an industry. In the past 20 years the creation of multi-trillion dollar derivative security markets has facilitated the world-wide flow of capital and thereby enhanced international commerce and productivity. Without the mathematical models which provide reliable pricing of derivative securities (e.g., stock options) and guide the management of their associated risk, these markets could not exist. The underlying theme of the mathematical success has been to compute precisely the price of financial derivatives which enable companies to lay off risk by buying financial instruments that protect them from unlikely but possibly disastrous events. Equally if not more important has been the description of a recipe for the seller of the instrument to follow in order to protect himself from the risk he accepts through the sale. A complete market is one in which the theory explains how to do this in principle, and in such a market the theory often provides an explicit guide to implementation of this recipe. In other words, in complete markets a new type of insurance has been created, and this has been made possible by existing probability theory. This type of ""risk insurance"" generated the revolution mentioned above. A real problem, however, is that in reality markets are not complete, and thus new mathematical techniques are needed to extend the theory and to make it more truly applicable. This has already begun, but it is in its infancy, and this extension of the theory will be a large focus of the proposed project. In addition, recently new models have been proposed to better incorporate liquidity issues and market frictions (such as transaction costs when implementing stock trades), in part by the PI himself. These models will continue to be developed, calibrated, and statistically verified. <br/>"

For example, given data that lives in a high-dimensional space, what information can be obtained by studying lower-dimensional projections of the data? Given a large number of interacting agents, who strategically make choices based only on their own state and the distribution of states of the other agents, what do their equilibria (or optimal strategies) look like? This award supports the development of diverse mathematical techniques for the analysis of such questions.  The focus will be on characterizing large deviations from typical behavior, which though rare, are often of crucial importance in applications. The investigator will help train new mathematics researchers, mentor early career researchers, and be involved in outreach efforts.  <br/> <br/>The research will address three topics concerning high-dimensional random phenomena. The first involves the study of random projections of probability measures in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.  This is relevant both for the statistical analysis of high-dimensional data, as well as for asymptotic convex geometry and asymptotic functional analysis. The focus is on characterizing the large deviation behavior of such random projections, as the dimension goes to infinity. This is of interest because, unlike fluctuations, the large deviation behavior is non-universal and thus distinguishes between different high-dimensional distributions. The second topic considers properties of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions on a class of hard-core configurations associated with a graph. Whereas classical models assume discrete spins, the focus of this research is on versions with continuous spins, which exhibit quite different behavior and require new techniques for their analysis. The last topic concerns the analysis of fluctuations, large deviations and concentration inequalities for Nash equilibria in both static and dynamic games of mean-field type with a large number of rational agents. This has implications for a broad range of applications and entails the development of new mathematical techniques, including large deviations principles for set-valued random elements, and analysis of solutions to a master equation for mean-field games."

There are many natural links between these two areas that  lead to a better appreciation of techniques and methods used in either field. In addition, an approach that combines stochastic modelling with a dynamical-systems analysis often has the best chances of tackling a problem successfully: three examples are nonlinear optics, where noise from various sources plays an important role in laser and fiber dynamics; stochastic networks, where stability of the network can, in many cases, be determined by the analysis of a related fluid limit that is characterized by an ordinary or partial differential equation; and cell physiology, where stochastic models of ion channel gates often provide better agreement with experiments. A similar trend occurs on the theoretical level: probabilistic methods are an important tool that aids in the analysis of PDEs, for instance in the derivation and validation of scaling laws and the dynamics of fronts in heterogeneous media; conversely, dynamical-systems methods provide insight into the behavior of PDEs with noise. The goal of this project is to broaden and enhance the scope and quality of the educational and research training provided to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows by integrating research and education in the fields of dynamics, stochastics, and their applications and to involve more undergraduate students in courses and research experiences in applied mathematics.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and stochastic processes are highly active and exciting fields of research that make important contributions to many applications in economics and the natural and social sciences, whilst also being of intrinsic mathematical interest. Dynamical-systems theory is concerned with time-dependent processes, while stochastics deals with nondeterministic, random processes. Examples where the interplay between these two fields is important are noise fluctuations in the design of high-power lasers, the long-time behavior of random interacting systems such as consensus formation in social networks, self-assembly of micro- and nanostructures for drug delivery, random fluctuations in biological cell processes, and importance sampling of rare events in finance. Providing more systematic and integrated training in dynamics and stochastics for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will prepare these groups better for careers in academia and industry. It will also lead to an increase in the number of US mathematicians trained in stochastic systems, and therefore make the US better able to compete with Europe, which has a larger community in this area. The initiatives for undergraduate students will increase the number of students who are exposed to applied mathematics and are engaged in summer research experiences."

The well-posedness of a class of FBSDEs with jumps and possibly super-linear growth coefficients, as well as its application to a class of optimal investment/reinsurance problems with general insurance models will also be investigated. The PI also proposes to continue his research on stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance problems. Two particular problems: one involving the dynamic pricing of the ""Universal Variable Life"" insurance, and the other involving systems driven by normal martingales (or martingales satisfying structure equations) will receive strong attention. The latter is also considered as a theoretical extension of the proposed optimal reinsurance problem.<br/><br/>Almost all the proposed projects have strong background in applications, especially in stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance. Many of these problems reflect the new trend of securitisation of risks in insurance products and pension plans, and the results are expected to have broader impact on actuarial mathematics, financial mathematics, and could benefit the insurance community for good contract designs.

When we have a large system of particles interacting through local interactions, the evolution of such a system when it starts far away from equilibrium poses several questions. Density being often the only conserved quantity, there is usually some sort of a transport equation appearing as the scaling limit. Superposed on it is the motion of individual particles, which is usually an inhomogeneous Markov process after the interactions are somehow averaged in the scaling limit. Laws of large numbers as well as fluctuations and large deviations from them are some of the interesting problems in this context. In addition the coefficients arising in the limiting descriptions are functions of density and or other parameters and the regularity of their dependence on the parameters is also of importance.<br/> There are a large class of physical processes where the rules of behavior are prescribed at the level of individual units. These rules concern the nature of the interaction between individual units that could involve some randomness as well. But one needs to make predictions of the collective behavior of the units at a much larger scale. This project deals with the derivation of the rules of collective behavior from models of interactions at the level of individual units. In the physical sciences examples of such problems that have been successfully studied include the rules of fluid flow that are derived from the laws of interaction between molecules that make up the fluid. Similar problems in the social sciences, for instance one of predicting macroeconomic behavior based on models of economic exchange between individuals, have not been adequately addressed. <br/>"

It has been observed that these distinct areas share the common feature that basic probabilistic principles govern the underlying high-dimensional behavior. In most cases, efficient approximation and study is facilitated by (non-asymptotic) high-dimensional probability. The investigator intends to work on several questions related to the most widely applied principle in high-dimensional probability: the concentration of measure phenomenon. This principle is commonly the main reason behind the frequently-observed tendency of high-dimensional systems to congregate around typical forms.  To quantify this phenomenon, one needs precise inequalities for high-dimensional objects (for instance, measures or random vectors), where independence properties can be lacking. The questions under study have a strong geometric component. Results of the study will have implications in disciplines that depend vitally on high-dimensional objects, including asymptotic geometric analysis, geometric probability, machine learning, sparse recovery, random matrices, and random polynomial theory.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is to find the quantities or to isolate characteristics of a function that govern its concentration (say with respect to the Gaussian measure); in particular, to determine the quantities that control small fluctuations (variance) and small ball probabilities. The project undertakes a systematic study of this problem and initiates some new methods to compute deviation inequalities (especially in the small ball regime).  It is planned to test these methods on more general measures such as log-concave probability measures. The project will also investigate limit theorems for geometric quantities that complement concentration inequalities at the asymptotic level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI intends to further investigate the geometric parameters of high-dimensional measures and in particular the geometry of   generalized centroid bodies associated to these measures.

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more. Educational impacts include providing summer research experiences for undergraduates and developing teaching/computational resources for interdisciplinary topics in statistics, probability, and mathematical finance.

Nonlinearity refers to the behavior that the randomness of the macroscopic observables are related to the underlying microscopic randomness in a nonlinear fashion. Criticality refers to the phenomenon that a given system exhibits drastically distinct macroscopic behaviors when certain parameters in the underlying microscopic model reach some critical values. Time-evolutionary stochastic systems form a large body of probability theory, yet the type of phenomena considered here sits on the frontiers of current standard theories. The goal of this project is to unveil the mathematical structure pertaining to the aforementioned scopes, and to refine the existing theories to study these systems.<br/><br/>In concrete terms, the project studies three types of models: interacting particles with moving boundaries, stochastic partial differential equaitons (SPDEs) at their criticality, and stochastic six vertex-types models. Particle systems with moving boundaries give rise to Stefan?s problem in PDE, and in one particular case those systems relate to the critical point of a reaction-diffusion particle system. The principal investigator seeks to develop more robust tools that do not require explicit stationary distributions and apply to the aforementioned critical point. SPDEs exhibit criticality for certain parameters, where the solutions become non-measurable with respect to the driving noise. This research aims at studying the correlation functions, regularity, and local properties of a few specific examples of such SPDEs. The stochastic six-vertex model is a specialization of the ice-type models that can be formulated as a Markov process. It hosts a number of degenerations, including the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. As a first step toward understanding the limiting shape of these models, the principal investigator plans to study the large deviations utilizing the Markov structures of these models."

These include showing that the number of infinite geodesics in first-passage percolation is infinite and that the boundary of the limiting shape has no sharp corners. For the two type Richardson's model we feel this method will show that coexistence is impossible when the two infections have different speeds. We will also study the connection between last-passage percolation on Z^3 and invariant measures for certain dynamics (called ""totally asymmetric hexagon flipping"") on lozenge tilings of the plane.

We will study under what rules of  growth it is possible that more than one of the objects survive for an arbitrary large time and conversely under which rules of growth does one object conquer all of the others.

Gaussian isoperimetric inequalities are studied for restricted sets. This leads to sharp estimates and extends the domain of applicability of the isoperimetric tool in a variety of settings. Small ball probabilities provide sharp estimates for rare events and so far there are only a few general methods available. The recent discovery of the connection between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems sheds some light in this area and suggests many fupther questions, in particular, the applications to approximation theory. Many of the probability estimates are motivated by the study of strong limit theorems. The research in limit theorems is centered around the limiting behaviors of Gaussian processes.  The primary focus of this research is a better understanding of rare random phenomena related to Gaussian processes which serve as models in many applications.

Due in large part to the recent explosion of DNA  sequence data, two significant trends have emerged in population genetics over the past 20 years.  Firstly, the theory now focuses on sampling distributions  and the inferences that can be drawn from them.  Secondly, the retrospective  view (often referred to as coalescent theory) replaced the former prospective view.  By studying ancestry, much of the unnecessary structure is stripped away and simple flexible models emerge.  Coalescent theory has had much success in analyzing neutral models (i.e., models with no selection); however, the corresponding selective theory has, for the most part, remained out of reach.  Recent progress by one of the PI's has opened up many avenues of research on biologically relevant problems.  It is shown that genealogical information is embedded in the dual processes of certain interacting particle systems.  The investigators propose to extend these techniques to include a variety of models, most notably models involving DNA polymorphism and recombination.  Sampling theory for models with selection will also be developed.  The sampling theory for a large class of models is characterized and is analogous to the exponential family.  Thus the theory of inference, including parameter estimation, information criteria, hypothesis testing, and model selection will be developed rigorously.  Interacting particle systems are ideal for modeling biological systems with spatial structure.  In recent years, tools have been developed for dealing with multitype particle systems. These multitype systems are particularly relevant in ecological models.  A number of multitype models of competition and succession are proposed.  Some of the key features in the proposed model s are the effects of different dispersal ranges and random environments.  The problems in this proposal are motivated by important issues in population genetics and ecology.  Mathematical models are useful for several reasons.  The time scales of interest in many biological settings are often hundreds or thousands of years (e.g., forest succession, evolutionary changes, etc.), and hence it is important to be able to predict long-term effects when certain characteristics of the population are changed.  Another example of a timely issue which precludes a ""wait and see"" approach is the extinction of endangered species.  The models and analysis proposed will allow for qualitative and quantitative predictions, as well as efficient simulation strategies.  Significant contributions to the mathematical underpinnings of these models are also expected.  The proposed work on population genetics will address the effects of natural selection on genealogy.  This is crucial for developing efficient tests for selection, determining how powerful these tests are, deciding which selective models are realistic and what their properties are.  Spatial models in ecology will be approached through ""interacting particle systems.""  Issues such as the spread and control of disease in plant communities, extinction of populations in subdivided habitats, and the effects of inhomogeneous environments will be addressed.  The models proposed are much more complicated than most models in the literature because they take into account the spatial structure that is inherent (and important) in real populations."

In the kinetic limit, the phase space distribution of a solution to this equation converges to a linear Boltzmann equation. Beyond the kinetic scale, one expects that the Boltzmann equation is still correct in dimension three or higher provided that the diffusivity is renormalized. The first project aims to study this renormalization for time scales longer than the kinetic scale. The second project concerns the viscosity of the lattice gas models. Recently the PI has established the divergence rate for the diffusion coefficient for the asymmetric simple exclusion process in dimension two. The goal of this project is to extend this result to the dimension one case and to the lattice gas models with the Navier-Stokes equation as the formal limit. <br/> The fundamental question regarding the conductivity of electrons in semiconductors is how conduction occurs. As the technology is reaching the stage that the semi-classical theory no longer applies, the quantum effect will dominate and a mathematical rigorous theory is of fundamental importance. The first project aims to establish the quantum corrections of the standard semi-classical theory based on the Boltzmann equation. This will provide the first rigorous understanding of these quantum dynamical effects. The second project investigates the validity of the lattice gas models for fluids. These models, besides being widely used to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations, are important models for non-equilibrium statistical physics. The goal here is to establish the divergence rate of the viscosity for these models. This will give the first clue concerning how well the Navier-Stokes equation models the two-dimensional fluid. <br/>"

The main goal is the analysis of steady statistical patterns in stochastic processes associated with random media such as random Lagrangian systems, directed polymers, random growth models, and models of stochastic hydrodynamics. Ergodicity is a form of stochastic stability that means that the long-term statistical properties of the system are not sensitive to the initial state. In particular, it makes measurements related to complex systems meaningful. Long-term statistical patterns in deterministic and random dynamical systems can be described via stationary distributions, and it is the description of these stationary regimes that the project aims at. It builds around the momentum that has been created by recent progress by the PI in ergodic theory of the Burgers equation and related systems. The central role of the Burgers equation is due to the fact that it is fundamental in modeling a variety of phenomena from traffic to the formation of large scale structure of the Universe. It is simultaneously a fluid dynamics model, a growth model, a conservation law, and is tightly related to stochastic control, directed polymers, and an important KPZ universality class of models of statistical mechanics. The proposed program will extend the understanding  of statistical patterns for the Burgers equation and related complex random dynamical systems in noncompact settings.<br/><br/>Studying ergodic properties of stochastic partial differential equations or similar models in unbounded domains calls for development of new mathematical techniques. The project will use and enhance modern methods of mathematical statistical mechanics, probability theory, and dynamics, techniques developed for first-passage percolation and last passage percolation models, lattice animals, concentration inequalities, stochastic control, thermodynamic limits for Gibbs ensembles and hydrodynamic limits for interacting particle systems, along with variational approach and analysis techniques such as inequalities and embeddings,  typical for partial differential equations. The description and analysis of stationary distributions will be obtained via sample measures, one force one solution principles, random one-sided Lagrangian minimizers and their polymer counterparts."

The first   project investigates the following three related topics:  (i)  the  scaling limit of  tagged   particles, (ii) the equilibrium fluctuation and  (iii) the appropriate time scale for dimensions   1 and 2.  The first problem emphasizes the  individual behavior of a typical particle instead   of the collective behavior of all the particles. The second problem is a question about the  central limit theorem. The third problem addresses  the time scale  in dimensions 1 and  2,   which is conjectured  to be very different from the diffusive scale in dimension 3. The   second project  studies the relaxation  rates of the Kawasaki dynamics of  Gibbs states in   infinite volume. This is believed to be  a power law. The method is  based on the Poincare   inequalities (spectral gap), logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and some entropy estimates.   The third project concerns the scaling limit of a quantum particle in a random potential.   There are two limiting cases: the low density  limit and the weak coupling limit. In both   cases, the phase space density of the quantum evolution  defined through  the Wigner   transform or the coherent state is expected to converge weakly to  a linear  Boltzmann   equation with  collision kernel given by the quantum   scattering  cross section.   This research addresses in particular the following two questions: (1) What is the   typical behavior of an individual particle in a fluid? Though the collective behavior of fluid    has been studied intensively, the important  question of the propagation of individual    particles in the fluid has not. The project will study this question with stochastic models   which are believed to capture the essential behavior of  the fluid.  (2) How does a wave   travel in random media. It is believed that  with high disorder, a wave in random media    becomes loca lized. The important question is to analyze the low disorder region when a   wave propagates. This can be considered as a model for conduction  of current in a   semiconductor, or propagation of radio waves or seismic waves. The practical  equation   governing all these diverse phenomena  is the  Boltzmann equation. This study will try to   validate the Boltzmann equation from more basic models involving  wave equations in   random media and to understand its next order corrections or fluctuations."

The main aim in the rigorous study of complex disordered systems is to understand how random microscopic systems display predictable and statistically universal collective macroscopic behaviors. Many such systems evolve to stationary states, but do so in very long time scales (e.g., exponential in system size). Dynamics and aging in these complex systems seeks to understand how their complicated energy landscapes governs their pre-stationary behavior.

This research project first concerns the local universality of such statistics, enlarging the class of models presenting the random matrices type of interactions; this includes the study of the so-called beta-ensembles, proving that the local interactions of the energy levels of many random Hamiltonian systems only depend on the their invariance type, and the analysis of universality for bidimensional spectra, appearing in non-Hermitian random matrix theory.

Analogously to the Gaussian distribution, describing the fluctuations of many systems with underlying independence, random matrix theory statistics appear universally for many strongly correlated systems.

Using an isomorphism theorem of Dynkin and results from the theory of probability in Banach spaces and random Fourier series they will explore relationships between continuous additive functionals of Markov processes and Gaussian processes and chaoses and random Fourier series. In this way they expect to be able to use known results about each of the different processes to obtain new results about the other ones as they did in their work on local times and Gaussian processes. They also plan to use techniques developed in their earlier work to study the number of intersections of random walks, particularly in the critical and super-critical cases. Motivated by the importance of a special class of second order Gaussian chaoses related tm Wick squares in the study of positive continuous additive functionals, they will try to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the continuity of these chaoses. They will also attempt to use self-collision local times of superprocesses to construct a self-interacting measure valued diffusion and study the large deviations of  additive functionals of super Brownian motion.   This research deals with fundamental properties of stochastic processes and has potential application in all areas that deal with random phenomena. The investigators will consider data that evolves in time in a random fashion, such as electrical signals received from distant satellites or dollar values in financial transactions. In particular they will consider the amount of time the data takes specific values or is in a small, heavily weighted, range of values and how this amount of time varies as the set of specific values vary. They plan to do this for a wide class of processes called Levy processes. These processes have often been thought of as models for many important practical applications but, so far, they have b een considered too difficult to analyze very deeply.

Brownian control problems(BCP) have been proposed  as formal diffusion approximations for a broad range of controlled networks.Currently there is a critical lack of general theory that establishes rigorous connections between a network control problem and its associated BCP. The first goal of this research is to establish that for a wide range of control forms, network structures and optimization criteria, the value functions of suitably scaled controlled network models converge to that of the corresponding diffusion control problem. The second goal  is the study of qualitative properties of diffusion control problems arising from the above asymptotic analysis.  These problems correspond to a family of singular control problems with state constraints in non-smooth domains. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations for such control problems are a challenging class of degenerate elliptic nonlinear partial differential equations with gradient constraints and somewhat non-standard boundary conditions. Existence, uniqueness and regularity theory for HJB equations for a range of such control problems and cost criteria will be developed. Wellposedness of such equations is a central ingredient in development of numerical schemes for obtaining near optimal controls.  Additionally, regularity is key in reading off useful qualitative information on the form of an optimal control.  An example of such  information is the characterization of an optimally controlled process as a reflected diffusion over a domain determined in terms of a suitable free boundary problem. Such characterization results for singular control problems are some of the most elegant and useful results in the field and their study for problems with state constraints will be a focus of this research.<br/><br/>Dynamic control problems that motivate this work arise from a wide range of application areas, such as, telecommunications, manufacturing, service engineering, computing, etc.  Control in such networks can take a variety of forms, examples include, scheduling, sequencing, routing and admissions of jobs, and input and processing rate controls.  Networks of interest are in general quite complex and thus  one seeks tractable approximate models. The overall theme of  this research is the development of  techniques for obtaining good scheduling policies for general families of such stochastic processing systems using the mathematical theory of diffusion approximations.  The work will lead to improved design, stability and regulation of complex manufacturing, communication and computer systems. Research project will support the training of two graduate students and  develop international collaborations and with faculty from non-Ph.D. granting institutions."

Such systems originally were considered in statistical mechanics, however in recent years studies in many different fields have led to similar stochastic dynamical models. Some examples include, loss network models, default clustering in large portfolios, chemotactic response dynamics, and belief systems in social sciences. The basic mathematical object is the empirical measure of the trajectories of the collection of particles. There is extensive work on the law of large number behavior(LLN), central limit theory and large deviation results for this object. For example, under conditions, this measure under a large particle limit converges to a deterministic measure that is characterized through a nonlinear evolution equation known as the McKean-Vlasov equation. Most of the existing theory concerns the behavior of the system on a finite time horizon. In the proposed work the interest is in the long time behavior of the empirical measure process and its LLN limit. More precisely, the goal is to develop a systematic stability theory for the associated Mckean-Vlasov equation, and to study its consequences for the time asymptotic behavior of the interacting particle system. Three specific families of models will be studied: (A) Finite state Markovian systems arising from communication networks; (B) Models for active biological transport; (C) Opinion dynamics models.<br/> <br/>In many applications the time asymptotic behavior of an interacting particle system of the above form  is of central concern. For example, in communication systems stability and control is fundamental and one is interested in system design and control protocols that keep the state processes in the neighborhoods of desirable operating conditions over long periods of time. In applications coming from biological systems, one is primarily interested in describing aggregation, self organization and other pattern formations in the steady state of the system. In social science applications, such as opinion dynamics modeling, one of the key goals is to understand long term consensus formation mechanisms. All of these topics have in common the feature that they are related to the behavior of the large time limit of the associated empirical measure process, the study of which is the central goal of this research.  Research in (A) will lead to ideas for improved design, stability, and regulation of complex communication networks.

In turn, it suggests many further questions connected to applications in probability theory and approximation theory. The PI intends to extend this study to other random processes such as Gaussian chaos and stable processes.

The   problems in area 1 originate from the long standing question concerning the possible   asymptotic distributions of the classical Student's t-statistic.

These are (1) universal results for the behavior of sums of independent random variables, (2) local empirical processes and (3) the fractal nature of empirical increments. Area (1) concerns the study of the law of the iterated logarithm for partial sums and their increments that hold under little or no assumptions. Area (2) involves the investigation of a new mathematical entity called the local empirical process, which is the random mechanism governing density estimators, regression function estimators and tail index estimators. Area (3) deals with the uncovering of the somewhat unexpected fractal nature of the increments of various random processes.   The proposed research is concerned with the study of the limit behavior of certain random processes and its applications. Very often a random process will exhibit stable properties as it is observed over a long period. The classical example is the random process of tossing a coin. If the coin is fair, the long time average number of heads will with certainty get arbitrarily close to 1/2. This fact is a special case of the law of large numbers. Statisticians take advantage of this law to construct estimators based on a large sample of data that are close with high probability to the population parameter of interest. The areas that will be investigated in this project should have a number of useful applications to the construction of such estimators."

There are major challenges in these areas that are addressed by a team of researchers, who bring different but complementary skill sets to explore. Statistical Learning is widely recognized as a very active area of interdisciplinary research, which lives between statistics, computer science, and optimization. With state-of-art optimization tools, this research offers a set of new approaches for statistical learning, including new penalties for regularization, further developments of large margin classifiers both theoretically and numerically, as well as nonparametric-based probability calibration for hard margin classifiers. In addition, new visualization and analytical tools for ``High Dimension-Low Sample Size'' (HDLSS) data are developed. Such development is extremely important since HDLSS has become a common feature of data encountered in many divergent fields such as medical imaging and micro-array analysis for gene expression but is outside of the domain of classical statistical multivariate analysis. OODA is a generalization of the recently very productive area of Functional Data Analysis (FDA). In FDA, curves are data points and variation in a family of curves is the focus of analysis. OODA extends this notion to populations where the data points are more complex objects, such as images, shape representations, and even tree-structured objects. The proposed research offers a set of new tools for FDA, including exponential family functional principal components analysis (PCA), robust functional PCA, curve discrimination, and forecasting and dynamic updating of time series of curves. Proposed research will also advance OODA for data on smooth manifolds and tree-structured objects.<br/><br/>The main application area of the research is in health and medicine and civil infrastructure. The research is motivated by and will have beneficial impacts on cancer research, medical imaging, call center management, and network traffic modeling.  However, the developed statistical methods will be useful in fields far beyond those motivating this research, such as demography/epidemiology, financial economics and spatial-temporal modeling.  The team consists of a good mix of well established senior researchers and young junior researchers. Strong mentoring at several levels is an important component of this project. First, there is  strong training of graduate students, in these exciting new research areas, with the goal of giving them the background, and skills needed to start their own research careers. Second, there is strong mentoring of the junior researchers, by the more experienced members of the research team.  In addition to working closely together on research projects, the junior researchers will learn the skills of advising PhD students, through joint supervision together with the more senior members. The team  continues to disseminate the research results quickly and broadly through collaborative work, academic presentations, and journal publications. Web pages are created to enable quick access to user-friendly and accessible software implementations of new methods as well as technical reports and relevant references.<br/>"

In the former, a particle is driven by its interaction with the non-homogeneous random medium, while in the latter, the particle interacts with other particles present. In the general RWRE model an environment is a collection of transition probabilities between lattice sites, and it is chosen from some mixing shift-invariant distribution. On the other hand, a class of deposition models, introduced by the first PI, not only provides a unified framework for many well-known particle systems, but also gives a broader view on common phenomena arising in such systems. An object of vital importance in particle systems, in spirit similar to a random walker in random environment, is the so-called second class particle. The main goal of these fields is the understanding of the consequences of the randomness in the environment, or caused by particle-particle interactions, respectively. Among the fundamental questions one can consider are the existence of 0-1 laws, law of large numbers, central limit theorems, large deviations, etc. The two fields are very close in spirit and ideas, just as an example, non-reversibility is a major obstacle in both fields to common applications. Sometimes even direct connections can be established between the two fields through different representations of the same system. This research contains an instance where a surface growth process is shown to be the dual of a RWRE model, allowing the flow of results from the latter to the former. Dual connections within the field of interacting systems are known to be a powerful tool.  Analogously, drawing parallels between interacting systems and RWRE's allows for the exchange of methods, insights, and results.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that probabilistic intuition and techniques are often of great relevance to other areas of mathematics, this research has a direct impact on probability theory, combinatorics, statistical physics, and the theory of partial differential equations. The fields of random media and interacting systems also have various industrial, agricultural, sociological, and biological applications. Moreover the methods and problems in these fields are often easy to state, while the solutions involve sophisticated tools.

An example is a cloud of gas comprised of a huge number of individual particles colliding with each other. On a larger (macroscopic) scale, this very seemingly complicated system may have a much simpler, but still very precise, description (the ideal gas law, for instance) due to the effects of the incalculable number of smaller scale interactions ""averaging out."" Other examples include the modeling of water moving through a porous rock, or the physical properties of composite materials. The derivation of large-scale, ""averaged"" laws from complicated small-scale irregularities and interactions lies in the realm of statistical physics. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical tools for a rigorous understanding of such problems under the assumption that the small-scale irregularities are occurring randomly. We would like to answer such questions as: How can the large-scale physical law, including the proportionality constants, be accurately predicted from the behavior of the small-scale interactions? What is the error in the large-scale law, in other words, what length scale is large enough that we observe the averaged behavior rather than seeing the complicated random fluctuations? Such questions are not just important to statistical physics and probability, but they also have wider applications, such as to the design of optimal composite materials or the construction of geothermal power plants. <br/><br/>Partial differential equations are used to model many important physical systems, and the focus of the project is to understand the large-scale behavior of solutions to such equations under the assumption that the coefficients exhibit small-scale random oscillations. Obtaining an ""averaged"" partial differential equation that describes the large-scale behavior of the original, more complicated equation is called ""homogenization"" in the mathematical literature. If randomness is incorporated in the model, it is usually referred to as ""stochastic homogenization."" In recent years, researchers have developed a rather complete quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for the simplest situation: uniformly elliptic equations. These equations model electrostatic properties of composite materials, for instance. The present project aims to go further by obtaining a quantitative theory of homogenization for ""degenerate"" equations as well as equations in porous media. Particular goals include rigorously justifying the Darcy-Brinkman law for fluid flow in a porous rock with quantitative error bounds; deriving the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of particles in a fluid; obtaining bounds for the diffusivity of a particle moving randomly on a percolation cluster as well as more precise estimates for the long-time behavior (intermediate asymptotics) of a diffusion in a random medium; the analysis of boundary layers in periodic and stochastic homogenization; and obtaining homogenization results for shape optimization problems. For each of these problems, the goal is to develop a quantitative mathematical theory that provides explicit error bounds and robust analytic techniques."

Special situations studied in this project include bottlenecks, traffic jams, boundaries between different phases, priorities between individuals, and other irregularities that disturb the individual particles. An interface model describes the growth or decay of one phase relative to another. Examples of mathematical models in this category are last-passage models, models of increasing sequences, and marching soldiers models. The questions addressed are the speed, the eventual shape, and the roughness of the interface. The results of this project will concern the macroscopic behavior of these models and the fluctuations and deviations around the expected behavior. <br/> A basic feature of the world around us is that natural processes occur at several different scales. Large scale features are formed through the combined effect of a vast number of operators on a smaller scale. This can be observed in physical processes, biological processes, and man-made processes. For example, the disorganized motions and collisions of individual fluid particles make up the flow of a river; competition and cooperation at the level of individuals determines the evolution of a population; and the behavior of vehicles on a freeway determines the flow of traffic. Many different complex systems share common basic principles of organization and behavior. Such shared features can be abstracted in mathematical models, and analysis of these models then has implications for many particular applications.

A common theme for these problems is the notion of a phase transition which comes up in various guises. The first set of problems to be investigated concerns elucidating the relationship among the notion of finitary mappings, a concept which is relatively old, the much newer and important notion of exact simulation and finally the existence of a phase transition. It is already known that there are intimate connections between these. A second set of problems concerns better understanding the relationship between the phase diagram for various statistical mechanical systems (such as the Ising or the classical Heisenberg models) and the underlying graph on which they live. These questions lead to the study of phenomena which do not arise on the classical Euclidean lattices. A third set of problems concerns determining the sets of capacity 0 for certain concrete Markov processes arising in particle systems (e.g., the stochastic Ising model). Finally, a fourth set of problems concerns understanding the class of stationary processes which arise from positive contractions in Hilbert space, a class of stationary processes which have very different behavior than processes traditionally studied. Even for these systems, the concept of phase transition arises. <br/> Many systems in the world evolve stochastically and probability theory is utilized in order to better understand and predict the behavior of such systems. For example, statistical physics is the study of how particles behave globally and more generally how various general cooperative systems evolve. Understanding such systems is part of the motivation for this project. Another goal of this project is to determine how certain abrupt changes occur within a system (a so-called phase transition such as when water boils) and to investigate the underlying conditions which lead to such phenomena. There are various distributions which arise here which are important to investigate but for which one is not able to make explicit calculations. In such cases, a key tool is computers which, via simulations, allows us to approximate these distributions. In many cases, one can sample exactly from these distributions and one more goal of this project is to understand when this is possible.<br/>"

The investigator and collaborators previously studied special cases of this conjecture. This project will develop this direction further and will study applications of the universality conjecture to statistics, combinatorics, mathematical physics, and computer science, bringing together researchers from probability theory and these other fields. The project is likely to result in fruitful collaborations with statisticians and computer scientists on the analysis of large random matrices.

Michael N. Katehakis and Herbert Robbins    Rutgers University    Abstract    This research involves work on adaptive control of dynamic systems.   The basic dynamic model is known as the ""Markov decision process with   incomplete information"" (MDP) problem,  where the transition law   and/or the expected one-period rewards may depend on unknown   parameters.  The most notable results in this area are based on ideas   utilizing either a separation principle and the related   certainty-equivalence rule, or uniformly efficient rules for the   model of  sequential allocation known as the multi-armed bandit   (MAB) problem.  Limitations of the certainty-equivalence rule are:   i)  there is no claim on the rate of convergence, and    ii)  there are cases  for which, with positive probability, this   rule can prematurely converge to a wrong parameter value so that   it eventually uses only a non-optimal policy. The  typical approach  in the latter studies  has been to  fit  the larger MDP model into  the smaller MAB one by considering each deterministic policy as a   reward-generating population (bandit).  A consequence of this is   that the resulting statistically  efficient procedures  involve   sampling from all deterministic policies and do not otherwise   utilize the optimization aspect of the problem. Thus, they become   limited in scope by data collection complexity.  The reason is   that in practice the state spaces of  MDP models tend  to be very  large and the set of deterministic policies is   immense.  In recent work the investigators have obtained adaptive   procedures with data collection requirements that are  proportional   to the number of state - action pairs of the MDP, under a minimal   irreducibility condition. A major direction of the proposed research   involves  the development of solutions for important more general   problems  such as  i) multi-chain MDPs,  ii) the case in which there   a re side constraints, and  iii) discounted streams of rewards.  A   second  important goal is the development of  new adaptive   statistical methods  that possess practically useful implementation   and optimality  properties for the related problems of detection of    total error and change points.      The main idea of adaptive control is to compute strategies (policies,   or control rules) for the operation of  a system that estimate the   unknown parameters of the system, and in doing so converge to a   strategy that is optimal for the true values of the unknown   parameters.  Applications arise in many  areas of  modern engineering,   finance, and operations research, such as reliability, maintenance,  quality control,  scheduling,  inventory, and  production planning.   Consequently, this type of problem has been widely studied in the   literature. However,  effective procedures that take into account and   optimize  the speed of  convergence  have been obtained only recently   for specific models, often, with prohibitive data collection   complexity.  A primary objective of the proposed research is the   development of relatively simple adaptive control procedures with   reasonable computational and memory  requirements for on-line   implementation, for a wide class of problems, utilizing ideas from   recent work of the investigators. Another  important goal is the   development of  new methods for specific models useful in such areas   as software reliability (error detection)  and  quality control   (change points).  This research relates to the following strategic  areas of national concern: high performance computing, communications,  and manufacturing."

The aim of this research project is to develop systematic mathematical theory to understand dynamic networks: systems that evolve over time through probabilistic rules. The investigator plans to develop robust mathematical techniques to understand how macroscopic connectivity arises via microscopic interactions between agents in a network. One important direct application is whether a message or a disease is able to reach -- or at risk of reaching -- a significant fraction of the population of interest. Mathematical techniques used to understand such questions have unexpected connections to combinatorial optimization, where one is interested in designing optimal networks between individuals, particularly by considering an important concept known as the minimal spanning tree. The project will also explore swarm optimization algorithms (inspired by the collective behavior of simple individuals such as ants) and their ability to solve hard optimization problems via probabilistic interaction rules through stigmergy (where the network of interacting agents changes the underlying environment which then effects the interaction of the agents). An important component of the project is involvement of students at all levels, including the development of undergraduate research seminars and research projects. <br/><br/>Understanding the metric structure of the giant component and the critical scaling window in inhomogeneous random graph models has been daunting, yet for several decades the community of combinatorial probabilists has seen it as key to understanding more complicated strong disorder systems. The project aims to develop a unified set of tools through dynamic encoding of network models to understand the metric scaling of the internal structure of maximal components in the critical regime. The investigator plans to show convergence to continuum limiting objects based on tilted inhomogeneous continuum random trees and in particular to prove universality for many of the major families of random graph models. Scaling exponents of key susceptibility functions in the barely subcritical regime will be studied. The relation between metric structure of components in the critical regime and the entrance boundary of Markov processes such as the multiplicative coalescent will be explored. The entire program is the first step in understanding the minimal spanning tree on the giant component under strong disorder. These models have spawned a wide array of universality conjectures from statistical physics. The project will also study optimization algorithms and meta-heuristics inspired by reinforcing interacting particle systems and stigmergy, providing qualitative insights and quantitative predictions on hard models in probabilistic combinatorial optimization."

New models of random trees motivated by statistical physics and biology will also be studied wherein using random walk constructions and conditioned branching processes, we aim to understand the scaling limits of such models. Finally we propose to develop mathematical methodology to analyze, understand and quantify sources of variation in the structure of real world complex networks such as trees arising as blood circulatory networks in the brain.<br/><br/><br/>Over the last few years the availability of empirical data on many real world networks including social networks, data transmission networks such as the Internet and various biological networks, has stimulated an explosion in the array of mathematical models proposed to understand these networks. Researchers in a wide array of fields are interested in understanding properties of such networks, the evolution and change of such networks over time, as well as the dynamics of various processes on these networks such as transporting flow or traffic through these networks and epidemic models on these networks. An understanding of the behavior of these mathematical models would allow practitioners to glean important information and insight about such processes in the real world, ranging from the design of more efficient networks, understanding the factors that influence the rate of spread of congestion of flow processes or other dynamics through the network, to the significant factors that contribute to the actual emergence of the structure of the network itself.    A mathematical analysis of such problems leads to interesting connections between these models and wide areas of mathematical probability including branching process models in biology and random fractals.  The aim of this project is to develop mathematical methodology to understand properties of such network models and in particular understand what happens when the system size grows large. At the same time the project will also develop techniques to accurately understand data arising from various biological networks such as vascular networks in the brain and the factors that significantly affect functional properties of such networks.  The techniques developed will be of use to a wide community of researchers, and we anticipate that the project will foster interdisciplinary collaborative projects with both national and international research groups and facilitate the training of students and expose them to this rapidly emerging field of research."

A number of continuous models, most particularly the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), have been constructed, and in some cases it has been proved that discrete models approach SLE in the limit. The proposer will study a number of discrete models, e.g., self-avoiding walk, Laplacian random walks, and walks on certain random graphs, with the hope of showing that they also converge to SLE. Also, the proposer will consider models in three dimensions where the recently developed techniques which rely on conformal invariance to not apply. The goal is to find three-dimensional continuous models to be candidates for limits of discrete systems. <br/> The goal of this proposal is to construct and analyze mathematical models for phase transition, which is the study of the sharp changes in a physical system when changing a parameter such as the freezing of water when the temperature is reduced. More generally, the mathematical goal is to understand universality principles that allow one to predict macroscopic behavior from microscopic rules. As well as being important to probability theory, the results will be relevant to many areas of theoretical physics. Special focus will be placed on the approach to the limit for two-dimensional models where the limit itself is now well understood and to construct candidates for the limit in three dimensions where the problems are more challenging.<br/>"

This research is to offer an answer for this pursuit and to establish a possibility-based network calculus theory that further extends the scope of this research line. The key methodology behind such a development is to apply Legendre transform at the sample-path level. Pilot research has shown some distinguished features that include: i) symmetric and decomposed characterization for traffic and service; ii) removal of highly nonlinear (min,+) convolution and de-convolution operators; iii) representation of single-node and tandem system performance bounds by summation of random variables; iv) recapture of effective bandwidth (capacity) and large deviations properties defined through the momentum generating functions; and v) tight bounds and improved scaling factor in the large deviations regime. It is expected that this research will open a new frontier in queuing theory and practice.<br/><br/>The proposed research will lead to a new theory for performance guarantees in queuing and other service systems that is expected to provide more accurate assessment of system performance and better management of system resources. Such a new theory will  justify the vision of offering performance guarantees in diverse engineering and social systems such as communications networks (wireless, sensor networks and the high-speed Internet), supply chain and logistic systems, transportation and healthcare delivery systems; empowers the private sector to generate more value-adding business models (e.g. premium vs. ?best effort? service grades); and influences the public sector to construct robust infrastructures and to effectively assume its critical social responsibilities. <br/>"

They will study problems related to the geometric characterization of random structures, such as topological invariants of excursion (nodal) sets of random fields and learning the homotopy and  homeomorphism types of manifolds in the presence of noise and developing techniques for quantifying the statistical accuracy of  the resulting estimates. Whereas previous work on random field geometry has concentrated on characteristics coming from differential topology, such as Lipshitz-Killing curvatures (which include the Euler characteristic) this project will concentrate on characteristics coming from algebraic topology, involving homology-invariant concepts such as the number of connected components, Betti numbers, and other related invariants. Furthermore, while previous work in these areas was in the setting of Riemannian manifolds, it is planned to extend this to allowing  non-Riemannian metrics even on smooth manifolds. In manifold learning this is important due to the fact that in some applications  natural measures of closeness underlying the context of a data set can well be non-Riemannian. In the context of random fields, it may open new doors in the study of purely non-Gaussian fields, such as stable fields, where the natural geometry on the parameter manifold induced by the field is  non-Riemannian.<br/><br/>The motivation for this project, which links algebraic topology, probability, and pure and applied statistics comes from both its intrinsic mathematical interest and from a wealth of applications, from areas as broadly spaced as the statistical analysis of fMRI brain images, high dimensional data analysis in computer science, and cosmological projects such as the COBE and WMAP experiments and the Sloan digital sky survey. The four PIs come from a variety  of intellectual backgrounds and are specialists with different, but complementary technical skills. Not only will this project join these skills, but over the next two years a number of other researchers will be added to the project, strengthening, among other aspects, its international component and extending to the training of young scientists in the US.<br/>"

The first one is equivalent to the universality conjecture of the local eigenvalue statistics of random matrices, an equilibrium problem. The second one is the construction of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory from a microscopic model, a nonequilibrium problem. As to the first problem, we use a new, entirely analytic strategy to extend the known universality for the unitary matrices also to the other types of random matrices: real symmetric, complex normal, and quaternionic self-dual. The strategy applies to the bulk and to the edge of the spectrum. We also apply our method to the study of the Laughlin wave function of superconductivity, which is of a related structure. As for the second problem, we use the recently laid microscopic dynamical foundations of relativistic many-particle theory to establish the first derivation of relativistic Vlasov kinetic theory in form of a weak law of large numbers. We also study its fluctuations around the limit in form of a central limit theorem. <br/> The universality conjecture is currently one of the top priority problems of random matrix theory, a subfield of probability and mathematical physics. Its applications range from nuclear physics, nanotechnology and superconductivity on the physics and technology side to deep number theoretical implications on the mathematical side - which in turn have applications in cryptography and related fields. The conjecture has been proven so far for the simplest type of matrices, but a proof for more general matrices has so far been elusive. The relativistic Vlasov theory of charged particle systems forms the dynamical basis for a large part of high temperature plasma physics, with applications ranging from thermonuclear fusion research to space plasma research, e.g. about the solar wind and magnetic storms. Its microscopic atomic underpinnings, which have so far eluded researchers, will make it possible for the first time to systematically study the accuracy of Vlasov theory and in particular to compute its leading corrections."

It is of intrinsic interest to probabilists, and of more general interest because of ties to PDE theory, and because it may turn out to be a very important process for modeling purposes and  as a building block from which other measure valued processes can be  constructed. This project is primarily aimed at seeing how well SBM indeed  serves as such a building block, by investigating a number of other infinite dimensional stochastic processes that can be built either from SBM or from simple variants of it. The first example that will be tackled is  a ``super iterated Brownian motion'' that seems to be accessible to this approach and yet is a stochastic process which promises a lot of surprises in its structure and behavior.  As a modeling tool, the random processes that will be studied in this project have applications to a wide diversity of different fields. They provide good models for studying the development of genetic diversity over a large  number of generations, and, indeed, it was as models here that superprocesses originally developed. In this and related projects, the PI and his colleagues will also be using superprocesses to study the dispersion of mass via ocean  currents. It is hoped that the models developed will lead to a better  understanding of the statistical aspects of, for example, the spread of ocean pollutants. Another side benefit will be the study of the spatial  structure of populations of small ocean dwelling organisms such as plankton, a topic of both ecological and defense (radar) interest."

The theory is well developed in two dimensions where the systems are invariant under conformal transformation and the investigation will be on fine properties. The theory in three dimensions is less developed and  the main goal is to construct nontrivial models.<br/><br/>More specifically, the goal in two dimensions is to study the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) as a measure on curves parametrized with the natural fractal parametrization. Technical questions to study include the Holder continuity of the curves (under natural parametrization) and the stationary of the SLE loop measure. The latter property is needed to construct a conformally covariant measure on SLE loops analogous to the Brownian loop measure.  There are several questions in three dimensions that will be investigated: trying to show that there is a unique chronological loop-erasure of Brownian motion and to describe the limit as a Laplacian random walk; proving analyticity of the intersection exponent for Brownian motion and establishing the multifractal spectrum for harmonic measure; and finding general methods to give nontrivial measures on continuous, non-self-intersecting curves  of fractal dimension greater than one.  The use of infinitesimal  (non-standard) techniques will be considered as an alternative to continuum  models for objects such as exponentials of Gaussian free fields, uniform  spanning trees, and percolation."

The proposal further addresses fundamental questions on growing interfaces and fluctuations of long chemical chains in a random potential (polymer models). Predictions from physics indicate that, in many of these models, fluctuations should scale sub-linearly with limiting laws that deviate from the standard Gaussian (for instance, which relate to the Tracy-Widom distribution from random matrix theory). This proposal continues and expands the research of the PI on these systems outside the scope of integrable models. In particular, this proposal aims to investigate the universal behavior of scaling exponents, the nature of the limit shape and the geometry of geodesics."

The most common example of such noisy input is Brownian motion, which occurs in models throughout science, engineering, and economics. Within this context, the so-called rough paths theory is a powerful method that allows one to define noisy systems in a wide variety of situations (well beyond the Brownian motion case). The rough paths theory also gives an almost-deterministic point of view on stochastic calculus, as opposed to the traditional approach, which is highly probabilistic in essence. The term stochastic analysis usually encompasses both stochastic integration of It type and Malliavin calculus techniques. The latter can be viewed as a way to define an analysis at the path level; it leads to deep and useful results concerning stochastic differential equations. This research project aims to combine rough-paths and Malliavin calculus techniques in order to give a meaning to and then study noisy partial differential equations that model heat transfer in random environments. The project will also study the large time behavior of differential equations driven by a general class of noises, and see how to statistically identify this kind of system by observing a typical path. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on interactions between rough paths theory, stochastic partial differential equations (PDE), and Malliavin calculus. A more specific list of the six subprojects can be structured as follows: (1) stochastic PDEs, with (a) parabolic Anderson model in rough environment, (b) parabolic Anderson model in dimension 2, and (c) density for solutions to rough PDEs; and (2) rough finite-dimensional systems, with (a) ergodic properties for rough differential equations, (b) estimation procedures for rough stochastic differential equations, and (c) renormalization of numerical schemes for rough stochastic differential equations.  In all those projects, the principal investigator will use stochastic analysis methods combined with analysis and rough paths tools in order to study some new yet very natural classes of processes. Because even the definition of those objects was far from clear before the rough path theory was introduced, their study is both motivating and challenging."

The first of these concerns  measure-valued population models.   A particle representation is used to study properties of a general class (including the Dawson-Watanabe and Fleming-Viot) of ""neutral"" processes and their induced genealogical structure.  A major aim of the proposal is to extend this construction, most notably to incorporate selection (equivalently location dependent branching rates in the spatial setting), but also (in the genetics context) to allow for recombination and population substructure.   Motivated by problems in the interpretation of human population genetic data, the investigator and his colleagues study particular subclasses of the general models with a view to understanding the effects on genealogy, and hence on genetic data, of various assumptions about population dynamics, and possible demographic correlations.  A second area of the proposal concerns properties of geographically structured population genetics models. Recent results relating to coalescence times in these models allow explicit calculation of moments of identity measures for mutation structures (beyond infinite alleles) relevant to molecular DNA data. Conversely, an understanding of the models motivates a study of measures of population differentiation (and associated estimators) for molecular genetic data which generalize Wright's F_st coefficient.   The third area of the proposal concerns the application of existing and anticipated theoretical results to statistical questions in the analysis of genetic data.   These include exact likelihood ratios for a wide class of selective models against neutrality (and hence efficient inference procedures), the potential for use of information on the age order of alleles in testing neutrality, the correlation structure of estimates of evolutionary parameters from samples of linked genes, and the (non-)existence of consistent estimators of certain evolutionary parameters from singl e-locus data.   The project is concerned with advancing our understanding of evolutionary processes.  The development of mathematical models allows an examination of the consequences of particular evolutionary mechanisms: one may ask ""if evolution acted in the following way, what sort of patterns would we expect in genetic data?"".  Mathematical modeling is necessary because many evolutionary forces operate over extremely long time scales for which direct observation, or experimentation, is impossible.  Comparisons of model predictions with actual genetic data then provides insight into the extent to which the posited mechanisms are acting.   The investigator studies, at a general level, the consequences of particular assumptions about the structure and demography of populations of interest. Particular aspects of the project relate to models for the evolution of human populations. Various statistical questions which arise in the interpretation of genetic data are also included."

The theoretical work will involve (a) methods of evaluating model stability and instability, which will include both discrete and continuous time Markov models; (b) development of performance measures for stable models, and specifically comparison of rates at which such models achieve a stable regime; (b) detailed behavior of stochastically ordered or partially stochastically ordered models; and (d) robustness of system design against perturbations in assumptions. One application of these methods will be to MCMC methods, which  are currently revolutionizing Bayesian and computational statistics methods, and under this project it is hoped to develop on-line convergence criteria, methods of evaluating convergence rates, and ways of speeding up these algorithms. The other area of application is in the analysis of  complex network, queueing and storage systems. The specific types of such application envisaged include the currently high-priority area of manufacturing systems, and more general queueing systems with feedback, for which the stability and performance results to be developed are well suited.    In evaluating many complex systems, there are two steps where mathematical models, especially those in probability and statistics, play a critical role. The first step is in describing the system. This research addresses the modeling of ``manufacturing networks'', currently of central importance in the high-technology manufacturing sector. Here the aim is to describe the way in which items such as semiconductor components move around the various machines which work and rework components to get to a final product. As with many models, the mathematics that describes such manufacturing systems also describes other systems, such as the movement  of bits over an information network. The work proposed here will attack the vital question: when is such a system stable, in the sense of running in equilibrium rather than developing problems which cause shutdowns, backlogs or overflows. This modeling step helps define the crucial parameters that describe ranges when systems can be controlled: the second step is then in estimating such parameters, and here it is proposed to work on new simulation methods that enable such estimation to take place. These "" Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  algorithms"" have very wide applicability, but are themselves ""complex systems"", and just as with real systems, they can develop overflows and backlogs in usage: the work here should provide methods of control for MCMC algorithms leading to faster and more accurate methods of simulation. These simulation methods have found application in a huge range of areas, from pattern recognition, to agricultural experiments, to clinical and epidemiological areas, to environmental assessments: the research supported in this proposal therefore propagates to usage in very many areas indeed."

Answering these questions is based on studying statistically stationary regimes of the system's evolution. This project is targeted at existence/nonexistence of such statistically stationary regimes, their description and behavior for several types of random dynamical systems arising in various applications from traffic to neuronal systems to the large-scale structure of the Universe: (i) randomly forced Hamilton-Jacobi equations;  (ii) small random perturbations of dynamical systems with multiple instabilities;  (iii) systems with random switching.<br/><br/>For general randomly forced Hamilton-Jacobi equations, the PI proposes to obtain a description of the global behavior in terms of one-sided action minimizers and their positive temperature counterparts, thermodynamic one-sided limits for directed polymers. For this, the PI proposes an extension of the notion of the directed polymer from quadratic to general Hamiltonians. Further questions  that the PI will address are: localization/delocalization, characteristic exponents, the renormalization group associated with the flow of monotone transformations defined by global solutions, the fixed points of this renormalization group and simplified discrete models, statistics of shock magnitudes and ages. Small noisy perturbations will mainly be studied for dynamical systems with heteroclinic networks, consisting of multiple unstable equilibria connected to each other by heteroclinic orbits, on much longer time scales than those already studied in the literature. This will allow to make conclusions about the behavior of invariant distributions and approach homogenization questions. For this, the mechanism of unlikely transitions in the network and the associated time scales will be studied in detail. The small scale analysis of the involved random variables will involve Malliavin calculus. For systems with random switchings, the previous work showed that under broad Hrmander-type hypoellipticity conditions, these systems have a unique invariant measure and this measure is absolutely continuous. Obtaining further regularity of the invariant density, studying its smoothness and the character of singularities turned out to be a hard problem. The recent progress by the PI and coauthors provides tools that will be used to approach general hypoelliptic switching systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Network of integrated molecular reactions tend to involve many different molecular species, thus posing complex analytical problems.  For prediction and simulation purposes it is essential to reduce both the model and computational complexity of the problem, while still capturing all the essential characteristics and potential behavior of the network. This project will systematically develop stochastic models for chemical reaction networks, beginning with classical Markov chain models and developing new models that take into account the stepwise development of reactions involving RNA and DNA molecules.  Specific issues to be addressed include scaling limits based on the wide range of time and other quantitative scales in the system, model reduction through scaling limit approximations and other approaches, the implications of the combinatorial restrictions the reaction structure places on the system, sensitivity analysis for the parameters of the stochastic models, and statistical methods for model validation based on data that is frequently obtained through indirect and/or aggregated measurements.<br/><br/>At the level of the cell, the chemical dynamics may well be dominated by the action of regulatory molecules that are present at levels of only a few copies per cell.  Therefore, the molecular fluctuations of these components may determine the dynamics of the reaction network.  These molecular fluctuations appear to have significant consequences; the observed large variation in rates of development, morphology and concentration of molecular species in a cell often lead to a randomization of phenotypic outcomes and non-genetic population heterogeneity.  Since these fluctuations may have profound effects on the physiology of the cell, stochastic models for the intra-cellular reaction networks and careful statistical analysis appear to be essential if the system is to be well understood.  The project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  There is a high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of problems arising in cell and molecular biology."

U-statistics are commonly encountered in problems concerning estimation, while multilinear forms arise in research pertaining to  multiple stochastic integration, regression and covariance analysis, and invertibility of matrices. Randomly stopped sums of independent random variables and martingales are found at the core of the studies of sequential analysis, and such diverse areas as queuing theory, inventory theory and reliability theory. The investigator and his colleagues consider fairly general problems involving sums of dependent random variables, including extensions of Wald's equation in the case of martingales, quadratic forms and  double stochastic integrals; approximations of the tail probabilities of multilinear forms; generalization of the principle of conditioning to a wider class of problems; and determination of speeds of convergence of related limit theorems. In tackling the proposed problems, the investigator and his colleagues draw from their recent results which include two fundamental contributions to the theories of sequential analysis, U-statistics and empirical processes.   The investigator and his colleagues deal with several problems whose solution would have a beneficial impact on several areas of probability and statistics. The broad area consists of the study of the properties of phenomena that exhibit high levels of inter-dependence and, hence, are hard to analyze on their own. The difficulty stems from the strong links present with other components. The approach followed by the investigator and his colleagues when dealing with this type of problem consists in introducing a new set of phenomena that closely resembles the original one but which in addition has desirable independence properties. In probabilistic language, one calls this approach to dealing with dependence a de-coupling of t he dependence of a phenomenon. Up to now there are several results developed in this area which typically produce optimal results. The investigator and his colleagues continue to apply this theory to problems in sequential analysis, U-statistics and stochastic integration. The statistical theory of sequential analysis was introduced during World War II as a means of optimizing resources. In sharp contrast with the typical statistical approach of assigning a prefixed sample and analyzing the data only after the sample size has been achieved, the sequential approach permits the optimization of resources by closely following the development of the process at each stage of the experiment. The sequential approach is particularly useful in cases of destructive sampling, as in  equipment and supply lifetime studies in military equipment and industrial applications. In medical studies, its application allows both to optimize resources and to  deal with the ethical issues of terminating early a clinical trial when there is strong indication that the drug under study is harmful or proven to be beneficial, without having to wait until a pre-fixed sample size has been attained in accordance with the classical approach."

In particular, the PI proposes to develop sharp inequalities for the moments of self-normalized processes, as well as for sums of multilinear forms and U-statistics (unbiased statistics) in independent and dependent variables. In addition, the PI intends to further develop a novel approach to approximating the expected time it takes a process (with a general dependence structure) to hit a given boundary. The interest in the study of self-normalized processes stems from their use as key quantities in the development of non-parametric estimators, as well as for their use as pivotal quantities for the creation of confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis. For example, the t-statistic is a self-normalized and unit-less estimator commonly used in the testing of hypotheses about the mean of a distribution with unknown variance. The interest on sharp results for self-normalized estimators is based in part in the need for approximating p-values and the power of tests in situations when the assumptions on the variables need to be relaxed (e.g. independence, normality and/or identical distribution). The study of results related to sums of multilinear forms and U-statistics is related to their use as building blocks in the development of certain stochastic integrals, as well as for their use as the typical unbiased estimators in statistics. Moreover, sums of multilinear forms in independent random variables are frequently used in approximating non-linear estimators of moving averages, which are of fundamental importance in econometric studies. <br/> The proposed work concerning the development of new and improved tools (under relaxed assumptions) for the study of statistical estimators is important for the assessment of hypotheses with direct implications in medical and social sciences as well as engineering through its connection to the comparison of competing treatments and technologies under a wider set of scenarios than is currently possible. The study on how long it takes for a random process to hit a boundary, on the basis of historical evidence, has potential important implications in the physical sciences and economics including in the study of how long it will take for 1) a tornado to hit a city, 2) a person to develop cancer, 3) an earthquake to occur or 4) the stock market to crash<br/>"

Building on the <br/>foundation of the First Cornell Seminar in Finance, the Second will again <br/>bring together leading researchers from the Northeast and selected points <br/>beyond for an exchange of ideas in seminar format.  The basic themes will <br/>be asset pricing and hedging, viscosity solution based control theory, <br/>credit risk, interest rates, and numerical methods and data analysis using <br/>modern statistical techniques.<br/><br/>Fundamental research in finance has helped to change the world of commerce <br/>during the last 30 years, and has arguably contributed to the explosive <br/>growth in wealth.  The key idea is the transfer of risk: modern financial <br/>tools allow one party to sell an aspect of a risky exposure to another <br/>party, and to do so at a fair price. Often a way for the buyer of the risk <br/>to hedge against the risk (a hedging strategy) can also be provided in <br/>terms of mathematical formulae.   A problem is, however, that while the <br/>models have led to huge advances, they are still often crude approximations <br/>of reality, and also most of the advances have come from the creation of <br/>financial derivatives in markets such as the stock market.  Of current <br/>interest is the development of analogous tools one could use in other <br/>markets, such as credit risk.

Lattice models, constructed to study natural phase transitions, are probability distributions on subsets of graphs depending on continuous parameters. This research project will study the phase transition of several important lattice models, including (1) the constrained percolation model, which randomly assigns ""0"" or ""1"" to each vertex of a graph, satisfying constraints that represent aspects of molecular structure; and (2) the self-avoiding walk, which is a path on a graph visiting each vertex at most once, introduced as a model for long-chain polymers. The work will broaden and deepen the mathematical foundations of the subject, with potential important applications in theoretical physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>The investigator aims to develop new theory concerning the phase transition of certain lattice models. Imposing constraints in the percolation model usually makes the model lose stochastic monotonicity, which, in the unconstrained case, is critical to study the phase transition described by the behavior of infinite clusters. One goal of the project is to develop new combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to study the behavior of infinite clusters without using stochastic monotonicity. Enumerating self-avoiding walks is typically difficult due to the non-Markovian structure. The connective constant and exponent of self-avoiding walks are fundamental properties of the underlying graph, yet can be identified for very few graphs. Another goal of this project is to obtain new information about connective constants and exponents for large classes of graphs, which may be achieved by analyzing harmonic functions on graphs. An analog to the central limit theorem in two dimensions is the limit shape behavior of height functions of certain lattice models at criticality, i.e. when the phase transition occurs. The investigator also plans to study the limit shape, using techniques from complex analysis and algebraic geometry."

Decoupling theory has been very successful in translating problems involving dependent variables into ones involving independent variables through the use of inequalities specially designed for that purpose. In this research the PI will study three major problems, and consider approaches (including decoupling methods) that may be used in solving them. The first problem involves a general and natural approach to approximate the expected waiting time for a random process to hit a boundary in terms of the function determined by the expected value of the supremum of the process. This approach permits the use of the historical averages in developing useful approximations. The second problem concerns an approximation to the speed of convergence of sums of dependent variables in terms of known results for sums of independent variables. This problem has the potential of widely expanding the applicability of the principle of conditioning, a method that extends the martingale central limit theorem. The third problem develops probability approximations for self-normalized martingales. Results from this problem have the potential to impact several areas of probability and statistics, including the theory of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, since typically self-normalized variables serve as pivotal quantities in the construction of confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis.<br/> A common assumption made in the development of statistical and probabilistic methods concerns the predicate that the variables or processes are independent or have independence properties, that is, what happens to one of the variables does not affect what happens to the other. This independence assumption has the effect of simplifying the mathematical complexity of the problem and is quite common in practice. Due to this simplification it seems natural to seek approaches that would permit the use of results involving independent variables in the case the variables are dependent. The PI has been heavily involved in such a project through the development of ``Decoupling'' theory which has the above paradigm as its goal. His first problem in the current research is to develop a probabilistic theory for the use of historical data to obtain estimates of the time dependent processes take to reach a boundary. His preliminary work provides useful connections between the study of this problem and the study of the case of boundary crossing by non-random functions through the use of the average (or expected) behavior of the processes involved. This work has the potential to impact profoundly several areas of scientific knowledge where boundary crossing times are important and historical knowledge of the behavior of the process in question is available. Examples of specific areas of application include approximations to waiting time for: 1) an earthquake to happen, 2) for the next tornado to arrive, 3) for a dam to overflow, 4) for a computer to crash. All this when historical records are available. The second problem involves the development of results connecting the efficiency of approximations used involving independent variables to obtain similar approximations for dependent variables, a potentially cost saving device for choosing between competing statistical procedures. The third problem involves the study of self-normalized statistics based on dependent variables or processes. This type of statistic provides key quantities used in the development of confidence intervals for parameters. An example of how dependence enters into this type of problem concerns the development of interval estimates for the percentage of voters which will vote for a given candidate in the case the voters do not act independently but influence each other's <br/>decisions."

Random Geometry uses tools from these fields to quantifiably study the rich geometrical structure of random metric spaces and the random processes that live within them. Random Geometry is interdisciplinary in nature, and the intellectual merit of the programme lies in its potential to establish a cross-fertilization of ideas within different areas of mathematics and connect these ideas with theoretical physics and other fields of science. Broader impact will be realized via this exchange of ideas across disciplines and through the training of a new generation of students to carry on the work in this important field.<br/><br/>In addition to enabling long-term collaborations between leading researchers, the programme will allow for the dissemination of new results with conferences on Conformally Invariant Scaling Limits (Jan 26-30, 2015), Random Graphs and Trees and their Applications (Mar 16-20, 2015), Random Planar Structures (April 20-24, 2015), and the Geometry of Random Walks and SLE (June 15-19, 2015).

The modeling approach that divides the population into three groups (susceptibles, infected, and removed--the so-called SIR model) and its various generalizations has been used historically as an important tool in deciding whether epidemics grow or dissipate.  The investigators expand the traditional model of an SIR stochastic epidemic on a graph with a given degree distribution,  in order to account for the Ebola-specific features.  These include, among others, incorporating a class of individuals at high risk of infection (e.g., health workers), and incorporating a dynamic network structure that reflects how contacts with different segments of the population change over the course of infection within host.<br/><br/>The new mathematical model describing the way in which Ebola spreads through a network of human contacts, both in rural and urban areas as well as across countries and continents, will be informed by the actual  field data from   various parts of the world including Africa and the United States. It is expected that the model will allow  public health and government officials to quickly analyze a host of different  intervention scenarios  in order to  speed up the current epidemic's  dissipation and to select the most effective way of preventing, or at least minimizing, the future outbreaks."

Many of such phenomena may be modeled by continuous time stochastic processes.  The first stochastic process that has been extensively studied is the celebrated Brownian motion, named in honor of the botanist Robert Brown, who observed and described in 1828 the random movement of particles suspended in a liquid or gas. The same  process was later used in 1900 by the mathematician Louis Bachelier to model stock prices on financial markets. Finally, in 1905,   Albert Einstein brought this process to the attention of physicists by presenting it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. The Brownian motion is an example of diffusion process. Like their ancestor the Brownian motion, diffusion processes appear in many different areas of sciences and economy and their  theoretical mathematical study has far reaching consequences in understanding and making predictions about the phenomena they model. In this  project, the PI will study several problems in  the theory of diffusion processes. In particular, questions about the deep interaction between the diffusion process and the geometry of the ambient space will be addressed and rates of convergence to equilibrium will be studied.<br/><br/>Mathematically speaking, the present project focuses on different aspects of the theory of diffusion processes and diffusion semigroups. The PI will investigate applications to sub-Riemannian geometry where diffusion methods turn out to be very fruitful to study generalized Ricci curvature lower bounds. The PI  will also address several questions about hypocoercive diffusions. Hypocoercivity is a concept recently introduced by Cedric Villani to obtain quantitative estimates for the convergence to equilibrium of some highly degenerate hypoelliptic semigroup. Hypocoercive estimates are in general very difficult to prove and the PI will systematically  study  new methods which parallel the Bakry-Emery approach to hypercontractivity.  Some problems in the rough paths theory of Terry Lyons will also be studied, in particular related to the properties of stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian processes. These projects will involve the training of graduate students and junior mathematicians. The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the blog of the PI."

The path regularity of the solutions to reflected backward SDEs (RBSDEs) will be studied, with an eye on its application to the numerical method for such equations. The study will also lead to the regularity of solutions to a class of obstacle problems in PDEs, via some new probabilistic representation formulae for the derivatives of such solutions. The PI proposes to continue his research on the new notion of stochastic viscosity solution for nonlinear SPDEs, including the stability and uniqueness results in the fully nonlinear case. Some stochastic control/stochastic finance problems, inspired by a risk reserve model involving investment, will receive strong attention. One example is the optimal retention/investment problem for an insurance company that uses the ruin probability as its stability criterion. <br/> The Feynman-Kac Formula is a powerful tool that links probability theory to analysis, especially to the theory of partial differential equations. The nonlinear form of this formula is useful for studying many nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations such as reaction diffusion equations, derived from expansion of advantaged genes in biology, combustion theory, as well as chemical kinetics. The celebrated Black-Scholes formula in modern stochastic finance theory and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in stochastic control theory are also, in essence, examples of the formula. The main part of the proposed research is to discover the possibility of advancing such formulae to a higher level, either by considering the ""functional form"", or by considering the ""stochastic form"" (viscosity solution of fully nonlinear SPDEs). Some stochastic control problems arising from finance, insurance, and many other fields are naturally considered as applications of the theory. <br/>"

The core of the present edition consists of scaling limits for random processes in discrete space, like interacting particle systems and models from Statistical Physics. Models such as exclusion processes, percolation and Ising give rise to continuum objects governed by PDEs or SPDEs, with the KPZ equation and the SLE emerging as the most relevant limiting objects. More applied topics as neuroscience and mathematic models for adaptive dynamics are also well represented, as well as Boltzmann equations, aging, hydrodynamic limits and spin glasses.

Realistic modeling is done at the smallest scale where it is easy to understand the physical process. But questions are often asked about what happens in a much larger scale. The transition involves a scaling limit and in this process certain universal behavior emerges. Different models at the micro level exhibit similar qualitative behavior at the macro scale. This notion of universality is important to understand from a mathematical point of view. The noise or randomness present at the micro level, while it is often suppressed in large scales, sometimes persists.  When it does, the statistics of this noise shows a universal behavior, and it is important to understand what to expect in a given situation.

The signature of complexity on the dynamics of these complex systems is seen in the fact that the evolution is very slow and trapped in regions far from equilibrium. It exhibits new characteristics like aging, and break the well established rules of fluctuation-dissipation. Nevertheless some universal features are shared by these complex systems and this project builds the foundations for understanding these universal phenomena. <br/><br/>This universal behavior is exhibited in very different models which  include the slow dynamics of Spin glasses, both for spherical and Ising spins, and the diffusion and transport on disordered structures like percolation clusters and random trees. One of the tools recently built (by the PI) is a new and powerful link between the study of the random energy landscapes and random matrix theory.

The starting point for this research is                  the work of Varadhan and Donsker, in the setting of Euclidean                   space.  Start with a Poisson distribution of spheres of fixed                   radius, and consider a large sphere of radius N.  Let D be the                  Laplace operator.  With Dirichlet boundary conditions on both                   the large sphere and the smaller ones, there is a probability                   distribution of eigenvalues (appropriately normalized) of -D in                 the large sphere.

This is one of the most active areas of statistical mechanics and mathematical physics in the last ten years that is focused on studying the extremes of highly correlated random systems. Remarkably, the statistics governing the extremes appear to be universal regardless of the particular system under consideration, although thus far this has only been understood for very specific systems. The main focus of the program is to understand the unifying mechanism behind the universality, motivated by examples from directed polymer models. This will be done in an interdisciplinary manner using ideas from statistical mechanics, probability theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. The intellectual merit of the semester lies in its potential to establish a cross-fertilization of ideas within different areas of mathematics and connect these ideas with theoretical physics and other fields of science. Broader impact will be realized via this exchange of ideas across disciplines and through the training of a new generation of students to carry on the work in this important field.<br/><br/>In addition to enabling long-term collaborations between leading researchers, the semester will allow for the dissemination of new results with a conference on Qualitative Methods in KPZ Universality (April 24-27, 2017) and a small groups meeting on Random Walks in Random Environments (March 13-17, 2017).There will also be a research school on Random Structures in Statistical Mechanics and Mathematical Physics (March 6-10, 2017) aimed at introducing graduate students and other junior researchers to this exciting new field.

The project has two separate areas of emphasis, the spectral behavior of large random matrices and the distribution of volume in high-dimensional convex bodies. The proposed techniques for studying these problems include both traditional probabilistic tools of random matrix theory and asymptotic geometric analysis, like the method of moments and the concentration of measure phenomenon; as well as novel techniques from theoretical probability, like Stein's method. In the area of random matrices the proposer studies the fluctuations of norms and eigenvalues of random matrices. One main goal here is to sharpen and extend concentration results due to the proposer and others. The proposer will also continue his study of the behavior of large random Toeplitz matrices, a class of random matrices which has only recently been investigated in the literature, and related random matrix ensembles. In the area of convex geometry the proposer will continue his work on Gaussian approximation theorems for volumes of sections of high-dimensional convex bodies, as well as related problems about how the volume is distributed in high-dimensional convex bodies.  An important feature of the problems considered here, which is typical of the field, is their intrinsically high-dimensional nature. For example, many quantitative geometric questions are trivial in a sufficiently low number of dimensions, but deep and unexpected phenomena can arise when the dimension becomes very large. In the context of random matrices, the primary interest is in results which are nontrivial for large finite matrices, as opposed to more-traditional limit results as the size becomes infinite.  This high- but finite-dimensional aspect is crucial for potential applications to fields like geometry, statistics, or computer science.<br/><br/>High-dimensional phenomena arise whenever one studies quantitative problems involving a large number of parameters.  Besides areas in pure mathematics like convex geometry and functional analysis which are the focus of this project, such problems naturally arise in fields as diverse as statistics, computer science, mathematical biology, and physics.  The so-called curse of dimensionality is familiar in many quantitative fields, indicating the potential difficulty of dealing with such problems.  The goal of asymptotic geometric analysis, on the other hand, is to identify regularity or patterns that arise in systems that depend on a very large number of parameters, but which are not apparent for a small number of parameters.  Thus high-dimensionality in some ways becomes a blessing rather than a curse.  Probability theory is a central tool in this field, both because many problems involve randomness in an explicit way, and because many a priori deterministic problems can be clarified by introducing a probabilistic viewpoint. That is, patterns that arise in high dimensions become apparent when one looks at things in an appropriately random way.  This project deals with both these types of applications of probability to high-dimensional phenomena.<br/><br/>"

Its primary goals are to analyze phase transitions: for example liquid-to-solid transitions where the physical properties of a substance change abruptly.  The dimer model was originally conceived as a simplified model of two-dimensional matter in which phase transitions can be studied. Recent work, however, has linked the model to many other areas of mathematics, from combinatorics to string theory, where ''brane dimers'' are proposed as fundamental descriptions of spacetime at small scales.  The PIs propose to jointly investigate a number of interrelated topics in mathematics and physics, each of which has the dimer model as its underlying combinatorial structure. This project will lead to the organization of workshops and regular meetings of the PIs and their graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, continuing the PIs' efforts to get young mathematicians and physicists involved in these topics.  The PIs will contribute to the mathematical community through their mentorship of young scholars, research talks in conferences and workshops, papers published in peer-reviewed journals, and books on a selection of these topics.<br/><br/>The dimer model studies the set of all dimers, or perfect matchings, on a planar bipartite graph G on a disk or Riemann surface. Despite the simple definition, there are many open problems about the dimer model, as well as applications to geometry, algebra, and physics. There is a fundamental connection between the dimer model on the disk and the Grassmannian, via the fact that generating functions of dimers satisfy Plucker relations. This fact leads to the cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian, and the beautiful combinatorics of the positive Grassmannian.  This project will explore a myriad of generalizations of the objects mentioned above, and will significantly improve our understanding of: the dimer model on non-planar graphs; limiting behaviors of the dimer model on a torus and other surfaces; the connection between dimers on a torus and brane tilings in string theory; soliton solutions to the KP equation and the bipartite graphs realizable as soliton graphs; the relationship between convex polygon tilings and the corresponding bipartite planar graphs with Kasteleyn weightings; the connection between the dimer model and triangulations of the amplituhedron, an object whose volume computes scattering amplitudes; and higher-dimensional dimer models, colored quivers and a generalized notion of cluster mutation, exciting new objects motivated by dualities in supersymmetric quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many probabilists study stochastic processes. Our specialization is local times which is a measure of what are the outcomes of these processes and which outcomes are more or less likely. Our motivation is twofold. One is esthetic, because the underlying mathematics is very beautiful. The other is practical, to provide tools for engineers and scientists engaged in protecting us from devastating weather, controlling destructive market fluctuations, analyzing voter patterns, protecting us from enemy missles...the list of potential applications is endless.

In the last decade, computer scientists and probabilists have brought new perspectives and methods to this study and showed its applicability to approximately uniform sampling, and approximate counting of combinatorial structures. The key factor controlling the running time of such sampling schemes is the mixing time of the dynamics, which can change dramatically when the underlying stationary measure undergoes a phase transition. A central aim of this FRG project is to explore systematically the connections between information theory, large deviations, and mixing times for Markov chains. Certain fundamental optimization and search problems (e.g., k-satisfiability with random clauses) exhibit a radical change as the ratio between the input size and the number of unknown parameters is tuned. Understanding these thresholds quantitatively is another focus of the project.<br/> A system undergoes a ""phase transition"" when a small change in its input has a profound, qualitative effect on its behavior. Examples of phase transitions have been studied for decades in physics; more recently, this notion has become important in other areas, notably in connection with the performance of search and optimization techniques. Further progress on the hard problems of the subject requires long-term cooperation of researchers in probability and algorithms, as well as consultation with experts in the adjoining areas of combinatorics and statistical physics. The project is expected to have an impact on the design and analysis of randomized algorithms and provide insight on key scheduling and optimization problems. Significant effects on graduate training of students in discrete probability and computer science are expected, as they learn the language and tools of the different disciplines involved. <br/>"

While there is much indirect evidence this is the case, the P.I. proposes systematically to examine the question. In addition, the P.I. proposes to use recently developed techniques in the theory of the expansion of filtrations to study questions concerning mathematical models of insider trading. It is hoped that such an analysis could be of benefit to regulators trying to ensure equitable financial markets, by showing how insider trading affects the calculation of the risk neutral measure of the insider, and renders it different (thereby affecting option prices) from the risk neutral measure of the traditionally informed market. <br/><br/>Mathematical models of the evolution of stock prices are widely used on ""Wall Street."" While the models are justified by economic reasoning, there is a wide variety of them, and practitioners try to use models that they think correspond to reality. This is a difficult procedure, and mathematical/statistical techniques to check to see if one class of models is better than an alternative class currently do not exist in any comprehensive form. It is the purpose of this grant to develop systematically such procedures. This should lead to more accurate modeling not just for practitioners of the financial industry, but also it should benefit government regulators (such as the SEC, the CFTC, and the Federal Reserve) in their attempts to minimize excesses and corrupt practices. A second goal of this research is to provide a workable mathematical model of insider trading activity. In principle this should lead to the ability to detect insider trading activity  as it happens in real time."

The PI will treat models of credit risk, and methods currently in use by practitioners (for example banks and investment houses) to calculate the risk involved. The research plan makes the informed conjecture that when bubbles are present, the standard approximations used by financial modelers in the US and around the world are in fact significantly worse than is currently believed. The research will draw on delicate techniques in probability theory which have to do with the availability and flow of information under uncertainty; as a consequence, new mathematical results will be established which deepen our understanding of probability. The broader impact which will apply to finance will potentially result in tools available to bankers, investors, and regulators to understand and therefore increase national and global financial stability. <br/> <br/>The classical way of looking at mathematical models of financial risk uses reduced-form models and attempts to approximate the hazard rate, which gives the likelihood of imminent default at a given time. The PI intends to investigate how fast numerical approximation methods converge for these reduced-form models in the presence of financial bubbles. This involves the numerical analysis of solutions of stochastic differential equations when the coefficients are neither Lipschitz-continuous, nor have linear growth in the space variable, creating technical challenges which should have significant numerical implications."

Incomplete markets are characterized by there being an infinite number of risk neutral measures, and therefore there is not a unique price, for the typical contingent claim.   Various methods have been proposed over the last 20 years or so to give a reasonable method to choose one risk neutral measure over the others, but they have always been unsatisfying, and ultimately arbitrary.  A current popular approach is to use ""indifference pricing,"" which involves economics arguments when choosing (still arbitrarily)  risk neutral measure.  We propose instead to try to ""complete"" incomplete markets, using a modification of the idea of Heath, Jarrow and Morton, who did an analogous feat for the bond market.  The idea is to use the continuous time pricing of financial derivatives, such as options, which are traded in the markets, and which (by the theory) have to be local martingales.  Therefore we need to show that there exist risk neutral measures that simultaneously make the underlying and its traded derivatives all martingales (or local martingales, or even sigma martingales); this can get quite technical, especially in cases where the maturity of the derivative is before the trading horizon.<br/><br/>In the trading of equities, such as stocks, an element which has become of fundamental importance are financial derivatives, such as options.  An option allows one to transfer risk, such as (for example) portfolio exposure, or foreign currency risk, from one party to another, for a fee.  In this way, it is like fire insurance on a home, where the home owner transfers the financial risk of losing his home to an insurance company willing to bear the risk, for of course, a fee.  However unlike fire insurance or life insurance, it is quite complicated mathematically to calculate a fair price for a financial derivative.  (It is also difficult to price some types of home insurance too, at times, such as storm insurance for homes in Florida and along the Gulf Coast of the US, and insurance companies are increasingly relying on ""re-insurance,"" which can often be modeled in ways analogous to option pricing.)   The models of Black, Scholes, and Merton, for which the latter two were awarded a Nobel prize, explain how to calculate a fair price in simple situations.  We now know how to calculate fair prices in slightly more sophisticated models, known as ""complete markets"", however it is widely believed that the world is more complicated than the complete market case, and is in fact ""incomplete.""  All of the many methods proposed to date to calculate a fair price in incomplete markets have been arbitrary, and in general not accepted either by academics, nor practitioners.  This proposal might go a long way towards solving that problem, by using the market prices of the options themselves, together with the underlying market stock prices, essentially to make an incomplete market into a complete one.<br/>"

The limiting objects, which are usually characterized by certain symmetries and spatial independence, capture the universal large-scale behavior of many models. In the last few decades, there have been great advances in random planar geometry, especially in the understanding of some fundamental two-dimensional discrete models and their scaling limits. These developments hugely expand our knowledge on the randomness of basic objects such as curves, functions, trees, and surfaces. They also revolutionize the mathematical understanding of some central pieces of physics, including conformal field theory, critical phenomena, and quantum gravity.  This project aims to broaden understanding of the fundamental mathematical underpinnings in this subject.<br/><br/>The project will explore two research directions in random planar geometry. In the first direction, the project aims at linking two ways of constructing random surfaces: (1) through the scaling limits of random planar maps; (2) through a continuous theory called the Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The investigator plans to prove a conjecture asserting that LQG is the scaling limit of random planar maps in a strong sense. As a tool for proving this conjecture, the project considers a statistical mechanical model called the critical percolation and aims to establish that the scaling limit of the critical percolation on the uniform random triangulation and on a regular triangular lattice are the same. The ingredients in both investigations include: (a) combinatorial bijections for planar maps that encode their geometric information; (b) a relation between fractals in quantum and Euclidean geometry called the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov relation; (c) the Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. In the second direction, the investigator aims to resolve questions in the geometry of random planar maps, computational geometry, and fractal geometry.

The stochastic evolution of molecular sequences on such a phylogeny is an instance of a Markov model on a tree. In this project, the PI will further develop connections between the theory of Gibbs measures on trees and the phylogenetic reconstruction problem. A particular emphasis will be given to models of insertions and deletions with the objective of providing a probabilistic analysis of the multiple sequence alignment problem. Connections to information theory problems will also be considered.<br/><br/>Assembling the Tree of Life is a fundamental problem in biology which provides insights in the study of evolution, adaptation, and speciation. Much information about past evolutionary events can be inferred from the analysis of DNA sequence data collected from existing species. A notable feature of the evolution of molecular sequences is the significant role played by randomness. In recent years, probability theory, the mathematical study of randomness, has provided key new insights in assessing the power of statistical methods to reconstruct evolutionary processes in large-scale phylogenetics. The main theme of this project is to further investigate these connections. In particular, more realistic models of evolution will be considered.

The well-posedness of a class of FBSDEs with jumps and possibly super-linear growth coefficients, as well as its application to a class of optimal investment/reinsurance problems with general insurance models will also be investigated. The PI also proposes to continue his research on stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance problems.

Many of these problems reflect the new trend of securitisation of risks in insurance products and pension plans, and the results are expected to have broader impact on actuarial mathematics, financial mathematics, and could benefit the insurance community for good contract designs.

The new notion of forward-backward martingale problem (FBMP) and the weak solution to forward-backward SDEs will be further investigated, and the discussion of well-posedness, especially the uniqueness of the solutions will be extended to general cases where the coefficients are allowed to be measurable and/or VMO (Variation Mean Oscillation), reaching the most advanced stage of the theory. A new variant of reflected backward SDEs is proposed with an eye on its applications to various problems in finance where a variant of Skorohod problem and a stochastic representation theorem for optional p rocesses were originated. Two proposed problems are more closely related to finance. The general convex risk measures will be put into the framework of the newly developed theory of filtration consistent nonlinear expectations, and will be investigated using quadratic backward stochastic differential equations and the BMO (Bounded Mean Oscillation) martingale theory. A credit risk model with partial information is proposed, aiming at a general framework where continuous observation, counting process observation, and delayed information can be present at the same time. New types of nonlinear filtering problems are expected to emerge, and some interesting new phenomena exhibited so far have raised new questions for the theory of stochastic differential equations.<br/><br/>The proposed research is seeking significant advancement in the field of stochastic differential equations, as well as the related areas such as finance. The proposed projects on stochastic viscosity solution for nonlinear SPDEs and weak solution of FBSDEs will build on the results initiated by the PI to further explore the nature of the respective subjects, and to fill the gaps in the long standing theory. The projects on variant reflected BSDE, on quadratic nonlinear expectations, and on credit risk models with partial information are aiming at developing new tools in stochastic analysis to solve complex but practical problems in finance.  Most projects in the proposed research have direct or indirect connections to applied fields, especially stochastic control, stochastic finance, and operations research. Two problems in finance theory will be treated directly, using advanced techniques in stochastic analysis and stochastic differential equations.

At the critical point exactly, random macroscopic - most often fractal - geometries arise, and in two dimensions these geometries are widely believed to possess a strong property of conformal invariance. The mathematical understanding of these models has considerably improved over the last ten years following breakthroughs of Lawler, Schramm, Smirnov and Werner, in particular thanks to the conformally invariant Schramm-Loewner-Evolution process of stochastic growth in the plane. This project addresses questions related to the behavior of these models at and near criticality, as well as related ""self-critical"" systems - forest-fire models for instance - where a phase transition intrisically appears without any fine-tuning of a parameter. The area of probability theory studied here overlaps combinatorics and complex analysis, and it also uses ideas and techniques from statistical mechanics.<br/><br/><br/>Random shapes, such as rough interfaces created by welding two metals, or irregular sea coasts fashioned by erosion, are omnipresent in nature. <br/>These shapes usually display a fractal behavior, and an increasingly important part of probability theory is devoted to studying such models where spatial randomness plays a central role. This leads to deep and fascinating mathematical questions, in particular surprising ""universality"" properties arise: for instance, similar shapes appear in situations that are, at first sight, completely unrelated, based on totally different physical, chemical or biological mechanisms. A better mathematical understanding of simplified models would provide new insight on more complex models used in applications."

The main goal is the analysis of steady statistical patterns in stochastic processes associated with random media such as random Lagrangian systems, directed polymers, random growth models, and models of stochastic hydrodynamics. Ergodicity is a form of stochastic stability that means that the long-term statistical properties of the system are not sensitive to the initial state. In particular, it makes measurements related to complex systems meaningful. Long-term statistical patterns in deterministic and random dynamical systems can be described via stationary distributions, and it is the description of these stationary regimes that the project aims at. It builds around the momentum that has been created by recent progress by the PI in ergodic theory of the Burgers equation and related systems. The central role of the Burgers equation is due to the fact that it is fundamental in modeling a variety of phenomena from traffic to the formation of large scale structure of the Universe. It is simultaneously a fluid dynamics model, a growth model, a conservation law, and is tightly related to stochastic control, directed polymers, and an important KPZ universality class of models of statistical mechanics. The proposed program will extend the understanding  of statistical patterns for the Burgers equation and related complex random dynamical systems in noncompact settings.<br/><br/>Studying ergodic properties of stochastic partial differential equations or similar models in unbounded domains calls for development of new mathematical techniques. The project will use and enhance modern methods of mathematical statistical mechanics, probability theory, and dynamics, techniques developed for first-passage percolation and last passage percolation models, lattice animals, concentration inequalities, stochastic control, thermodynamic limits for Gibbs ensembles and hydrodynamic limits for interacting particle systems, along with variational approach and analysis techniques such as inequalities and embeddings,  typical for partial differential equations.

The understanding is that for some of these systems the slowing down is due to localized regions in configuration space where the system spends most of its time. A general paradigm (the Trap Model) has been introduced in physics literature and studied recently by the PI and various collaborators. This project proposes to do three things: sharpen this understanding of this phenomenological model, show that it is relevant for mean-field Spin Glass dynamics (and aging) in a wide range of time scale (building on recent work of the PI and collaborators), and introduce the point of view of trap models in hard problems of Random Walks on percolation clusters. The PI will investigate the first topic and second topic with graduate students and an established international network of collaborators. The Co-PI will investigate one of the two themes of the third topic (Biased random walks on supercritical clusters) with the PI for the duration of his appointment at Courant Institute (approximately two years). The second topic will be investigated by the PI, the Co-PI and external collaborators. <br/><br/>Many branches of modern science are challenged with the complicated task of attaining a clear understanding of the time evolution of complex systems, or more specifically, of large systems comprised of many components and with complex local rules.

They achieve their equilibrium very slowly and exhibit fascinating properties along the way; one of them being ""aging"". These very slow evolutions are the subject of this proposal for addressing well chosen paradigms which are known to be complex and ""universal"", i.e. representative of a wide class of such phenomena."

A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.

The processes considered include Brownian motion and stable processes in dimensions one two and three, as well as processes in their domains of attraction.  Marcus and Rosen plan to characterize the self-intersection local time functional as the process of zero quadratic variation in the decomposition of an associated Dirichlet process.  Given that the self-intersection local time functional has zero quadratic variation it is natural to ask what is its precise p-variation.  They plan to investigate this question as well. They expect to be able to use techniques developed in an earlier paper based on the theory of random Fourier series to expand the definition of the self-intersection local time functional by replacing measures by distributions.  They will continue their study of continuity properties of high order Gaussian chaos processes and stable moving averages, and level crossings of absolutely continuous infinitely divisible processes.  They will also study the multifractal spectrum of occupation measures and intersections of random walks on a four dimensional lattice.<br/><br/>This research deals with fundamental properties of stochastic processes.  It exposes a deep relationship between two classes of stochastic processes, Markov processes and Gaussian chaos processes that previously were considered to be unrelated.  This relationship leads to increased understanding of the two component processes, an understanding that cannot be obtained by considering the  processes separately.  These results may have long range applications in the transmission, reception and analysis of data, in quantum physics and in the analysis of financial derivatives.<br/>"

The PI, jointly with Zhen-Qing Chen, has recently obtained sharp estimates on the Green function and Poisson kernel of symmetric stable processes on bounded smooth domains.  And these estimates have been applied to study the intrinsic ultracontractivity and conditional gauge theorem for symmetric stable processes on smooth domains.  The PI intends to continue this study of the fine properties of symmetric stable processes first and then to investigate the fine properties of more general Levy processes or Markov processes.  More precisely, he intends to do the following: 1) study the Martin boundary and integral representations of positive superharmonic functions of symmetric stable processes; 2) establish the intrinsic ultracontractivity and conditional gauge theorem for symmetric stable processes on rough domains; 3) establish the boundary Harnack principle for symmetric stable processes on domains rougher than Lipschitz domains; 4) find some nontrivial estimates on the first eigenvalue of the generator of the killed symmetric stable processes; and 5) generalize the results proposed above to more general Levy processes.<br/><br/>One of the most important classes of Markov processes is the Levy processes or processes with independent stationary increments.  And one of the most important classes of Levy processes is the symmetric stable processes.  Brownian motion is the only symmetric stable process with continuous sample paths.  Brownian motion plays a central role in modern probability theory and has been intensively studied.  In the last few years there has been an explosive growth in the study of physical and economic systems that can be successfully modeled with the use of stable processes and other Levy processes.  Stable processes and Levy processes are now widely used in physics, operations research, queueing theory, mathematical finance and  risk estimation.  These widespread applications are the motivation for this investigator to study the fine properties of Levy processes.  The principal investigator expects that this proposed study will make symmetric stable processes and Levy processes applicable to a wider range of practical areas and to more difficult problems.<br/>"

The transition from one scale to another always requires some averaging at the microscopic level and sometimes, as in the non gradient models, getting rid of certain divergences as well.  In the case of hyperbolic scaling, the macroscopic equation is a nonlinear hyperbolic equation that develops shocks.  The characterization of the microscopic profile of the shock is an interesting problem.

In the presence of conservation laws,  the Markov Process will have several invariant measures. If the  interaction is local then the evolution will take the system  quickly to a local equilibrium  parametrized by the local  averages of the conserved quantities. These parameters that are  functions of space and time will evolve according to some  evolution law after suitable rescaling. There are  several  examples of this phenomenon, known as hydrodynamic scaling:  the  transition from Hamiltonian Equations for particles to Euler  Equations  for a fluid, Nonlinear diffusion equations for the  bulk diffusion of various interacting particle systems etc. The  project investigates rigorously this transition for several  classes of models.     One of the central problems in the use of  mathematical models in the physical as well as social sciences,  is the problem of scaling.  One has a complex system consisting  of a large number of interacting components which is evolving in  time. Its properties are specified at the level of individual  components. However one is interested in how certain small number  of measurements made on the large or global scale evolve in time.  The aim of this research is to make a  mathematically valid link  between the two in certain specific physical models."

He also intends to study fine properties of the geometry of the simple random walk in two dimensions. <br/> The research of Professors Marcus and Rosen is aimed at understanding the structure of stochastic processes. Stochastic processes are models for the evolution of random phenomena in time. However, even though the processes are random they contain some fundamental inner structure which when understood makes them in some sense predictable. Global warming is a good example. The temperature varies, day by day and season by season. There is a fundamental question: Is the average temperature getting warmer, or is the warming we seem to be witnessing simply a short term fluctuation of a basically stable weather pattern? The research supported by this grant does not attempt to answer this specific question. It is instead a study of the fundamental properties of random structures, which may give the tools to more effectively deal with important questions such as this one. <br/>"

Most of these questions are set in a group-invariant context and the goal is to understand how geometric or algebraic properties of the group are reflected in probabilistic properties of the processes.  For example, in the random cluster model, there are 4 natural critical values of p for each value of q.  The PI is continuing his previous investigations of the relations among these values on planar Cayley graphs of groups.  Two other models under investigation concern random spanning forests in graphs.  One of these is obtained from limits of minimal spanning trees in finite graphs, while the other is from uniform spanning trees.  The former is connected to percolation, a special case of the random cluster model.  The latter, connected to random walks and potential theory, is much better understood.  The PI is working to bring the state of knowledge of the minimal spanning forest closer to that for the uniform spanning forest.  There are also many open questions related to the uniform spanning forest that the PI is investigating.  When one views uniform spanning forests as determinantal probability measures, there are a large number of new questions that open up.  For example, the PI is working to establish basic topological properties of higher-dimensional analogues of random forests and to establish conjectures that arise by analogy to percolation. Phase transitions and entropy of other determinantal dynamical systems are also under investigation.<br/><br/>The field of statistical physics is concerned to a great extent with mathematical models of phase transitions (e.g., water to ice).  Typically the model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions.  This lattice is infinite and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group.  The simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in the ground and gas flow through a gas mask.  One asks how far fluid can flow, in particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far.  This, of course, depends on the density of particles; there is a phase transition as the density increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can no longer flow arbitrarily far.  One would like to know where that point is and how the probability changes as this critical point is approached.  About a decade ago, several researchers began investigating lattices that are quite different from the usual Euclidean ones that are most familiar and that most closely correspond to our physical world.  These new lattices, called nonamenable, are also usually based on groups. Such investigations began out of the usual scientific and mathematical curiosity that drives fundamental research.  Within the last 5 years, this area of research, statistical physics on nonamenable groups, has seen an explosion of interest.  This area of research turns out to be quite rich and to contain a large number of important fundamental questions whose answers remain unknown.  Already, there have been applications to Euclidean lattices of some of the new ideas that have arisen in response to the need to develop new tools for nonamenable groups.<br/>"

This award supports research into the understanding of permutations from a mathematical perspective, in particular permutations involving large numbers of objects. Powerful new techniques at the interface of combinatorics and probability allow the large-scale study of the behavior of ensembles of permutations. Experience with other large combinatorial objects has led mathematicians to expect them to behave in certain predictable ways. As a result, when such permutations arise in nature and do not have the predicted properties, scientists know to seek a hidden explanation. For example, this involves the study of the significance of the order of genes on a chromosome, and the knowledge of the behavior of ensembles of large random permutations may tell geneticists when to look for a pattern.<br/><br/>New discoveries have made it possible to learn much more about the nature of large permutations. In particular, the space of permutations of all sizes can be completed by limit objects that are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals. By maximizing a certain entropy integral, one can, in principle, find the limit object that describes nearly all permutations with certain given properties. The proposer and his collaborators will be using both analytic and experimental techniques to exploit this variational principle. One important objective, barely begun, is to plot the landscape of permutations with two fixed pattern densities and determine, for each feasible point, the number and character of the corresponding permutations."

A dynamical system consists of a state space, in which a point represents a complete description of the state of the system, and a rule governing the evolution of the system from one state to another. This project focuses on the long-term behavior of such systems from two complementary points of view. From the first point of view, the project seeks to describe the behavior of typical systems when the rules of evolution are chosen at random. Such results shed light on what properties one might expect to find in disordered systems. The second point of view, the ""inverse problem,"" concerns the statistical problem of recovering some information from the observation of a dynamical system. While there are many examples of dynamical systems being used as mathematical models, and there is a large statistical literature regarding inference and estimation, the performance of statistical procedures when applied to data generated by nonlinear dynamical systems is poorly understood. This project focuses on characterizing when traditional statistical procedures may be effectively applied in the context of dynamical systems. Beyond the very fertile potential applications, the project will also have broader impact on training of graduate students who will acquire invaluable skills in sound probabilistic modeling and statistical inference by working on the project's research topics.<br/><br/>Symbolic dynamical systems, which may be defined in terms of discrete constraints on the possible trajectories, serve as prototypical models of systems that evolve over time. Random ensembles of these systems may be produced by selecting the constraints at random. Ideas from both discrete probability and dynamical systems may then be used to analyze the structural properties of the resulting systems with high probability. For the inverse problem, this project seeks to evaluate the performance of several statistical inference procedures, both frequentist and Bayesian, when the models involved are dynamical systems. Fundamental questions about convergence and consistency of the procedures may be addressed using tools from ergodic theory, such as joinings and the thermodynamic formalism."

The proposed project encompasses the following topics: statistical approach to ill-posed problems for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), analysis of optimal input signals for parameter estimation, and averaging and singularly perturbed systems with transient and null-recurrent diffusions.  To treat the ill-posed problems, the techniques will be based on statistical approaches. Assuming that the observation is the solution of an ODE or a PDE plus a white Gaussian noise with small intensity, the attention will be devoted to the estimation of the unknown source of nonlinear PDEs and certain coefficients appearing in linear differential equations.  The nonparametric estimation approach to reconstruction of initial/boundary conditions for PDE with partial observations in white noise will be studied. Focusing on analysis of optimal signals for parameter estimation, the main effort is to find asymptotically efficient adaptive estimation procedures. Asymptotically stable, neutral, and unstable systems will be examined.  A two-step estimation procedure will be adopted.  The first step builds a preliminary estimator based on input signals, and the second step fine tunes the estimate using a Newton-Raphson type correction.  Analyzing asymptotic properties of diffusion processes where the fast changing process does not possess a finite invariant measure, both null-recurrent cases and transient processes will be treated.  In addition to obtaining certain results on limit distribution of integral functionals of null-recurrent diffusions, the asymptotic properties of the singularly perturbed systems will be examined in detail.  The proposed topics are motivated by various applications in control, optimization, image processing and other related fields. The expected results will have a wide range of applications.<br/><br/> The fast-paced progress in technology and the complexity of modern systems necessitates communication, exchange of ideas and cooperative research at the international level.

The results of the research will be useful for many applications in manufacturing systems, data analysis, image processing, control and optimization of stochastic systems.  The continued and increased collaborations will bring both short and long term fruitful returns.  The proposed project will be successful and effective in accelerating progress in these fields.

There is randomness in the behavior of the microscopic components, so the models are stochastic in nature.  The project covers several models of current interest:  longest increasing subsequences, moving interfaces, Hammersley's process, the exclusion process, models with frozen disorder, and the random-cluster model.  The investigation addresses two basic questions:  (1) Is there predictable macroscopic behavior that does not depend on the particularities of the random microscopic motions?  The answer sought can be the numerical value of an interesting quantity, a function that describes the shape of an interface, or a differential equation that describes the macroscopic evolution.  (2) What are the chances that the microscopic evolution deviates noticeably from the macroscopic description? Answers to this question are large deviation theorems and central limit theorems, and may involve finding an entropy function that the system seeks to maximize or minimize.<br/><br/>In many situations macroscopic behavior of a system depends on interactions of microscopic components.  The microscopic components can be of many types, depending on the model under study: vehicles on a freeway, customers in a sequence of queues, or fluid particles in a pipe or in a porous medium such as soil.  The outcome of this project is a better understanding of the overall behavior of such a complex system.  For example, in the traffic model the investigator seeks to describe two distinct situations, a low density phase and a high density phase, with qualitatively different patterns in the movement of vehicles.  In a queueing model one seeks a description of the flow of customers through the network, to understand whether the system can become dangerously clogged and unstable.  Such models form part of the theoretical underpinnings of modern communication technology.  For a model of a moving interface the interesting properties are the speed, the eventual shape, and the roughness of the interface.  These models and their relatives are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, physical scientists, and engineers.  In many cases simulations have not yielded conclusive pictures of the behavior.  Consequently there is great need for basic mathematical work to aid the more applied scientists' understanding of such phenomena.<br/>"

This                        isomorphism has been exploited by Professors Marcus and Rosen to                show that there are deep connections between these two                          fundamental classes of stochastic processes, both of which serve                as models in countless applications to continuous time random                   phenomena.  This research could lead to significant new knowledge               about our random environment."

A common thread in many <br/>of these problems is:one is given a probability distribution <br/>on some large discrete space (e.g. independent sets in, or <br/>proper colorings of, a graph), and wants to know whether <br/>behavior in one part of the system can significantly affect <br/>behavior in other, distant parts.  The loose term<br/>``long range effects"" (LRE's) is used for such interactions.<br/>Both strong and weak LRE's are of interest:<br/>For SM what's wanted is, more often than not,<br/>strong LRE's, usually under the name ``phase transition"" (PT).<br/>In very recent work, the investigator and his student David<br/>Galvin used mainly combinatorial ideas to settle one<br/>much-studied question in this area (concerning PT's in the<br/>``hard-core lattice gas model""), and a particular hope at<br/>present is that ideas from this work, and, more generally,<br/>the investigator's combinatorial perspective, will lead to<br/>progress on various more or less related questions.<br/>From the perspectives of DM and TCS, on the other hand,<br/>weak LRE's are often desirable, e.g. because of their<br/>connections with rapid mixing of Markov chains (a topic<br/>of major interest in TCS), and because in combinatorial<br/>applications of probability, systems with sufficiently<br/>weak LRE's can sometimes substitute for probability spaces<br/>based on purely independent choices.  (This again involves<br/>the hard-core model, which arises in surprisingly diverse<br/>mathematical contexts.)<br/><br/>Speaking very generally, the (main part of the) project aims<br/>at understanding the degree of order or disorder in various<br/>large random systems, for instance the extent to which the<br/>global structure of a physical system can be predicted from<br/>knowledge about interactions between neighboring particles.<br/>In recent years, random systems similar to those used to model<br/>physical reality have played increasingly important roles<br/>in TCS and DM, partly because they can be helpful in analyzing<br/>(algorithmically and/or theoretically) even non-random problems<br/>in these areas; and there has been an increasing realization of<br/>the degree to which the issues arising in these three disciplines<br/>are related.  One major theme of the present project is an interest<br/>in applying ideas and methods across mathematical boundaries:<br/>especially in using ideas from the investigator's core area (DM)<br/>to attack problems in SM and TCS, but also in bringing an <br/>increasing familiarity with techniques from the latter areas to<br/>bear on several problems of longstanding interest in DM.<br/><br/><br/>"

Since noise is ubiquitous in physical systems, it is natural to study the effect of noise on these systems.

The principal questions in ergodic theory are  existence, uniqueness and attraction properties of invariant measures for stochastic or deterministic dynamical systems. In the quenched random media setting, invariance is naturally replaced by skew-invariance and attraction has two natural counterparts, forward and pullback attraction. The main question is that of the existence of a global attracting skew-invariant positive solution for a cocycle generated by products of random linear cone-preserving operators. Therefore, one of the key points of the project is to develop a general analogue of the Perron--Frobenius theory for positive linear cocycles in noncompact settings. This approach will allow the asymptotic analysis for a wide class of infinite-dimensional stochastic systems and include the classical ergodic theory of Markov processes as a specific case. It is most promising in the situations where the random environment possesses certain localization properties. <br/>It is also aimed at the infinite-dimensional situations where the classical minorization conditions fail. Naturally, under this project several problems tightly related to the main topic will be studied: the problems of invariant measures for PDEs with random forcing and boundary conditions; localization issues for random directed polymers and associated parabolic models; universality classes for action-minimizing paths in random potential; the questions of regularity of transfer operators for  infinite-dimensional systems and related techniques of infinite-dimensional Malliavin calculus and non-adapted stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>Random media problems and ergodic theory have been intensively explored by mathematicians and physicists for many years.  In this project, these two fields are brought together. Ergodic theory studies statistical patterns arising in complex systems where it is hard or impossible to make exact predictions, and only probabilistic predictions make sense in the long run. There are many interesting and important practical situations including those from physics, biology and economy where the dynamics is determined by the randomness present in the environment which adds another layer of complication to the analysis. In particular, the statistical patterns themselves become random. The main and unifying goal of this project is to describe the random statistical patterns in the long-term behavior of these stochastic systems and understand qualitatively and quantitatively the mechanisms of their formation. The proposed activities include attracting students to this area of research beginning at the undergraduate level.<br/>"

Examples of such types of convenient features include linearity, Gaussian or light-tailed features. The investigators intend to develop mathematical tools that enable the analysis of stochastic systems that exhibit non-linear, non-Gaussian and potentially heavy-tailed type characteristics. Their goal is not only to provide tools that can be used to identify when Gaussian approximations are appropriate and at which spatial scales large deviations or heavy-tailed asymptotics should be used, but they also aim to develop techniques to improve upon Gaussian and tail asymptotics by means of corrected approximations and sharp large deviation results. These techniques will help researchers identify the spatial and temporal scales under which Gaussian approximations are valid. In addition, the investigators aim to provide tools that allow to understand how such spatial scales transition into a large deviations region which may incorporate heavy-tailed approximations and more refined information. Since the qualitative behavior of a system can change dramatically depending upon various input characteristics (e.g. light vs. heavy-tailed), identifying regions or scales when tractable approximations can be safely used would be of great value.<br/><br/>        Recent developments in areas such as Communication Networks, Catastrophe Modeling, Insurance and Finance demand more complex time-series models that are either non-linear or exhibit non-Gaussian and/or even heavy-tailed features (such as ARCH and GARCH type processes). For example, portfolios of insurance claims or complex financial securities count their individual risk factors in the order of thousands. The factors can give rise to extremely large losses (heavy-tails) and the dependence structures among such factors, which is crucial in the overall risk profile, is very complex (giving rise to non-Gaussian behavior). As a consequence, the analysis of such complex models is challenging both computationally and analytically and therefore it is necessary to resort to approximations and efficient computational algorithms. The investigators propose the use and development of mathematical techniques to better understand when standard approximations, based on Gaussian laws and linearization, are applicable; when non-linear features must be taken into account and how does one transition from Gaussian-type approximations to a type of analysis that involves large losses or extreme behavior. The outcome of this research will improve the performance analysis of complex stochastic systems in the areas indicated above."

The field of ecology is largely devoted to the study of these limiting factors.  Debates concerning the relative importance of different potentially limiting factors for particular microbe, plant, and animal taxa pervade the evolutionary ecology literature; prominent examples include extrinsic versus intrinsic sources of mortality, different macro- and micronutrients required for organismal growth, physical wear or breakage of different key structural features of an organism, resources versus predators in population regulation, pollen versus resource limitation in plants, and egg versus host limitation in insects. While important progress has been made developing theory to resolve these debates in particular contexts,  these theoretical treatments have been developed in isolation from one another. Many of these debates, however, share a common logical structure: the focal organism lives in a heterogeneous environment, has a finite pool of metabolic resources to ameliorate multiple limiting factors, and can not instantaneously adjust metabolic allocations to perfectly match the environment.  This project will develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing evolutionary problems with this logical structure, apply this framework to several major limiting factor debates in evolutionary ecology, and confront the modeling predictions with empirical data. The mathematical framework will provide broadly applicable methods at the interface of stochastic processes and dynamical systems. These methods will be used to understand (i) whether insects are limited by a finite supply of eggs or a short lifespan to locate hosts and (ii)  whether plants are limited by their ability to attract pollinators or by other aspects of reproduction. To establish a dialogue between the theory and the natural world, data on egg limitation and pollen limitation will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the theory. <br/><br/>Conservation and restoration ecologists are interested in anticipating the responses of animals and plants to changing environments and in being able to manipulate those responses to beneficial ends. This project will contribute to these goals by providing a deeper understanding of how organisms evolve in response to different factors that may limit reproductive success. A population of organisms whose fitness is consistently limited by one particular factor will respond predictably to perturbations of that factor. On the other hand, a population of organisms whose fitness is limited by different factors at different times or places will respond to perturbations less predictably. A key topic of this project, pollen limitation, has direct bearing on documented global declines in the populations of pollinating insects such as bees.  These population declines threaten plant communities and crop productivity world wide. Results from this project will be incorporated into a new course on pollination ecology, into two textbooks dealing with calculus and modeling as applied to the life sciences, and into entry-level courses for biology students. Moreover, undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates will be trained in a vertically integrated manner."

In IFS generation an ergodic Markov chain is                   simulated in R2 or R3 through products of random affine                         transformations, and its trajectory is plotted to create an                     image.

The straightforward way to analyze a position is to examine all of its options and all the options of these options and all the options of the options of these options and all the.... The obvious difficulty is that this exhausting search through the game-tree takes an enormous amount of time even for very simple games (exponential running time in terms of the board-size). Note that the game-matrix approach, the set-up of traditional game theory, is much worse: usually requiring double exponential time. A desperate attempt to make up for the lack  of time is to study the random walk on the game-tree. Now the basic idea of the probabilistic theory of the investigator is that  the probabilistic analysis of the random walk (i.e. the random game)  is often a tractable problem, and also what one has learned from this analysis can often be converted, via potential arguments (like resource counting with loss-probabilities), into deterministic optimal strategies. The probabilistic theory is basically a game-theoretic  adaptation of the so-called Probabilistic Method in Combinatorics  applied to hopelessly complicated games where algebraic and other exact methods fail to work. The surprising thing is that this desperate attempt turns out to be very successful for large, interesting classes of positional games. The main chapters of the proposal are: the foundations of positional games (a surprisingly non-trivial task), game-theoretic Ramsey theory, game-theoretic random graph theory, game-theoretic Lovasz Local Lemma, and applications in algorithms and complexity.  Traditional game theory, i.e. von Neumann's theory, is basically the theory of games of incomplete information. It provides good insights to Economics, and many areas of social science (Management, Military Strategy, etc.). Similarly, one can expect many new applications from a successfu l theory of games of complete information (i.e. positional games). This is exactly what the investigator's proposal is all about. An extremely exciting aspect of studying positional games is that it might give a better understanding of how human intelligence works. It might have some impact on fundamental questions like whether human understanding is a computational or a non-computational process. Note that in Japan there are several ""perfect"" players who, when playing first, can consistently win Go-Moku (5-in-a-row on the 19 by 19 Go board), but nobody can turn these heuristics into precise arguments. Similarly, 6-in-a-row on a sufficiently large board between two reasonably good players is always a boring draw-game, but again we cannot precisely explain why. Or what is the reason that Go-playing computer programs are nowhere close to the best human players? These are just three of many examples where the human mind ""knows"" something beyond rigorous mathematics. One more thing: in contrast to Go, the best Chess-playing computer programs have now reached the level of human Grandmasters. But there is a basic difference. Computer programs examine millions of positions before deciding what to do next. On the other hand, even the best Grandmasters do not search more than 100 positions per move. In human Chess, pattern recognition plays a more important role than search. How to supply this human knowledge to a computer is a puzzle that no one has solved yet. Beside its theoretical importance, the investigator's project could be a crucial step toward the solution of these questions, too."

An important phenomenon to clarify is the transition between different universality classes as the parameters of the zero range process are varied. <br/><br/>This project investigates mathematical models that describe complex interactions and  motion of particles in an irregular environment.   These mathematical systems incorporate randomness to model irregularity and unpredictability.

They have obtained many interesting results about local times which they have published in more than a dozen papers and a monograph. Until recently their work was based on an isomorphism theorem of Dynkin, which is difficult to prove and to apply. In the last two years this has all changed. Together with Professors Eisenbaum, Kaspi and Shi, they have obtained new, simple isomorphisms relating local times and Gaussian processes and have greatly simplified and clarified their early work. They have also obtained many new results; the most significant is a simplified version of Ray's theorem on the local times of diffusions. They will continue this work to generalize the scope of Ray's theorem to consider local times of processes which are not continuous. They will apply their new results and techniques to consider other properties of Markov processes that can be studied through their local times. They also plan to extend their results to more general classes of continuous additive functionals of strongly symmetric Markov processes by comparing them to Gaussian chaos processes. Professor Marcus will continue his studies of sample path properties of infinitely divisible moving average processes. These process are fundamental in applied mathematics. They appear to have remarkable smoothness properties and to behave better than similarly defined Gaussian processes. This surprising observation will be investigated. Professor Rosen plans to study the time needed for a simple random walk to visit each point on a finite graph. The case of the two dimensional lattice torus is particularly challenging. He intends to study this discrete problem by relating it to a continuous one concerning Brownian motion on the two dimensional torus. This in turn will lead to the analysis of `late points', those points whose approach by the Brownian path takes an unusually large amount of time. Professor Rosen also plans to study points of infinite multiplicity on the path of planar Brownian motion.<br/> This research deals with fundamental properties of stochastic processes and has potential applications in all areas that deal with random phenomena. Generally speaking phenomena that evolve in time do so in a random fashion. Examples are the Dow Jones average, data on global warming or communication with satellites. Of particular importance is the amount of time that a process takes a specific value. This is studied in terms of the local time of the process. In this proposal the local times of Markov processes will be investigated by means of associated Gaussian processes. Until very recently these two important classes of stochastic processes, Markov processes and Gaussian processes, were considered to be essentially unrelated. Professors Marcus and Rosen have shown that they are intimately related and are searching for a unified theory for these important processes."

How does a collection of iron atoms gain or lose magnetic properties with changes in temperature? ""Statistical mechanics"" is the branch of mathematics and physics which deals with understanding such systems: systems consisting of large numbers of identical objects, interacting locally. The main goals of statistical mechanics are to describe large-scale behavior and phase transitions through mathematical methods. One of the most interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the resulting ensemble. A simple example of this is the water/ice transition under a pressure gradient induced by gravity. The principal investigator proposes to study mathematical models of such behavior in a variety of basic settings, in hopes of understanding their common features and to be able to predict similar behavior in other potentially more complex systems.<br/><br/>The notion of limit shape in probability describes the property of large random systems to settle into a fixed, nonrandom state in the limit of large system size. Typically limit shapes arise due to a combination of entropic considerations and energy minimization. Several diverse areas where limit shapes have been shown to arise are in the theory of random graphs with subgraph density constraints, random tilings with imposed boundary conditions, and random configurational models such as ""square ice."" These examples are all studied through variational formulations. By studying their common features the PI hopes to learn more about the limit shape phenomenon in general."

These theoretical insights will, in turn, inform the intuition of engineers for building the next generation of neural net-based machine learning systems. <br/><br/>Mathematically, the study of neural networks is a cross between approximation theory and optimization, touching on topics from random matrix theory, Gaussian processes, hyperplane arrangements, tensor decompositions, and optimal transport, to name a few. The PI will focus specifically on (i) the stability of gradient-based optimization of neural networks to both the linear statistics and spectral asymptotics of random matrix ensembles given by products of many random matrices in the regime where both the number of terms in the product and the sizes of the matrices simultaneously group, and (ii) computing the correlation functions of neural networks at initialization (e.g. with random weights and biases). Questions of type (i) give quantitative information on the numerical stability of neural network architectures at initialization. Questions of type (ii), in contrast, aim at principles for data-driven architecture selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current proposal focuses on those processes that arise naturally in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization. The common features of the proposed problems are simple formulation, fundamental mathematical structure, interesting underlying phenomena and non-trivial impacts on physical disciplines. One main aspect of the proposal is on extreme values for Gaussian processes. An example question is on the geometry of level sets for some spatial processes, and in particular whether one could walk on a random surface while staying on high mountains most of the time.  Another main aspect is on  phase transitions of random constraint satisfaction problems, and an example question is to decide whether there exists an assignment simultaneously satisfying a collection of random boolean formulae.  In addition, the PI intends to apply probability in related areas such as statistical learning and biological evolution. For example, the PI wishes to understand how features of individuals influence the structure of social network and what could be learned about individuals from the network structure.   Finally, the PI intends to provide research opportunities for both graduate students in probability theory, and to develop topic courses that bring probability techniques to students in related areas.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications on a number of stochastic processes in statistical physics and optimization. In the direction of Gaussian processes, the proposal focuses on a number of aspects including the geometry of level sets for two-dimensional Gaussian free fields, an improvement on majorizing measure theory, as well as the connection between Gaussian free fields and random walks.  For instance, we intend to study the random geometry and random motion on the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, which is connected to the Liouville quantum gravity.  In the direction of random CSPs and optimization problems, the proposal features the intriguing phase transitions of the solution spaces predicted by statistical physicists. Since most classical NP-complete problems are expressed as CSPs and random CSPs are a rich source of computationally hard CSPs, the proposed study of random CSPs are expected to shed light on underlying barriers to algorithmic performance. Some of the study of random combinatorial optimization problems is related to understanding the average complexity of certain widely-used algorithms.  Furthermore, the PI proposes to study certain probabilistic models for social network such as random geometric graphs,  as well as the NK-fitness model in biological evolution with the aim of providing mathematical explanation to some experimental findings."

His goal was to understand the scaling properties of the eigenvalues of random matrices to get insight about the spectrum of certain operators arising from the study of heavy nuclei. In the last half century, random matrices found applications in a wide range of areas both within mathematics (e.g., combinatorics, number theory, and the study of interacting stochastic systems) and various other fields as well (e.g., information theory, financial mathematics, and RNA-folding). In the recent years, a new characterization has been established for limit laws of random matrices via the spectra of certain random self-adjoint differential operators. This provides a new connection between random matrices and self-adjoint operators more than half a century after Wigner's original idea. This research project explores this new area.<br/><br/>This project builds on recent results of the investigator and collaborators on random operator representations of scaling limits of random matrices. The aim is to study the resultant random operators in order to learn more about the limit point processes.  Questions under study include the application of the classical theory of differential operators to random matrices, the study of operator level convergence results for random matrix models with quantitative error bounds, and the investigation of the connection between random matrix limits and diffusions in the hyperbolic plane. The project also includes investigations related to the study of the large-scale behavior of interacting stochastic systems. It is conjectured that a wide family of one-dimensional interacting stochastic systems share an unusual scaling behavior with limit distributions related to random matrix theory; this is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.  The investigator intends to explore various models belonging (or conjectured to belong) to the KPZ universality class, with a special focus on directed polymers, a model describing random paths in a space-time environment that is also random."

Data science has experienced rapid recent development, largely in response to the challenges associated with massive data sets. The enhanced ability to collect and store data requires a fundamental change in approaches to data analysis. Today's big data challenge presents a unique opportunity to discover new scalable approaches and to expand current theoretical and computational algorithms. The conference features keynote lectures by Andrea Bertozzi and Aad van der Vaart. Additionally, a dynamic group of U.S. and international researchers at different career stages will give invited plenary talks and poster presentations. This project utilizes NSF funding to support travel and other participation costs for approximately forty researchers, giving priority to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty members. <br/><br/>The 2017 Barrett Lectures will be the 47th installment of a lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H. Barrett, head of the Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969. The Lectures are one of the longest-running mathematical lecture series in the country and are delivered by distinguished speakers. The focus of the 47th Lectures is the application of several mathematical methods in topics of data analysis and the growing penetration of complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data. A dynamic group of prominent researchers will expose several research avenues for integrating aspects of our respective (but seemingly disparate) big data perspectives. These connections will ultimately deepen our understanding of the emerging methodologies, which are vital for solving the scientific and engineering problems of the 21st century. Young researchers, especially, will benefit from exposure to the wide array of approaches presented at the meeting.

The project aims to develop probabilistic, analytic, and geometric tools that will lead to a deeper understanding of physically-relevant random fields.  It is anticipated that these tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of long-standing open problems in the theory of SPDE and related random fields, and further promote their applicability.

In past work, the investigators developed ideas, based in geometric-measure theory, for the analysis of non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields, and they introduced renewal-theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of nonlinear SPDE. This research project continues investigation of precise quantitative connections between random fields, potential theory, SPDE, and the geometry of random fractals. Special emphasis is placed on two extremal universality classes of SPDE that are driven by fully non-linear multiplicative noise.  Further pursuit of these connections is expected to yield novel insights into the structure of random fields, physical multifractals, and related SPDE."

The first stems from the recent discovery by the investigator and collaborators of a connection between the Tracy-Widom laws of RMT, their generalization to the so called ""beta-ensembles"", and a family of random Schroedinger operators.  This connection opens the door to a deeper understanding of the analytic structure of Tracy-Widom laws. It also presents a new method for investigating the universality question at the spectral edge for both random matrices and random Schroedinger.<br/>The second set of problems concerns bulk fluctuations for ensembles of matrices with no assumed symmetry.  Such questions are of growing interest in theoretical physics on account of the ties between these fluctuations and the Gaussian Free Field.  Finally, the investigator looks at several applications of RMT to wireless technology where probabilistic and analytic techniques from RMT are employed to estimate the capacity and performance of multiple-antenna communication systems with feedback.<br/><br/>Matrices and their spectra (eigenvalues) are fundamental objects throughout mathematics and its applications.  The study of random matrices (again, RMT) addresses the natural question: ""What do the eigenvalues of the typical matrix look like?""  Or, said another way: ""What properties of the spectra are universal in that they depend only on the rough characteristics (e.g. symmetries) of the matrix ensemble?"" It is therefore not surprising that RMT has serious impact in disparate areas of mathematics ranging from Statistics to Number Theory to Operator Algebras, as well as in Physics and Engineering.  On the theoretical front, this project brings new ideas to the study of the universal properties of the largest eigenvalues in symmetric matrices and also the bulk (or generic) eigenvalues in matrices without symmetry.  On the more directly applied side, this project looks at problems in the theory of wireless technology where, interestingly, the design and performance analysis of many efficient communication systems leads to mathematical problems cast in the language of RMT.  The engineering issues here are of the utmost practical importance - while the demand for wireless communications continues to grow, the spectrum remains a limited resource.  Presenting a natural setting for collaborations between mathematicians and electrical engineers, this project will sponsor joint meetings along with jointly mentored graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/>"

The main focus is on models related to Loewner's differential equation, and in particular on the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). Three principal directions of investigation are proposed. First, the PI intends to study almost sure fine properties of the SLE curves, primarily from the point of view of multifractal analysis. One of the main questions concerns the properties of the almost sure multifractal spectrum of harmonic measure on the boundary of the SLE hulls, but the PI will also investigate, e.g., the winding of the curve at the tip and the geometry of the SLE curve's collisions with the boundary of the domain where it is defined. All of these questions can be formulated in terms of the boundary behavior of the random conformal maps that generate the SLE curves. Secondly, the PI intends to study rigorous connections between the SLE processes and related discrete models and Conformal Field Theory (CFT). One goal is to develop the rigorous understanding of the objects and algebraic structures of CFT from probabilistic and analytic points of view. Finally, the PI will study the Hastings-Levitov family of models which uses iterated random conformal maps to model planar aggregation processes. A specific regularization will be studied with an understanding of scaling limits and the predicted phase transition as ultimate goals.<br/><br/>Discrete probabilistic lattice models are used in physics to model a range of phenomena, and they provide a source of many interesting mathematical problems. Techniques related to the random fractal Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curves, which approximate interfaces between phases in the models, have led to much progress in the mathematical understanding of such models in recent years. Within the project the PI will develop the understanding of the SLE curves' rich random geometric and multifractal structures. Beside the intrinsic and fundamental interest of these structures, and their strong connections with physical models, the universal nature of the SLE process suggests that methods and insights developed in the study of its geometric properties will be useful in the study of other random fractals. An important physics approach to lattice models uses Conformal Field Theories, CFTs, which (roughly) are ``smeared out'' continuum versions of the discrete models. The rigorous SLE machinery is still limited compared to the scope of the non-rigorous CFT predictions, and many connections between CFT and discrete models remain mysterious from a mathematical perspective. The PI intends to develop the rigorous understanding of the objects and structures of CFT from probabilistic and analytic points of view, in particular direct connections with SLE and the discrete models themselves. A related circle of questions concerns models of aggregation where planar clusters are grown to model important natural processes such as diffusion limited aggregation and flow of viscous fluid. Recent advances in the understanding of random growth models related to conformal maps has provided new tools which the PI will use to study versions of the so-called Hastings-Levitov family of aggregation models."

Many of such phenomena may be modeled by continuous time stochastic processes.  The first stochastic process that has been extensively studied is the celebrated Brownian motion, named in honor of the botanist Robert Brown, who observed and described in 1828 the random movement of particles suspended in a liquid or gas. The same  process was later used in 1900 by the mathematician Louis Bachelier to model stock prices on financial markets. Finally, in 1905,   Albert Einstein brought this process to the attention of physicists by presenting it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. The Brownian motion is an example of diffusion process. Like their ancestor the Brownian motion, diffusion processes appear in many different areas of sciences and economy and their  theoretical mathematical study has far reaching consequences in understanding and making predictions about the phenomena they model. In this  project, the PI will study several problems in  the theory of diffusion processes. In particular, questions about the deep interaction between the diffusion process and the geometry of the ambient space will be addressed and rates of convergence to equilibrium will be studied.<br/><br/>Mathematically speaking, the present project focuses on different aspects of the theory of diffusion processes and diffusion semigroups. The PI will investigate applications to sub-Riemannian geometry where diffusion methods turn out to be very fruitful to study generalized Ricci curvature lower bounds. The PI  will also address several questions about hypocoercive diffusions. Hypocoercivity is a concept recently introduced by Cedric Villani to obtain quantitative estimates for the convergence to equilibrium of some highly degenerate hypoelliptic semigroup. Hypocoercive estimates are in general very difficult to prove and the PI will systematically  study  new methods which parallel the Bakry-Emery approach to hypercontractivity.  Some problems in the rough paths theory of Terry Lyons will also be studied, in particular related to the properties of stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian processes. These projects will involve the training of graduate students and junior mathematicians. The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the blog of the PI."

Understanding these structures is a long-standing challenge in probability theory; this project focuses on the mathematical study of these structures. One class of these, percolation, has arisen to study various random networks: for instance, underground rock formations carrying oil, traffic networks in cities, and polymer chains. Another class of these, Abelian networks, arose to describe situations where energy builds up microscopically until it reaches a certain threshold and then causes a large ""avalanche,"" and has been used to model earthquakes. A major issue the work under this project will touch on is how widely-separated (in space or time) parts of the random structure depend on each other: for instance, how do early topplings in an avalanche influence those occurring much later? These questions have connections to other important physical systems as well as to optimization problems from computer science.<br/><br/>The research under this award will study correlations and fluctuations in disordered systems (first-passage percolation and related disordered magnets) and critical systems (percolation, and Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld models also known as sandpiles). A primary focus in first-passage percolation will be the order of fluctuations of the random metric and its relationship to properties of geodesics. In critical percolation, the work will focus on the scaling of the chemical or graph distance in large finite clusters -- in particular, bounding the chemical distance exponent in two dimensions. A final focus will be structural properties of avalanches in the Abelian sandpile model, including the question of stabilizability of sandpiles in two dimensions."

In complex systems where rules of randomness are well understood and sufficiently many underlying events are independent of each other, aggregate behavior at large scales tends to deviate very little from the median behavior. This phenomenon, known as concentration of measure, has been the subject of exciting developments, since concentration tools allow one to analyze many essential properties of rather general systems. Being strongly motivated by challenging purely mathematical questions, this research area also has a wide range of applications in disciplines such as information theory, statistics, computer science, and machine learning, among others. This research project is aimed in particular at a correct understanding of the role of the growing dimension, especially in the problems where high dimension serves as a unifying force. High-dimensional models are useful in practice for instance to understand the entire evolution of a phenomenon in time, not just the governing local rules, which may lead one's low-dimensional intuition astray. The project will have an important impact correcting such misconceptions in mathematics, and will have further impact when these ideas are applied to areas such as statistics and machine learning. The project will also have broader impact on educating undergraduate and graduate students in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/>The project's themes refer either to long-standing open problems or to challenging questions related to recent developments. More specifically, the investigator plans to develop new concentration tools starting from the spherical concentration phenomenon and its extensions to Grassman and Stiefel manifolds. With new tools, one of the targets of investigation will be the circle of problems related to the K-L-S conjecture of Kannan, Lovasz, and Simonovits. The project will explore refined concentration properties of high dimensional projections of log-concave and more general convex measures; in particular, the work will investigate new integral geometric characteristics of convex measures on Euclidean spaces that are responsible for spectral gap and Cheeger isoperimetric constants. Part of the project is devoted to asymptotic expansions in the central limit theorem for the relative entropy and Fisher information, including Berry-Esseen bounds, and their applications to optimal transport for sums of independent random vectors. The project also deals with information-theoretic inequalities and transport problems about empirical distributions."

The aim is to describe the strange magnetic behaviors of certain alloys. Over the past decades, physicists' investigation has generated a series of methodologies and predictions. In the community of mathematics, spin glass models are purely probabilistic objects that present highly complex random structures. The general aim of this research project is to pursue mathematical investigation of physical phenomena including the complexity of the random Hamiltonian, the structure of the Gibbs measure and the thermodynamic limit of the free energy. As well as being important in the field of probability, the tools and results obtained in this research plan are relevant to a variety of scientific branches including computer science, theoretical biology and social networks. <br/><br/>More precisely, this proposal is concerned about the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. The PI will investigate the structure and the role of the functional order parameter in the low temperature regime. In addition, the conjectured ultrametricity of the Gibbs measure and the problem of chaos in temperature will be analyzed following the Guerra-Talagrand replica symmetry breaking bound. The PI will as well study the central limit theorem for some physical quantities such as the overlap and magnetization especially at the critical temperature using Stein's method. Another direction is the SK model with heavy tail disorder. As now higher order interactions are allowed, the system has been predicted to exhibit unusual spin glass phenomena. The last part of the project involves the bipartite version of the SK model, which was used to model collective properties of two interactive large groups of individuals motivated by the studies of the social and neural networks, biology and economics. The PI will be concentrated on the computation of the limiting free energy."

A basic objective is the study of stochastic partial differential equations driven by rough noises, which are more singular than the classical white noise. These equations provide random field models that play a fundamental role in a wide range of areas of applied mathematics and mathematical physics, such as growth models for interfaces, turbulence in fluid dynamics and polymer models. The proposed research will focus, among other topics,  on intermittency and chaotic properties of the solutions, which are related to observed characteristics  in  particular physical models.  A second objective of the proposal is  to broaden the range of  the applications of the stochastic calculus of variations, also called Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin calculus is a mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of variations from functions to stochastic processes. It has proved to be a powerful tool in deriving rates of convergence in central limit theorems.  In this direction, the proposal aims to establish new asymptotic  results in a variety of frameworks including numerical schemes for  fractional diffusions, where  the noise exhibits long-range dependence. Getting exact rates of convergence in this context is of great relevance in practical applications of these models.<br/><br/>A first working block of the proposal is the study of the stochastic heat and wave equations perturbed by  a  Gaussian noise which is white in time and it is a fractional Brownian motion in space with Hurst parameter less than 1/2.  The roughness of the noise creates new difficulties and important challenges in the analysis of these equations. We plan to develop an in-depth  study of such equations in a wide range of directions including existence and uniqueness of solutions, modulus of continuity in space and time, rough initial data, regularity of the density of the solution, moment estimates, sharp tail estimates, intermittency properties, chaotic  behavior and asymptotic analysis when the space or time parameters  are large.  A second working block deals with the applications of Malliavin calculus in  variety of open problems, including the smoothness of the joint density  for the solution to a general class of stochastic partial differential equations at a fixed number of spatial points, the analysis of the fractional Bessel processes and the eigenvalues of a matrix-valued fractional Brownian motion, and the computation of the p-variation of divergence integrals with respect to the fractional Brownian motion. The research will focus in the rough case where  the Hurst parameter is less than 1/2, and new challenging difficulties appear. A third working block of the proposal is to  establish new central limit theorems where the limit is a mixture of Gaussian laws and to obtain rates of convergence and asymptotic error distributions, using techniques of Malliavin calculus. Particular asymptotic problems to be investigated include approximation schemes for stochastic differential equations driven by a  fractional Brownian motion, weighted  q-variations of the fractional Brownian motion and limit theorems for intersection local times."

Heavy tails appear when researchers need to model phenomena where extreme values appear relatively frequently, such as weather, seismology, finance, social networks,  and others. Long range dependence appears when the memory persists in the system for a long time. This happens in economics, hydrology, supply chain management, and other areas. Both heavy tails and long range dependence affect in a major way how the forces in a system interact and combine. Failure to account appropriately for the heavy tails and long range dependence can lead to very misleading conclusions about stability and reliability of the system - underestimating the risks in a financial network, or underestimating the bottlenecks in a communication network are only two examples. The interaction of forces in a system with heavy tails and long range dependence is the subject of the proposal. <br/><br/>This project deals with several interlinked important parts of probability theory.  The first one is that of long range dependence. This has been and remains an active area of research, into which this proposal introduces a number of new ideas. Further, limits theorems  of the central limit type, as well as related types, are bread and butter of probability theory, and the present proposal is likely to introduce an entire new class of such theorems and relate them to the notion of long range dependence. Next, interplay between the probability theory and ergodic theory is also classic, but the present proposal introduces new directions of such interplay, particularly with infinite ergodic theory. The expected results are, of course, results in probability, but some of the results can be of interest in ergodic theory itself. Finally, understanding the structure of non-Gaussian self-similar processes, particularly those with stationary increments, remains an important and difficult question, and the present project is likely to introduce new and unexpected families of such processes and, hence, allow a new point of view on self-similarity."

The vast number of agents and the disorder present in these complex systems make straightforward predictions impossible. The project goal is to develop tools of probability theory to improve our fundamental understanding of disordered systems and, ultimately, to lead to better statistical modeling of rare events, such as high volatility episodes in stock markets and certain kinds of phase transitions in physics.<br/><br/>Specifically, the aim of this project is to extend the theory of extreme values in probability to random systems with strong and complex correlation structure.

This general area of problems is relevant to many important physical phenomena, such as porosity and ferromagnetism. The project's emphasis is on the case of two-dimensional systems, where the last fifteen years have seen spectacular and ongoing progress, involving a wide variety of mathematical concepts and techniques, along with a rapprochement between mathematical and theoretical physics. The PI will continue to engage in mathematical and interdisciplinary training activities of students and junior researchers, in particular in relation with his research projects at the interface of Physics and Mathematics. <br/><br/>The program of research described in this project is mainly focused on two-dimensional critical models in statistical physics, with special emphasis on conformal invariance and the interplay between the field formulation and the geometric aspects of their scaling limits. The introduction of Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) has deeply influenced the study of conformally invariant random systems. This new class of stochastic continuous planar curves has proved extremely effective in describing the scaling limit of interfaces of critical models of statistical physics, such as percolation and the Ising model. The research projects of the PI have three main focuses. The first is the study of systems of SLE-type paths and loops, in particular in relation with the Conformal Field Theory formalism. The second concerns the dimer model and aspects of the free field description of its scaling limit, building on the analysis of families of Cauchy-Riemann operators. The third focus involves the exact relations between SLE paths and an ambient Gaussian field. The expectation of the PI is that these studies will help provide a deeper understanding of critical models and the interplay of the relevant concepts and tools in combinatorics, probability, analysis, complex geometry and representation theory."

These equations are partial differential equations involving a random component, known as the noise. They mathematically model dynamical systems in a wide spectrum of fields. Physics is the most important of these and was the origin of the use of SPDEs. These equations appear for instance in models for growth at interfaces (the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation), models for the movement of galaxies, and polymer models, and also in models of randomly forced propagation of waves, such as the movement of DNA in a fluid. SPDEs also appear in biology, for instance in predator-prey models and models for growth of bacterial populations. They are also a tool of importance in the modeling of interest rates in mathematical finance. This project focuses on study of the property of intermittency for solutions to SPDEs: the fact that the solution develops high-valued peaks (atypical of the average behavior) concentrated on small spatial regions. This phenomenon and its conjectured connection to turbulence and chaos has been very carefully described by physicists, who conjectured many results, only a very few of which are mathematically proved. This research project aims to obtain a more profound understanding of this phenomenon. This field being relatively young, some effort will also be invested into popularizing these ideas among the scientific community, in particular among students and future researchers. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on equations related to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation of physics, which is the central component of the KPZ universality class, a class of probabilistic models appearing in many instances of interface growth phenomena, such as percolation of a liquid in a porous medium, development of a population of bacteria, or the movement of cars in heavy traffic. In order to establish and understand the intermittency of solutions, several new techniques, such as stochastic Young inequalities, moment estimates, and scaling properties have been developed in recent years. These techniques have been successful in specific cases, but more general and more precise results are still sought. Knowledge of the quantitative behavior of the moments of the solution to the SPDE, as well as almost-sure behavior of this solution, are extremely important when it comes to careful study the peaking phenomenon, for instance the position, size, movement, and fractal dimension of the peaks. The project will develop new methods, such as the use of Galton-Watson type processes. The  main objective is to carefully understand the impact of the noise on the physical properties of the solution. Thus, the project aims to compare the impact of different types of noise (e.g., white, colored, fractional) on properties of the associated equations."

For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries.

The  computational aspect is concerned with the numerical  determination of stationary probabilities associated with  large-scale irreducible Markov chains with special emphasis on  those which are nearly uncoupled (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems).  The focus is on the  development, implementation, and analysis of  aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.  Both iterative and exact  aggregation/disaggregation methods are to be considered along  with some hybrid A/D techniques.       This research focuses on the analysis of stochastic matrices  and associated Markov chains concepts. Markov chain techniques  constitute a unifying theme and are the basis for an extremely  wide variety of mathematical models which are used to describe,  predict, and analyze the dynamics of large evolutionary systems.  Markov chain models are fundamental mathematical tools in areas  as diverse as engineering, economics, physical science, and  social science. In particular, analyzing and computing stationary  probabilities associated with large scale Markov chains is a  primary concern in problems involving queueing models and  networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation,  economic modeling and forecasting, manufacturing systems  modeling, and more generally in applications  where stochastic  models are used to understand the behavior of systems that evolve  with time. This project emphasizes both computational and  theoretical issues, and special attention is devoted to the  analysis of nearly uncoupled problems (systems comprised of a  collection of loosely coupled subsystems). The following specific  research topics are to be investigated:  (1) As they evolve with  time, many physical systems eventually settle down into some sort  of steady state.  If the physical system is modeled by utilizing  the theory of Markov chains, then the steady state nature of the  system is characterized by a set of probabilities called  ""stationary probabilities.""  Consequently, analyzing the behavior  of the stationary probabilities is a fundamental issue. The  theoretical component of this research involves studying the  stability properties of stationary probabilities. The results of  this research should clarify the understanding of the mechanisms  which contribute to either the stability (or instability) of the  underlying physical system being examined.  (2) The computational  facet of this project is to develop new algorithms for computing  stationary probabilities and to develop new methods by means of  which such algorithms can be analyzed. In practical applications  such as those mentioned above, it is usually the case that the  physical system under question involves an extremely large number  of components, but these components can often be grouped into  clusters for which there is strong interaction within any given  cluster but weaker interaction among the clusters themselves  (e.g., consider the economy of the United States).  This research  effort devotes special attention to analyzing and computing the  stability and steady state nature of such systems.  Mathematically, this involves computing and analyzing the  stationary probabilities of such systems. To this end, numerical  algorithms known as aggregation/disaggregation techniques will be  designed to specifical ly to exploit the special features of these  types of nearly uncoupled systems."

With regard to (1), it is expected that the  problem of portfolio optimization with random endowment streams  will require non-standard techniques from functional and convex  analysis. Questions of pricing are formulated in terms of a new  kind of stochastic control problem where the terminal reward  function has a random component.

Existing methods for pricing financial instruments (for  example, contracts whose value will be revealed at some future  date) assume that financial markets are ""complete"" of ""perfect""  in the sense that it is possible to exactly calculate the present  value, and hence the price, of such instruments. In reality, this  is not the case; markets are ""imperfect"" or ""incomplete"" due,  among other things, to investment constraints, transaction costs,  different interest rates, different patterns of information, etc.  Thus, it is very important to develop new methods for pricing  financial instruments in imperfect markets; such methodologies  will be investigated in this project. In a similar vein, standard  economic equilibrium theory provides ways to determine prices for  financial assets so that individual agents' utilities are  maximized and ""markets clear"" (that is, supply equals demand) -  but again, only in the context of perfect markets.

The stochastic systems fall into two   model classes: Conservative particle systems, and Brownian trapping models.  The first   category includes the simple exclusion and zero-range systems, while the second category   considers variants of the ""Wiener Sausage"" model.  An important difference between these   two classes lies in that the random environments presented to a particular particle are   ""changing in a comparable scale"" in the first and ""slowly varying"" in the second. Although   the tagged particle fluctuations are well understood with respect to reversible versions of   these models, little is known when these processes possess a drift.  This project focuses on   developing various estimates and limit theorems which do not depend on symmetry, so as   to identify the non-reversible tagged particle fluctuation picture.   Two sample questions which are addressed in this work are: What are the effective   statistics governing the behavior of a typical passenger interacting with other passengers   moving in a complex Customs queue? Consider a thick porous stone roof of a cave; what   is the chance that a rain drop will weave its way through the fissures in the stone to drip   into the cave, and what strategy does it take to avoid being absorbed into the stone?    These two questions fit into the framework of the so-called ""tagged"" particle problem   which is the main subject of this project.  Abstractly, a particle, such as a passenger or a   rain drop, interacts with a random environment.  The goal of this project is to understand   the fluctuation probabilities of this particle interaction in various systems with   asymmetries.  The motivation for this work is that the most general situations in many   physical phenomena of interest, such as fluid flow, queuing, and chemical ion trapping   behavior, are well modeled by these asymmetric p rocesses.  The significance of this   project is that asymmetry is a main feature of the models considered; previously, research   proceeded under the less palatable assumption of symmetry which often simplified the   models beyond application."

It includes non-logarithmic large deviation probabilities for partial sums of independent random vectors via dominating points in the infinite dimensional setting, and also the application of these results to a Gibbs conditioning principle for certain infinite dimensional statistics. Limit sets for random samples of processes, as well as related coverage problems will be examined, and a primary focus will be to further examine the link between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems in approximation theory.  For Gaussian measures, this linkage has been useful in a number of problem areas, but a more detailed examination from several points of view is proposed. Problems concerning vector valued partial sums, empirical processes, self-normalized partial sums, and limit theorems for convex hulls for Brownian motion are also to be considered.  Applications of probability in modern science frequently involve the study of random quantities with many components (dimensions), or perhaps even of a geometric nature. Thus they require probability estimates and limit theorems which are applicable to random sets, or which are dimension free (hence, in essence, infinite dimensional). A major theme in the investigator's previous work and in much of the currently proposed research addresses both of these issues in a variety of settings. As a first example consider the link between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems, which showed certain probability estimates are equivalent to problems in approximation theory. This link led to the solution of a long standing problem in approximation theory, and portions of the proposed research involve important unsolved analogues of this problem. Another example is the study of the Gibbs conditioning principle of statistical mechanics for statistics with infinitely many components. To begin to handle this type of problem one needs non-logarithmic estimat es of large deviation probabilities which are dimension free.  Such estimates were obtained recently, and their application to Gibbs conditioning is being initiated. Additional problems exhibiting these general features are also to be considered, and connect with classical geometry, analysis, and statistics."

Although typically appealing to different groups of researchers, both areas deal with large systems of objects, such as particles or customers, which are connected together by some interaction rule. Interacting particle systems research usually deals with lattice-valued random systems which update according to some local rule. Such systems model various complex random systems and exhibit a wide range of spatial behavior; they frequently occur in the context of mathematical physics and mathematical biology.  One is interested in the long-time behavior of such systems, such as the behavior of the associated equilibria. The investigator intends to work on topics such as the structure of multitype particle systems, systems with annihilation and creation, the equilibria of certain semi-infinite systems, and interface dynamics.  Queueing networks research studies the evolution of queues of individuals under different rules for routing and assigned priorities. As time evolves, individuals enter the system, move from one queue to the next, and, upon completion of service, exit from the system. Depending on specifics, such a system may or may not be stable; the goal of much recent research has been to analyze such behavior.  A recent important tool for such problems is the use of fluid limits, with which problems on stability of networks can be reduced to the stability of the associated fluid models.  The investigator intends to investigate the properties of some of the main classes of fluid models, and apply this analysis to the study of stability questions for networks and to the related topic of heavy traffic limits for networks.      The investigator's research lies primarily in two areas of probability theory, interacting particle systems and queueing networks. The field of interacting particle systems typically deals with large random systems.  The compon ents of these systems can represent, for example, particles, cells, or various organisms.  Such systems model various complex random systems and exhibit a wide range of behavior; they frequently occur in the context of mathematical physics and mathematical biology.  One is typically interested in the long-time behavior of such systems.  The topics the investigator intends to work on include biological models for the diversity and stability of different species, and physical models for the evolution of chemical reactions.  The field of queueing networks studies the behavior of lines of individuals in general settings. These individuals can, for example, be customers waiting to be served, or components involved in some manufacturing process.  As time evolves, individuals enter the system, move from one line to the next, and, upon completion of service, exit from the system. A general unsolved problem is to find which systems are stable, that is, the lengths of their lines do not tend to grow as time increases.  This information can then be used to indicate more efficient algorithms for the service of customers, with the goal of saving time and materials.  A recent important tool for the analysis of queueing networks is the use of fluid models, which are nonrandom simplifications of the original networks. The investigator intends to continue his work in the area by studying and applying the properties of fluid models."

Griffeath exploits this ""symbiosis"" in his theoretical and empirical studies of cellular automaton dynamics and other nonlinear spatial interactions. On the theoretical side, this work is giving rise to an increasingly rich and illuminating rigorous theory of Threshold Growth, a new paradigm for discrete-time parallel updating of lattice configurations. On the empirical side, Griffeath is developing effective, interactive simulation tools for the study of complex spatial systems, designing two platforms in parallel: (a) a high-end simulator based on the new CAM8 cellular automaton machine from MIT, of which he has one of the first few prototypes in the world; and (b) a low-end 32-bit Windows 95 simulator and graphical front end called WinCA. Over the next three years, among the types of dynamical system Griffeath intends to study using this hybrid methodology are various cellular automata, interacting particle systems, and individual-based models that serve as prototypes for such complex phenomena as nucleation, spiral formation in excitable media, the shape theory of crystal growth, flocking, host-parasite interactions, dendritic growth, and phase separation by surface tension.    Mathematical models for growth and competition have played a key role in the development of spatial complex systems theory since the mid 1950's. An extensive body of theory and applications, for both random and deterministic systems, has been developed, especially over the past twenty years. Modeling of such fundamental phenomena as aggregation, emergence of shape, interfacial competition, and droplet interaction sheds new light on many areas of applied science. Griffeath's work during the next funding period will be motivated especially by problems elicited from the spatial mathematical ecology community, as identi fied during an interdisciplinary conference that he organized at the Santa Fe Institute during January, 1996. He expects that the various simulation tools he is developing will be able to provide new insights into questions of genuine interest to that clientele, and that a substantial body of interesting new pure mathematics will result as well."

This variability can be seen in the shift in the distribution in stock market, in the income distribution, in the electoral map, in the levels of a river or of the waves. All the data arising from these phenomena are considered to be non-stationary. Non-stationary data, as a rule, cannot be easily modeled and studied. The results obtained by many of the existing models may be spurious. They may indicate a relationship between two variables, where one does not exist. In order to apply consistent, reliable results, the rigorous mathematical tools have to be constructed for non-stationary data. This research has double scope. First, it will contribute to a better understanding and modeling of the non-stationarity phenomena and, in addition, will build new, reliable tools for their forecast and their long term behavior.<br/><br/>An important technique for establishing limit theorems for nonstationary sequences and random fields is to approximate them with well understood structures, such as martingales and ortho-martingales. Motivated by the study of asymptotic properties of nonstationary evolutions the theory of nonstationary martingale approximations will be developed. This theory is fundamental for obtaining new projective criteria for nonstationary stochastic processes and for random fields that ensure maximal inequalities and asymptotic results, including the conditional functional central limit theorem and limit theorems started at a point for multi-indexed evolutions. The processes to be studied are very general.

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Martingale theory,  <br/>heat kernel estimates and techniques (perhaps even yet to be<br/>discovered) from the theory of the wave equations for fractional Laplacians, will play a key role in these investigations.<br/><br/>Martingales, which were invented more than a hundred years ago to explain the theory of ""fair"" games, play a fundamental role in many branches of mathematics and their applications in countless areas of the physical, biological and social sciences. They are intimately related to a second order differential operator knows as the Laplacian.  This operator, named after the mathematical astronomer Marquis Pierre-Simon De Laplace more than two hundred years ago, gives the matheamtical foundation for the theory of heat, waves, electricity, magnetism and fluids. Both martingales and the Laplace operator interact with Brownian motion which models physical, biological and economic systems, and even with more general Levy processes which are widely used to model various financial systems which are subject to more instantaneous changes or jumps.  At the root of the interactions between martingales, the Laplace operator and Brownian motion, is a deep mathematical theory which makes these applications scientifically sound.  This project deals with several of these core questions and relates them to several other branches of mathematics including more general partial differential equations and their applications to the diffusion of heat, propagation of waves and their connections with random phenomenon.<br/><br/>These projects will involve graduate students.  The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the web.  A sincere effort will be made to expose (and involve) students and young Ph.D.'s from underrepresented groups to this research and to increase their participation in mathematics."

One of the basic problems of random matrix theory is to analyze the eigenvalues of large random matrices. The PI will focus on problems related to the asymptotic spectral properties of the beta ensembles, a family of models generalizing some of the most studied classical random matrix models (e.g. GOE, GUE, GSE, Wishart). The project builds on the recent results of the PI and collaborators in which the point process scaling limits of general beta ensembles are derived in the bulk of the spectrum. The proposed problems include the extension of methods to other random matrix ensembles, analyzing the limiting point processes and finding connections to the existing descriptions of classical cases. The approach relies on the study of random tridiagonal matrices which also provides a natural framework to investigate the asymptotic spectral properties of certain random Schrodinger operators. Non-rigorous physical scaling arguments suggest that a large class of one-dimensional random systems have unusual superdiffusive fluctuations with a scaling exponent of 2/3. Examples include interacting particle systems, growth models and directed polymers. These systems arise as models for various phenomena in the natural and social sciences. The recent decade brought a breakthrough from the mathematical side: for certain models the fluctuation exponent has been determined rigorously and in some cases even scaling limits have been proved. The PI will work towards extending the rigorous results to a wider family of models. In particular the fluctuation theory of certain lattice gases, directed polymer models and self avoiding processes will be studied.<br/><br/>The problems considered in the proposal deal with the analysis of systems with a large number of random components with complex interactions. We might understand the joint distribution of the entries of a large random matrix, but the distribution of the eigenvalues is usually a lot more complicated. The evolution of an interacting particle system might be simple on a local level, and we might understand the behavior of the fluctuations for a fixed time, but the scaling limit of the fluctuation field may be a highly non-trivial object. The goal of the proposal is to develop new tools and to provide a better understanding for such problems. The educational part of the proposal focuses on enhancing undergraduate and graduate probability education at the PI's host institution and actively involving graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the PI's area of research."

In particular, this research sheds light on the formation of asset prices, on portfolio strategies, and on the frequency of defaults that can be expected in markets with many agents, as well as how prices are formed in  markets with varying degrees of liquidity.

One central question in this investigation is to give necessary and suffcient conditions on an infinite binary sequence X which ensure that there is a continuous measure m such that X is effectively or arithmetically random relative to m.  This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data set determine a distribution which would generate it.  By results of Reimann and Slaman, for all but countably many X there is such an m. The argument is highly meta-mathematical. Necessarily so, as Reimann and Slaman have also shown that this co-countability theorem cannot be proven without invoking infinitely many iterations of the power set of the reals. In the emerging picture, there is a close interaction between a sequence's failure to have a random ingredient and it's being structurally definable, which should be studied more deeply.<br/><br/>Slaman's proposal can be viewed in the context of the continuing investigation of computability and mathematical definability. With quantitative mathematical analysis of these phenomena, one can answer questions of the form ``Is there an algorithm to solve all problems of a this type?'', ``Is there a simple example with specific properties'', ``Is there a concrete classification of all structures with these properties?''. One can also address questions of the sort ``Are these techniques adequate to resolve this question?'' or ``How random must a sequence be in order to exhibit a particular typical behavior?''  One must develop a detailed theory of computation to show that there is no algorithm of a certain type. Similarly, one must develop a detailed theory of definability to show that there is no simple example with certain properties or to show that certain phenomena do not have concrete classifications."

In such systems, members under consideration are traditionally located on the vertices of a static graph, with the state of each  member being updated according to transition rates that depend upon the configuration in its local neighborhood. Motivated by a variety of problems that arise from ecology, sociology and neuroscience, the primary objective of this research project is to introduce and analyze simple stochastic models that extend the framework of interacting particle systems as the components under consideration evolve either on hypergraphs or on dynamic graphs rather than traditional static graphs. Hypergraph structures will be employed to model systems including an intermediate mesoscopic scale: contact process with destruction of cubes and hyperplanes as a model of populations subject to catastrophic events, and voter type model on hypergraphs as a model of the majority rule in explicit space. This results in systems in which all the vertices connected by the same hyperedge are simultaneously updated, either spontaneously or at a rate that depends upon the global configuration of the hyperedge. Dynamic graph structures will be employed to model systems of components that have the ability to shape their spatial environment:<br/>coupling of contact processes with varying parameters as a model of host-symbiont interactions, and random walks on weighted graphs as a model of electrochemical signals in the brain. This results in systems involving dynamics on the graph similar to that of traditional interacting particle systems, but also dynamics of the graph, with a feedback between dynamics on and of the graph. Beyond the mathematical analysis of some specific models, the aim of this research program is also to initiate the development of a theoretical framework, inspired from interacting particle systems, in order to model more realistically systems that are ubiquitous in nature.<br/><br/>In the early seventies, Frank Spitzer in the United States and Roland Dobrushin in Soviet Union independently introduced a new theoretical framework, known as interacting particle systems, in order to understand the dynamics of systems that are spatial by nature. This framework not only had a major impact in a wide variety of fields such as physics, biology and sociology, but it also gave rise to a number of challenging and exciting mathematical problems. The main objective of research in this area is to understand the macroscopic behavior and the spatial patterns that emerge from the microscopic interactions that dictate the local dynamics of large systems of components such as atoms, cells, plants of different species or individuals with different opinions. Motivated by a variety of problems that arise from ecology, sociology and neuroscience, the primary objective of this research program is to extend, starting from simple examples, the traditional framework of interacting particle systems following two directions. The first extension consists of systems that include an intermediate mesoscopic scale: populations that undergo catastrophic events modeled by the removal of all the individuals in large blocks, and opinion dynamics including the emergence of large discussion groups.<br/>The second extension, also known as adaptive networks in the physics literature, consists of systems of components that have the ability to shape their spatial environment: host-pathogen and host-mutualist systems in which symbionts affect the mortality of their host, and electrochemical signals that can strengthen or weaken the connections between neurons.<br/>This research project is also the first step towards the development of more realistic models of biological and sociological systems that cannot be captured by traditional interacting particle systems."

The proposal focuses on two aspects of this domain: <br/>(i) Analysis of the topological expansions. It was shown in the seventies that matrix integrals can be viewed as generating functions for the  enumeration of maps, that is connected graphs which are sorted by their genus, where the dimension plays the role of  genus parameter.   This is the so-called topological expansion. They were first used in physics as a clever way to enumerate maps. It then became an apparatus  to find invariants in many different fields. On a different point of view, the limit  of random matrices is well described by free probability.   Hence, free probability is useful to analyze  topological expansions and conversely topological expansions and random matrices can be used  to construct new concepts in free probability, with consequences in operator algebra. The first part of the proposal  addresses several  questions in this direction.   One of the  goals consists in   developing  a general mathematical scheme to obtain  topological expansions. Another one is to use random matrices and classical probability theory to develop the theory of optimal transport in free probability, hence proving isomorphisms results in operator algebra.<br/>(ii)The second part  of the proposal concerns the study of the universality classes of  random matrices. In fact, after the recent breakthroughs  exploring the universality class of  Gaussian matrices, it is natural to study matrices which are definitely out of this class.

One such question we will address involves analysing algorithms for detecting sub-communities within a social network by investigating the graph of friendship relations. The proposal addresses questions from combinatorics and computer science about when random combinatorial and computational problems have solutions, such as when there is a colouring in a random graph.  Ideas from statistical physics give predictions for these thresholds which we will mathematically prove.  It also studies questions of how long it takes random processes on networks, such as the Glauber dynamics Markov chain, to reach their equilibrium distribution and how this depends on their initial starting position.  Such processes are used as algorithms for sampling high dimensional distributions.  The proposal focuses on development of mathematical theory with a view to better understanding these problems.  Finally the proposal will support the development of new graduate courses in discrete probability and stochastic process on random graphs as well as providing research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications across a range of stochastic processes on networks. One aspect involves studying phase transitions of Gibbs measures on random graphs, particularly random constraint satisfaction problems.  Here we hope to establish conjectures from statistical physics for a range of models such as the chromatic and independence numbers on random graphs.  A second theme is the development of new tools for establishing rough isometries and other geometric notions of closeness between random metric spaces.  In particular we will consider whether independent copies of Poisson processes, percolation clusters and SLE curves are rough isometries or quasi-symmetries.  Finally the proposal will consider Markov random fields such as the Ising model on lattices.  At high temperatures it will consider the question of universality of the cutoff phenomena as well as the effect of different initial conditions on the mixing time.  At low temperatures it will pursue a better understanding of Ising interfaces in order to establish rapid mixing results."

The first sub-project is a continuation of the PI's ongoing investigation of the phenomenon of ""typically Gaussian marginals'' of a large class of high-dimensional probability distribution.  In the most recent part of this work, the PI found a sharp cut-off for the projection dimensions for which this phenomenon occurs for a very general class of distributions.  One direction of proposed future work is to enrich this theory by investigating the effect of additional geometric conditions on the measure on the largest dimension onto which most projections look Gaussian. A second sub-project deals with the spectral measures of certain types of random matrices, and has connections to both geometry, mathematical physics and number theory.  In very recent joint work with M. Meckes, the PI proved strong concentration results for the empirical spectral distributions of arbitrary powers of random unitary matrices.  It is likely that this work will enable a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the maximal eigenvalue gap of random matrices from the compact classical groups. A third proposed project is a collaboration with P. Albin to investigate conditions on a compact manifold under which the eigenfunctions of its Laplacian have approximately Gaussian value distributions in the high-eigenvalue limit.  Conjectures that such an approximation sometimes holds have mostly come out of quantum chaos, and some numerical evidence for these conjectures exists.  Combining earlier work of the PI with techniques of pseudo-differential calculus appears promising. Other projects in early stages include a collaboration with C. Hughes to find new patterns in the zeroes of L-functions, inspired by a deep result of Rains on random unitary matrices; a joint project with K. Kirkpatrick to prove central limit theorems in many-body quantum dynamics using a new non-commutative version of Stein's method; and a joint project with V. de Silva to extend the PI's earlier work on limit theorems for Betti numbers of random simplicial complexes to the context of persistence homology.<br/><br/><br/>A main goal running through these projects is to move away from the problems that classical probability theory has traditionally focused on, so as to interface with a wide variety of other areas of mathematics.  It seems that more and more fields, from Riemannian geometry to number theory to algorithm design and beyond, are finding that a probabilistic viewpoint can open doors to solutions to previously impenetrable problems, and suggest fruitful new lines of research that had not previously been considered. Central to such exploration is the role of independence.  Classical probability theory focuses on situations in which independence plays a key role --  when one can describe multiple experiments and assume that their outcomes cannot affect each other, very precise analyses can be carried out in tremendous detail.  However, probability arises in many fascinating and important ways in other areas of mathematics and science in which independence does not naturally occur, but where there is some other special structure.  Consider, for example, a sensor network that needs a certain degree of connectivity in order to function properly.  If sensors are dropped from an airplane over a region of wilderness, it is important to know how many are probably needed to gain enough connectivity for the network to function.  A classical probabilistic approach might be to assume that each pair of sensors communicates with some prescribed probability, independently, but a more realistic approach is to incorporate spacial data and say that sensors communicate if they are close enough together.  Understanding the likelihood that such a random network will function becomes a harder problem because of the lack of independence, but an ultimately more useful one.  The goal of this project is to investigate situations like this, in which independence assumptions are gone but geometric or other considerations can be exploited instead."

The PI has been fortunate to participate in some these developments and he would like to propose to continue his research on these topics. In this proposal, he is going to discuss the current state of some of these problems, and propose to study several research problems that  would lead to a more complete and deeper understanding of the subject, especially problems related to the universality phenomenon. Beside studying traditional questions on limiting distributions, we will also discuss  non-asymptotic aspects of the theory, e.g. problems concerning large deviations. Many of these problems are important in applications in other fields, such as   theoretical computer science and data mining.<br/><br/>The theory of random matrices is a rich topic in  mathematics. Beside being interesting on their own right, random matrices play fundamental role in various areas such as statistics, mathematical physics, combinatorics,  theoretical computer science,  etc. A famous example here is the study of physicist Wigner, who used the spectrum of random matrices as  a  model in  nuclear physics, and consequently discovered the fundamental semi-circle law. The main project in   this proposal is to study limiting distribution the spectrum of random matrices, at the finest scale, motivated by long standing problems from mathematical physics and probability. We also believe that the methods being developed in the project will be useful for other purposes, such as the study of large (random) networks and large data from random samples."

In fact, modern society's need for analysis of temporal evolution of complex spatial systems far outpaces the technological, engineering and mathematical advances made so far. Spatial structures encountered in actual practice are often nontrivial due to long memory, or due to presence of ""rough"" geometrical constraints, and the existing analytical tools fail to describe spatio-temporal evolution of such systems, making solution of necessary parameter estimation and prediction problems very challenging. This project addresses some of these challenges and focuses on the analysis of continuous stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures. More specifically, the research will deal with the following major areas: 1. Analysis of multiparameter Volterra random fields (this includes construction of strong/weak martingale transforms generating the same natural filtration as the Volterra field, study of integrated Volterra kernels with respect to non-Gaussian martingales, analysis of Volterra random fields with infinite-dimensional parameter spaces, development of efficient simulation techniques for Volterra multiparameter fields); 2. Development of stochastic calculus with respect to Volterra random fields and the study of local time for Volterra processes; 3. <br/>Analysis of stochastic evolution equations driven by Volterra random fields (including the study of parabolic SPDEs perturbed by Volterra-type noise, analysis of stochastic evolution equations arising in nonlinear filtering of random fields when the observation noise has Volterra structure, representations and construction of suboptimal filters in that setting, development of numerical techniques for ``denoising"" of images with long-memory spatial structure. Stochastic evolution equations arising from systems of interacting randomly moving particles, which are subject to Volterra-type noises, will also be studied. 4. Inference for evolution equations driven by Volterra fields (estimation of coefficients when the Volterra kernel is known, plus estimation of parameters of the Volterra kernel itself). The results are expected to be useful in a wide variety of complex spatial systems, as they evolve in time. The project has a substantial nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of settings where image/video ``denoising"" is important. These range from tracking hurricanes via satellites to medical procedures involving analysis of spatial data streams that are recorded and transmitted by various devices.<br/><br/>Everyday we are surrounded by complex systems and are awash in spatial data. The importance of analysis and modelling of spatial phenomena is growing with the increasing use of remote-sensing images and video-streams arising in such diverse areas as geological and astrophysical sciences, climatology, biomedical applications and studies of population dynamics. Specific applications include Mobile-commerce industry (location based services), NASA's study of climatological effects of El Nino, land-use classification and global warming using satellite imagery, analysis of evolution of stars and galaxies via remote and Earth-based telescopes, studies by National Institute of Health on predicting spread of disease and epidemic control, not to mention ``routine"" analysis of traffic and infrastructure trends on the basis of specialized maps, which represent noisy ``snapshots"" of the state of complex spatial dynamical system taken at particular points in time. The use of random fields, which allow to take into account spatial interactions among variables in complex systems, is an increasingly important tool used in numerous problems of statistical mechanics, spatial statistics, neural network modelling, and others. At the same time many of the above real-life applications lack mathematically convenient Markov and martingale (spatial) structures, making the majority of available analytical tools inadequate. This project aims to address these challenges and to develop a theory of stochastic evolution equations driven by a large class of random fields, called Volterra random fields, which lack martingale and Markov structures and allow for a wide range of (both, long and short) memory and pathwise properties. The project also has a significant nonlinear filtering component, which naturally enjoys applications in a great number of scientific and commercial settings where spatial filtering and image and video denoising are important. The research results emanating from this grant aim to advance the current state-of-the-art in stochastic analysis and will promote use of probabilistic methods among scientists in other areas. This encourages interaction between researchers with varying backgrounds and ultimately leads to new ideas, techniques and conclusions in each of those fields. For example, complex media, with its important applications and underlying microscopic processes, is typically linked to long-term memory, long-range interactions and non-Markovian kinetics. Some of the examples of the latter include processes in systems of many coupled elements, colloidal aggregates and chemical reaction medium, porous media, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, plasma physics, magnetosphere and many other fields. The project also has a substantial educational component."

Its primary goals are to analyze phase transitions: for example liquid-to-solid transitions where the physical properties of a substance change abruptly.  The dimer model was originally conceived as a simplified model of two-dimensional matter in which phase transitions can be studied. Recent work, however, has linked the model to many other areas of mathematics, from combinatorics to string theory, where ''brane dimers'' are proposed as fundamental descriptions of spacetime at small scales.  The PIs propose to jointly investigate a number of interrelated topics in mathematics and physics, each of which has the dimer model as its underlying combinatorial structure. This project will lead to the organization of workshops and regular meetings of the PIs and their graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, continuing the PIs' efforts to get young mathematicians and physicists involved in these topics.  The PIs will contribute to the mathematical community through their mentorship of young scholars, research talks in conferences and workshops, papers published in peer-reviewed journals, and books on a selection of these topics.<br/><br/>The dimer model studies the set of all dimers, or perfect matchings, on a planar bipartite graph G on a disk or Riemann surface. Despite the simple definition, there are many open problems about the dimer model, as well as applications to geometry, algebra, and physics. There is a fundamental connection between the dimer model on the disk and the Grassmannian, via the fact that generating functions of dimers satisfy Plucker relations. This fact leads to the cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian, and the beautiful combinatorics of the positive Grassmannian.  This project will explore a myriad of generalizations of the objects mentioned above, and will significantly improve our understanding of: the dimer model on non-planar graphs; limiting behaviors of the dimer model on a torus and other surfaces; the connection between dimers on a torus and brane tilings in string theory; soliton solutions to the KP equation and the bipartite graphs realizable as soliton graphs; the relationship between convex polygon tilings and the corresponding bipartite planar graphs with Kasteleyn weightings; the connection between the dimer model and triangulations of the amplituhedron, an object whose volume computes scattering amplitudes; and higher-dimensional dimer models, colored quivers and a generalized notion of cluster mutation, exciting new objects motivated by dualities in supersymmetric quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is important for theoretical reasons as it helps validate the use of phenomenological theories whenever small-scale phenomena are not expected to be of relevance, but has also practical consequences as one also needs a recipe for computing various material constants that enter the governing phenomenological equations. The present proposal goes some way towards these goals by analyzing specific systems where large scale phenomena give rise to a new degree of regularity. These systems are of interest for material theory and statistical mechanics in general.<br/><br/>The specific problems proposed to be studied divide into five specific subareas: (1) Random metric structures on the line associated with long-range percolation, (2) Fluctuation theory and homogenization in random resistor networks, (3) Extreme points of the two-dimensional discrete Gaussian Free Field, (4) Stationary Diffusion-Limited Aggregation, (5) Isoperimetric Wulff problems in random environment. A common feature of these problems is that, in the limit when a natural parameter related to size tends to infinity, a limiting structure emerges. This structure can be deterministic, e.g., a limit shape in question (5), or random, e.g., a Poisson process with random fractal intensity measure in question (3) above. The questions to be studied have bearing on several subject areas of probability and statistical mechanics, e.g., disordered systems, growth processes, extreme-order statistics, random geometry. Methods and tools will be borrowed from other parts of mathematics as well, e.g., harmonic analysis, differential equations, homogenization theory and geometric measure theory."

On the probability side,  the problems are formulated in terms of the behavior of stochastic processes which extend in a natural way Brownian motion. These processes, called Levy processes after the French mathematician Paul Levy, play an important role in many areas of mathematics.  They have applications in fields as diverse as life and physical sciences and economics.  They have been particularly useful in the modeling of financial markets. On the partial differential equations and spectral theory side, they involved extensions of classical theories to operators which are used to model phenomena involving fractional diffusions.   <br/><br/>Mathematically the problems are as follows. (1) Trace asymptotics for Schrodinger operators on Euclidean spaces for  the generator of rotationally symmetric stable processes (fractional Laplacian) with smooth  potentials.  In the case of the Laplacian this produces the famous heat invariants for potentials which are used in inverse scattering and other problems in spectral theory arising in areas of mathematical physics.  Questions of scattering and resonances for stable processes  and connections  <br/>to  heat invariants for the fractional Laplacian will be explored. (2)  A two-term  Weyl's asymptotic law for domains on Euclidean spaces.  The probabilistic techniques introduced by Mark Kac in the early 50's to prove the celebrated ""Weyl's First Law"" on the growth of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian (Brownian motion) in terms of the volume of the domain can be used to extend this result to the eigenvalues of many other Levy processes. These probabilistic/heat equation methods fail to give ""Weyl's Second Law? which is a much deeper result and which was proved in 1980 for the Laplacian by Ivrii and shortly thereafter by Melrose.  On the other hand, the analysis techniques of Ivrii and Melrose also fail primarily due to the boundary conditions needed to deal with processes with jumps. The failure of both the current probabilistic and analytic methods makes these problems extremely challenging. In order to make progress on these  questions, brand new techniques will have to be developed. Such techniques will likely impact several fields in mathematics, including probability and spectral theory. These projects will involve the training of graduate students.  The results will be disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the web.  As in previous NSF grants awarded to the PI, serious efforts will be made to involve students and young Ph.D.'s from underrepresented groups on this research."

From social networks to biological ones, the problems of community detection and clustering are paramount to understanding the nature of the network; as such, efficient and reliable algorithms for these problems are of utmost importance. Devising, analyzing, and benchmarking such algorithms often rely heavily on random matrix and random graph theory, as studies have shown that large network characteristics can often be replicated (and more easily studied) via random graph models. Thus, good theoretical results on the spectra of large random graphs are needed to understand the typical behavior, as well as the limitations of community detection algorithms.<br/><br/>The PI will work on a variety of problems, ranging from the theoretical (spectral of random graphs) to the applied (proposing and analyzing community detection algorithms). Some of the models considered will include the Stochastic Block Model and variants thereof, especially at the limit of sparseness (when average node connectivity is either large and constant or goes to infinity slower than any power of the network size). On the more theoretical side, the PI will work on problems from spectral gap (which controls properties like mixing, but also the possibility of exact community recovery in certain networks) to the empirical spectral distribution (which can be used to establish the nature of the network). The PI will also work on threshold bounds for various regimes of community detection in these graph models, and will produce software for numerically computing the asymptotical spectral distributions for a large variety of random graphs."

First discovered in the description of the largest eigenvalues for certain large random matrices, these laws are now understood to serve the role of the ""bell curve"" (or provide the appropriate central limit theorem) for a wide area of modern nonlinear phenomena. The main objective of the proposed research is to advance our understanding of these and other probability laws introduced through the study of random matrices.

These extensions have the advantage of embedding the more familiar triple(s) of limit laws (tied to the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry classes) into a one-parameter family of distributions defined via random differential operators. The first goal is to extend universality results for these distributions using the random operator approach. A second goal is to establish non-communative versions of certain Brownian functional identities (for instance, the Dufresne identities) of current interest given their role in the KPZ universality class. The final project is to prove universal local limit theorems for a class of solvable logarithmic gas ensembles of multiple charges which interpolate among the classical orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles."

Complexity is captured by the randomness in the model, both in the environment in which the particles interact or the crystal grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim of the project is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To have a very simple example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of Heads in a large number of tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of getting Heads in one toss. (The mathematical law behind this basic phenomenon is known as the Law of Large Numbers.)  Besides its impact on probability theory and mathematics in general, the proposed activity is expected to have a direct impact on the understanding of many physical systems involving random motion in random or disordered media. Understanding complex interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for society.<br/><br/>The proposed activity is on the subject of random motion in random media. Models in this field have been  intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers. Their importance arises from rigorous mathematical connections to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, and the KPZ universality class.  The PI has already established energy-entropy duality and produced solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann functions. In particular, the PI proved almost sure existence of Busemann functions for the growth model with general weight distribution. The PI will next generalize this existence result to  positive temperature polymers, as well as higher dimensional models. As a result, KPZ fluctuation exponents become at last accessible for general models, allowing to establish some universal properties for models beyond the narrow set of explicitly solvable cases. This also opens the  door to establishing existence of Busemann functions in the continuum setting of the stochastic heat equation, enabling one to deduce global existence of a solution to the stochastic Burgers equation, as well as access KPZ fluctuation results directly rather than through approximation schemes via discrete models."

He will also organize conferences and develop courses on this topic.  <br/><br/>Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) arise from extremely important models in areas such as statistical physics, quantum field theory and fluid mechanics. Solving these equations, including proving existence and uniqueness of their solutions, is exceedingly difficult. This is often due to the presence of very singular random forcing, as well as nonlinearities. Various solution theories were established based on different approaches, the most powerful of which is the theory of regularity structures introduced by Hairer around 2013 and further developed by the PI and a few other authors since then. This research will apply the theory, combined with ideas from other areas such as quantum field theory to investigate more SPDE problems. The PI will provide solutions to new important examples of SPDEs, including equations with gauge symmetry and the sine-Gordon equation near criticality. The PI also plans to prove scaling limit results for these singular SPDEs. In particular the PI will study convergence of discrete systems, such as the Glauber dynamics of ferromagnetic systems and directed polymers in random media, to the solutions to these SPDEs in various scaling regimes. The PI will also organize conferences and develop courses to disseminate this research."

One of the most interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the resulting ensemble. A simple example of this is the water/ice transition under a pressure gradient induced by gravity. The principal investigator proposes to study mathematical models of such behavior in a variety of basic settings, in hopes of understanding their common features and to be able to predict similar behavior in other potentially more complex systems.<br/><br/>The notion of limit shape in probability describes the property of large random systems to settle into a fixed, nonrandom state in the limit of large system size.

These examples are all studied through variational formulations. By studying their common features the PI hopes to learn more about the limit shape phenomenon in general."

Until recently this threshold state remained beyond the realm of rigorous proof, but it is now understood in a particular case, the abelian sandpile in the limit as the initial condition tends to negative infinity. Dr. Levine will leverage this understanding to locate the activity phase transition in a wider class of models. This project also has an educational component, whose goal is to encourage and enable bright young people to pursue science and technology careers by providing them with the working knowledge of probability they will need to succeed in those careers."

The trimester comprises four conferences that will take place between January and April 2015.  Hard sciences such as mathematics and physics thrive on unsolved old and new problems.  They have recently been called to focus on matters traditionally away from their realm, for instance on questions arising from socio-economic investigations.  This situation presents a new opportunity for growth of the fields.  This set of meetings provides a venue for a range of scientific communities to discuss these sometimes-controversial topics, toward development of a common and well-grounded scientific understanding.  The two research areas of disordered systems and random spatial processes have developed in recent years the methodological and conceptual skills to approach these new applications.<br/><br/>The trimester concerns studies of random spatial processes, disordered systems, and applications to socio-economic sciences. Spatial probability is concerned with the investigation of large-scale random structures extended in space-time.  Disordered systems are a natural setting to describe phenomena with multiple equilibrium states, a situation that now appears to be the norm rather than an exception.  Regarding applications to socio-economic systems, the main theme will be strongly interacting agent based models, which are extensions of the McFadden Discrete Choice theory (Nobel Prize in Economy, 2000).  Specific models to be discussed include: Polymer models and self-interacting walks; random walks in a (dynamically evolving) random environment; two-dimensional models scaling to stochastic Loewner evolution; random graphs, from the simple Poissonian degree distribution to the scale-free; the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model; the Edwards-Anderson model; branching/coagulation processes; directed polymers in random environment in 1+1 dimensions; and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.<br/><br/>The program website is http://www.ihp.fr/en/CEB/T1-2015"

Despite their importance and usefulness in engineering and science, a complete theory establishing properties of solutions of these equations continues to be elusive. With applications to physical and biological sciences and aeronautical and naval engineering, the mechanism for energy transfer and dissipation governing fluid motions remain carefully concealed from the current methods to analyze these equations. The dramatic improvements in efficiency attained in aircraft, naval and automotive design, serve as testimony of the economic and societal impact of improved control of basic processes modeled by these equations.<br/><br/>In recent years problems in the study of differential equations in general, and in particularly of the Navier-Stokes equations, have given rise to interesting probabilisticstructures. The current project aims to elucidate the relation between properties of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with properties of a class of branching Markov chains naturally associated to these equations.   As well-illustrated by considering self-similar solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, regularity properties as well as uniqueness of solutions corresponds to properties of a specific branching Markov chain in which the branching nodes have a law determined by the invariance of the Navier-Stokes equations under spatial dilation (with a corresponding time scale change) and rotations.  This intrinsic branching structure motivates the formulation of an explosion problem that it is of interest in its own right from the probability point of view. It involves new considerations of the location of the left most particle of the branching process. Furthermore, the branching structure establishes a striking connection between nonlinear PDE's and branching processes that is the object of study in this proposal. A further specific objective of this proposal is to explore the consequences on the branching structure imposed by the incompressible character of the velocity field.  Specifically, the Fourier transform of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations can be represented as an expected value of a multiplicative functional defined on the nodes of the alluded branching Markov chain that reflects the incompressibility of the velocity field.  An objective of this proposal is to develop the implications for energy depletion as a consequence of the algebraic structure defined by the indicated multiplication operation. Likewise, regularity and large time behavior of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation can also be gleaned from this representation.  The proposal  also involves methods of graph theory, with the use of semi-algebraic sets in the classification of nodes of random trees.  Ultimately, this proposal seeks to elucidate the role of incompressibility in the multiplicative stochastic processes associated with equations of fluid flow."

The summer school will focus on the ongoing development of theoretical methods and applications in these areas. The aim is to provide a stimulating intellectual environment for interactions among researchers with different backgrounds. The school is primarily oriented towards PhD students, young and experienced researchers and professionals working in related areas. This summer school is especially aimed at encouraging female students and early career researchers in mathematics. The interest and enthusiasm of these young students are the motivating factor in organizing this summer school. This school will further advance this development throughout the region, while training U.S. junior mathematicians and students for international collaborative research. The summer school materials will be widely distributed by the publication of a textbook. <br/><br/>Taking stochastic effects into account is of central importance for the development of mathematical models of complex phenomena that affected by uncertainty. Macroscopic models for these systems can include randomness in several ways. The theories of random dynamical systems and stochastic differential equations provide fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling, analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena. The associated research, ranging from pure to applied, is extremely broad, with many active groups in the U.S. and abroad. The summer school will treat key topics related to the theory and application of stochastic differential equations, in particular, to turbulent flow simulations: Malliavin calculus,  Monte Carlo methods, multiscale models, molecular dynamics, stochastic methods for turbulent flows, porous media, weather prediction, and uncertainty quantification. The summer school will serve as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research among different research groups.

Second, there are models of electrical properties of randomly composited materials.  Third, there are models which lie in the intersection of the previous two categories, such as those for fluid flow in porous media.  Many unresolved questions surround these models and are now of great interest in probability theory.  The PI aims to resolve some of these questions by (1) using computer simulation to identify new phenomena and (2) applying tools from analysis, combinatorics, and probability to rigorously understand the new phenomena.<br/><br/>The models alluded to above share a common theme; each is a diffusion processes on the integer lattice whose scaling limit can be interpreted as the solution of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE).  The PI is primarily interested in three models: the Abelian sandpile, random walks in random environments, and first passage percolation.  The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena."

While one can try to directly model such systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.<br/><br/>Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems, observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model, Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur / Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently, these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately. The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena."

The conference features a series of ten lectures by mathematician Alice Guionnet. Probability, as a field, seeks to understand how large, complex random systems manifest deterministic behaviors, and universal fluctuations around them. Matrices are fundamental objects in mathematics and all of science -- they encode transformations of space, descriptions of atoms in physics, chains of chemical reactions and probabilities in chemistry, and series of observations in experimental sciences, and they are vital in signal processing. In many applications, there is noise present in the system under study, and the associated matrices end up having structured but random entries. The fundamental challenge becomes to understand the effect of noise on these structures. How does it change the key properties of these objects, and how can statistical methods be developed to separate the signal from the noise? The principal lecture series will report on some of the most exciting new advances in tackling these types of questions. The meeting also will include presentations by other experts in the subject area.  There will also be daily tutorials and problem sessions, with lecture notes provided in advance to help students prepare adequately.<br/><br/>Understanding the large-dimension asymptotics of random matrices or related models such as random tilings has been of great interest for the last twenty years within probability, mathematical physics, and statistical mechanics. Because such models are highly correlated, classical methods based on independent variables fail. Special cases have been studied in detail thanks to specific forms of the laws, such as determinantal laws. These lectures will discuss a general class of models using the so-called Dyson-Schwinger equations and generalizations. The ten lectures cover the following subjects: law of large numbers in random matrices and concentration of measure; central limit theorem in the one-cut case; generalization to the discrete setting of tiling models; topological expansions for large-N asymptotics of partition functions; and generalization to several-cut models.  Additional talks will be presented by Charles Bordenave (University of Toulouse), Gaetan Borot (Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Bonn), Paul Bourgade (New York University), Vadim Gorin (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Antti Knowles (ETH Zurich).<br/><br/>The website for this conference is: http://www.math.columbia.edu/department/probability/seminar/Guionnet.html"

One of the most interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the resulting system of particles. This non-homogeneity can result in abrupt changes in structure, called spatial phase transitions, where the system breaks into pieces with very different local behaviors. For example under a pressure gradient, water can have both solid and liquid phases in the same container. It is a challenging mathematical problem to understand these phases and their common boundaries. The project will investigate some of the mathematics involved in describing these kinds of phenomena at a generic level, with a goal to characterize the macroscopic shapes of the systems and their internal interfaces based on an understanding of their microscopic interactions. One of the main outcomes of this project, beyond the discovery of mathematical laws describing the complex behavior of condensed matter, will be the training of Ph.D. students in the mathematical sciences who will profit from working on cutting-edge topics in probability theory and combinatorics.<br/><br/>The research project will study mathematical models of such limiting-shape behaviors, in several different settings, notably in planar configurational models such as ""square ice"" and related integrable statistical mechanical models. Bethe Ansatz techniques, although notoriously difficult in general, can be effectively applied in certain limiting situations to obtain mathematically rigorous limit shape theorems, as this project plans to show."

This research project explores a number of directions that exploit both the geometric and algebraic structures of such systems to better understand these basic transport phenomena. The investigators will work to understand how such interactions can lead to stabilization in systems that are unstable in the absence of randomness. The project includes research participation by graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students.  At the high school level, the investigators will also work to keep the students' teachers connected with cutting-edge mathematics, helping them to be more effective and better informed as teachers. In addition, videos chronicling the student research efforts will be made in collaboration with a center for documentary films to further disseminate the experience and broaden the project's impact. <br/><br/>This collaborative research project in stochastic analysis and dynamics will explore the propagation of noise and dissipation in stochastic systems and their effects on the existence and structure of stationary states. There is particular emphasis on effects that occur in stochastic partial differential equations, the ability of noise to stabilize unstable systems, and non-equilibrium steady-states in forced systems. Many of the equations to be investigated are physical models (e.g. from fluid mechanics or non-equilibrium statistical physics) while other equations to be studied serve as examples that aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms producing stability or instability in such systems. This work will build on the investigators' previous work in designing Lyapunov functions in the finite-dimensional setting of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) and establishing practical methods for proving unique ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium in both the finite-dimensional setting of SODEs as well as the infinite-dimensional setting of SPDEs. While the research is anticipated to have immediate implications in fluid mechanics and statistical physics, the techniques that will result from studying such systems will be applicable to a wide family of problems in other areas, such as biology, engineering, physics, and finance, which regularly employ stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations as modeling tools."

A phase transition describes a sharp qualitative change in a physical system under variation of an external parameter, such as freezing of water (transition from liquid to solid phase as temperature decreases). At the phase transition, a random macroscopic geometry may emerge, akin to the wiggly interfaces separating non mixing fluids like oil and water, or positively and negatively charged regions in a magnetic material. The study of those fluctuating interfaces is grounded in both Probability Theory and Theoretical Physics. Special emphasis will be put on the interplay between these two approaches, and their relation to other areas of mathematics."

He will also organize conferences and develop courses on this topic.  <br/><br/>Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) arise from extremely important models in areas such as statistical physics, quantum field theory and fluid mechanics. Solving these equations, including proving existence and uniqueness of their solutions, is exceedingly difficult. This is often due to the presence of very singular random forcing, as well as nonlinearities. Various solution theories were established based on different approaches, the most powerful of which is the theory of regularity structures introduced by Hairer around 2013 and further developed by the PI and a few other authors since then. This research will apply the theory, combined with ideas from other areas such as quantum field theory to investigate more SPDE problems. The PI will provide solutions to new important examples of SPDEs, including equations with gauge symmetry and the sine-Gordon equation near criticality. The PI also plans to prove scaling limit results for these singular SPDEs. In particular the PI will study convergence of discrete systems, such as the Glauber dynamics of ferromagnetic systems and directed polymers in random media, to the solutions to these SPDEs in various scaling regimes. The PI will also organize conferences and develop courses to disseminate this research."

Biologists<br/>have proposed qualitative explanations of this fact based on the concept of<br/>mutation-selection balance: that natural selection does not oppose mutations<br/>with deleterious effects if those effects are felt primarily after the bearer has been able to reproduce. However, it has been a challenge to provide a rigorous quantitative version of this notion because it involves large numbers of genes with complex interactions, and yet the resulting patterns of aging should be fairly insensitive to the underlying specifics. One part of the project aims to improve understanding of this important problem in evolutionary biology and biodemography using ideas from infinite-dimensional, non-linear dynamical systems.<br/><br/>Another common question in evolutionary biology is whether evolutionary<br/>processes leave some sort of signature in the shape of the phylogenetic tree of<br/>a collection of present day species. Similarly, with the increasing availability of large amounts of data, computer scientists wonder if the current structure of a large network that has grown over time reveals something about the dynamics of that growth. Motivated by such questions, one seeks ""statistics"" that somehow summarize the shape of trees and more general graphs, and to determine the behavior of these quantities when the graphs are generated by specific mechanisms. <br/>Mathematically natural candidates for such descriptors are the so-called<br/>eigenvalues of the graph. Two further goals of the project are, firstly, to use<br/>relatively simple techniques from linear algebra and probability to understand<br/>the eigenvalues of broad classes of large random graphs, and, secondly, to use<br/>ideas from the theory of Martin boundaries to delineate fully all the possible<br/>ways that certain models for growing trees can behave when the tree becomes large.<br/><br/>The last objective of the proposal is to study how the age of the <br/>most-recent-common ancestor (MRCA) of a population changes over time. Any asexually reproducing population has a unique MRCA, from whom the entire population is descended. In sexually reproducing species, the same is true for each non-recombining piece of DNA. For instance, our ""mitochondrial Eve"" from whom all modern-day humans inherited their mitochondrial DNA is estimated to have lived around 180,000 years ago. As time progresses into the future, eventually the mitochondrial lineages of all but one of the daughters of the current  mitochondrial Eve will die out, at which point the new mitochondrial Eve will have lived somewhat later in time. The proposed research will investigate the dynamics by which the age of the MRCA varies."

(3) What kinds of algebraic invariants can help distinguish between nonisomorphic graphs?  Abelian networks tie these three questions together: From a dynamical point of view, an abelian network is a cellular automaton that produces complex patterns using local rules. From a computational point of view, an abelian network yields the same output regardless of the timing of events at its individual nodes. And from an algebraic point of view, an abelian network associates an invariant, in the form of an abelian group or commutative algebra, to its underlying graph.<br/><br/>What can a network of computers reliably accomplish if each computer in the network runs at a different and unpredictable speed?  Answering this question would bring us closer to understanding complex networks like the brain, the economy and the internet. A related question asks what kinds of patterns can arise from simple interacting components in a situation where the order of interactions does not matter. A better understanding of pattern formation would aid in engineering desired large-scale outcomes by modifying only small-scale features of a system.  This kind of problem arises, for example, in designing a road network to minimize traffic delays and in using nanotechnology to engineer stronger materials."

These areas deal with large systems of objects, such as customers, jobs, or particles, that are connected by some random interaction rule.  He has recently also become interested in coupling problems for Brownian motion on certain bounded domains. In the area of queueing networks, an important question over the past two decades had been when such a system is stable and, when it is stable, to analyze its behavior; presently, a general theory is still lacking. The PI intends to study the behavior of several families of networks, such as those where the customer always joins the shortest queue and those connected with Internet traffic. In the area of interacting particle systems, one typically studies the evolution of large lattice-valued random systems, which model various complex random systems and exhibit a wide range of spatial behavior; they frequently occur in the context of mathematical physics and mathematical biology.  These models sometimes overlap with models involving branching random walks or with other models from mathematical physics.  The PI intends to study the behavior of a number of such models, including those for branching random walks, Gaussian free fields, and the exclusion process.  The PI  also intends to study certain properties of Brownian motion, in particular, under what conditions pairs of Brownian motions on certain bounded domains can, with positive probability, remain separated for all time.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's research is concentrated in several areas of probability theory.  He works in the area of queueing networks, where the behavior of how lines evolve is studied.  Examples include human lines (""customers"") or assembly lines for component parts (""jobs"") of a manufacturing process, for instance, the manufacture of semiconductor wafers.  When the rule by which customers or jobs are served involves multiple steps, the evolution in time of such lines can have unexpected behavior; understanding such behavior is important for designing efficient and cost-effective rules for these systems.  Much of PI's work in queueing networks is in this direction, with continuing work including systems where customers or jobs choose to join the shortest line, for instance, when shoppers pay for purchases at a supermarket.  The principal investigator also performs research in the area of interacting particle systems, where the evolution of complicated random systems is studied.  Such systems arise in physics and biology, and their components can correspond to particles, cells, or individual organisms, and may model, for instance, the spread of tumor cells. Because of the very different behavior exhibited by different systems, many aspects are currently only partially understood, and since such systems are typically too complicated to do explicit computations, a mathematical theory to understand these systems is important.  This project will study the behavior of a number of such models."

Random processes are also used as important tools for efficient computations and simulation. In all these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the behavior of the process. This research project is concerned with the fundamental properties of such stochastic processes and their relationship to global structures.<br/><br/>The project focusses on Markov processes that are defined in terms of a related geometric or algebraic structure. The long-term and global properties of these processes are determined by and often reflect the global structure of the underlying space. The project involves questions at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability with a major role played by groups and their actions. Partial differential equations and potential theory, i.e., the study of harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation, are also at the center of many of these considerations. Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold and random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups provide key examples."

Permanental process are the missing link that can be used to extend the Dynkin Isomorphism Theorem to an isomorphism theorem that contains the local times of Markov processes that do not have symmetric potential densities. They also plan to extend the study of permanental processes to permanental fields and to develop  new isomorphism theorems that relate them to continuous additive functionals and intersection local times of   general Markov processes.

Many probabilists study stochastic processes. Our specialization is local times which is a measure of what are the outcomes of these processes and which outcomes are more or less likely. Our motivation is twofold. One is esthetic, because the underlying mathematics is very beautiful.

Problems involving these complex structures involve understanding the behavior of sums of spatially dependent terms having short range interactions, but complicated long range dependence. Problems of interest in discrete stochastic geometry involve functionals of convex hulls of i.i.d. samples, asymptotic quantization error,  the limit behavior of  maximal points, and  the limit behavior of generalized tessellations in Euclidean space. Problems of interest involving spatial data include dimension estimation of non-linear data clouds embedded in a high dimensional Euclidean space, estimation of entropy, estimation of surface and volume integrals, as well as establishing minimal cost networks for data transmission and energy scaling laws. In each case, one seeks to quantify the `mean' or average behavior of functionals arising in these problems.   A chief goal is to show that  sums of spatially dependent terms behave as though they were sums of independent identically distributed random variables.

It is known that if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then pricing the Black-Scholes type formula becomes delicate and difficult to analyze.  For instance, if the underlying asset price is a ""true"" martingale, then the European call price is a submartingale, hence the function is increasing. On the other hand, if the underlying asset price is a strict local martingale, then the European call price is not in general increasing.  The project develops techniques from probability theory to build a bridge between mathematical models and financial markets.  A first main direction of the project uses the interpretation of the generalized Black-Scholes quantities in terms of last passage times in the framework of Bessel processes in order to derive fine properties of the call option process, as a function of maturity, written for the strict local Bessel martingales.  Concretely, the work aims to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding market bubbles.  A second main focus of the project investigates the enlargement filtration of the last passage time in the Black-Scholes type formula, in particular, its ""distance"" from the stopping time.  In a financial context, an example of the improper use of stopping time may be interpreted as using signals coming from available inside information. <br/>The project will develop mathematical theory and tools for detecting the presence of arbitrage trading in this setting which is also related to market bubble phenomena.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a series of market crashes and bubbles where mispricing takes place. In economic terms, a bubble is defined as a deviation between the price of an asset and its underlying values.<br/>Mathematically, bubbles are phenomena for which the discounted asset prices are strictly local martingale but not martingale under the risk-free measure. In other words, if the discounted asset price processes are strict local martingales, option prices no longer increase in maturity and Merton's no early exercise theorem does not hold. Intuitively, if a bubble exists, the asset price will increase initially, but a crash is<br/>likely to take place in the future.   It is well-known that many<br/>sophisticated financial derivatives have been built on the foundation of mathematical theories since the 1970s. As a consequence, such a rapid increase of derivative markets necessitates proper communication between financial analysts and mathematicians.  A general goal of the project is to develop a rigorous mathematical understanding of market bubbles and related phenomena.  The project is interdisciplinary in nature and will be integrated into practical applications.<br/><br/><br/>"

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability. Some of the topics in these courses will be related to the problems in this project. The PI will continue to write research papers, organize seminars, and give a wide range of talks, from research level to introductory one in order to encourage students into studying mathematics."

Three of the proposed questions in the first topic concern ""When can species coexist"", while a fourth concerns the possibility that the quadratic contact process in two dimensions can have two phase transitions one for the existence of stationary distributions and a larger one for survival from a finite set. In the second topic one interesting mathematical problem concerns ""explosive percolation"" conjectured to have a discontinuous transition, while the more biologically important question concerns how the outcomes of epidemics and ecological competitions change when they take place on random graphs, which arguably provide better models of the real social networks. The third topic concern situations in which the characteristics of individuals in ecological competitions are also not static but evolve in response to their environment. My first steps in the area ""adaptive dynamics"" were taken in a study of predator-prey systems with John Mayberry. Here, we propose to study more complex examples that lead to evolutionary cycling and a second problem on the evolution of virulence, which leads to consideration of the role of spatial structure in increasing the virulence of diseases.<br/><br/>Many interesting mathematical questions arise from biology. Here we address some questions that arise from ecology and evolution. Three examples should illustrate the nature of our work. (1) At the turn of the century, observations of social networks revealed that we live in a small world in which everyone on the planet is separated by six degrees of separation. Now we need to understand how this geometry of social networks effects the spread of epidemics and the other biological and social processes. (2) The world shows much more biodiversity than mathematical models predict, so it is important to understand the mechanisms which allow for species coexistence. More generally, we will also be interested in how spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological competition. (3) In most situations the characteristics of individuals involved in competition with other species or with infectious agents are not static but evolve in time. <br/>For example, in most cases diseases evolve to be less virulent, but in a spatially structured population the opposite may occur. Co-evolution of hosts and parasites can lead to interesting evolutionary cycling, sometimes called ?Red Queen Dynamics after the character in Alice in Wonderland who has to keep running to stay in the same place."

The PI is interested in three important classes of models arising from statistical physics.  First, there are cluster growth models for corrosion of metals and crystal formation.  Second, there are models of electrical properties of randomly composited materials.  Third, there are models which lie in the intersection of the previous two categories, such as those for fluid flow in porous media.  Many unresolved questions surround these models and are now of great interest in probability theory.  The PI aims to resolve some of these questions by (1) using computer simulation to identify new phenomena and (2) applying tools from analysis, combinatorics, and probability to rigorously understand the new phenomena.<br/><br/>The models alluded to above share a common theme; each is a diffusion processes on the integer lattice whose scaling limit can be interpreted as the solution of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE).  The PI is primarily interested in three models: the Abelian sandpile, random walks in random environments, and first passage percolation.  The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena."

The examples include, among others, the World Wide Web and the networks of brain neurons. These real-world networks can be effectively modeled by sparse random graphs where the links between the pair of vertices are added under certain stochastic rules. These random graphs have very complex geometry. One way to understand their geometry is to study what are called the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the graphs. For example, by looking at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors one can infer how congested the network is, or identify the different clusters present in the network. A significant part of this proposal is devoted to the study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these sparse random graphs of which very little is known so far. These random graphs with the associated eigenvalues and eigenvectors are also used as a mathematical model to study the propagation of electrons in a disordered medium, that is, a medium with impurities. Some of the questions outlined in this proposal are motivated by the goal of understanding the transport of electromagnetic waves in disordered media. The proposed research will involve active collaborations between the PI and a number of researchers from various US and international universities. <br/><br/><br/>This proposal consists of three directions of research in probability theory, all related to the spectra of sparse random graphs. The first part of this proposal deals with the study of eigenvalue distributions of the adjacency matrices of different models of random graphs with bounded average vertex degrees. In the limit, as the size of the graphs grows to infinity, these eigenvalue distributions exhibit a remarkably complex range of behaviors. The PI will study properties of the eigenvalue distribution for various sparse random graph models, including random graphs with a given degree distribution and percolations on Euclidean lattices, primarily focusing on three key features in the limiting eigenvalue distributions- existence of continuous part, finitely many atoms and gaps in the support. The adjacency matrix of a large sparse random graph can be used as a Hamiltonian for electron hopping on a disordered medium and the study of its eigenvalue distribution is a preliminary step towards understanding whether the medium behaves like a metal or an insulator at different energies. The second part of this proposal deals with a model which was introduced by Hatano and Nelson to study the motion of magnetic flux lines in semiconductors. This can be thought as a non-Hermitian analogue of the famous Anderson model in one dimension. Hatano and Nelson observed contrasting localization behaviors of the eigenvectors associated with the real and the complex eigenvalues. The PI proposes to investigate this phenomenon rigorously and try to understand so-called 'delocalization transition' of the eigenvectors. The final part of this proposal involves a couple of combinatorial optimization problems on sparse random graphs. Each of these problems deals with a combinatorial structure that is connected to the spectra of the underlying graph, but they are interesting on their own. One of them is to understand the behavior of the minimum weight perfect matching on the Euclidean lattices. The variants of this optimization problem has received a lot of attention in the literature. Overall, this proposal consists of a wide range of problems whose solutions will include a combination of a diverse set of tools and ideas from random matrix theory, random Schrodinger operators, graph theory, statistical physics, additive combinatorics and probability."

From a more abstract perspective, cellular automata are a suitable tool used to characterize and catalog local dynamics which generate a prescribed global phenomenon. The first aim of this project is to develop and use techniques from modern probability theory, as well as computational tools, to study diverse aspects of cellular automata. Then second aim is to use the gathered insights to investigate more complex dynamics of diffusive, nonlocal and high-dimensional models inspired by crystal growth, genetics and social networks.<br/><br/>Three themes connect cellular automata with probability theory. The first issue, motivated by studying self-organization, involves evolution of a given rule from random initial states. The addressed topics include: nucleation, that is, random formation of centers that orchestrate a takeover of the available space; highly dependent percolation structures that determine the behavior of typical trajectories; and Lyapunov stability analysis through large deviations of branching random walks. The second direction are random rules, with a branching process approach to formation of stable periodic structures. The third, classical, theme is perturbation of deterministic updates by random noise. For more general models, the project aims to study non-local dynamics, focusing on nucleation theory, the nature of phase transitions, effects of space heterogeneity, and the boundary between short- and long-range interactions. Computation is a significant component of the research and involves simulations, analysis of algorithms, computer-aided proofs, numerical and statistical methods, and visualization techniques."

Motivated by problems from both wired and wireless communications, the research program will develop explicitly computable large deviation asymptotic approximations, and will also develop methods such as importance sampling to provide accurate results even in the non-asymptotic regime.

This area of application is narrower in scope, being of particular interest to engineers of next generation, high-rate wireless access systems. However, within that scope, the activities are general and fundamental in nature. The emphasis here is on the development of methods for the analysis of scheduling algorithms in wireless, and on the development of new algorithms.<br/>  This project will develop mathematical methods for two important areas in modern telecommunication, with an emphasis on a broad university/industrial training of graduate students.  A key component of the research program is the joint supervision of graduate students between Bell Labs and Brown University.  For the graduate students that are involved, there will be summer internships at Lucent Technologies, which will supplement the more traditional training in a number of ways.  Both research areas of focus, namely occupancy models and wireless scheduling, are challenging intellectual problems that are motivated by developing commercial technology.  In addition to working with specific industrial mentors, the students also have the opportunity to attend talks, seminars and generally benefit from exposure to a wide variety of current problems and solution methods whose development is in progress.

The purpose of this project is to make significant progress towards developing a theory of the exact solvability of the KPZ equation. In particular, this theory should lead to exact formulas for the probability distributions of the solution to the KPZ equation when started with various important types of initial data. This project will involve a number of fields of mathematics and this direction has already produced results of independent interest to these fields, which include: Macdonald symmetric function theory, tropical combinatorics and Whittaker functions, and certain quantum integrable systems.<br/> <br/>Since its discovery two hundred years ago the Gaussian distribution (bell curve) has come to represent one of mathematics greatest societal and scientific contributions ? a robust theory explaining and analyzing much of the randomness inherent in the world. Physical and mathematical systems accurately described in terms of Gaussian statistics are said to be in the Gaussian universality class. This class, however, is not all encompassing. For example, classical extreme value statistics or Poisson statistics better capture the randomness and severity of events ranging from natural disasters to emergency room visits. More recently, significant research efforts have been focused on understanding systems which are not well-described in terms of any of the classically developed statistics. The failure of these systems to conform to classical descriptions is generally due to a non-linear relationship between natural observables and underlying sources of random inputs and noise. A variety of models for complex systems such as growth processes, polymer chains, mass transport, traffic flow, queueing theory, driven gases, and turbulence have been actively studied for over forty years in mathematics, physics, material science, chemistry and biology. All of these systems fail to conform with classical Gaussian statistics, as has been observed through experimental evidence involving turbulent liquid crystals, crystal growth on a thin film, facet boundaries, bacteria colony growth, paper wetting, crack formation, and burning fronts. Surprisingly, despite their differences, all of the systems fall into a new statistical universality class whose properties are described in terms of a single model called the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The purpose of this project is to develop a statistical understand of the KPZ equation and its universality class."

Recently, algorithms based on variants of the Thorp shuffle that use both local and global swaps have been proposed. It is planned to obtain good mixing time bounds for these shuffles.

A point-of-view that has been particularly fruitful for understanding complex objects in many areas of mathematics, and science more generally, has been the formulation of an appropriate notion of distance between objects and the introduction of ""ideal"" infinite objects such that the finite objects get closer and closer to a target infinite object as they become larger.  The first subproject investigates situations in which an informative notion of distance is that objects are deemed to be close if they are close in a statistical sense; more specifically, the subproject considers various classes of structures where there is a well-defined notion of a randomly sampled substructure of a given size and one declares that two structures are close if the probabilistic behaviors of substructures of various sizes sampled from each of them are similar.  The goal of the subproject is to investigate whether there are ""ideal"" infinite structures in these settings and corresponding notions of random sampling such that the substructures sampled from large finite structures behave similarly to those sampled from a target infinite structure.  The second subproject investigates one of the senses in which large and complex objects may be broken down into simpler building blocks that are combined in a prescribed manner.  A prototypical instance of such a decomposition is the factorization of whole numbers as products of prime numbers.  Here the attention is on geometric objects which can be discretized to an arbitrary degree of precision by sampling points at random and the analogue of the multiplication of whole numbers is the formation of Cartesian products.<br/><br/>The latter half of the proposed research consists of two subprojects in the area of probability theory applied to biology.  One of these involves the analysis of metagenomic data in which the microbial diversity of an environment (e.g., the human gut) is surveyed by bulk sampling of genetic material from all organisms present and the subsequent placement of the organisms on a reference ""evolutionary family tree"" of microbial life.  The research will develop new methods for understanding the ways in which an array of such samples differ from each other and how these differences are affected by external factors such as the presence of certain medications.  The other subproject in the latter half deals with ecology and population dynamics.  It seeks to model the growth of geographically dispersing populations in an environment that is heterogeneous in space and time and shed light on questions about how environmental conditions, dispersal strategies and the effects of competition for resources interact to influence the long-term survival of the population."

If the abundances of the constituent molecules of a reaction network are sufficiently high then the reaction network is typically modeled as a coupled set of ordinary differential equations.  If, however, the abundances are low then the standard deterministic models do not provide a good representation of the behavior of the system and stochastic models are used.  The simplest stochastic model treats the system as a continuous time Markov chain. More complicated models tend to be hybrid in nature with some components modeled discretely, some diffusively, and some absolutely continuously (that is, solutions of ordinary differential equations with stochastic inputs from the other components).  This project has two related goals.  The first is to develop rigorous results relating network structure---typically the simplest information to obtain experimentally about networks---with qualitative properties of the dynamics of reaction networks, and to do so in both the deterministic and stochastic settings.  The second goal is to develop and analyze numerical simulation methods for stochastically modeled systems that account for both the natural scalings and basic mathematical structure of reaction networks.  Stochastically modeled reaction networks often involve multiple natural scales and it is crucial that these natural scales be accounted for when developing and analyzing numerical simulation methods.  Also, all of the equations that describe reaction networks are of a very specific mathematical structure that can be utilized to develop efficient algorithms in both the discrete and continuous stochastic contexts.<br/><br/>All of the questions being addressed in this proposal have motivation from the biosciences. Recent advances in experimental methods concerning the dynamics of the cell (such as green fluorescent protein) have increased interest in how biological molecules interact at the cellular level over the course of time.  Because Brownian forces are significant at this level, stochastic models for these intracellular reaction networks, combined with analytical and computational tools, are essential if they are to be well understood.  This project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students.  In particular, there is a high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of problems arising in biology."

The investigator's research concerns stochastic models associated with the evolution of dilute gases, coagulation-fragmentation phenomenon and the formation of solids. As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. In the case of a dilute gas, one shows that after a suitable scaling, the particle density converges to a solution of the Boltzmann equation. In the case of the coagulation-fragmentation phenomenon, the rescaled microscopic particle density converges to a solution of the Smoluchowski equation. As a model of a crystal, one may consider an inhomogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation with viscosity. After a suitable scaling, the solutions converge to solutions of homogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Probabilistically, such a convergence is a law of large numbers and its corresponding central limit theorem and large deviation principle provide us with some vital information about the microscopic model under the study. <br/> Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move erratically without any particular aim.

One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied.

The first one involves study of spectral and eigenvectors properties of sparse random graphs. This is a joint work with Ioana Dumitriu. Eigenvectors of graph adjacency or laplacian matrices have natural significance as solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. However, very little theoretical results are known about eigenvectors of random graphs. Our ongoing investigation combines methods and intuition from the Random Matrix Theory with graph combinatorics. We have so far succeeded in obtaining interesting results for random regular graphs where we show that, when the degree grows poly-logarithmically with the order, the adjacency matrix displays some of the properties of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles. Eventually we plan to  study ``real world'' graphs, particularly the ones with a given degree distribution. The second direction is the construction and study of a diffusion on the space of continuum trees whose reversible measure is the Brownian CRT, as conjectured by David Aldous. This appears as a limit of natural discrete Markov chains on finite phylogenetic trees. Continuum trees are of great significance as they appear as the limiting state space of several families of random trees and random planar maps (via Schaeffer bijection). It appears from our ongoing study that this limiting diffusion is a new kind of measure-valued process on the space of such trees, reminiscent of the classical Fleming-Viot model. The proposed method is a continuation of ideas developed by the PI in related recent work.<br/><br/><br/>Random graphs and networks are popular in diverse areas such as social networks, models for the internet, computer vision, and number theory. Several natural optimization problems on graphs (e.g., figuring out clusters, or ranking algorithms such as Google PageRank) involve what are called eigenvectors of the graph. If the network grows randomly, its eigenvectors are random, and it is of interest to study its properties. A study of such properties is listed as one of our main research areas. The other main area involves the structure of phylogenetic (or evolutionary) trees. A lot of recent interest in Biology and related mathematics is in the structure of the collection of all possible evolutionary trees. This is an enormous space very different from the usual Euclidean (say, three dimension) space. One way to explore this set is to let a Markov chain jump around from tree to tree randomly in a ``nice'' way. A few such models have been proposed in the literature. We take up the study of one of them which is related to other areas of Probability. The analysis and results are expected to be quite novel in the subject area."

Stochastic filtering has experienced a rapid development in recent years due to its flexibility to engage modeling predictions based on pertinent dynamics with experimental data. Moreover, complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data lead to an urgent need for new theoretical establishments of filtering and novel computational implementations. The conference will feature, Dan Crisan, Tom Kurtz and Boris Rozovsky, who will each present three expository lectures within the realm of the thematic topic of the Lectures. Additionally, invited plenary talks by a dynamic group of international researchers at different stages of their career development and a poster session will take place. This project utilizes NSF funding to support travel and other participant costs for approximately 40 participants, giving high priority to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty members.<br/><br/>The 2015 Barrett Lectures will be the 45th installment of a highly regarded lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H. Barrett, head of our Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969. The Lectures are one of the longest-standing series of mathematical lectures in the country delivered by distinguished speakers. The focus of the 45th Lectures is the interdisciplinary impact of other mathematical methods into traditional topics of probability, and the increasing interdisciplinary penetration of complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data. A dynamic group of auspicious and prominent researchers will deliver talks and engage in discussions to deepen our understanding of the new stochastic filtering methodologies and theories which need to be further developed in order to meet the challenge of new complex scientific and engineering problems of the 21st century.

We use randomness to understand complex phenomena, from the behavior of polymer molecules and DNA analysis, to image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, and the behavior of financial markets. Random processes are also used as important tools for efficient computations. In all these cases, there are strong structural constraints underlying the behavior of the relevant random process. These constraints are expressed in terms of the environment of the process which often has a complex combinatorial or geometric  structure. This proposal focuses on the study of the fundamental properties of such stochastic processes and on how they relate to the global structure of their environment.<br/><br/>Many basic Markov processes evolve on a state space carrying a related geometric structure. Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold,  random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups and  finite Markov chains on complex combinatorial structures such as trees or matchings are significant examples.

In the area of asymptotic enumeration, he will obtain approximations to coefficients of multivariate meromorphic generating functions that are asymptotically valid as the multi-index goes to infinity in any possible way.  The ultimate goal is to automate this procedure, at least for the class of (multivariate) rational generating functions with nonnegative coefficients. Previous results indicate this may be feasible, or at least may be carried out to some extent.  These results are to be applied to several combinatorial problems in probability theory, including asymptotics for random tilings for the so-called Aztec Diamond configurations and other related tiling ensembles conjectured to produce polynomial phase boundaries.  In the area of random processes with reinforcement, he will investigate the rate at which processes of stochastic approximation type converge to their ultimate limiting behavior.  In particular, the slow convergence of vertex-reinforced random walks and uniformly reinforced social network models to their limits is to be explained by giving quantitative bounds on the probabilities of deviating from this behavior at finite times.  It is hoped that this will both explain simulation data and give a theoretical basis for the use of these models.  Among the other miscellaneous problems are several problems in economic game theory and one concerning asymptotics of solutions to functional equations.<br/><br/> Recent progress in computer algebra has made many types of computation automated which once were done only by skilled practitioners.  Nowadays, a few messy equations are no barrier at all to a complete theoretical and practical understanding of a problem.  The most tangible result of the asymptotic enumeration project will be the transformation of a formerly difficult type of computation into a straightforward, though messy, series of steps.  Applications reach far beyond the motivating examples of random tilings, and include queuing theory, signal processing and combinatorial enumeration.  Reinforcement processes arise most commonly in three application areas:  formal models of learning, population biology, and economic behavior. In each of these areas, the results of the project will shed light on when and why the theoretically predicted limiting behaviors are not observed in the timeframes of real applications.<br/>"

The importance of this project comes from the following three reasons: First, the area of sample intersections is full of mathematical elegance and surprise. It is also of great interest to the people working in the fields of physical and biological sciences. Second, this study is a crucial step toward understanding the asymptotic patterns (at the exponential level) of additive functionals and local times of the multi-parameter processes. As a concrete example of the local times run by multi-parameter processes, the long term behaviors of intersection local times locally resemble those of the local times of Brownian sheets. Third, the problems involved are often mathematically challenging. The intersection local times are the processes with strong memory and sharp singularity. Many of the results proved in this field show a heavy dimension dependence, which results from a combination of these two factors. In existing literature, a substantial difference between self-intersection and inter-path intersection has also been observed in the multi-dimensional cases. Compared with other aspects of the study, such as the weak laws, much less has been known in the limit behaviors such as large deviations, small ball probabilities and related strong limit laws. Recently, the proposer and his collaborators have made some substantial progress on the exponential asymptotics and the law of the iterated logarithm for the intersection local times run by Brownian motions, stable processes and random walks. The progress suggests further questions and establishments in broader situations. The project concerns three types of models, to which the exponential asymptotics will be investigated: The intersection local times of random walks and some more general processes; the range and intersection of ranges of the random walks; and the local times and additive functionals of multi-parameter processes. <br/> It is a well known fact in the biological and physical communities that the notion of intersection local times is an effective tool in the study of polymer and polaron models. This project is related to the long term behaviors of these models. The study will advance our knowledge on how the systems evolve in various scales. Therefore, the success of this project will also have impact on some areas in the biological and physical sciences. <br/>"

Specifically, the project investigates the mathematics behind portfolios that outperform a standard index such as S&P 500 in the presence of volatility. The utility of such portfolios is that in that process they reduce volatility demonstrably, and thus contribute to the stability of financial markets. Although ad hoc use of such portfolios is widespread, a systematic mathematical study has been limited so far. It turns out the mathematics is related to some very modern topics in probability and geometry, especially that of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport maps. Successful completion of the research will not only lead to striking new mathematics in probability and information geometry, but will also imply very practical applications in modern portfolio management, with potential societal benefits of the highest level via increased financial stability. <br/><br/>The investigator plans to study an array of problems linking the fields of optimal transport and interacting particle systems, with applications to modern portfolio theory. There are two parts to this project. The first one investigates the behavior of exponential stochastic integrals where the integrand is given by a solution of a Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport map. The study is an interesting interplay between geometry of the unit simplex and universal behavior of stochastic integrals when they are not martingales. Classical probability relies heavily on the martingale property of stochastic integrals. Here, the investigator explores a completely distinct class of behaviors that should be of independent interest. The second part studies properties of interacting continuous-time particle systems in finite and infinite dimensions. These particle systems, originally coming from stochastic portfolio theory, can be thought of as a continuous-time analogue of the discrete time exclusion process on the integer lattice. However, unlike exclusion processes, very little is known about these processes. They are conjectured to display striking phase transitions. The project aims to establish concentration inequalities and fluctuation estimates (among other properties) for such processes, which is a step towards proving more subtle behavior of these processes."

A particular goal will be to study the effect of cycles in the graph on the localization/ delocalization property of the eigenvectors. The other line of work is related to models used in mathematical finance. Particle system models from statistical physics have been recently successfully used to explain observed financial data and construct portfolios that can be thought of as arbitrage opportunities with respect to the market index.

As such it is of great interest to practitioners who would like to harvest growth out of market fluctuations.

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability.

Thus they require probability estimates and limit theorems which are applicable to random sets, or which are dimension free (hence, in essence, infinite dimensional). A major theme in the investigator's previous work, and in much of the current research, addresses both of these issues in a variety of settings. As a first example consider the link between small ball probabilities and metric entropy problems, which showed certain probability estimates are equivalent to problems in approximation theory. This link led to the solution of a long standing problem in approximation theory, and portions of the proposed research involve important unsolved analogues of this problem. Another example is the study of the Gibbs conditioning principle of statistical mechanics for statistics with infinitely many components. To begin to handle this type of problem one needs non-logarithmic estimates of large deviation probabilities which are dimension free. These estimates depend critically on dominating points and a suitable representation formula for the probabilities. A variety of conditional limit theorems are to be considered. Additional problems exhibiting these general features are also proposed, and connect with classical geometry, analysis, and statistics.<br/> This work includes further non-logarithmic large deviation probabilities for partial sums of independent random vectors, an investigation of dominating points in a more general setting, and the application of these results to conditional limit theorems for infinite dimensional statistics. Limit sets for random samples of stochastic processes, as well as related coverage problems will be examined, and a primary focus will be to further examine the link between small ball probabilities and non-classical functional laws of the iterated logarithm applicable to occupation measures. Problems concerning vector valued partial sums, cluster sets, small ball probabilities, self-normalized partial sums, and limit theorems for convex hulls of Brownian motion paths are also to be considered. <br/>"

The project aims to develop probabilistic, analytic, and geometric tools that will lead to a deeper understanding of physically-relevant random fields.  It is anticipated that these tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of long-standing open problems in the theory of SPDE and related random fields, and further promote their applicability.

In past work, the investigators developed ideas, based in geometric-measure theory, for the analysis of non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields, and they introduced renewal-theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of nonlinear SPDE. This research project continues investigation of precise quantitative connections between random fields, potential theory, SPDE, and the geometry of random fractals. Special emphasis is placed on two extremal universality classes of SPDE that are driven by fully non-linear multiplicative noise.  Further pursuit of these connections is expected to yield novel insights into the structure of random fields, physical multifractals, and related SPDE."

The relation between the zeros of the polynomial Q and the coefficients of P/Q have been demonstrated in a series of works from 2000 to 2011.  Via Cauchy's integral representation, estimating coefficients is reduced to residue integration along the zero set of Q.  There are two main open problems addressed in this proposal.  In the case where the zero set of Q is smooth, we consider the effective computation of the homology class of the chain of integration with respect to a basis of saddle point contours.  In the case where the zero set of Q is singular, only quadratic singularities have as yet been worked out; we consider here two examples of higher degree. The second part of the proposal concerns the relation between the zeros of Q and the coefficients of Q itself.  This work is part of the emerging field of stable function theory.  The main goal here is to extend the Borcea-Branden-Liggett theory of strong Rayleigh distributions to random variables taking more than two values.  A third part of this proposal concerns problems in discrete probability theory, including locating the critical points of a random polynomial or power series, and a problem on totally anisotropic percolation.<br/><br/>The broad impact of this research lies in computational infrastructure for computation in combinatorial applications.  Generating functions are used in many areas of pure and applied mathematics: random graph theory, theory of algorithms, statistical physics, discrete probability theory, population biology and genetics to name a few.  Estimating the coefficients of a generating function is a crucial step in any application of generating function techniques. This work, and particularly the part dealing with automated computation, allows users to compute without having to develop ad hoc methods in each case.

Despite their importance and usefulness in engineering and science, a complete theory establishing properties of solutions of these equations continues to be elusive. With applications to physical and biological sciences and aeronautical and naval engineering, the mechanism for energy transfer and dissipation governing fluid motions remain carefully concealed from the current methods to analyze these equations. The dramatic improvements in efficiency attained in aircraft, naval and automotive design, serve as testimony of the economic and societal impact of improved control of basic processes modeled by these equations.<br/><br/>In recent years problems in the study of differential equations in general, and in particularly of the Navier-Stokes equations, have given rise to interesting probabilisticstructures. The current project aims to elucidate the relation between properties of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with properties of a class of branching Markov chains naturally associated to these equations.   As well-illustrated by considering self-similar solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, regularity properties as well as uniqueness of solutions corresponds to properties of a specific branching Markov chain in which the branching nodes have a law determined by the invariance of the Navier-Stokes equations under spatial dilation (with a corresponding time scale change) and rotations.  This intrinsic branching structure motivates the formulation of an explosion problem that it is of interest in its own right from the probability point of view. It involves new considerations of the location of the left most particle of the branching process. Furthermore, the branching structure establishes a striking connection between nonlinear PDE's and branching processes that is the object of study in this proposal. A further specific objective of this proposal is to explore the consequences on the branching structure imposed by the incompressible character of the velocity field.  Specifically, the Fourier transform of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations can be represented as an expected value of a multiplicative functional defined on the nodes of the alluded branching Markov chain that reflects the incompressibility of the velocity field.  An objective of this proposal is to develop the implications for energy depletion as a consequence of the algebraic structure defined by the indicated multiplication operation. Likewise, regularity and large time behavior of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation can also be gleaned from this representation.  The proposal  also involves methods of graph theory, with the use of semi-algebraic sets in the classification of nodes of random trees.  Ultimately, this proposal seeks to elucidate the role of incompressibility in the multiplicative stochastic processes associated with equations of fluid flow."

The first is to try to classify ``quasi-stationary random overlap structures''. Random overlap structures arise in the study of mean-field spin glasses such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. They are analogous to random partition structures, but more general. Quasi-stationarity is an invariance property for random overlap structures, abstracted from the physicists' ``cavity step''. It is akin to exchangeability for deterministic mean-field spin systems. So, the proposal is to find and prove a spin-glass version of de Finetti's theorem. Unrelated to this, the PI will study the ferromagnetic Heisenberg quantum spin system. The Hamiltonian of this quantum model equals (one minus) the Markov generator of the symmetric exclusion process (SEP). Physicists' spin wave arguments suggest important conjectures for the spectrum of these operators. For example, one such conjecture turned out (after the fact) to be equivalent to Aldous's conjecture, that the spectral gap for the SEP equals the spectral gap for the random walk. The proposal is to try to prove these conjectures.<br/><br/>Spin glasses are unusual magnetic materials, which settle into stable configurations on short time scales, but hop from configuration to configuration on long times scales. So, depending on the length of time observed, they look either like solids or liquids. Glass does the same thing: for example, windows in very old churches are thicker at the bottom than the top, supposedly because the glass flowed down over time. Over 20 years ago, Giorgio Parisi, a physicist, proposed a unique solution to the simplest spin glass model. Only recently was his intuitive guess really proved by mathematicians. This led to interesting new math as well as new physics. But much remains to be done. Parisi made other guesses for problems in computer science. For many computational problems which involve finding an optimal solution, it is known that any algorithm is ``NP complete''. This means (it is strongly believed) that a program solving such problems would take inordinately long to run. On the other hand, Parisi and others proposed analytical solutions to random versions of many of these problems. Presumably, the next best thing to a foolproof solution is one that works with high probability. The property of quasi-stationarity seems to be inherent to all these heuristic solutions. So understanding it is important for an overall picture of the subject."

The goal is to reach a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of such models.  In particular, the plan is to establish the existence of a large class of mathematical models in physics and biology which is sufficiently rich to allow for a broad range of applications and at the same time flexible enough to accommodate unavoidable statistical errors in estimating the parameters of the underlying models. <br/><br/>The proposed research consists of three major undertakings concerning stochastic dynamical systems:<br/>1.  Existence and spatial regularity of random invariant manifolds for singular stochastic differential equations (sdes) driven by Brownian motion and Borel measurable linearly bounded drift coefficients.   A Stable Manifold Theorem should hold for such singular sdes.

Several related  topics concerning self-avoiding walks, percolation, Ising and random cluster models, and stochastic dynamics of Ising models are proposed.

Such questions include: (1) What is the average end-to-end distance of an N-step self-avoiding walk? (2) What is the asymptotic behavior of the number of N-step self-avoiding walks starting from a given point?  The topic in percolation concerns the critical behavior and critical exponents of the model on d-dimensional hyperbolic graphs, which are regular tessellations of the hyperbolic d-dimensional space.  The main project of Ising models on non-amenable graphs concerns problems which are of fundamental importance in physics literature. They  include: (1) How many extremal Gibbs states are there in different temperature region?  What are they? (2) How many translation-invariant Gibbs states are there and what are they?  Problems concerning stochastic dynamics of Ising models on various infinite graphs where spins evolve according to the usual Glauber dynamics are also proposed.<br/><br/>The proposed topics originate from and have a wide range of application in materials science, statistical physics, chemistry, biology and other fields of sciences.  The study of the self-avoiding walk arose in chemical physics as a model for long polymer chains.  It is the simplest mathematical model which characterizes the self-repulsion between monomers in a polymer chain, yet exhibits critical phenomena.  The interest in this model is, however, much broader since it is closely related to other stochastic models such as the Brownian motion and the newly discovered stochastic Loewner evolution.  Percolation is a probabilistic model of studying flow through a disordered system, such as particles flowing through the filter of a gas mask, or fluid seeping through the interstices of a random porous medium.  Ising models capture the basic magnetic properties of materials.  An important goal of this project is to understand how the geometry of the  space affects the nature of macroscopic behavior of these models.  The proposer will continue to make an effort to involve undergraduate students to undertake small pieces of the problems proposed here.  The proposal, if funded, will also support the students to present their findings in undergraduate research/education conferences.<br/>"

The project will develop a novel way to unify the treatment of an important class of scaling limit results that must currently be proved one at a time using ad hoc arguments.  In the process, interesting connections to functional analysis and differential equations will be made. Several ancillary problems will be investigated as well; each of these supports the main focus of the project by providing special cases, possible avenues for generalization, or alternative areas of application.  These supporting problems are: (a) prove a diffusion limit theorem for bandwidth-sharing networks; (b) obtain fluid and diffusion limits for Least Attained Service queues; (c) study a model of social news aggregators. <br/><br/><br/>This project aims to improve the theoretical tools available for analysis of complex random systems, such as computer and telecommunication networks, social networks, and biological processes. For example, the project will produce theorems that enable a practitioner to understand the variability of congestion in a proposed computer network design. Such work has tangible benefits to society. The designs of many components of the internet for example -- switches, routing protocols, load balancing systems -- have been informed by theoretical work of this kind. In our ever more networked world, we continue to create new structures and interactions, such as the models under study in this project. There is a clear benefit to deepening our understanding of these complex systems.  The project also integrates research training activities for both graduate and undergraduate students, enhancing research infrastructure for the future."

Statistical physicists and probabilists often try to understand the macroscopic behavior of systems consisting of many microscopic random inputs, which can give rise to interfaces between two phases at a critical temperature, such as water and ice at zero degree Celsius. This can be modeled via the scaling limit behavior (macroscopic behavior) of discrete lattice models (microscopic inputs) in critical cases. Oded Schramm's SLE (Stochastic Loewner Evolution) processes have led mathematicians and physicists to a clean and novel understanding of the scaling limits of the interfaces in discrete models in two dimensions. And CLE (Conformal Loop Ensemble) is the generalization of SLE which is predicted to be the scaling limit of the collection of all interfaces in discrete models. This research focuses on CLE and its relation between Gaussian Free Field, Liouville Quantum Gravity, and Random Maps.<br/><br/>Precisely, the research considers the following two problems.<br/>(1) The conformally invariant metric on CLE. Since the introduction of SLE and CLE, CLE(4) has been proved to be the scaling limit of the collection of level lines of discrete Gaussian Free Field. In the previous work of the principal investigator, a time parameter is constructed for CLE(4) loop configurations, and a coupling between Gaussian Free Field and CLE(4) with time parameter is given. The research aims to show that the time parameter defined on CLE(4) is in fact a deterministic function of the loop configuration. This result would deepen understanding of the relation between Gaussian Free Field and CLE.<br/>(2) CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity. Liouville Quantum Gravity is conjectured to be the scaling limit of random maps. The research project first aims to understand CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and then to explore the relation between CLE-decorated Liouville Quantum Gravity and loop-decorated random maps."

Such models arise in diverse areas of application; the models in this project are taken from materials science, social science, genetics, and distributed computing.  Specific examples are: an interface between regions of liquid in a pipe; candidates sequentially dropping out of a primary election; tree-search for approximate evaluation of a Boolean function. Common to all these models is an underlying mathematical structure in which initial conditions are random, after which the evolution is governed by a non-random mechanism.  Analyses of evolutions without randomness is often considerably more difficult than analysis of those with randomness.  The focus in this project is on creating tools to circumvent this problem.  In most cases the PI seeks qualitative answers to questions such as: what does the system look like after a long time, how long does it take to reach this state, and how robust is the description to changes in the initial conditions? The project's broader impacts beyond the potential applications to the aforementioned areas, include the training of graduate students in the mathematical sciences at the University of Pennsylvania who will have opportunities to engage in research on highly non-trivial topics in probability theory. The PI will also devote some effort to improving STEM education at a broader level through the development of innovative techniques for calculus instruction and curriculum development. The PI will investigate the systematic mathematical study of certain common practices which have suffered from a lack of methodological validation, as a further broader impact.<br/><br/>The mathematical techniques to be used in this project involve the introduction of time reversals.  In a time reversal, randomness of initial conditions becomes randomness of the time-reversed path.  Once there is randomness in the evolution, it is possible to use techniques from Markov chains, statistical mechanics, and other applications of probability theory. There are a number of Markov chains that describe time reversals of a given system.  Suppose one's concern is to describe the time-zero distribution of a system evolving deterministically from random conditions at time minus infinity.  Among possible Markovian time-reversals, the one that describes this is the one with the maximum entropy.  The PI then plans to compute this using a variational principle."

Network of integrated molecular reactions tend to involve many different molecular species, thus posing complex analytical problems.  For prediction and simulation purposes it is essential to reduce both the model and computational complexity of the problem, while still capturing all the essential characteristics and potential behavior of the network. This project will systematically develop stochastic models for chemical reaction networks, beginning with classical Markov chain models and developing new models that take into account the stepwise development of reactions involving RNA and DNA molecules.  Specific issues to be addressed include scaling limits based on the wide range of time and other quantitative scales in the system, model reduction through scaling limit approximations and other approaches, the implications of the combinatorial restrictions the reaction structure places on the system, sensitivity analysis for the parameters of the stochastic models, and statistical methods for model validation based on data that is frequently obtained through indirect and/or aggregated measurements.<br/><br/>At the level of the cell, the chemical dynamics may well be dominated by the action of regulatory molecules that are present at levels of only a few copies per cell.  Therefore, the molecular fluctuations of these components may determine the dynamics of the reaction network.  These molecular fluctuations appear to have significant consequences; the observed large variation in rates of development, morphology and concentration of molecular species in a cell often lead to a randomization of phenotypic outcomes and non-genetic population heterogeneity.  Since these fluctuations may have profound effects on the physiology of the cell, stochastic models for the intra-cellular reaction networks and careful statistical analysis appear to be essential if the system is to be well understood.  The project will also provide a fertile training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  There is a high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of problems arising in cell and molecular biology."

The sampled vectors making up the first class are independent, each a linear transformation of a vector containing i.i.d. elements, while the second class models the result of perturbing a sample covariance (or correlation) matrix with noise added to each sampled vector.  For the latter case independence is not assumed on the unperturbed samples.  Although both classes have a broad range of applicability, motivation for studying them comes from the detection problem in array signal processing, when the number of (unknown) sources, impinging on a bank of sensors in a noise-filled environment, is sizable.  For both classes the empirical distribution function (e.d.f.) of the eigenvalues (as the dimension approaches infinity) converges to a nonrandom limit.  Using techniques and arguments recently developed to successfully analyze the convergence of individual eigenvalues of the first class to boundary points in the limiting support, the principal investigator plans to solve two remaining open problems concerning this class, namely the rate of convergence of both the e.d.f. and those individual eigenvalues, and relaxing independence assumptions.  He also intends to study completely the analogous properties of the second class of matrices, beginning with understanding analytically the limiting e.d.f., which is described in terms of an equation satisfied by its Stieltjes transform.    The principal investigator plans to study properties of two classes of random matrices of high dimension used in modeling multivariate random phenomena.  The motivation stems primarily from the detection problem in array signal processing, that is, determining the number of sources impinging on a bank of sensors in the presence of noise.  Under certain conditions, when  the number of sources is sizable, known results on one of the classes of random matrices can be used to reliably estimate the number of sources with the total number of measurements much smaller than what is needed according to standard multivariate analysis.  The principal investigator intends to study a few remaining questions pertaining to this class, and to mathematically analyze another class of random matrices which allows for a broader range of applications."

There are many analogies between problems considered in this project and representation theory in quantum physics, in particular, Mackey's theory. This project is intended to build on these analogies to establish spectral representation of isotropic stable random fields in possibly the most explicit form that could be used for analysis, modeling and computer simulation of such random fields. The second part of this proposal is concerned with infinite dimensional stochastic integrals. Various sample path properties of stochastic processes, such as continuity and boundedness, can often be described in terms of the existence of such infinite dimensional stochastic integrals. It is proposed to simplify and unify the present approach to infinite dimensional stochastic integrals of deterministic functions and then to extend these results to nonanticipating integrands using decoupling techniques, among others. This is an outgrowth of the present research of the PI with Professor Michael B. Marcus. Development of stochastic integrals with respect to cylindrical semimartingales in Hilbert spaces is also proposed. This development will follow a recent progress of the PI and his collaborators on the radonification of cylindrical semimartingales. <br/> Isotropic random fields play an important role in the statistical theory of turbulence and other areas of natural sciences and engineering. They can be used to model 3-dimensional turbulent velocity, velocity and pressure, etc. The classical theory of isotropic random fields is not suitable for modeling random phenomena with long range dependence and high variability, that are often observed. Therefore, the PI proposes to investigate isotropic random fields with heavy tailed stable distributions. Puzzling connections with certain methods of quantum physics are found under this approach; they will be further investigated and exploited. The second part of this proposal is concerned with the theory and applications of infinite dimensional stochastic integrals. The importance and need for the study of such integrals comes from the theory of random systems characterized by very large or continuous set of parameters. Infinite dimensional approach makes such systems simpler and mathematically tractable. <br/>"

The conference website is https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/12461/.  The topics of the conference are at the interface of mathematics and physics and are concerned with uncovering through exact calculation the universal behaviors of large, complex random systems. There are two main types of random systems -- those which are growing and those which have stabilized to a sort of equilibrium. The universal behaviors of each of these types of systems are rather different in characteristic. However, recent advances have indicated surprising connections between the behaviors of non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems. This conference will bring together experts in both areas with the aim of stimulating new advances and spark new connections. There is a strong emphasis on educating a new generation of researchers to appreciate and understand the broad cycle of ideas and motivations from both mathematics and physics in this area.  Half of the lecturers will be mini-courses and the other half, research talks. This will benefit the many early-career researchers who will participate in the conference. The US participants funded by this award, most of whom are early-career researchers and graduate students, will benefit additionally by the opportunity to forge relations with their European colleagues. The organizers will actively encourage the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM, including women and minorities.<br/><br/>Universality within and between complex random systems is a striking concept which has played a central role in the direction of research within probability, mathematical physics and statistical mechanics.  Complementary to universality, is the exact description of the behaviors that are expected to be universal as well as the determination of which systems are meant to display them.  In recent years there has been an immense amount of progress in the rigorous mathematical understanding of certain universal scaling limits in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physical systems.  On the equilibrium side, critical scaling limits are often described in terms of conformal field theories, among which Liouville quantum gravity plays an important role.  On the non-equilibrium side, systems like growth processes are described through the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.  There is reason to believe that these two directions share many (as of yet) unexploited relationships.  For instance, the field of quantum integrable systems was developed to study equilibrium systems, but has now found itself center stage in the KPZ universality class.  Conversely, methods developed in stochastic partial differential equations for non-equilibrium systems have begun to make their way into constructive field theory.  The purpose of this two-week conference is to bring together experts in these two areas and enable a lively exchange of ideas and methods through mini-courses and research talks."

In joint work with Dr. Stephen Pacala (Princeton University) the principal investigator will consider the consequences of spatial structure in classical models in ecology, such as the Lotka-Volterra model of interspecific competition. The nonspatial version is very well understood. Including a spatial component will likely yield new phenomena. In joint work with Dr. Stephen Krone (University of Idaho) the principal investigator will study the spread of a population in a heterogeneous environment by using the two-dimensional contact process in a random environment. In theoretical population genetics, Dr. Neuhauser plans to study genealogies under various selection schemes, for instance, frequency-dependent selection and overdominant  selection. It is planned to rigorously derive genealogies and to use them to investigate sample properties in both spatial and nonspatial settings.   The causes and effects of spatial structure have long been central topics in population and community ecology. In joint work with Dr. Stephen Pacala (Princeton University) the principal investigator will study the effects of competition on the spatial structure of communities. Local interactions and competition in spatial communities can cause clumping of individuals of the same species which can lead to a reduction in biodiversity. In joint work with Dr. Stephen Krone (University of Idaho) the principal investigator will consider the spread of populations in heterogeneous environments and how habi tat destruction and subsequent restoration affects the ability of populations to recover. Genealogies are an important tool in population genetics to investigate properties of samples of genes. Dr. Neuhauser plans to investigate frequency-dependent and overdominant selection. Both modes of selection are known to be able to maintain a high degree of genetic diversity. Little is known about genealogies under such selection schemes which are important, for instance, in plant breeding systems or in the major histocompatibility complex."

Two major themes in the first topic are the stability of queueing networks and their heavy traffic limits. A queueing network is said to be stable when the associated Markov process is positive recurrent. The heavy traffic limit of a sequence of queueing networks is the diffusive limit obtained by applying the usual central limit scaling. Results over the last decade have led to a better understanding of queueing networks, although a general theory is lacking. The researcher plans to investigate the behavior of queueing networks under certain well-known disciplines, such as processor sharing and earliest-due-date, first-served. Other related topics in queueing theory include dynamic scheduling in heavy traffic and the stability of self-managed models for the internet. Interacting particle systems consist of systems of many particles that evolve according to some interaction law. Such systems are frequently motivated by models from the physical and biological sciences. The researcher plans to investigate models that have creation and annihilation of mass, as well the stationary measures of certain exclusion processes. <br/><br/>Professor Bramson's current research is in two areas of probability theory, queueing networks and interacting particle systems. In the first area, one studies the behavior of large systems of individuals who proceed from one server to the next, until their needs are satisfied and they leave the system. ""Individuals"" here should be interpreted in a general sense, and may be customers waiting to be served (for instance, at a bank or at a service counter), jobs in some manufacturing process (such as the production of semiconductor wafers) or information packets on the internet. In practice, one is often faced with the choice of whom to serve first. This choice can substantially affect the efficiency of a system, and sometimes even its stability. That is, based on how good a service rule is in a given setting, the number of customers waiting in line may typically remain small over extended periods of time, or may tend to grow without bound. Work over the last decade has shown that such systems can be unstable for unexpected reasons. The researcher plans to continue his work in this area and investigate the stability of the network under certain well-known service rules. The area of interacting particle systems is motivated by models from the physical and biological sciences consisting of large numbers of ""individuals"" who interact according to some rule. For instance, individuals might be molecules moving about according to some rule or cancer cells spreading along a surface. The behavior of these systems can depend strongly on the nature of their interactions. The researcher plans to continue his research on certain of these models. <br/>"

Foundations of the traffic project are described in a recent paper, joint with Lawrence Gray of the University of Minnesota, in the Journal of Statistical Physics. Motivated by empirical work of Kai Nagel and others, the authors give convincing evidence that the TCA exhibits several phase transitions as the density of cars increases, and for a certain range of densities clusters into a mixture of two self-organized extreme ergodic states called free flow and synchronized jam. The research program will further analyze this model, intended to establish the new phenomenon of conservative clustering, and also to shed light on the underlying mechanism. In a separate project, Griffeath will study Von Koch crystals, very simple deterministic nearest-neighbor Cellular Automaton growth rules on the two-dimensional integer lattice, many of which are exactly solvable but aperiodic. A novel computational machinery will be developed in order to rigorously describe the self-organized, often fractal structure of these crystals by means of a generalized formal language, interactive visualization, nonlinear recursion, and computer-aided proof.<br/> The research of David Griffeath combines mathematical analysis and computer visualization in the study of complex spatial systems.

In the area of stochastic spatial models, he will study the asymptotic behavior of multitype voter models where voters have several opinions and are more likely to imitate neighbors with similar opinions. With Ted Cox he will work to extend their conclusions for the stepping stone model to samples of size k > 2, and will study equilibrium properties of a hybrid zone which results when each of two alleles is favored in one half of the space. With Ed Perkins he will study measure valued limits of particle systems to produce limit processes with interactions between different types of particles. Not all of the systems Durrett studies will be spatial however: he will work with Jason Schweinsberg to develop approximations of genetic hitchhiking that involve the coalescent with multiple collisions, will study the phase transition in a quasi-species model which models properties of viruses with high mutation rates, and will continue his work with Vlada Limic on Kauffmann's NK model, which is a prototypical example of a fitness landscape with a large number of local maxima.<br/> Durrett's research is motivated by a variety of applications. Durrett will work with Ted Cox to extend their work on spatial genetics models to investigate explanations for the surprisingly large amount of linkage disequilibrium (genetic correlation) in the human genome. Understanding the possible sources of patterns in DNA sequences is important for using association mapping to locate genes and to identify footprints of positive selection. In relation to the latter question, Durrett will work with Jason Schweinsberg to develop an approximation to the genetic hitchhiking that occurs with the fixation of favorable mutation, which will allow for the derivation of analytical results for quantities that can currently be understood only by simulation. A major theme of Durrett's research is the influence of a spatial distribution of competitors on equilibrium properties of a system. With Simon Levin, he will study a collection of stochastic spatial models for the evolution of social norms. With Ted Cox, he will investigate hybrid zones where closely related but genetically differentiated populations coexist in close proximity. With Ed Perkins he will investigate scaling limits of stochastic spatial models, in order to construct new interesting examples of interacting measure-valued diffusions and to obtain approximations for particle systems with large range.<br/>"

The investigator's research concerns stochastic and deterministic models associated with the evolution of  gases, the formation of gels and crystals, and Hamiltonian systems with random potentials. As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. Roughly, after a suitable scaling, the density of particles in a gas with grazing collisions converges to a solution of Landau Equation,  a rough interface modeled by Hamilton-Jacobi PDE with impurity homogenizes to a homogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and a chain of particles with random potential are governed by an effective potential. Many issues related to these models are not fully understood. Large-deviations type questions for the homogenization and a central limit theorem type result for gases would provide us with valuable information about the corresponding microscopic models. Also, simplified models for coagulation phenomenon should help us to discover the rules governing the mysterious interaction between gels and sols.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas is a collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale?  Roughly the reason is that the local conservation laws impose constraints not immediately visible on the microscopic scale. As an another example, consider a solid  to which further material sticks from the ambient atmosphere.  The process of the attachment is a function of a huge variety of growth mechanisms depending on the materials involved, their temperature, composition, etc. Following the tradition of statistical mechanics, one studies simplified models which nevertheless captures some of the essential physics.<br/><br/>The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids, gases and crystals. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of components is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of our microscopic world such as the formation of crystals, the emergence of clots in blood, the roughness of the surface boundary of solids and occurrence of shocks in fluids."

Motivated originally by the interest of the proposer in solving the hot spots conjecture, the first problem concerns the construction of couplings of reflecting Brownian motion in convex domains. The author introduced a new type of coupling of reflecting Brownian motions, which led him to a partial resolution of the hot spots conjecture; the author will try to develop these coupling arguments, with the hope of solving this long-standing conjecture with roots in mathematical physics. In connection to this problem is the more general conjecture of the diagonal monotonicity of the Neumann heat kernel of convex domains with one axis of symmetry (which implies the hot spots conjecture). A related open problem which the PI intends to study is Chavel's conjecture on the domain monotonicity of Neumann heat kernel. In the view of the PI, coupling techniques can be used here to obtain classes of domains for which Chavel's conjecture holds true. Finally, in connection to all above-mentioned problems is the more general problem of finding a precise dependence of the Neumann heat kernels of two convex planar domains. <br/> Reflecting Brownian motion has been observed and studied for more than one century, since it was first observed by the English botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Its most recent spectacular application is probably the famous work of Black-Scholes, which changed forever the guessing game of the price of a stock option in a mathematical sense by tying it to the random behavior of a Brownian motion. This led to the award of a the Nobel prize for Economics in 1997. Other applications of reflecting Brownian motion are in potential theory, partial differential equations, mathematical physics and mathematical finance. The present research aims to develop and study certain properties of reflecting Brownian motion (monotonicity properties and domain dependence of the transition density), which will give a deeper understanding of this fundamental stochastic process. In turn, this gives as applications properties of functions arising from real-life situations, whenever a connection to this process can be established (for example the extremum properties of the temperature of a thermally insulated body). <br/>"

Firstly, in the area of random matrix theory, we seek to build upon recent progress in understanding the fascinating universality phenomenon for such matrices, by generalising the ensembles for which universality can be established, and looking for the underlying mechanisms causing this universality.  Secondly, in the area of arithmetic combinatorics, we seek to improve our theory of approximate groups and related structures in noncommutative settings, with potential impact on geometric group theory and finite group theory. <br/>Finally, we wish to extend and understand the exciting new connections between algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and incidence combinatorics which have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the latter subject by applying algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Physical systems are often incredibly complicated, being driven by interactions between countless components of those systems.  However, in many cases, a remarkable phenomenon known as universality occurs, in which the macroscopic statistics of the a wide variety of systems are governed by a single universal mathematical law, almost without any regard to how the components of these systems interact with each other at the microscopic level.  For instance, the famous central limit theorem in mathematics asserts that many statistics (e.g. the distribution of heights in a human population) are described by a single curve known as the ""bell curve"" or ""Gaussian distribution"".  While the central limit theorem is now very well understood, there are other universal laws that are still mysterious, such as the Dyson sine law that has been empirically found to govern such diverse statistics as nuclear scattering, arrival times of buses, and the spacing of the zeta function in number theory.  However, we have recently begun to understand this law for a simple class of models known as random matrix models, though even for these models there is still much work to be done.  We plan to work on further understanding the underlying causes of universality for random matrix models and related models, with the hope of shedding insight on the universality phenomenon for other models as well.<br/><br/>The second aspect of the research program concerns the phenomenon of expansion in various networks, most famously manifested by the ""six degrees of separation"" experiment of Milgram, that asserts that any two people in the world are linked by at most six degrees of acquaintance. <br/> For a mathematical model of this phenomenon known as a Cayley graph, the existence of expansion is closely tied to the absence of a certain type of mathematical object known as an approximate group.  There has been a substantial amount of progress in understanding what exactly approximate groups look like, but the control we have on these groups is still not as precise as we would like.  We plan to study the theory of approximate groups further, with an eye towards applications to other areas of mathematics such as understanding the geometry of groups.<br/><br/>Combinatorial incidence geometry is the study of how simple geometric objects such as lines, circles, and points can be arranged together in as efficient a configuration as possible for various purposes (e.g. to try to arrange a given number of points and lines so that as many points lie on as many lines as possible).  Understanding the limits of how efficiently one can design such configurations is a basic mathematical question which also has practical applications (e.g. in designing frequency configurations for cell phones in order to maximize capacity and minimize interference).  Recently, there has been several breakthroughs in the subject by introducing methods from algebra (particularly algebraic geometry and algebraic topology).  This unexpected development is still not well understood; the algebraic methods can solve some problems almost completely, while making no mark on other ostensibly similar problems.  We plan to study these methods further and understand exactly what their strengths and limitations are."

It is one of the simplest mathematical models which displays a phase transition as the temperature is varied. The Ising model has a long mathematical history and has inspired much of modern mathematical physics such as quantum field theory and string theory. Its integrability properties act in some sense orthogonally to its large-scale order properties. The integrability is nonetheless related to our ability to ""solve"" the model mathematically, so the connection between solvability and integrability is important to understand in this and other related models, which seem at present much harder to solve.<br/> <br/>Statistical mechanics is concerned with studying, through probabilistic methods, systems of many interacting particles. There is a tension between making realistic models, which are close to real-world phenomena, and making mathematically solvable models, which are typically more abstract. A new tool which we hope to use to increase the range of our solvable models is the notion of integrability. This is the notion, coming from dynamical systems, that in certain cases a complicated system can be shown to exhibit in fact quite simple behavior under an appropriate change of coordinates. We hope that understanding in a precise sense the integrability properties of the Ising model will lead us to see similar possibilities in other classical statistical mechanical models."

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) Pinning and depinning of lattice polymers and interfaces due to potentials existing in lower-dimensional subspaces of the lattice. Particular emphasis will be placed on the disordered case, in which the potential varies randomly with location. Competition between a potential in a subspace and random potentials in the bulk will also be considered. (2) Layering transitions in the three-dimensional Ising model without an external field, caused solely by the attraction of an interface to a wall in competition with entropic repulsion. (3) Convergence to equilibrium, in systems modeling the phase separation that occurs in the freezing of solutions. (4) Moving interfaces, e.g. between phases of the Ising model, which may ""hang up"" at locations where a weakened interaction reduces the energetic cost of the interface, resulting in an energy barier which must be crossed.(5) Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the two-dimensional Potts model and their relation to decay rates of certain probabilities in the FK model. (6) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are opposed to each other.<br/><br/><br/>The research can help provide a theoretical underpinning for applied work in areas such as polymers, adhesion, and superconductivity. The work may lead to predictions which can be tested by experimentalists, leading to new practical discoveries.  Introducing a mathematician's perspective to theoretical problems that have previously been considered principally by physicists may in general alter the physicists' perspective,leading to further advances. US-French scientic partnership is enhanced by Alexander's collaboration with Francois Dunlop and Salvador Miracle-Sole.  This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors;(iv) denaturation of DNA; and (v) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small-scall randomness and macroscopic properties,including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. Some of the systems which Alexander will investigate-percolation, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems-are examples of such abstract systems. Other systems which Alexander will investigate are somewhat more closely based on specific physical systems, such as polymers, DNA molecules, and solutions."

Much of the existing theory of random matrices deals with normal matrices, which are stable under perturbations; many of the existing tools<br/>implicitly use either this stability, or some strong independence assumptions, even in deriving rough results. A major goal of the  present proposal is to build on previous work of the PI and collaborators and develop techniques that work even in a context where both structural assumptions (normality or independence) fail. While the proposal discusses and addresses some very specific questions, it is part of a larger attempt to develop new techniques that would be  applicable to a wide range of RMT questions. The second topic to be studied concerns random walks and branching processes in random environments. Though the theory of random walks is well developed, many gaps in understanding remain when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved  in the last few years by several researchers, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. The proposed project will built on previous work, by the PI and other researchers, with the goal of resolving some of these outstanding questions.<br/><br/>Matrices are the cornerstone of linear algebra, and are fundamental building blocks in operator theory. Random matrix theory (RMT) is concerned with the study of properties of random matrices, typically in the limit where the dimension of the matrix is large.<br/>Motivations and applications for this study come from several areas of mathematics (probability theory, number theory, representation theory), the physical sciences (especially, mathematical physics), statistics, and engineering (specifically, communication and information theories). In recent years, RMT has emerged as a major research area within mathematics, combining techniques from probability theory, operator algebras, complex analysis, and combinatorics.  Several major (and fundamental) open questions have recently been resolved, especially concerning the universality of limit laws regarding the spectrum of large random matrices. The proposed research will seek to significantly expand the theory toward a class of matrices whose spectrum is not stable under (small) perturbations. While the focus of the research is theoretical, an impact on applications is expected, e.g. in evaluating the stability  of complex systems, in computations related to quantum information theory, and in statistics. The second main focus of the study, random walks, are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such  RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and  reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place."

A unified picture, describing the limit of this model as random curves and fields, capturing subtle geometry and boundary conditions effects, seems to be rigorously obtainable. This picture will also deepen the comprehension of other models and offer many applications.<br/><br/>Phase transitions are abrupt changes in the nature of systems: vapor that suddently condensates into water, metals that gain supraconductivity, social networks whose activity explode once critical mass has been reached.

The first round of problems pertains to the Random Conductance Model. These include derivation of scaling limits of random walks in disordered media, study of spectral properties of random Laplacians, analysis of fluctuations of effective conductivity, detailed control of heat-kernel decay, etc. The second area proposed to investigate is that of Gradient Fields. These problems are ubiquitous in physical and applied sciences but their mathematical understanding is currently stalled because of the inability to overcome non-convexity of the underlying interaction. We offer specific methods and approaches how this obstacle may technically be overcome. The third class of problems addresses the area of Disordered Systems. The specific subjects of interest are random-field spin models and the dynamics governed by the parabolic Anderson model. Precise mathematical approaches are outlined that could lead to significant improvements in the mathematical understanding of these problems. A good many of listed problems are devised with the intention to provide training, and inclusion in research, of graduate students and postdocs who have interest in Probability Theory and Mathematical Physics.<br/><br/>The tremendous success of hard sciences in accurate description, modeling and even forecasting complex natural phenomena derives, in large part, from their foundation in rigorous mathematics. In the context of solid-state physics and material sciences, the mathematical methods most commonly used are those of probability and/or statistics. This comes as no surprise as these disciplines have been designed precisely to deal with systems involving large numbers of individual constituents. The present project studies three specific classes of problems in probability theory of large systems whose origin is rooted in physics of materials. The most pertinent general question we ask is how the structural details of materials, and their various inherent irregularities, exactly express themselves in their macroscopic properties. As a rule, we seek an enveloping principle, or a ""physical law"", that extracts, in quantitative or qualitative form, the essential features from the specifics. It is hoped that developing the theoretical foundations of such systems will eventually lead to significant advances in engineering applications. There is also an immediate impact for mathematics itself: analysis of complex phenomena inevitably involves a number of separate sub-disciplines of mathematics and will thus lead to fruitful exchange of ideas among them. The project naturally offers an opportunity to include graduate students and postdocs into the research environment at a top research US university."

The new method will exploit blocking techniques to break the dependence and a new type of martingale construction based on blocks of variables. We shall also provide maximal inequalities, including Rosenthal-type inequalities, which are important for obtaining rates of convergence in the asymptotic results and facilitate the study of a stochastic process by approximating it, in the almost sure sense, with sums of independent normal random variables. These tools are fundamental for obtaining new projective criteria for stochastic processes that insure asymptotic results, including the conditional functional central limit theorem, limit theorems started at a point, moderate and large deviation results as well as exact representations for the tail probabilities of sums of random variables. These types of asymptotic behaviors are at the heart of probability theory with important applications to statistics and other applied fields.<br/>     <br/>The proposed project is expected to provide new mathematical ideas and techniques that will shed new light on several difficult open problems for stochastic processes and will impact other fields of research as follows: The limit theorems started at a point are useful to analyze random walks in a random environment.

The results will be applicable to families of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms that are essential, for instance, for Bayesian statistics. The exact asymptotic representation for the tail probabilities will facilitate the estimations of deviation probabilities that occur in a natural way in many applied areas, so for instance, in problems of insurance in the context of large claim insurance, in risk theory and finance. The results will be disseminated broadly through publications in top rated journals and presentations in national and international conferences. They will also be integrated with training of graduate students, presented in weekly seminars, and will enter the curriculum of a course on limit theory for stochastic processes.

The principal  investigators also plan to apply the theory of spectral analysis  of large dimensional random matrices to the detection problem in  array signal processing when the numbers of (unknown) sources and  the sensors are both large. Recent work has shown that, when  applying known results, the number of measurements needed to  estimate the proportion of the number of sources to the number of  sensors can be much smaller than what is required when using  classical multivariate analysis. However, extensive simulations  reveal an interesting phenomenon: the exact number of sources can  be detected with the same relatively low number of samples.  Intensive investigation of these problems is of great interest in  both probability theory and signal processing. Some other  application problems are also proposed.  The principal investigators (Z.D. Bai and Jack W. Silverstein)  plan to study certain properties of random matrices of high  dimension used in modeling multivariate random phenomena. The  motivation stems from the detection problem in array signal  processing.  For example, when determining the number of sources  impinging on a bank of sensors in the presence of noise when the  number of sources is sizable, known results on large dimensional  random matrices can be used to reliably estimate the proportion  of the number of sources to the number of sensors with a number  of measurements much smaller than  what is needed according to  standard multivariate analysis. However, extensive simulations  reveal that, with high probability, the exact number of sources  can be detected with the same relatively low number of samples.  The principal investigators intend to mathematically analyze the  observed phenomena which allows for exact detection, and its  dependence on the number of sensors and the sample size.

The project has significance for the design and analysis of algorithms, particularly in computer science. Tree models also arise in statistics, physics, chemistry, sociology, and numerous other scientific areas. A first line of investigation into the behavior of such trees is to consider how a ``typical'' tree behaves. Thus a random model is postulated and characteristics of the ``random tree'' are studied.

Familiar examples of stochastic processes include stock market fluctuations, signals such as audio and video, medical data such as a patient's blood pressure or temperature, and random movement, such as random walk. A generalization, the random field, describes evolution in time and space. Examples of random fields include static images, random terrain (landscapes), waves, or composition variations of a heterogeneous material. This research project is concerned with a better understanding of the degree of dependence in a stochastic process or random field by using new techniques for studying the interactions between its variables. These techniques are based on surprising relationships with concepts that appear in other fields of mathematics, such as algebra and dynamical systems.  The results will lead to a more accurate prediction of future values of random evolution.<br/><br/>More specifically, in many situations, the interactions between the variables are viewed as a measure of the strength of dependence of a time series. The information about these interactions is given by a function called the ""spectral density function,"" which plays a central role in the theory of time series and random fields. Other spectral notions in mathematics are: ""operator spectral measure,"" which generates the transitions of a Markov process, and ""empirical spectral distribution"" of the eigenvalues of large random matrices with entries selected from random fields. This research project aims to establish several structural relationships that will build bridges between these three, apparently disparate notions, each having  the word ""spectral"" in its definition. The results of this research will show that this is not a coincidence. As a matter of fact, they are interconnected and they shed light on one another. These relationships will facilitate determination of the strength of dependence in a random evolution. They will extend and improve tools used for analyzing stationary stochastic processes and fields by indicating new ways to estimate their spectral density. Some of the results will contribute to a better understanding of the limiting empirical eigenvalue distribution for random matrices with correlated entries, exhibiting long range dependence. The research aims to show that this limiting distribution is uniquely determined by the field's spectral density and to find a formula relating them."

The school will provide individuals with interest in mathematical finance and stochastic analysis a focused opportunity to learn new concepts, discuss relevant questions, form mathematical and interdisciplinary networks, initiate new problems and tackle collaboratively defined problems, and explore the possibility of extending their collaboration beyond the school and conference. <br/><br/>The broader significance and importance of the project are in the educational training of a future generation of mathematicians for a global world, through the expository lectures to be given; the equipping of students and educators in sub-Saharan Africa with skill sets that can be useful in studying and understanding the economic challenges of the growing economies in these regions; the initiation of research collaborations between US and European mathematicians and mathematicians from the Central and Sub-Saharan African region; the creation of local and regional professional networks of mathematical scientists in Africa; and the exposure of US students and faculty to an international educational and cultural experience. The school/conference website is http://bueaconference.com/buea-summer-school/ and it will serve as the initial means of disseminating presentations and other materials as well as the source point for post-school/conference networking."

He also proposes to study universality in the bulk of the spectrum by using the renormalization group approach.  Another foci of the project is concerned with determinantal random point fields.

The importance of the field increases as many different areas of mathematics and physics including combinatorics, representation theory, operator algebras, number theory, integrable systems, quantum chaos, nuclear physics, statistical physics appear to have deep and fruitful connections to random matrices.

The first problem is to characterize scaling limits of rather general systems of random curves.  One aspect of the problem is to determine the regularity and dimension of a given (not necessarily random) curve without actually parametrizing it. Moreover, a sequence of scaling exponents which are relevant for regularity and tightness will be studied. The second problem is concerned specifically with random spanning trees in two dimensions. Precise conjectures exist regarding the values of the exponents in a number of examples. The object is to confirm or contradict those predictions, especially for the first three non-trivial exponents. A related question is whether the scaling limits of two standard examples, called the Minimal (Random) Spanning Tree, and the Uniformly Random Spanning Tree, differ or coincide in the limit. Moreover, existing methods should be extended to cover a class of tree processes on random graphs which has natural conformal invariance properties. Work on these questions will be part of a continuing collaboration.  The third problem is to try to establish any non-trivial bound on the dimension of self-avoiding random walks, adapting techniques that were successful for random spanning trees  and loop-erased walks. Finally, the investigator will participate in a collaborative effort aimed at understanding the connecting curves in high-dimensional critical percolation. <br/><br/>Random curves provide some of the most natural examples of fractal sets. They appear in random spanning trees (where every pair of points is connected by a unique curve), in critical percolation clusters (where two points are in the same cluster, if they are joined by a path along occupied bonds), as random walks, and as interfaces between random subsets of the plane (such as the Frontier of Brownian Motion, or level sets of random functions). These systems of random curves are typically constructed on a fine lattice within some box of finite size. Simulations suggest that in many models of interest, a meaningful continuum limit emerges as the lattice spacing is taken to zero. It is widely believed that these limits have remarkable symmetry properties, and that they should admit simple descriptions. However, there are only partial results guaranteeing that such limits even exist, and many questions about their properties remain open. <br/>"

The theory of growth models has played a key role in the analysis of spatial complex systems, dating back to the middle of the century.  During the present funding period, Griffeath will seek to further that theory by focusing on five main research projects: scaling laws for critical monotone solidification, shape theory for random perturbations of threshold growth, a prototype of spinodal clustering, quantitative analysis of 'small-world networks', and asymptotics for von Koch - type CA solidification.  These studies are primarily theoretical, their goal being rigorous mathematical results.  On the experimental side, Griffeath has begun to examine more complex interactions which exhibit a wide variety of intriguing self-organizational effects not present in the simplest ""linear"" spatial systems.  Preliminary empirical modeling projects at present include digital biofilms, nonlinear spatial modeling of social interaction, CA pattern dynamics, and a simple CA paradigm for traffic jams.<br/><br/> In broad strokes, the ongoing research of David Griffeath combines mathematical analysis and computer visualization in the study of complex spatial systems.  The investigator exploits this interplay for the theoretical and empirical study of deterministic and random cellular automata, local lattice dynamics which serve as prototypes for spiral formation in excitable media, the morphology of crystals, and various other nonlinear processes such as nucleation, flocking, host-parasite interactions, dendritic growth, and phase separation by surface tension.  The analysis of aggregation, shape, interfaces, and droplet interaction for such basic growth models sheds new light on many areas of applied science.  The investigator's research contributes to the mathematical foundations of such processes.<br/>"

Four topics concerning stochastic dynamics of Ising spin systems, the random cluster and Ising ferromagnetic model, and the contact process are proposed to be studied. The first topic concerns stochastic dynamics of an Ising spin system on an infinite lattice where spins evolve according to the usual Glauber dynamics. Some typical questions are: does a spin flip infinitely many times or only finitely many times? what is the probability that a spin has not yet flipped at time t? The second topic is about Ising models on hyperbolic lattices. Although Ising models on the hypercubic lattices have been studied intensively and extensively since they were introduced, these models on hyperbolic lattices have just started to receive attention from physicists and mathematicians. They are found, by both numerical studies and mathematical proofs, to exhibit a phenomenon of multiple phase transitions. Although some results have been rigorously proved, many statements suggested by numerical studies are to be proved, and many more are to be explored. Some GHS type inequalities in the random cluster model and a related question of uniqueness of the random cluster measure are the contents of the third topic. The final topic deals with phase transitions of models with low-dimensional inhomogeneity. These models include percolation, Ising ferromagnetic systems and contact processes.<br/> Models of the sort to be studied in this research arise naturally from physical sciences. Percolation is a probabilistic model of studying flow through a discrete disordered system, such as particles flowing through the filter of a gas mask, or fluid seeping through the interstices of a porous medium, while the contact process can be regarded as modeling the spread of an epidemic through a population.<br/>"

Once a year, the Northwest Probability Seminar, a one-day conference, brings together interested people from Oregon, British Columbia and Washington. Again, the participation of women in this annual event is significant.

Participation of young researchers and Ph.D students is significant. The University of Washington has established a Program in Computational Finance. Both PI's plan to participate in the program to help disseminate the knowledge of the stochastic analysis, including the most recent advances in the field, to non-mathematical audiences, with stress on students. In the past, the program attracted students from diverse departments, such as Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Finance, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Computer Science.

The purpose of this project is to make significant progress towards developing a theory of the exact solvability of the KPZ equation. In particular, this theory should lead to exact formulas for the probability distributions of the solution to the KPZ equation when started with various important types of initial data. This project will involve a number of fields of mathematics and this direction has already produced results of independent interest to these fields, which include: Macdonald symmetric function theory, tropical combinatorics and Whittaker functions, and certain quantum integrable systems.<br/> <br/>Since its discovery two hundred years ago the Gaussian distribution (bell curve) has come to represent one of mathematics greatest societal and scientific contributions ? a robust theory explaining and analyzing much of the randomness inherent in the world. Physical and mathematical systems accurately described in terms of Gaussian statistics are said to be in the Gaussian universality class. This class, however, is not all encompassing. For example, classical extreme value statistics or Poisson statistics better capture the randomness and severity of events ranging from natural disasters to emergency room visits. More recently, significant research efforts have been focused on understanding systems which are not well-described in terms of any of the classically developed statistics. The failure of these systems to conform to classical descriptions is generally due to a non-linear relationship between natural observables and underlying sources of random inputs and noise. A variety of models for complex systems such as growth processes, polymer chains, mass transport, traffic flow, queueing theory, driven gases, and turbulence have been actively studied for over forty years in mathematics, physics, material science, chemistry and biology. All of these systems fail to conform with classical Gaussian statistics, as has been observed through experimental evidence involving turbulent liquid crystals, crystal growth on a thin film, facet boundaries, bacteria colony growth, paper wetting, crack formation, and burning fronts. Surprisingly, despite their differences, all of the systems fall into a new statistical universality class whose properties are described in terms of a single model called the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The purpose of this project is to develop a statistical understand of the KPZ equation and its universality class."

One of the most important objectives in any given model is to understand the asymptotic structure of its Gibbs measure and in a number of models this structure is expected to be described by a version of the Parisi ultrametric Ansatz.  For diluted models, such as diluted p-sat and p-spin models, the proposal concerns with a better mathematical understanding of a framework for the diluted Parisi ansatz described by a random measure on the space of measurable functions and, in particular, with finding new ways to utilize some recent stability results in these models. For perceptron type models, the proposal aims to develop new stability properties with applications to certain cavity computations. <br/><br/>Many models in the general area of Spin Glasses originate from the attempts to understand the behavior of various optimization problems from different branches of science (physics, computer science, biology) and, more specifically, their average or typical behavior rather than focusing on one fixed scenario. This is done by randomizing the parameters of the problem and then trying to answer several key questions using the methods from Statistical Physics and Probability Theory. In the seventies and eighties, the physicists developed a number of novel ideas to approach these very difficult questions, first, in the setting of the now famous Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and then later successfully applied these ideas to other models as well. The ideas of the physicists were for the most part heuristic and are often described by the German word ""Ansatz"" which means ""an educated guess that is verified later by its results"". In recent years, many of these ideas have been confirmed rigorously, especially, in the setting of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. The goal of this project is to build upon recent progress and try to confirm other, even more bold, predictions of the physicists that are crucial for broader applicability of their ideas."

(3) What kinds of algebraic invariants can help distinguish between nonisomorphic graphs?  Abelian networks tie these three questions together: From a dynamical point of view, an abelian network is a cellular automaton that produces complex patterns using local rules. From a computational point of view, an abelian network yields the same output regardless of the timing of events at its individual nodes. And from an algebraic point of view, an abelian network associates an invariant, in the form of an abelian group or commutative algebra, to its underlying graph.<br/><br/>What can a network of computers reliably accomplish if each computer in the network runs at a different and unpredictable speed?  Answering this question would bring us closer to understanding complex networks like the brain, the economy and the internet. A related question asks what kinds of patterns can arise from simple interacting components in a situation where the order of interactions does not matter. A better understanding of pattern formation would aid in engineering desired large-scale outcomes by modifying only small-scale features of a system.

The most general  condition of Markov chains related to the above properties is  associated with Harris recurrence, which requires the Markov  chain returning to every set of positive measure infinitely  often, with probability 1.  The properties of Harris recurrent  Markov chains are well studied.  However, there are examples of  common Markov chains (e.g., some simple auto-regressive models)  which are not Harris recurrent.

The first two parts of the research concern the investigation of several multispecies models from ecology and  population biology.

These systems evolve over time  according to non-deterministic local rules which describe the  dynamics of each species and how they interact with each other in  this spatial environment.  Models to be considered include host-parasitoid associations and a model for the study of genetic diversity of a species in a subdivided habitat in which local  extinctions are frequent.  These investigations are theoretical  and experimental  (computer simulations).  The main goal is to  study how the spatial component affects survival/coexistence of  the species involved.  In the third part, problems concerning DNA  sequence comparisons are addressed.    One project is to construct  a statistical test that takes all types of mutations into account  in order to assess the statistical significance of such  comparisons.  The other project is to investigate what happens  when the sequences involved in the comparisons are very  different.  Current tests always assume that the frequencies with  which letters in the  sequences appear, are not too different.   In the first two parts, the investigator will study  several multispecies models from ecology and population biology.  These models are formulated as complex spatial systems that  evolve in time according to non-deterministic local rules.  Examples include host-parasitoid associations and models for the  study of genetic diversity of a species in a subdivided habitat  in which  local extinctions are frequent.  Some of the proposed  work is done in  collaboration with researchers from the biology  department at the  University of Wisconsin - Madison and the USDA  Forest Service.  The main goal is to st udy ho w the spatial  component affects survival/coexistence. In the third part,  problems arising in DNA sequence comparisons are addressed. Such  comparisons have revealed some unexpected sequence similarities  and there is the need for statistical tests to assess statistical  significance to such comparisons.  Currently, there is no test available that takes all types of mutations into account that  occur in DNA sequences.  Furthermore, all available tests require  the composition of the sequences (i.e., the frequencies with  which the letters in the sequences appear) not to be too  different.  The proposed research addresses both problems."

Theoretical problems include the  convergence and convergence rates of the empirical spectral  distributions to some nonrandom limits, limits of extreme  eigenvalues, separation between eigenvalues when the population  ones are separated, and analogues when the underlying samples are  dependent, such as stationary ergodic. The principal  investigators also plan to apply the theory of spectral analysis  of large dimensional random matrices to the detection problem in  array signal processing when the numbers of (unknown) sources and  the sensors are both large. Recent work has shown that, when  applying known results, the number of measurements needed to  estimate the proportion of the number of sources to the number of  sensors can be much smaller than what is required when using  classical multivariate analysis. However, extensive simulations  reveal an interesting phenomenon: the exact number of sources can  be detected with the same relatively low number of samples.  Intensive investigation of these problems is of great interest in  both probability theory and signal processing. Some other  application problems are also proposed.  The principal investigators (Z.D. Bai and Jack W. Silverstein)  plan to study certain properties of random matrices of high  dimension used in modeling multivariate random phenomena. The  motivation stems from the detection problem in array signal  processing.  For example, when determining the number of sources  impinging on a bank of sensors in the presence of noise when the  number of sources is sizable, known results on large dimensional  random matrices can be used to reliably estimate the proportion  of the number of sources to the number of sensors with a number  of measurements much smaller than  what is needed according to  standard multivariate analysis. However, extensive simulations  reveal that, with high probability, the exact number of sources  can be detected with the same relatively low number of samples.  The principal investigators intend to mathematically analyze the  observed phenomena which allows for exact detection, and its  dependence on the number of sensors and the sample size. Several  other remaining questions on large dimensional random matrices  important to applications will also be studied."

Probability densities for this stochastic process solve the classical diffusion equation. A continuous time random walk is a simple random walk subordinated to a renewal process, used in physics to model anomalous diffusion. Increments of the simple random walk represents particle jumps, and the renewal epochs represent the particle jump times. Infinite variance particle jumps cause superdiffusion, in which a cloud of particles spreads faster than the classical model predicts. Infinite mean waiting times lead to subdiffusion. Scaling limits of continuous time random walks are stochastic processes whose densities solve fractional partial differential equations. Infinite variance particle jumps lead to operator stable Levy motions, while infinite mean waiting times induce subordination to an inverse stable subordinator. Fractional derivatives are generators of stable continuous convolution semigroups. The research funded by this grant is developing a sound mathematical basis for this physical theory, and pursuing practical applications to problems in contaminant transport. The goals of this research include limit theory for continuous time random walks with possible dependence between the jump sizes and the waiting times, extension to more realistic multidimensional jump vectors with matrix scaling to allow different rates of particle spreading in each coordinate, parallel development of multiscaling fractional derivative operators in space, analysis of the fundamental physical basis of fractional diffusion to elucidate the physical meaning of the model parameters, development of useful statistical methods for parameter estimation, numerical methods for fractional partial differential equations, and application of these methods to real data from laboratory and field experiments and remediation efforts involving porous media and fracture flow. <br/> Movement of contaminants in a mountain stream takes place over a vast range of time scales. A majority will move away quickly, but a small amount can be caught in eddies for minutes or days. Another fraction may move into the relatively motionless water beneath the streambed, and it may take months or years for the last molecules to disappear completely. The movement of contaminants in underground water spreads over a similar range of time scales. Our team of mathematicians and hydrogeologists uses modern interdisciplinary research methods to develop accurate models for the movement and spread of these contaminants. Much more than an academic exercise, this work is needed for realistic models of contaminant and nutrient movement in drinking water supplies. The research is necessary because existing diffusion models greatly underestimate the time and concentration at which contaminants arrive downstream, when compared to actual data."

One of these problems is essentially combinatorial, having to do   with enumeration of lattice paths and with solving a class of recursions arising in this   problem. The problem arose from an application in computer science, but the applications   of this combinatorial analysis extend to particle systems, and to many other enumeration   problems. The second research area is the theory of random processes on countable   groups.  Many basic processes such as percolation, random walk, and Markov random   fields are symmetric with respect to the action of some group.  When the geometry of the   space is hyperbolic, the group is typically non-amenable, and the symmetry of the process   under the action of such a large group forces the process to be at least somewhat well   behaved.

Finally, he will continue research into random processes on trees,   and in particular, the examination of the rotor model, the contact process, branching   random walk, and invasion percolation.   Often quantities of mathematical and physical interest are encoded in a power   series, which is a very powerful tool for obtaining expressions for the quantities of   interest, provided one can in the end decode the information.  It is known how to do this   for power series in one variable, but relatively little is known when there is more than one   variable.  Even a reasonable approximation is in general unknown.  The results from this   research are expected to include a reliable method for approximating the coefficients of   power series in more than one variable.

Professor Bramson intends to study stability questions and the behavior under diffusive scaling for the first class of models; the use of fluid models is an important tool in such analysis.  The second class includes models such as the voter model, and two-type particle systems with the annihilation and creation of mass.

In the study of tilings one examines the different ways in which a region can be built by fitting together smaller pieces (called tiles) taken from a small collection of shapes.  The combinatorial perspective focuses on the question `In how many ways can this tiling problem be solved?' while the probabilistic perspective focuses on the question `What does a typical solution to this tiling problem look like?'  In many instances these tiling models are equivalent to models studied by statistical mechanicians for decades, but the new outlook is leading to many results that the physicists missed.  The tools that are used in attacking these questions range from complex analysis and the calculus of variations to ergodic theory and interacting particle systems.<br/><br/>On one level, this is basic mathematical research whose main motivation (like that of most theoretical mathematics) arises from the desire to understand phenomena that are simple yet surprising, especially in cases where existing analytical tools do not make it possible to provide rigorous proofs of empirically well-founded conjectures.  A further (and potentially more applicable) motivation for this research comes from the fact that tilings are simplified models of matter, particularly of matter that incorporates randomness at the very finest levels of organization.  In many cases, the precise details of the tiling problem (the shape of the tiles and of the region to be tiled) enforce a kind of large-scale heterogeneity reminiscent of physical systems in which different phases of a substance (such as ice, liquid water, and steam) coexist.  In studying tiling models, one can prove rigorous results concerning the ways in which the boundaries between different phases are maintained thermodynamically.  Thus the study of tilings can serve as a kind of a test-bed in which some ideas about random media can be subjected to mathematical analysis.<br/>"

The first three areas all involve agents controlling stochastic processes either   alone or jointly. Abstract gambling theory is a particular formulation of one-person   stochastic control theory, whereas two-person, zero-sum stochastic games have two   controllers with opposing interests. Strategic market games typically have many agents   and are used to model features of an economy such as price formation and loan markets.   In the fourth area, predictive inference, research is proposed on two criteria that seem   natural to require of any statistical prediction.   Most of the proposed research is on questions of how one or more individuals   should act when faced by a series of successive choices that must be made with   considerable uncertainty about their consequences. An example is the problem of how   much of one's income should be spent on current consumption and how much should be   saved (or invested) for the future. This problem, when formulated for a single individual,   fits into the framework of abstract gambling theory. If two individuals are in direct   competition for resources, the problem can be viewed as a two-person stochastic game.   Finally, if the problem involves all the individuals in a large economy, it can be viewed as a   many-person, strategic market game in which the individuals as a group determine, or at   least influence, prices and interest rates. If a central bank is added to the game as another   player that has the power to set interest rates, the question arises as to how the bank   should set interest rates so as to minimize inflation or improve the general welfare. This is   likely to be a difficult problem for our models just as it is in the real world."

While the problems concern very different physical situations, at the   mathematical level they all deal with situations where presence of disorder can significantly   change properties of the system. Part one studies ground states of random lattice models   in statistical mechanics---a question related to understanding thermodynamics of   disordered systems.  In part two the focus is on effects of randomness on propagation of   nonlinear waves described by partial differential equations---of the conservation law and   Hamilton-Jacobi type.  The content of part three is statistics of density and of pairwise   velocities of galaxies in the universe. From the point of view of mathematics, each part of   the proposal involves studying nonlinear functions of many independent random variables   or of the realizations of a simple underlying process (often a Gaussian one). This relates   the project thematically to the theory of large deviations and concentration of measure   phenomena.  The tools include functional limit theorems, ergodic theory, large deviation   estimates and martingale methods in the first two parts and generalized Gaussian   processes in the third part. The interplay of physical and mathematical ideas is essential in   the whole proposal.   Many interesting questions in mathematical physics are concerned with   complicated inhomogeneous systems.  For example, a realistic description of a solid often   has to take into account presence of defects and impurities, which make its physical   properties different from those of a homogeneous crystal.  These special properties of   disordered systems are of crucial importance in modern materials science and technology    --- semiconductors and glasses are examples of disordered materials. Another example is   the distribution of galaxies in the Universe --- their positions do not follow any simple   regular pattern and us ing such a pattern in modeling their configuration would not account   for observed phenomena. While detailed configuration (arrangement of atoms, galaxies or   other constituents) of an inhomogeneous system varies from one region in space to   another, there is often an underlying simple statistical regularity, which leads to modeling   and studying such systems using concepts and methods of probability theory.  Each of the   three parts of the proposal addresses a different physical problem of the above type. Part   one involves the study of models of disordered solids, focusing on their ground states ---  the energetically preferred configurations.  Part two is concerned with propagation of   waves in disordered media --- several applications of mathematics to hydrology are of this   type. The content of part three is fluctuations of various quantities related to the   distribution of matter in the Universe and statistical questions arising in interpreting   observational results. The general physical motivation behind the proposal is to understand   possible effects resulting of the presence of randomness in different physical systems."

In recent years, the investigator and his collaborators have made considerable progress in identifying simple, descriptive conditions on observable characteristics, such as diversity or sufficient intrinsic volatility, which allow the construction of simple (based solely on observable quantities) portfolios  that can outperform a large equity market.  This project seeks to build on these results in order to understand the nature of optimal, that is, ""least-expensive"", arbitrages of this type, and their connections to stochastic analysis (exit measures for supermartingales, degenerate diffusions), parabolic partial differential equations (propagation of qualitative properties such as convexity), and the fine structure of financial markets (the onset of arbitrage opportunities, or of ""bubbles"", and its implications for pricing and for hedging).  Additionally, the investigator has gained considerable understanding of stochastic control problems with discretionary stopping, when a ""controller"" (a player who affects the dynamics of the game) and a ""stopper"" (a player who decides the duration of the game) cooperate to minimize an expected cost.  This project embarks on an effort to understand non-cooperative versions of such games, both in zero-sum and in non-zero-sum contexts. A rich theory seems to emerge, and we intend fully to pursue its development as described in the proposal. Furthermore, research will focus on such stochastic optimization problems in the presence of unobservable parameters, modeled in a Bayesian framework by means of random variables with known prior distributions and continuous updating. Such problems are notoriously hard to solve explicitly, but we have ambitious plans in this direction and some preliminary results. <br/><br/>Stochastic portfolio theory is a relatively novel mathematical framework for analyzing portfolio behavior and equity market structure; it is descriptive as opposed to normative, is consistent with observable characteristics of actual portfolios and real markets, and provides a theoretical tool (with insights into questions of arbitrage, construction of portfolios with controlled behavior, etc.) which is also useful for practical applications. Optimization problems that involve features of both stochastic control and optimal stopping arise, for instance, in the study of target-tracking models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived ""sufficiently close"", and then to decide whether to engage the target or not. Problems of combined optimal stochastic control/stopping also arise in Mathematical Finance: in the context of computing the upper- and lower-hedging prices of American contingent claims under portfolio constraints; in portfolio/consumption problems with an embedded ""retirement"" option; in the study of dynamic measures for managing risk; in the context of dynamically consistent utilities; and in stochastic games of the principal/agent type. Stochastic control with partial observations has implications for the adaptive sequential detection of change-points, for signal processing, for finance, and for other fields of application where learning about unknown parameters and dynamic system optimization have to take place simultaneously, and in real time."

In large deviation theory, regeneration and renewal methods will be used to extend the applicability of sub-additivity arguments to Markov additive processes and to infinite memory chains.  This yields quick and direct methods to establish existence of a large deviation principle.  New techniques for identifying the relevant rate functions will be investigated.  Large deviation of the iterates of certain monotone maps related to the infinite order chains will be studies by the above methods.  Electron-photon cascades will be studied as special cases of multi-type branching random walks.  An open question on the balance between electrons and photons above a fixed energy at large depths of an absorber will be studied.  Large deviation theory is the study of the estimation and approximation of very small probabilities.  These arise in the study of transmission errors in information communication, in studying large exceedances in random networks, in estimating failure probabilities in large systems (e.g. insurance companies) and many other settings.  New techniques will be developed and applied to study the rate at which these probabilities decrease as the number of observations increases.  A second subject to be studied is a model for electron-photon cascades, in particular, the ratio of the number of electrons to photons above a given energy level."

More precisely, one looks at random walks on the d-dimensional lattice, whose transition probabilities form a random field indexed by the vertices of the lattice. Not only is the RWRE providing a serious mathematical challenge, many of the results proved in this field, especially in the one dimensional case, stand in sharp contrast with the behavior of classical random walk. For example, in dimension 1, subdiffusive behavior and aging phenomena are present, whereas in high dimension one may construct RWREs with nonzero (averaged) local drift pointing in one direction while the walk drifts away (with positive speed) in the opposite direction. Some of the mathematical challenge emanates from the fact that in the multidimensional case, conditioned on the transition probabilities random field, the RWRE is not reversible. This precludes the use of much of the available theory of homogenization, and requires the development of new techniques, most notably through the use of regeneration times and of renormalization ideas. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers including Sznitman, Varadhan, and Zerner, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Among these one notes the existence of 0-1 laws, laws of large numbers in full generality, transience and recurrence criteria, the relation between quenched and annealed large deviations behavior, the existence (or non-existence) of sub-diffusive behavior for high dimension, and the behavior of RWREs in mixing (as opposed to i.i.d.) environments. <br/> Random walks are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such RWREs can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow one to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWREs can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place. <br/>"

One of the main features of modern classification techniques is that they take into account the distribution of the so called classification margins (large margin methods), the quantities that characterize the reliability of classification. However, the margins alone do not give a satisfactory explanation of the superb performance of these methods. To provide such an explanation one has to combine margin type parameters with complexities of the classification rules in rather sophisticated upper confidence bounds. The goal of the research is to use concentration inequalities and various tools from the theory of Gaussian, empirical and Rademacher processes to develop new, much more subtle and powerful bounds of this type, that would lead to a much better understanding of the performance of the existing large margin classification methods and suggest ways to develop statistically optimal large margin procedures. The research includes the study of limit theorems and inequalities for ratio type empirical processes; the study of localized complexities of function classes involved in learning algorithms and the development of new bounds on generalization performance in terms of individual complexities of combined classifiers; the investigation of convergence rates of the empirical margin distribution to the true margin distribution of classifiers in terms of localized and individual complexities; the study of convergence rates of learning algorithms and the development of adaptive classification algorithms with optimal convergence rates; and the investigation of spectral properties of random matrices that play important role in learning theory for kernel machines. <br/> Learning Theory is a rapidly growing area between Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics that deals with modeling the process of learning and generalization in both biological and artificial neural networks and other learning machines. The results of the research are likely to facilitate further development of boosting, kernel machines, and other learning techniques and lead to new probabilistic bounds and asymptotic results in the theory of empirical processes with potential applications to many problems in statistical learning theory and other areas of Statistics. Methods of statistical learning theory have been penetrating many important areas of applications ranging from biotechnology to computer security. One of the topics of the proposed research is to develop applications of large margin learning methods in the area of robust control, in particular, to the problem of congestion control in communication networks. The results of the research are likely to impact this and other areas of applications. <br/>"

Importance sampling is a widely used Monte Carlo simulation technique for the estimation of quantities that are largely determined by rare events. With few exceptions, importance sampling algorithms are based on a change of measure that is not allowed to adapt in the course of generating a sample. Recent studies, however, indicate that these schemes may fail miserably in very common circumstances. These difficulties reflect the absence of a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling. One contribution of the proposed research is to build such a foundation in a general setting. Roughly speaking, at the heart of any importance sampling problem is a stochastic game, and an understanding of this game is the key to designing and analyzing efficient importance sampling algorithms. This perspective motivates the concept of dynamic importance sampling, where the change of measure is allowed to vary depending on the simulation history. It can be shown that dynamic schemes, properly designed, are optimal in a suitable sense. The second topic, urn occupancy problems, is concerned with the distribution of multiple balls in multiple urns. This classical topic has found applications in many fields. The proposed research concerns large deviation approximations, new techniques for explicitly solving the associated variational problem, and the development of relations between equilibrium distributions for stochastic networks and occupancy problems.<br/><br/>If one were to ask an average person whether unlikely events are important, their first response might be that an event with very little chance of happening could not be significant.  After a moment's reflection, however, they would realize that such events have a profound impact in many circumstances. For example, measuring credit risk is very important to those who manage portfolios of loans, corporate bonds, and other financial instruments that are subject to default risk. Often the problem reduces to estimating the probability of default, which is usually very small, especially for highly rated obligors. However, an accurate estimation is crucial for risk management because these rare defaults can induce significant losses.  Similar considerations apply in many other circumstances, especially when performance standards are stringent.  The dominant technique for estimating small probabilities has been a simulation algorithm called importance sampling. However, the traditional design methodology for importance sampling has very limited applications and has been observed to break down in very common situations. Part of the proposed research is concerned with the most basic question, that is, how to build a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling, upon which efficient algorithms can be designed for very general problems. A new concept of design is introduced in the proposal and the resulting importance sampling algorithms work well in practice. The other part of the proposal is concerned with a class of urn occupancy models. These models are very useful in the design and analysis of large-scale networks, biological systems, and physics. However, due to the complexity of the models, approximation becomes exceedingly important. The proposed research will develop an asymptotic method that can yield good approximations with only a modest computation effort.   <br/>"

The problems consist of determining information on the nature of                signals emitted in a noise-filled environment from an unknown                   number of sources from data gathered from a collection of                       sensors.  Methods for solving the problem, such as MUSIC, rely on               the spectral properties of the covariance matrix associated with                the vector of sensor values.  This matrix is approximated by the                sample covariance matrix formed from samples of the vector data                 across time.

Applied to the                     signal processing problem when there are many sources, the                      theorems can be used to determine the number of sources and the                 variance of the noise, with a sample size considerably smaller                  than needed to approximate the covariance matrix.  Moreover, they               can, in certain situations, provide additional information on the               nature of the signals.  Computer simultations indicate that                     useful information can be obtained with as little as 20 sources.                Research is also planned to solve some important mathematical                   questions concerning the limit theorems, in order to completely                 understand the applicability of the theorems to signal                          processing.

The first problem involves reflected Brownian motion in time-dependent domains and the corresponding heat equation with the Neumann boundary conditions. The main emphasis is on the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the heat equation and the reflected Brownian motion, and on the singularities of the heat equation solutions close to the moving boundary. The second part of the project is concerned with stochastic flows related to singular stochastic differential equations. Flows of this type have interesting combinatorial properties not present in flows corresponding to equations with smooth coefficients. The ""hot spot"" conjecture states that hottest point in an insulated body lies on its boundary. While this is not true in general, it is a widespread belief that the conjecture holds in convex domains. The PIs are currently studying symmetric convex domains. Finally, stable processes and related processes are studied from the point of view of potential theory.<br/> Stochastic analysis was one of the most important developments on the borderline of probability and analysis in the twentieth century. It now provides the basis of studying fundamental properties of real life phenomena which are random by nature. One of the most spectacular recent successes of the theory is the so-called financial mathematics. This theory provides a solid theoretical basis for trading securities - its founding fathers were recently recognized by a Nobel Prize in Economics. Stable processes, one of the topics of the project, are more and more often applied in financial mathematics and other applied sciences because the traditional continuous models are not always adequate. The study of a singular flow was directly inspired by a collaboration of one of the PIs (Burdzy) with economists, published in a leading journal ""Econometrics."" The study of reflected Brownian motion in time dependent domains is reminiscent of the ""Stefan problem"" concerned with melting ice. Similar physical models are of great interest to scientists who model real life environmental changes.<br/>"

The effect of small perturbations on the almost sure qualitative structure of the stochastic flow will be studied near hyperbolic stationary solutions. Such small perturbations are natural because of unavoidable statistical errors in estimating the parameters of physical models against experimental inaccuracies in the measurement of real data.

The dynamics of the third class of problems will be studied by analyzing classical examples such as two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes and Burgers equations. The  proposed research is a long-term program that advocates novel links between probability theory/stochastic analysis and traditional mainstream mathematical disciplines such as dynamical systems, differential geometry and numerical analysis. In particular, the research would lead to new interactions between stochastic geometry and dynamical systems.<br/><br/>During the past decade, a considerable number of applied mathematicians, engineers and economists have turned their attention to randomly evolving systems with memory for modeling a variety of physical phenomena whose time evolution depends on their past history. In physics, laser dynamics with delayed feedback is often investigated, as well as the dynamics of noisy bi-stable systems with delay. In biophysics, random (viz. stochastic) systems with memory are used to model delayed visual feedback systems or human postural sway and in the design of cardiac pacemaker cells. In mathematical finance, the volatility of the stock may be dependent on its past history and hence the stock dynamics may be best described by a stochastic system with memory. The research in this project is expected to give a complete characterization of the stability structure near equilibria for a large class of infinite-dimensional models called stochastic partial differential equations. Such models are ubiquitous in the study of heat flow, the movement of fluids and modelling of climate change.<br/>The PI will complete the preparation of a research monograph on stochastic systems with memory. The monograph is intended to be the basis for a graduate course in mathematics at Carbondale.

Thus it can be and has recently been applied to describe phenomena that cannot be described by these two major stochastic processes. To enlarge the scope of application one needs to study the nonlinear  functionals of fractional Brownian motion.  An important and  natural class of such functionals are those given by stochastic differential equations. In addition to studying self-intersection local time, the principal investigator proposes to study general stochastic  differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion.  The  difficulty in such study is caused by the fact that the powerful Picard's iteration approach fails to work.  The principal investigator proposes to combine fractional calculus, anticipative stochastic calculus, and the characteristic theory to investigate such equations.<br/><br/>To describe natural or social phenomena mathematically, people usually use Markov property (the future depends only on today although the whole history until today is known). This is a reasonable simplification, particularly if one considers the sophistication needed to deal with the entire past. However, it becomes more and more demanding to assimilate all the information available to better predict the future.  Fractional Brownian motion is among the simplest statistical model that captures this long memory character.  It has found many applications. To more adequately fit mathematical models to the phenomena under consideration, one should use  fractional Brownian motion as building blocks to obtain more sophisticated random quantities. The principal investigator has focused on this statistical model for a number of years and has achieved significant success. This research will considerably further this progress and is expected to have impact on many other fields. Immediate applications are to be found in finance and bio-informatics.<br/>"

A natural sub-optimal strategy can be exhibited. It is further shown how one can create a long-term portfolio strategy which asymptotically withdraws money at the (same) asymptotic rate at which the portfolio is growing, without diminishing that long-term rate(!). 3) Extend previous work on self-normalized martingales. 4) Attempt to construct and/or identify extremal distributions which arise in various situations maximizing the expected value of some random quantity subject to infinitely many linear inequality constraints. 5) Develop an idea, conveyed to him in 1992 by Prof. David L.

This approach permits one to establish confidence intervals for parameter estimation, to perform hypothesis testing and data classification with only finite samples.

We propose to study stochastic partial differential equations with a Gaussian random potential. There are many examples of such equations, and usually they are treated on a case-by-case basis. On the other hand, in many cases the solution can be expanded in terms of multiple stochastic integrals with respect to the noise. There are many tools available to study such equations, including Wiener space analysis and the Feynman-Kac formula. We intend to use these tools to study qualitative properties of solutions, such as asymptotic growth, and the critical parameters for existence of solutions. For certain parameter values, we expect solutions taking values in the space of Schwartz distributions. Of course, this is a broad program, and many such equations have been considered before. However, much less is known for the case of correlated Gaussian noise than for white noise. Here, we are referring to specific phenomena, which might occur only for certain correlation functions of the Gaussian noise. Also, the stochastic heat equation has received much more attention than other cases. <br/> In the physical sciences, engineering, and increasingly in biology, the most useful tool is a partial differential equation. Solving the equation gives us a quantitative understanding of the physical situation, allowing us to make predictions and to control the system. However, in the real world, all systems are affected by random noise, and our models must also include randomness. The field of stochastic partial differential equations attempts to address this situation. This field is much newer than partial differential equations, and our mathematical understanding is much less. This proposal focuses on equations with a potential term. Such equations model many natural phenomena. In quantum mechanics, potential terms represent the interaction between particles and forces acting on the system. Potential terms can also arise in the equations for the spread of epidemics, and in other situations in population biology. We will study the effect of a random potential. The goal is to increase our understanding of the mathematical tools, so that scientists and engineers can use them more skillfully. <br/>"

Such techniques are likely to lead to new and unexpected applications in other areas particularly for other stochastic processes with jumps but whose transition probabilities still retain certain rotational invariance properties. Martingales have played an important role in the study of singular integral operators in general and in the study of Beurling-Ahlfors operator in particular. A new probabilistic approach, based on heat martingales, is proposed. This will give a better understanding of a celebrated conjecture of T. Iwaniec on the size of the norm of this operator. <br/> A remarkable aspect of contemporary mathematics is the unexpected yet deep connections between previously very different fields. The problems in the proposed project are all interdisciplinary in nature and as such have the potential to impact different fields in mathematics, engineering, science and economics. Symmetric stable processes have been used to model many physical and economic phenomena, particularly for certain stocks where the Brownian motion models are not adequate. Estimates on the Beurling-Ahlfors operator have many applications to nonlinear problems in elasticity. The 'hot-spots' conjecture, when formulated in terms of the theory of heat conduction, asserts that if one begins with an initial heat distribution on a plate which is insulated around its boundary and waits for the initial transients to settle down, then the hottest and coldest regions will be found on the boundary of the plate. Since the mathematical description of heat is given by a second order partial differential operator, introduced by the Marquis Pierre-Simon De Laplace (1749-1827) more than 200 years ago, the conjecture has been of interest to researchers in mathematics, physics and chemistry. The connection to probability arises from the description by Norbert Wiener (1894-1964) of heat flow in terms of Brownian motion. <br/>"

These include the problem of characterization of probability distributions satisfying dimension free concentration properties and related Sobolev-type inequalities, the KLS-conjecture on the dominating role of linear functionals with respect to logarithmically concave measures, the problem of existence and asymptotic normality of typical distributions in randomized models of summation. The PI also plans to address new aspects of the concentration phenomenon of product measures under additional symmetry hypotheses. As closely related, part of this activity is devoted to finite dimensional de Finetti representations for permutation invariant probability measures on product spaces and their applications to quantifying the rate of dependence of elements in long finite exchangeable sequences. A separate part is devoted to analysis of random walks on discrete structures and focuses on developing techniques based on suitable modified forms of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. <br/> The study of concentration phenomena is motivated, in particular, by classical problems of probability and statistics about general global properties of smooth functionals of stochastic processes. Concentration tools are also of great importance in asymptotic convex geometry where one explores the role of the dimension of high-dimensional convex objects.

While extreme value theory has always played an important role in probability and statistics, recent events such as the economic meltdown of the international banking system and the heightened threats of climate change  have underscored the pressing need to develop and expand methodologies in extremes to tackle these new and critical challenges.  Many of the first applications of extremes were tied to hydrology.  Engineers were interested in designing dams that would cope with maximum river flow.  This led naturally to the concept of a one hundred year flood.  Analogues of the concept of the 100 year flood have spread to atmospheric science, where one may be interested in the 100 year rainfall, and to finance where the 100 year flood is replaced by the 10 day or 1 year VaR (value at risk).  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>In the last ten years there has been a rapid development of new theory and methodology in extreme value theory.  This has been motivated by applications in climate and atmospheric science; geosciences;  hydrology; finance, economics, and insurance; and telecommunications and stochastic networks.  Recent events such as the economic meltdown of the international banking system and the heightened threats of climate change  have underscored the pressing need to develop and expand methodologies in extremes to tackle these new and critical challenges.  The ?

All aspects of risk and extreme value analysis and their applications will be included with participants  from a variety of disciplines in the physical sciences, engineering and economics.

Back in the sixties, in a series of pioneering papers Erdos and Renyi created what is now known as random graphs theory, a fast growing research area remarkable for fruitful interplay of enumerative combinatorics and modern probabilistic models and techniques. While Erdos-Renyi random graph process is based on assumption that a new edge location is chosen uniformly at random, it has been recognized that in some applications (internet networks) a more realistic assumption is of a bias toward more ""popular"" vertices (nodes), a so-called preferential attachment hypothesis. The proponent has proved that in this counterpart of the E-R process the random graph undergoes a rapid transformation, from a sea of small components (clusters) to a giant cluster in a sea of small clusters. The proponent plans to study the subsequent phases of the graph process, such as formation of a k-core, and the moment the graph first becomes connected. The proponent will study vertex and edge percolation processes on random graphs with a given degree distribution, and solvability of the random Boolean equations based on his previous studies of the E-R process at the critical stage. The program includes joint research with Alan Frieze (""mixing"" time of a random walk on an incipient giant component of the E-R graph), and Nick Wormald (directed version of the E-R process). Among other problems are (i) a detailed asymptotic study of the expected coalescing time for a ""m balls into n boxes"" combinatorial scheme, motivated by problems in population genetics (""most recent common ancestor"")and computer science (""coupling-from-the past"" algorithm by Propp and Wilson);(ii) enumerative-probabilistic study of ""sorting networks""; (iii) probabilistic study of ""hard-to-solve"" combinatorial problems, such as integer partitioning problem and a k-SAT problem, on satisfiability of a random Boolean function with clauses of length k > 2.<br/><br/>Importantly, besides its intrinsic mathematical value, the proposed research program is motivated by problems arising in related areas of operations research (two-sided labor markets), probabilistic modeling of growing information networks, percolation processes in statistical physics, and average case analysis of combinatorial algorithms. Some of these problems seem particularly suitable as research topics for the proponent's partnerships with PhD students. The past beneficiaries of such a collaboration were Adam Hammett and Craig Lennon who successfully defended their PhD theses on problems from the program funded by the NSF in 2004&#8722;2007. The proponent is confident that systematic interaction with his current students, John McSweeney and Jia Yeum, will lead to solving two problems included in the proposed program, one on the expected coalescing time for the allocation model,and another on probability of solvability of the random equations."

Here one looks for (a) collective behavior of the system as a whole or (b)  a statistical description of the behavior that an individual component might exhibit.  It is emphasized that (a) and (b) are not disjoint criteria:  indeed quite often (but not always) they coincide. The setups that will be used to promote these studies are of four types; all,  to a greater or lesser extent, are interrelated and all four have their origins in the description of physical problems.  These are (i) [Classical Spin--Systems] Lattice models of spins or particles interacting under certain rules, primarily local, which are known as the laws of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics.  (ii) [Quantum Spin--Systems] A similar setup as in (i) but under the rules of quantum equilibrium statistical mechanics.  (iii) [Interacting Particle Systems] Models where individual particles or spins occupying lattice positions update their position or state dynamically in time according to stochastic rules that are themselves effected by the existing local configuration.  (iv) [Cluster Models/Graphical Representations] Graphical models where, in addition to local rules, configurations are determined, stochastically, according to global considerations or non-local rules.  In addition to the standard lattice based large-scale descriptions, some of the work will concern continuum models --as well as continuum limits of lattice models.<br/><br/>A philosophy which became prevalent beginning in the late 1960's is that of universality:  Once the basic nature and premise of the constituents and their interactions are determined, the resultant (possible modes of) large?scale, long?time collective behaviors in systems with many degrees of freedom do not depend on the meticulous details of the model.  Thus a variety of systems will be investigated where the nature of the interacting constituents is of the simplest type.  However, it is anticipated that the full tapestry of collective behavior will be exhibited. Thus, notwithstanding the physical origins of these types of models,  it is anticipated, at least by the PI, that these types of models allow for a broad range of applications--even beyond the physical sciences.  (Already some of this has come to fruition in the context of a related proposal which concerns the study of criminal behavior and allocation of police resources.) Moreover and perhaps more pertinently:  This proposal and its predecessor encompass a broad array of problems with multiple facets providing research opportunities at every level and the successful completion of the program will require the assistance of many collaborators ranging from the undergraduate to the senior research collaborator."

Asymptotic geometric analysis deals with geometric properties of finite dimensional convex bodies as the dimension grows to infinity. In her research the PI uses methods from both areas, as well as probabilistic tools and concentration  phenomena, to get a better understanding of the structure of convex sets. The  PI was able to prove a variety of results where such structural aspects of convex sets play a role: in approximation of convex bodies by polytopes; to establish a link between the so called order statistics (which are fundamental objects in statistics)  and Orlicz norms; to determine the ``sizes"" of certain (convex) sets that appear naturally in quantum information theory.<br/>A further focus  of the PI's research is the development of affine invariants.  <br/>The PI and her collaborators started the  systematic study of (affine invariant) functionals associated with convex bodies and their corresponding inequalities. Among the most important such functionals are  affine surface area and p-affine surface area . The affine isoperimetric inequalities related to them are more powerful than their Euclidean relatives and related to  other important inequalities, e.g. <br/>the  Santalo- and Inverse Santalo- inequalities. The latter is related to Mahler's conjecture which is still open in dimension 3 and higher.<br/><br/>A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call ""the curse of dimensionality.""  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases which are not visible in low dimensions. <br/>We can  exploit those patters, thus taking advantage of the ""curse of dimensionality"" to make it the  ""blessing of dimensionality"". <br/>It is one purpose of this grant to study such high dimensional phenomena.<br/>"

Progress in the understanding of optimal stopping has recently made possible the explicit resolution of a large class of problems.  In this project, it is envisioned that similar advances in significant, and increasingly realistic, questions of adaptive change-point detection -- when one has to learn about unobservable parameters and simultaneously, in real time, to optimize system performance.  In addition, plans include work on a 'fusion' of optimal stopping with stochastic control and filtering theories, and contemplate the exact resolution of combined problems of stochastic optimization with discretionary stopping in the presence of partial observations.  This effort will, for the first time, bring the field to the threshold of solving fairly explicitly several Stochastic Games of combined Control and Stopping, of both zero- and non-zero-sum type.   <br/> <br/>Optimization problems that involve features of both stochastic control and optimal stopping arise in the study of target-tracking models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived sufficiently close to the target, then to decide whether to engage the target or not.  Problems of combined optimal stochastic control/stopping also come up in Mathematical Finance in the context of computing the upper- and lower-hedging prices of American contingent claims under portfolio constraints, in portfolio/consumption problems with an embedded retirement option, in the study of dynamic measures for managing risk, and in stochastic games of the principal/agent type.  The work on adaptive sequential detection of change-points has clear implications for several fields of application (signal processing, finance, wireless communication, manufacturing, image or speech recognition), in contexts where learning about unknown parameters and dynamic system optimization have to be made simultaneously and in real time.  The resolution of the problems suggested in this project is expected to advance our understanding of stochastic optimization and expand the frontiers of its applications. The involvement of graduate students in the research activities is expected to continue at a strong pace, and to be a major factor in the advancement of Applied Probability and of the Mathematics of Finance."

The systems include self-avoiding random walks and loops, Ising spin systems, and percolation. Our first approach is through real space renormalization group transformations.  These transformations for Ising type models relate the critical behavior of the model to the behavior of the renormalization group map near the critical point.  This map is not well defined mathematically, and the project will study the mathematical properties of this map.  Our second approach is restricted to two dimensional systems where conformal invariance miraculously appears when there is critical behavior. The research will study the relation between the Schramm-Loewner evolution and various discrete models by studying the Loewner driving process, especially for models which are near but not at their critical point.  The relation of the bi-infinite self-avoiding walk to the newly discovered conformally invariant measures on self-avoiding loops in the plane will also be investigated.<br/><br/>The systems that will be studied contain randomness at a microscopic length scale. For most values of the parameters, e.g., temperature, this randomness is not seen at the macroscopic scale. But for special values of the parameters this microscopic randomness can produce macroscopic effects. This is one characterization of a phase transition. Physicists have developed powerful techniques for studying phase transitions, but the mathematics of these methods is not well understood. This research will further our understanding of critical phenomena by developing the mathematics behind two of the most important of the physicist's tools - the renormalization group and conformal invariance. The research on the renormalization group will focus on the Ising model, arguably the single most important model of the magnetic behavior of crystalline materials.  One product of the research on conformal invariance will be a much faster algorithm for numerically computing conformal maps which are used extensively in science and engineering."

Moreover, on a finite regular tree, the critical temperature for rapid mixing is lower than the critical temperature for uniqueness of Gibbs states on the corresponding infinite tree. The investigator intends to study precisely which aspects of the geometry of a graph (e.g. spectra, Cheeger constants) are most relevant to the mixing rate of Glauber dynamics. Modern approximation schemes for ""hard"" combinatorial problems (e.g., counting matchings in a graph) use processes related to Glauber dynamics, so new insights on these dynamics will have an impact on randomized approximation algorithms.<br/> Large networks of interacting particles have been studied for decades in statistical physics, as models of magnetism, freezing, and other physical processes. In these models, each particle interacts only with its immediate neighbors, yet from this local interaction, global structure can emerge. The evolution of these systems over time is called ""Glauber dynamics"". In the last twenty years, these dynamics have been used in image analysis, approximate counting algorithms, and communication networks. While most of the mathematical results and physical predictions available are restricted to quite special networks (where the particles are arranged in a regular lattice), they have motivated applications where the underlying network has completely different structure. The investigator intends to analyze Glauber dynamics on a variety of networks, with attention focussed on the effect of the network geometry on the dynamics.

The networks (graphs) have long been used as abstract mathematical descriptions of real-life social and technological networks. In 1960 Erdos and Renyi began studying a mathematical model of a graph with many vertices that slowly evolves in time, as one link after another is inserted between two randomly selected nodes. However idealized, this model captured a combinatorial complexity of the real networks that are poorly connected at the inception and become more and more tight as more and more pairwise links appear in a chaotic fashion. Erdos and Renyi discovered a remarkable mathematical phenomenon: for a long time the evolving graph remains split in many small connected components, and then during a relatively short time period the graph undergoes a dramatic transition which results in the appearance of a giant connected subnetwork (subgraph) that contains a positive fraction of all vertices. This pioneering work started an avalanche of research aimed at elucidating deeper feautures of the phase transition phenomenon and tracking down the likely changes in the graph structure after the giant component has appeared. This research includes a detailed study of the group of largest components at the moments when they are about to merge into a giant component. Another component of this research is to have a close look at a core of the giant component, i.e. the largest subset of vertices in that component which are connected to each other noticeably stronger than to the other vertices. The principal investigator will work on alternative random graph models that may be closer to the real-life networks. One such network is the World Wide Web. There is a body of interesting, but not rigorous, research on the networks that grow population-wise in such a way that the most connected nodes are statistically preferred as contacts by the arrivals. The proposer plans to study these network growth processes jointly with D. Aldous and A. Frieze.<br/> Other classic examples of combinatorial structures are the partitions of sets and integers. And again there are numerous illustrations of how useful and insightful these abstractions are in applications. An integer partition is a partition of a given integer into decreasing parts. A central problem is to study the structure of a partition chosen at random among all such partitions. Since the pioneering work by Erdos and Lehner, the studies by Szalay, Turan, Fristedt and this investigator resulted in discovery of a rather detailed picture (shape) of the typical partition. The investigator plans to continue his research on the random integer partitions, and to extend it to the random plane partitions, a surprisingly rich combinatorial scheme, whose probabilistic aspects have only started to emerge. The investigator plans to combine enumerational tools and the probabilistic techniques in order to study the geometric characteristics of the typical plane partitions. The random partitions have been found critically important in probabilistic studies of optimization problems. One such well known problem is to partition a given set of numbers (weights) into two groups so that the weights of two groups are as close to each other as possible. Simplicity of this problem is deceiving: there is no efficient algorithm to solve it when the set of weights is large. It is natural then to switch attention and to study computational complexity of a typical problem when the individual weights are random. In on-going joint research C. Borgs, J. Chayes and the investigator have found a parameter of the problem whose value plays a crucial role in determination of how intrinsically difficult a typical instance of the problem is. Much as the partition problem differs from the evolving random graph, there is a striking similarity between two structures: both experience a rapid transition within a surprisingly narrow window on the parameter scale. The research will continue, and the collaborators plan to broaden it, to include various other optimization problems."

The powerful stochastic calculus for semimartingales are not applicable to them. Motivated by the urgent need from applications the principal investigator and his collaborators have developed a new stochastic calculus of Ito type based on the Wick product. He proposes to continue this research topic and to study the stochastic differential systems driven by fractional Brownian motions. First he shall study the existence, uniqueness and approximation of global solutions to stochastic differential systems driven by fractional Brownian motions. Many researchers have attempted to obtain result on these aspects with little success. The principal investigator has discovered a relationship between stochastic differential systems driven by fractional Brownian motions and quasilinear hyperbolic equations (of infinitely many variables). It is well-known that the latter equations are also difficult to solve. However, there are a number of results which are useful. This connection will lead to a better understanding of stochastic differential systems and the PI plans to explore this relation. Secondly, in application of the stochastic systems driven by fractional Brownian motions, one also needs to identify the coefficients and the Hurst parameter. The PI proposes to study one such identification problem and apply it to the investigation of the stochastic volatility model in financial market. <br/> To obtain the maximum benefit from a physical or social system, one needs to understand the system in the most precise way possible. This requires building a mathematical model for the dynamic evolution of the system. When the system is under the influence of some uncertain factors, the system should be modeled by a random process. Up to now one of the random processes which has received the most attention and has been studied the most is stochastic differential equations based on the so-called Brownian motion. Brownian motion has some nice properties such as Markovian: Its future state depends only on the present state and does not depend on the past. This simplicity makes the mathematics for it easy and very profound results have been achieved. In fact there have been enormous work on it over the past century. However, this elegant property also limits the applicability of such a random process, since it cannot be used to describe those systems whose future depend not only the present but also on past history! Fractional Brownian motions are random processes having this long range dependence and may be used to describe such systems. This proposal aims to construct mathematical tools for the fractional Brownian motions which have already found applications in hydrology, climatology, network traffic analysis, and finance. This research will have impact on these areas as well as in life science. <br/>"

The first is concerned with Harnack inequalities. A Harnack inequality asserts that nonnegative solutions to a partial differential equation satisfy certain boundedness estimates at points, and thus allow one to obtain pointwise estimates from global information. They are used in partial differential equations to obtain estimates on heat kernels and to prove regularity properties of solutions. They are used in probability to obtain transition density estimates and regularity properties of certain stochastic processes. The principal investigator will investigate when one can obtain Harnack inequalities for functions related to non-local operators. The operators in question have an integral term and correspond to processes with jumps. The second area of research concerns uniqueness for the solutions of stochastic differential equations arising from population models in mathematical biology. These equations describe the limit of branching diffusion processes as the number of particles increases, the mass of each particle decreases, and the branching rate increases. The branching rate and the diffusion mechanism for a particle are allowed to depend on all other particles in the system. Branching diffusions are used as models of population dynamics for a large variety of species. The equations that result are typically either infinite dimensional, degenerate, or both. The principal investigator will continue his work on proving uniqueness for these equations. <br/> It has been known for a long time that many systems in the physical and biological sciences can be modeled by stochastic processes. More recently it has been discovered that many financial and economic systems can also be so modeled. To investigate more complex systems, new types of random processes have arisen. To give an example, stock prices are often viewed as depending on a continuous random process, Brownian motion. Yet the fluctuations of stock prices often have sudden jumps, resulting from wars, new discoveries, etc. Thus it is essential to also study stochastic processes with jumps. When studying population models, one expects that the behavior of the population will be qualitatively different depending on whether the population is large or whether it is small. The research of the principal investigator is primarily concerned with two types of stochastic processes, ones with jumps, as in the stock market example, and ones concerning systems that can degenerate, as in the population example. Some of the questions that are being investigated are whether there is only one solution to the equation and whether the solution has sufficient regularity to be useful in providing new information for the model. <br/>"

This project is to investigate various limit laws for additive functionals associated to Markov processes. The recent study shows that the asymptotic magnitudes of additive functionals of a Harris recurrent Markov process are measured by the partial Green functions. The progress suggests further questions and establishments in broader situations. The project lists four areas in which the limit laws of related additive functionals will be studied under this research. As the first step toward the general theory, the investigator will look for relations between weak and strong laws for additive functionals. Specifically, the investigator will study the limit theorems for additive functionals of diffusion processes and for the local times embedded in various norm spaces, and the strong laws for occupation times arising from interacting particle systems. <br/>The significance of this study is also due to its connections to some important problems. The limit laws for additive functionals have been extensively applied to computer simulation and control theory. In general, additive functionals describe random accumulations --- in particular, the capital accumulations of investors in market environment. The study of additive functionals arising from particle system will lead to better understanding of population growth and migration of various species, and of the spreading process of certain diseases. Such models can be viewed as random system evolving in time and this project is about the long term behaviors of these systems. This research could achieve: 1) progress in the general theory of the limit laws for additive functionals; 2) developments of technologies and tools for study of additive functionals; 3) solutions to the problems raised from some practically interesting models.<br/>"

The investigator's research concerns stochastic models associated with the evolution of dilute gases and the formation of solids. As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. Roughly speaking, one shows that after a suitable scaling, the particle density of a dilute gas (respectively, the boundary surface of a solid) converges to a solution of the Boltzmann equation (respectively, Hamilton-Jacobi equation). Probabilistically, such a convergence is a law of large numbers and its corresponding central limit theorem provides us with some vital information about the microscopic model under the study. <br/> Solids form through growth processes which take place at the surface. Imagine an already formed nucleus to which further material sticks from the ambient atmosphere. The process of the attachment is a function of a huge variety of growth mechanisms depending on the materials involved, their temperature, composition, etc. Following the tradition of statistical mechanics, one studies simplified models which nevertheless captures some of the essential physics. Such simplified models are proved to be useful in understanding the intricate formation of solids. It turns out that these models describe other phenomena such as the spread of infected cells in a tissue, the effect of impurity in the evolution of a fluid, etc. The investigator's research concerns the interplay between the microscopic growth rules and the macroscopic shape of the surface of a solid."

This includes diverse phenomena such as the spread of disease in a population, the growth patterns in a forest fire, as well as the fracture analysis of metals such as those found in aircraft.

The primary questions include existence and stability of stationary solutions in response to a constant or periodically varying input. The proposal also has an educational component; see below.<br/><br/>Traditionally, many physical systems are modeled with a diffusion process. It is often the case that the medium in which the diffusion occurs possesses certain inhomogeneities (e.g. an electron moving in an allow, waves diffusing in rocks underground, etc).

A recent technique for analyzing a class of such networks allows to view the population dynamics as a certain diffusion process. The PI proposes to extend this technique to a wider class of neuronal models, including a feedback (adaptation) mechanism.  The results will be applied to specific neurobiological problems, such as localization of moving sound sources and contrast adaptation in vision.  The third component in the proposal is educational.

Varadhan<br/><br/>The main theme of the conference will be important recent results<br/>and outstanding problems in the fields of representation theory<br/>of finite and infinite dimensional Lie and super-Lie groups, and<br/>its applications to quantum computing, geometry, physics, and<br/>differential equations, the different areas being unified under<br/>the over-arching theme of symmetry manifested in geometric<br/>actions of groups and their representations. The speakers will be<br/>internationally recognized researchers in these fields and the<br/>audience is expected to be a mixture of senior researchers in<br/>these fields together with advanced graduate students, postdocs<br/>and junior faculty who aspire to make or already are making<br/>important contributions to these fields. There will be travel<br/>funds made available to select participants of the latter group<br/>with a special emphasis on women and underrepresented<br/>minorities. It should be pointed out that four of the twelve<br/>speakers are women. The background to the conference consists of<br/>the work on supersymmetry pioneered by the physicists such as<br/>Zumino, and Ferrara (both speakers at the conference), and the<br/>work of the mathematicians Kac, Moody, and others who brought<br/>focus to infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications<br/>to quantum field theory. In the 1990's the group theoretic point<br/>of view was applied successfully to the theory of meromorphic<br/>differential equations and their moduli. Very recently important<br/>new progress has been made by the development of a supersymmetric<br/>Mackey theory and its applications to super particle<br/>classification, by work on differential Galois group theory of<br/>difference equations, and by the work on the foundations of<br/>super-geometry.<br/><br/>Symmetry is one of the most fundamental and useful notions in<br/>both mathematics and theoretical physics. For example it explains<br/>the mysteries of the periodic table of chemical elements such as<br/>why hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. An example of<br/>symmetry is the following; consider an ordinary square made with<br/>wire, rotate it 90 degrees about its center and notice it comes<br/>back onto itself although the molecules of the wire have<br/>moved. Do it again, you still get the same square. When you do it<br/>the fourth time, i.e., you rotate it 360 degrees the molecules of<br/>the wire come back to where they started. In mathematical<br/>language this says that &#147;the cyclic group of order 4&#148; is<br/>the symmetry group of the square. It is a wonder that the notion<br/>of symmetry and group can be extended and enriched to explain<br/>complicated sub-atomic physical phenomena as well as solve<br/>fundamental problems in mathematics coming from areas such as<br/>cryptography. The symmetries to be considered in this conference<br/>are part of this same story. Of perhaps particular interest is<br/>the theoretical notion of supersymmetry used in the study of<br/>sub-particle physics. The founder of this notion, B. Zumino, will<br/>speak at this conference. It is presently a theoretical<br/>hypothesis that many believe to be true but which awaits<br/>experimental verification. It is one of the main goals at the<br/>European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva to use its<br/>multi-billion dollar Hadron Collider which comes on line in 2008<br/>to experimentally establish the supersymmetry hypothesis.

Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such  RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow one to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and  reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place.<br/><br/><br/>The primary focus of the proposed research is the long term behavior of RWRE (random walks in random environments). More precisely, one looks at random walks on thed-dimensional lattice, whose transition probabilities form a random field indexed by the vertices of the lattice. Not only is the RWRE providing a serious mathematical challenge, many of the results proved in this field, especially in the one dimensional case, stand in sharp contrast with the behavior of classical random walk. For example, in dimension 1, subdiffusive behavior and aging phenomena are present, whereas in high dimension one may construct RWRE's with nonzero (averaged) local drift pointing in one direction while the walk drifts away (with positive speed)in the opposite direction. Some of the mathematical challenge emanates from the fact that in the multidimensional case, conditioned on the transition probabilities random field, the RWRE is not reversible. This precludes the use of much of the available theory of homogenization, and requires the development of new techniques, most notably through the use of regeneration times and of renormalization ideas. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers including Bolthausen, Sznitman, Varadhan, Zerner, and the PI, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Among these one notes the existence of 0-1 laws, laws of large numbers in full generality, transience and recurrence criteria, the existence (or non-existence) of sub-diffusive behavior for high dimension, and the behavior of RWRE's in mixing (as opposed to i.i.d.)environments. One direction of intensive study will be the extension of existing renormalization techniques, in order to fully resolve the perturbative regime of RWRE."

The project considers theoretical and computational aspects associated with possibly non-regular patterns in non-Markovian sequences. Previous work by the PI has shown the existence and uniqueness of optimal Markovian structures to keep track of the number of matches with a given pattern in a random sequence. At a theoretical level, the project aims to identify ergodic Markovian structures in embeddings that result in non-ergodic behavior due to small perturbations, and to use these ergodic structures to characterize the asymptotic distribution of the number of matches with a pattern in a non-Markovian sequence. It also compares the entropy of the optimal Markovian embedding of a non-Markovian sequence with that of the original sequence. At a computational level, the PI aims to apply generating function techniques in conjunction with Markovian embeddings to characterize the joint asymptotic distribution of the number of matches with several patterns. The PI also aims to quantify the error in approximating the number of matches with a pattern in a sequence of a moderate size with that of a Binomial distribution. A secondary goal of the project is to develop a method for the symbolic specification of branching processes that will represent the solutions of non-linear o.d.e.'s probabilistically and to explore new connections between these and the analysis of patterns in non-Markovian sequences.<br/><br/>The analysis of patterns in random sequences lies at the core of several emerging fields such as computational biology, security systems, speech recognition and text mining. Random sequences of characters are used to model diverse phenomena ranging from written text to genomic sequences to audit files. In these, exceptional patterns, i.e., over- or under-represented words, may provide a great deal of insight or knowledge. For instance, a widely used heuristic is that overrepresented patterns in DNA may be key for gene expression whereas underrepresented patterns may interfere with this process. As another example, hackers leave traces of their intrusions into secured databases in audit files and unusual patterns may be used to warn of potential security breaches. However, one cannot assess how truly exceptional a pattern is without a bona fide statistical model of the text in which it is immersed. The prevalent models cannot accommodate the long-range correlations present in most types of text. For example, the characters occurring in written text or audit files follow syntax rules and, in RNA sequences, palindromic structures induced by base-pairing convey genome-wide correlations. Unfortunately, the available techniques to assess how exceptional a pattern is, cannot systematically handle the more realistic models. Furthermore, the PI has recently shown that the widely used paradigm that the number of matches with a pattern in a long text is approximately Gaussian distributed does not necessarily apply when long-range correlations are present. Due to these considerations the PI aims to develop new qualitative and quantitative tools to address systematically the occurrence of highly complex patterns under more realistic statistical models of text.<br/>"

Wiener Chaos decomposition is a stochastic  analog of the classical Fourier method and is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic equations, from both analytical and numerical points of view. In particular, Wiener Chaos decomposition is the key component of several new numerical algorithms for nonlinear filtering  and the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in domains is necessary for  development of  a complete theory, similar to the one for deterministic partial differential equations. In addition to purely theoretical results about existence and uniqueness of solutions, this analysis leads to new  numerical methods for such equations. Methods of statistical inference make it possible to relate an abstract equation  to a concrete problem from applications. Unlike finite-dimensional systems, a consistent estimation in a stochastic partial differential equation is possible even when both the observation time and the amplitude of noise are fixed.<br/><br/>Stochastic partial differential equations  are both an interesting mathematical object and an effective  modelling tool in various branches of applied science, such as ecology,  finance, meteorology, and navigation.  Equations studied in this project can describe, for example, the term structure of interest rates, the propagation of an oil spill in the ocean, and the motion of the target on the radar screen. The research objectives of the project are to study mathematical properties of stochastic partial differential equations and to develop effective computational and statistical methods for relating an equation to  a model. The educational objective of the project is to increase  understanding of stochastic partial differential equations among the students and researchers both inside and outside of the mathematical community.

To get an estimate on the lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the SLE boundary, the asymptotic behavior of normalized (pre-)Schwarzian derivatives for the SLE backward flows is employed. The normalized (pre-)Schwarzian derivatives of SLE maps with higher order terms are continuous square integrable martingales with second moment obeying the Duplantier duality and they have correlations that decay exponentially in the hyperbolic distance. This method allows one to make a formal argument for a lower bound. Makarov's law of iterated logarithm makes it possible to compare harmonic measure to a Hausdorff measure associated with a logarithmico-exponential function. The goal of this project is to get the exact estimate for Makarov's law of iterated logarithm for SLE and compare harmonic measure to a Hausdorff measure with a best possible measure function.<br/><br/>Since Stochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE) was introduced by Schramm, a lot of works have been done in this area by mathematicians and physicists in various areas like mathematical physics, probability theory and complex analysis.

For example, in dimension 1, <br/>subdiffusive behavior and aging phenomena are present, whereas in high <br/>dimension one may construct RWRE's with nonzero (averaged) local drift <br/>pointing in one direction while the walk drifts away (with positive speed) <br/>in the opposite direction. Some of the mathematical challenge emanates <br/>from the fact that in the multidimensional case, conditioned on the <br/>transition probabilities random field, the RWRE is not reversible. This <br/>precludes the use of much of the available theory of homogenization, and <br/>requires the development of new techniques, most notably through the use <br/>of regeneration times and of renormalization ideas. In spite of rapid <br/>progress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers <br/>including Bolthausen, Sznitman, Varadhan, Zerner, and the PI, many <br/>fundamental questions remain unanswered. Among these one notes the <br/>existence of 0-1 laws, laws of large numbers in full generality, <br/>transience and recurrence criteria, the relation between quenched and <br/>annealed large deviations behavior, the existence (or non-existence) of <br/>sub-diffusive behavior for high dimension, and the behavior of RWRE's in <br/>mixing (as opposed to i.i.d.) environments.<br/><br/><br/>Random walks are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by <br/>mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as <br/>diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. <br/>Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at <br/>all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a <br/>random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). <br/>Such RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media <br/>in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing <br/>because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the <br/>other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are <br/>not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is <br/>to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow to make <br/>provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that <br/>such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link <br/>naturally to the study of trapping models and reinforced random walks. <br/>While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have <br/>recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and <br/>RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of <br/>contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical <br/>background and tools are in place.<br/>"

These include (1) problems related to the hot-spots conjecture of Jeff Rauch for Neumann eigenfunctions and counterparts originally raised by the PI for conditioned Brownian motion and (2) problems related to the sharp spectral gap bounds conjecture for Schrodinger operators.  The problems in (1) and (2) are formulated in terms of survival time probabilities for Brownian motion which are then reduced to the study of finite dimensional distributions functions. The probabilistic formulations are more general than the original conjectures but much more natural from the point of view of the stochastic analysis ideas and techniques suggested in this proposal. The conjectures that motivate these problems are well known and very difficult. Any progress on these problems will likely lead to other applications and will be of considerable interest to researchers working on several different areas of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, geometry and probability. Versions of these problems will also be investigated for processes other than Brownian motion such as symmetric stable processes and more general Levy processes.  <br/><br/>It has been known since the beginning of the last century that many physical and biological phenomena can be modeled by random stochastic processes.  Indeed, the classical model of Brownian motion which is at the heart of the problems discussed above was discovered by the British botanist Robert Brown (even earlier) from physical observations of pollen particles suspended in fluids. More recently, stochastic models have been used in many other settings in the physical, biological and social sciences with many sophisticated applications to economic models, and particularly to financial markets. Many of these applications involve stochastic processes which, unlike Brownian motion, do not have continuous trajectories.  The finite dimensional distribution techniques that arise in the problems above came about because of the connections to these more general stochastic processes. <br/><br/>"

This representation, which was recently discovered by LeJan and Sznitman in France, is clearly intrinsic to the structure of the Navier-Stokes equations. While this is not the first attempt to use stochastic methods in connection with the flows associated with the Navier-Stokes equations, it does represent an entirely new direction which has the potential to transcend much of existing theory. Specific problems considered in this proposal seek to provide a better understanding of the role of spatial dimensions, boundary conditions, multi-scaling exponents and singularities, viscosity, homogeneity, isotropy and rotational accelerations, stationary flows and long-time evolution.<br/> The Navier-Stokes equations describe the basic physics governing the motion of fluid in its various forms of air, water, oil, etc. As such these equations play a fundamental role in science and engineering through the modeling of all varieties of fluid flow, from atmospheric and oceanic circulation to the flow of water beneath the earth's surface. Improved understanding of these equations and their solutions is essential to applications which range from tracking climate change and dispersion of contaminants in the Earth's environment, to more stable aerospace and sea vessel designs. The nonlinearity inherent in these equations makes explicit solutions possible only for the simplest of flows. Consequently the development of a more complete understanding of these equations at all physical length scales ranks among the most important outstanding problems of contemporary mathematical physics<br/>"

Rigorous unconditional results about the geometric features of lattice-based FPP models are hard to come by, largely due to technical difficulties associated with the anisotropy of the underlying lattice. Models of Euclidean FPP take place on graphs constructed from a homogeneous Poisson process and enjoy complete statistical invariance under all rigid motions. In this sense, Euclidean FPP is a natural setting in which to study geometric properties of FPP. One objective of this proposal is to refine, for Euclidean FPP, existing estimates of key fluctuation exponents associated with these models with the ultimate goal of proving interesting qualitative results. Another goal is to exploit a certain re-scaling relation that holds for Euclidean FPP to obtain results about the stochastic monotonicity of passage time viewed as a function of distance. Other closely related open questions under investigation concern issues such as how massively a local perturbation of the Poisson particle configuration affects minimizing paths and how far ""parallel"" geodesics typically travel before coalescence. In Stochastic Ising models, rules of dynamics interact with a random initial state to produce a system that evolves with time. The state at any particular time is a configuration of +/-1 spins associated with the sites of some regular lattice; the configuration at time 0 makes the spins i.i.d. random variables. For the homogeneous ferromagnetic models of this proposal, the dynamics tend to produce increasing agreement of spins for neighboring sites as time elapses. Key matters of investigation concern how quickly and in what sense the system evolves to a limiting state as well as various percolation properties of the configuration as a function of time. <br/> Disordered systems are a large class of probabilistic models generally motivated by problems arising in condensed matter physics and materials science. First-passage percolation and other closely related models have served as a mathematical model for phenomena as seemingly diverse as properties of randomly porous media (such as aquifers), the growth of cancerous tumors, and the propagation of cracks through brittle material. Ising models capture the basic features of magnetized materials. The proposed work aims at a rigorous understanding of some of the many fundamental mathematical properties of these models.<br/>"

In the area of asymptotic enumeration, he will obtain approximations to coefficients of multivariate meromorphic generating functions that are asymptotically valid as the multi-index goes to infinity in any possible way.  The ultimate goal is to automate this procedure, at least for the class of (multivariate) rational generating functions with nonnegative coefficients. Previous results indicate this may be feasible, or at least may be carried out to some extent.  These results are to be applied to several combinatorial problems in probability theory, including asymptotics for random tilings for the so-called Aztec Diamond configurations and other related tiling ensembles conjectured to produce polynomial phase boundaries.  In the area of random processes with reinforcement, he will investigate the rate at which processes of stochastic approximation type converge to their ultimate limiting behavior.  In particular, the slow convergence of vertex-reinforced random walks and uniformly reinforced social network models to their limits is to be explained by giving quantitative bounds on the probabilities of deviating from this behavior at finite times.  It is hoped that this will both explain simulation data and give a theoretical basis for the use of these models.  Among the other miscellaneous problems are several problems in economic game theory and one concerning asymptotics of solutions to functional equations.<br/><br/> Recent progress in computer algebra has made many types of computation automated which once were done only by skilled practitioners.  Nowadays, a few messy equations are no barrier at all to a complete theoretical and practical understanding of a problem.  The most tangible result of the asymptotic enumeration project will be the transformation of a formerly difficult type of computation into a straightforward, though messy, series of steps.  Applications reach far beyond the motivating examples of random tilings, and include queuing theory, signal processing and combinatorial enumeration.  Reinforcement processes arise most commonly in three application areas:  formal models of learning, population biology, and economic behavior. In each of these areas, the results of the project will shed light on when and why the theoretically predicted limiting behaviors are not observed in the timeframes of real applications.<br/>"

As a second example, work on DNA sequences of interest to biotechnology and health uses Poisson approximations from probability theory.

A remarkable technique, introduced by Charles Stein at Stanford, offers hope of better quantifying the accuracy of such procedures. Stein's method has proven successful in applications to DNA sequencing, but the technique is largely unexplored. The investigator plans to extend the scope and applicability of this method.

Under the simplest choice of measure on these surfaces, the uniform measure for a fixed boundary, the large-scale shapes taken by these surfaces has begun to be worked out by the PI and Okounkov, using techniques from PDEs, analysis and tropical geometry. This model is essentially the only mathematically 'solved' model of random interfaces.

For these reasons it is worth understanding this model better, and also worth looking for generalizations.<br/><br/>We are studying mathematical models of crystal surfaces. On an atomic scale, the surface of a crystal, such as a salt crystal or diamond, is rough and 'random', but at large scales it is typically smooth and facetted. How these large scale features arise from the microscopic interactions of the atoms comprising the crystal is, to a large extent, still mysterious. However we can make models of crystal surfaces which are computationally tractable in a mathematical sense, and display the same behavior as real crystals: in particular they display facetting and large-scale shape formation. By studying these models we hope to gain understanding not just of crystal surfaces but of the general phenomenon of how local interactions among a large number of constituents can develop into large-scale behavior."

The theoretical problems are concerned with spectral properties of large dimensional random matrices. More precisely, four of the main objectives of the program are: 1) further develop new covariance estimation methods;  2) further our understanding of the spectral properties of relevant large random matrices; 3) find and contribute to areas of application where this high-dimensional statistics framework is relevant; 4) train graduate students in high-dimensional statistics and make undergraduate students at least aware of possible pitfalls of classical methods and of better alternatives when available. More specifically, statisticians are now often faced with ""n by p"" data matrices X, for which p, the number of variables recorded per observations, is of the same order of magnitude as n, the number of recorded observations, and p and n are both large. The sample   covariance matrix computed from this data is of great importance to a number of applications, as it underlies widely used methods like principal components analysis. However, the theoretical results which underlie the method, classically developed in the ""small p and large n"" setting, fail to apply in the ""large n and large p"" setting just described. Hence, a thorough study of sample covariance matrices in this setting is needed. Eigenvalues of such large dimensional matrices are of particular interest. The investigator plans to launch a multi-pronged effort to get at various kinds of properties of these objects: for instance, he plans to develop theoretical results that will allow inferential work to be done from computation of extreme eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices, develop new methods of estimation of the whole covariance matrix, and also work on the impact of naively plugging-in the sample covariance matrix as a proxy for the population covariance in certain optimization problems which depend on this latter parameter. An effort will be made to try and apply this theoretical work to real-world problems, both to raise awareness in applied communities about the pitfalls associated with high-dimensional covariance matrices, and to shape the models that will be studied to be of most relevance to applied researchers.<br/><br/>Technological progress allows us to store and use massive amounts of data about many aspects of our daily lives. An interesting problem is to use the data to understand how certain traits depend on each other. In the stock market, we might be interested in how the behavior of one stock affects the behavior of another stock; understanding all these interrelationships leads to having a measure of the risk taken by investing in portfolios that use the corresponding stocks. Statisticians have a number of tools to deal with all these interrelationships. We can discover ways to look at the data so that, even if all interrelationships are small or weak, so each trait ""should"" not help us learn too much about any other trait, we might still find combinations of the traits that carry enormous amounts of information. We also know what typical values for these combinations are, so we might be able to detect unusual features in the data set by looking at it the right way. Those statistical techniques have very wide applications in various fields of science, ranging from climatology to genetics, image recognition, finance etc... Thousands of research papers are published each year that use these techniques. However, the theory that underlies these statistical techniques was created in an era where massive datasets just did not exist. This research project is focusing on theories and their applications that are better suited to handle our current massive datasets. The applications should allow us to see structure where the classical tools fail to see any and tell us when there is no structure when the classical tools tell us there is. We also have increasing evidence that our standard tools give us often very inaccurate results about our standard measures of risk or amount of information carried in combination of traits. It seems that risks might be underestimated and amount of information might be overestimated. Part of this research program will be dedicated to measuring how inaccurate the classical results are for large datasets, how much practical predictions are affected, and how a more relevant theory can be used for correcting these inaccuracies.<br/>"

Limit theorems play a fundamental role in the development of probability and statistics. The principal investigator continues his study in this direction in general, focusing on self-normalized limit theorems in particular. The investigator intends to systematically study moderate deviations for self-normalized sums of independent random variables, for Hotelling's t-statistic and for studentized U-statistic. The objective is to establish a Cramer type moderate deviation theorem under a finite third moment condition. Since the self-normalized moderate deviations require few moment conditions, they not only extend classical limit theorems but also provide much wider applicability to other fields, particularly to statistics. The study should also help us better understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since the t-statistic and U-statistic are their building blocks. Another area where limit theorems prove useful is the study of the real zeros of random algebraic and trigonometric polynomials. Such polynomials with random coefficients arise in many disciplines and their behavior is of interest to statisticians, engineers, economists, and mathematicians. The primary focus of the second topic is on estimating lower tail and small ball probabilities for Gaussian processes. These types of probabilities often arise in estimating the chances of rare events occurring in areas where such events are of fundamental importance such as weather prediction, natural disaster prediction and economic indices. One of the objectives is to develop new methods of estimating small ball and lower tail probabilities. The focus is specifically on small ball probabilities of the Brownian sheet in high dimensions and lower tail probabilities for stationary Gaussian processes. The investigator also intends to study basic sample properties for a newly introduced family of Gaussian processes which have the same scaling and time inversion properties as the Brownian motion but are infinitely differentiable. It is believed that this new family of Gaussian processes would prove useful in many other fields as mathematical models. <br/> This project is devoted to the study of two topics: (i) limit theorems in probability and statistics, and (ii) lower tail and small ball probabilities of Gaussian processes. Limit theorems play a fundamental role in the development of probability and statistics. It is hoped that the first part of this research may lead to the development of a self-normalized limit theory in probability and statistics, while the second part of the research could provide significant new knowledge about Gaussian random processes as well as about our random environments."

The second topic deals with a generalization of the classical theory of lattice paths on the plane, where now the paths lie on a Riemann surface. The third topic concerns the subject of sign-balance, i.e., the difference between the number of even and number of odd permutations in certain sets of permutations.

The fourth topic concerns the saturation conjecture for Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, recently proved by Knutson-Tao and others. There are many new avenues of investigation opened up by recent work in this area. The fifth topic is the theory of k-triangulations, a generalization of ordinary triangulations of a polygon. A recent breakthrough of Jakob Jonsson suggests several new open problems and conjectures. Finally the proposer plans to continue his research on increasing and decreasing subsequences, another subject for which recent work has suggested a host of new directions of research.<br/><br/>The proposal deals with a number of topics in algebraic combinatorics, a field which connects arrangements and patterns (such as jigsaw puzzles, computer chip design, and airplane boarding systems) with sophisticated abstract techniques.

The proposer plans to work in six specific areas in which recent work points to the possibility of much further progress. These areas involve such ideas as using symmetry to simplify complicated objects, extending the notion of paths on a plane surface, decomposing a geometric figure into simpler pieces, and finding patterns in a list of objects. Progress on these very natural questions should have many applications, both within mathematics and to practical problems of scheduling, ranking, optimization, etc.<br/>"

Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory. A combined, focused effort is expected to bring new insights toward a better understanding of the participants' respective fields of research, which - while related and occasionally overlapping - are not identical and often employ different perspectives.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics encompassing the methods and the problems described above has recently entered a period of rapid growth. In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

Special attention is given to application areas which include the financial and commodities markets and teletraffic networks such as the World Wide Web.

Statistical issues include coping with changes of methods implied by non-standard data features such as long range dependence, lack of existence of moments and correlations, and dependencies which cannot be captured by linear structures.  Probabilistic models will be formulated and studied in an attempt to qualitatively explain observed features of the data.    The increasing instrumentation of both financial markets and broadband data networks makes possible the collection of huge quantities of data.  Examination of some of the data reveals features that classical statistics and probability models are not used to dealing with and hence, this project has a dual purpose:  (a) To develop statistical tools which use the data to more reliably fit models and make predictions; (b) To build probability models which provide qualitative insights into the nature of the system under investigation.  For example, modern broadband networks exhibit characteristics much different from what is predicted by classical models.  A question which may be answered by this research is, ""when is it economically advisable to add service capacity to the network?""."

Intersections of Brownian sample paths were first studied by  Dvoretzky, Erdos and Kakutani more than forty years ago. Intersections of random walk  paths are in some ways harder to analyze; Lawler's (1991) book presents most of what  is known about them.  The proposer's approach to these problems is motivated by his  recent work, which shows that certain sample paths (e.g. of Brownian motion ) are  ""equivalent"" to certain ""random Cantor sets"" constructed via a branching process, in  the sense that the same deterministic sets are hit by these two types of random sets  with positive probability.  The remaining problems have close ties to ergodic theory;  they involve the Hausdorff dimension of measures on Galton Watson trees and on  invariant sets for expanding maps.       It is proposed to study several problems in probability theory involving  intersections of random paths in space.

In particular, the investigator will prove the existence of stable, unstable and center manifolds near each stationary point on the manifold.

The proposed research falls into   three parts. Part I deals with degenerate diffusions and their impact on linear partial   differential equations. In their recent work, the investigators have proved a very general   Hormander-type hypoellipticity theorem for second-order linear partial differential   operators.

The proposed project involves further applications of this new technique, focusing on two main directions:<br/><br/>1)  Developing a new approach to proving a certain type of quantitative central limit theorem ``with high probability''. For example, a random projection of a large collection of high-dimensional data points is ``usually'' approximately Gaussian; the empirical spectral measure of a large Wigner-type random matrix is ``usually'' close to the semi-circle law.  The proposed project involves using the method of infinitesimal exchangeable pairs in combination with other tools of theoretical probability, e.g. measure concentration and entropy bounds, to prove quantitative versions of statements of this type. Quantifying such statements leads not only to finer information about convergence and dimensional dependence, but also allows applications of the relevant results in fixed (high) dimensions, which is frequently important in applications to geometry, statistics, and computer science.<br/><br/>2) Continue the PI's study of value distributions of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.  In earlier work, the method of infitesimal exchangeable pairs was used to identify a previously unobserved connection between value distributions of eigenfunctions and the behavior of their gradients.  Partial results have been obtained in certain examples, namely on large-dimensional spheres and tori; the PI aims to develop a more complete understanding of these examples as well as exploring new applications of previous results in the high-eigenvalue limit on fixed manifolds.<br/><br/>Over the past four decades, Stein's method has proved to be a powerful tool for showing that certain randomly constructed objects can be well understood by approximating by classical probability distributions, and giving quantitative information about how good these approximations are. <br/>The PI has introduced a new version of the method which can be used to take advantage of the presence of ""continuous symmetries"" (e.g., the symmetries of the sphere as opposed to those of the cube) in a problem. <br/>This new approach has already been successfully applied in studying Riemannian manifolds, convex bodies in Euclidean space, and the compact classical matrix groups, in some cases to prove results rather different from those previously known, and in some cases shedding new light on old results.  The proposed project includes applications in convex geometry, spectral geometry, random matrix theory, and statistics. Accordingly, progress made in the proposed research will cut across disciplines as well as adding to the existing infrastructure of available techniques in probability.  It is expected that the new techniques developed in the course of the project will be widely applicable to other problems in mathematics.  In particular, these techniques will likely be useful in analyzing systems in which there are two levels of randomness, and there is a ""typical"" behavior for the system, which occurs conditioned on most realizations of one of the types of randomness; such situations occur frequently in mathematics and statistical physics."

The main difference from the traditional approach for N diffusing particles is that the   fluctuations will be represented by ""correlated"" Brownian motions (representing the   fluctuation forces), where the strength of the correlations depends on the distance of  two   given particles and a parameter, the so-called correlation length. Consequently, the SPDEs   will depend on the correlation length as a parameter. Macroscopic and central limit   theorems are expected, as the correlation length tends to zero. Further, the investigator   will study the qualitative properties of the SPDEs. Homogeneous, isotropic and stationary   random fields shall be derived as solutions of the SPDEs, and the spectral analysis of the   random fields in terms of the coefficients of the SPDEs shall be conducted.   Mathematically, the proposed work will build a bridge between 4 different areas of   mathematics, namely particle systems, SPDEs, random fields and partial differential   equations.   Many physical, biological and economic phenomena consist of a large number of   components. The large number and the rapid changes of the components make an exact   description of the time evolution of all components very difficult , if not impossible.   Examples are turbulence, chemical reactions, diffusion, spreading of diseases (viruses,   bacteria), population growth, environmental pollution, climate, weather, financial markets   etc. To build a mathematical model of those phenomena, the real world systems of atoms,   molecules, viruses etc. are replaced by random particle systems whose time evolution can   serve as a good predictor for  the real world systems. A more traditional model for the   same phenomena are macroscopic (deterministic) partial differential equations, many of   which, more than  a century ago, became the ma in theoretical tools in different areas of   physics and engineering and also, more recently, in some areas of the biosciences and   economics. Such an equation typically describes ""how much mass (of some matter) is at a   given place at a given time."" Mathematically, most of those macroscopic equations can be   derived from particle systems by a limit procedure, assuming that the number of particles   becomes infinite and their respective masses become very small, and that the motion of   particles is always statistically uncorrelated. This derivation also explains why the   macroscopic equations often do not correctly predict the time evolution of the real world   systems, but that in the long run they appear to be an average of many observations.   Macroscopic equations, however,  are easier to compute than particle systems. The   investigator will extend the model of macroscopic partial differential equations to a model   of  mezoscopic (stochastic) partial differential equations. The mezoscopic equations shall   be derived from particle systems in the same way as the macroscopic equations, but under   more realistic assumptions on the particle systems, namely that the motion of particles is   statistically correlated, when they are close to one another.  As a result the mezoscopic   equations should be in better agreement with observations than the macroscopic   equations, while preserving the computational simplicity of the latter ones. Moreover, the   macroscopic equations will appear as the  limiting case of the mezoscopic equations.   Mezoscopic equations will have diverse applications in physical chemistry, the biosciences,   fluid mechanics and financial markets."

In North America much emphasis has been on stochastic modeling in particle systems:  in particular, interacting particles and so-called ""superprocesses"".   In the latter area, attempts have been made to develop physically meaningful stochastic equations for the distribution of diffusing and branching particles.  So far, rigorous stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE's) for the mass distribution have been obtained only in very special cases (space dimension one), due to the very singular character of the noise (a result of the independence assumptions on the level of particles).  The P.I. on the American side (P. Kotelenez) recently developed a new approach to  SPDE's  which leads to physically meaningful and mathematically solvable SPDE's in any space dimension.  Since this approach starts with stochastic  ordinary differential equations for the positions and momenta of the particles and then derives the SPDE's as mezoscopic equations from the microscopic equations, the applicability of these equations in the physical sciences is immediate.  Rigorous results    have been obtained for the case of long range interaction and mass    conservation.  Together with the Ukrainian investigators, who have    expertise  in both finite and infinite dimensions, we wil l attempt to    extend this approach to a large class of physically meaningful equations     for interacting and diffusing particle systems with short range     interaction and annihilation.  Another focus of the proposed research is      on so-called anticipating  integration, arising in elliptic equations and     certain integral equations.  Anticipating integration  actually originated in Kiev and has been given much attention in Western Europe (where it is    called the ""Skorokhod integral"") in recent years but much less has been     done in North America.

A goal of this work is to gain potential new insights of the influence of geometry on the bottom of the spectrum.

These can be studied by diffusion theory and the influence of the geometry of the manifold on these quantities can be determined.

It is concerned with the development of such models, the study of their properties and the investigation of systematic techniques for fitting them to data.  Also considered are the large-sample properties of the estimated model parameters and the performance of model-based forecasts.  Many of the standard tools of linear time series analysis (e.g. the sample autocovariance function) have substantially different properties when the underlying process is nonlinear and this must be taken into account when they are used in conjunction with nonlinear models.  Nonlinear continuous time ARMA models have been found useful in the modeling of financial data.  Efficient estimation for these processes and for non-Gaussian and multivariate extensions of these are to be investigated to allow for the observed heavy-tailed behavior of financial time series and to permit the study of the dependence between related financial time series.  An alternative promising approach to the analysis of financial time series is to use all-pass linear filters driven by non-Gaussian noise as a possible alternative to the use of nonlinear models.  Integer-valued time series are of wide occurrence, for example the weekly numbers of accidents or diagnosed cases of some disease.  As for the models considered above, the objective is to develop a systematic approach to the modelling and forecasting of such data.<br/><br/>In the last ten years there has been a steadily increasing realization that non-linear time series models provide much better representations of many empirically observed time series than the classical linear models.  Many of the properties of non-linear models are however not yet understood and there is a need for the development of new models accompanied by efficient model-fitting procedures.  At the same time there has been a surge of interest in continuous-time time series models, partly as a result of the very successful application of stochastic differential equation models to problems in finance, exemplified by the derivation of the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and its generalizations.  This proposal is concerned with the development of non-linear models in both discrete and continuous time with particular emphasis on the application of these models to the representation and forecasting of financial data.  Another class of time series which arises frequently in applications and for which systematic analysis is relatively undeveloped are those in which the observations are integer-valued.  For these series also a systematic approach to model-building and forecasting is proposed.<br/>"

These results                   will be incorporated into a new approach to Markov decisions                    processes where the state space is extended to include the                      decision set into the overall Markovian structure. Stability                    properties of such general processes will then be established in                quite complex environments.                                                          Probabilistic modelling and statistical estimation                         techniques encompass two separate parts of the same activity.                   The first part endeavors to describe, in manageable terms, models               of real and often complex systems in such a way that the inherent               randomness in the system is properly represented.  The second                   endeavors to use these models, and data gathered to describe real               systems, in such a way that one can estimate the parameters that                actually describe what is happening in practice.  In the                        modelling part of this project the investigators will study                     important models in operations research, time series, and finance               and economics, with a focus on developing methods for stability                 of such systems.  In the statistics part of the proposal, the                   investigators will look at a number of computer intensive ways of               estimating parameters with a goal of finding methods which give                 good estimates quickly."

This proposal concerns the development and application of new methodologies motivated by problems in these diverse applications areas.  The investigator will carry out research in five main aspects of the theory of stochastic models which can benefit all of these applications:  (i) Methods of applying coupling theory and minorization theory to the development of perfect sampling strategies; (ii) Methods of computational evaluation of the rates at which models achieve a stable regime; (iii) Properties of stochastically ordered or partially stochastically ordered models, especially in continuous time, for both diffusions and jump-continuous processes; (iv) Robustness of model behavior against perturbations in assumptions; and  (v) Use of non-Markovian and other general stationary processes in describing systems and developing algorithms.<br/><br/>Overall this project can be expected to deliver new methodologies which will provide a significant theoretical underpinning, and methods of speedup, to simulation and modeling methodologies currently being used more and more widely in solving problems in areas as diverse as manufacturing plant design, atmospheric and climatology modeling, and economic theory.  In the analysis of complex network, queueing and storage systems, applications envisaged include the currently high-priority area of manufacturing systems, and more general queueing systems with feedback.  High dimensional spatial models being used for the understanding of environmental issues should also be faster to analyze using some of the proposed methods.  The development of simulation approaches for non-linear time-series models in this context can be expected to provide new results in models of physical, social and economic phenomena.<br/>"

In particular he investigates the problem called small deviations. The PI is also working on extreme value theory for Gaussian random fields motivated by an application to nonparametric statistics. The problem of small deviations is related to the behavior of the probability that a stochastic process stays in a small neighborhood of the origin. As the neighborhood shrinks, this probability clearly tends to zero --- the question is at what rate? The PI calculates this rate for various processes, including the storage process that is used to model the amount of water available in a dam. Motivation of the other problem comes from nonparametric statistics. One of the main problem in modern nonparametric smoothing is concerned with finding the best smooth curve approximating the data. Chaudhuri & Marron (1999) proposed a tool for data exploration called SiZer. The visual display of SiZer, can be viewed as a summary of a large number (hundreds) of hypothesis test results. For reasonable statistical inference, care needs to be taken about the multiple comparison issue. The current implementations of SiZer is not addressing the issue of multiple testing adequately. To correct this one needs to study the distribution of the maximum of a particular discrete nonstationary Gaussian random field. <br/><br/>The PI works on two major problems, small deviations for stochastic processes and extreme value theory for a particular random field. The area of small deviations is relatively new with major developments starting in the 1990's. The solution of the small deviation problems helps us understand the nature of certain rare events when the variability of a random process is much less then expected. Applications of this theory are currently pursued by many researchers. The investigator develops a new application of small deviation techniques in storage theory. The proposed extreme value problem is directly motivated by a statistical application. It aims at improving the performance of the data analysis tool SiZer. SiZer is currently widely used by many applied scientists. Successful applications of SiZer include internet traffic modeling, climatology and environment, and biology and genetics. Part of this proposal aims at significantly improving the SiZer tool to make it more reliable for applications. <br/><br/><br/>"

Because many new researchers are isolated  from the statistical community, with little or no contact with junior and  senior colleagues in their field, this meeting provides a unique opportunity for new researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contact with one another. We hope that this conference will assist in the professional development of  new researchers, by helping them become full participants in the statistical  profession, and by providing an opportunity for them to act as peer mentors  for each other as they begin their scientific careers.  The ultimate effect of this process is a strengthening of the research base of the statistical  community in North America.   All those attending the conference are expected to actively participate by presenting their current research---either in a talk or displayed in a poster. There will be no parallel sessions. The program also includes several talks by senior statisticians and probabilists actively  involved in the most up-to-date areas of research. These people will be  invited to share their research ideas and enthusiasm for research, and to  provide tactical suggestions on how to build a thriving research program and  succeed in the academic world and larger statistical community."

Specific sample directions of planned research are related to the slicing problem, the Mahler conjecture, the Gaussian correlation conjecture, combinatorial dimensions of classes of functions, singular numbers of random matrices, signal reconstruction (notably, compressed sensing), and links to quantum information theory. A combined, focused effort is expected to bring new insights toward a better understanding of the participants' respective fields of research, which - while related and occasionally overlapping - are not identical and often employ different perspectives.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics encompassing the methods and the problems described above has recently entered a period of rapid growth. In large part this is due to numerous links to other fields such as computer science and mathematical physics. In a nutshell, the wealth of connections between high-dimensional convexity and applications is due to the complexity of the systems (e.g., physical, biological or economical) that one wants to analyze: the large number of free parameters in such systems may be reflected in the large dimension of the mathematical object that serves as a model. Additionally, many results in, say, geometric functional analysis, can be presented as statements about the complexity of high dimensional objects in presence of convexity; this explains the links to computer science. In addition to research per se, a major component of this project is the training of postdocs and graduate students in an integrated research environment. This includes organization of a summer school and of a conference. Workshops and seminars devoted to the project at each institution are also planned. The dynamic growth of the area and wealth of applications makes it an ideal topic of study for graduate students and young researchers, whom we expect to attract. Special attention will be paid to recruiting members of groups under-represented in the field of mathematics."

To accomplish this goal, he proposes to develop new connections between the theory of stochastic processes and ergodic theory, group representations, particularly those induced in the sense of Mackey, and functional analysis.  These general results can be applied in the structural analysis of stationary, self-similar, and isotropic infinitely divisible random fields.  He also intends to continue research on asymptotic independence of stochastic processes, sample path continuity, and multiple stochastic integrals.    Infinitely divisible random processes appear naturally in many areas of theoretical and applied probability, communications, networking, mathematical finance, and statistics.  Roughly speaking, a process is infinitely divisible if its behavior is determined by a large number of mutually independent random factors. Stationarity is a notion describing statistical symmetries of a random process.  Stationary infinitely divisible processes, which may exhibit high variability, are not well understood at present because the traditional methodology of Gaussian processes is not applicable here.  This project is intended to develop tools and methods for analysis of infinitely divisible processes which can be used in modeling of highly variable phenomena."

The moment method has been explored in studying the intersection local times and ranges for about two decades. The classic applications include the existence and weak convergence of intersection local times. In this setting, the power of the moment is fixed. To study the large deviations for these models, however,  one needs to understand the asymptotic behaviors of the moments as the power increases to infinity. In recent years, there have been new development in this direction. The method developed along this line is called high moment asymptotics. Even in its early stage, the method of high moment asymptotics has shown its power in the areas of intersection local times and of the local times of additive Levy processes.<br/><br/>Understanding large deviations for intersection local times and related models is crucial for the applications to Euclidean quantum field theory, the growth of  polymers,  and the polaron problem.

This connection leads to a natural classification of such random  processes and gives a base for their systematic investigation.  A  new approach has been necessary because the ideas and techniques  based on harmonic analysis of square integrable processes have a  very limited use in the infinite variance case.  On the other  hand, many results of the ergodic theory of nonsingular flows  have their natural counterparts in the theory of infinite  variance stationary processes.  For example, the famous Hopf  decomposition of flows into dissipative and conservative parts  permits us to identify and isolate the moving average parts of  the corresponding stationary processes.  Building upon these  connections, structural and path properties of certain important  classes of infinite variance stationary processes will be  investigated.       Stochastic stationarity can be observed in the long-time  behavior of many random phenomena when the same patterns of  behavior occur with time independent frequencies.  For example,  in a noisy communication channel the initial signal is  superimposed with a random noise giving a stationary random  process on the channel's output.  In recent years there has been  a growing interest in the investigating of highly random  (infinite variance) models.  The existing methodology and tools  of harmonic analysis, that have been very successful in the study  of moderately random stationary processes, have shown a very  limited applicability in the infinite variance case.  This  project is intended to establish and explore new connections  between certain classes of infinite variance stationary processes  and the ergodic theory of nonsingular flows.

Large deviation theory is a branch of probability theory                   involving limits of random variables.  It is well known that in                 certain idealized cases, where the random variables are                         independent and identically distributed, that the average of the                sequence converges to the average of the individual random                      variable (in terms of statistics, that the sample average                       converges to the population average).  Large deviation theory                   shows that the probability that the sample average deviates from                the population average by a small amount is exponentially small                 as the sample size increases.

The first problem involves the statistical inference                of a quantity called the extremal index, which is of importance                 to the statistical theory of extremes of dependent data.  The                   second problem involves the study of properties of a two-                       dimensional random measure which records the excursions of high                 levels by a continuous-time stationary process.

One problem is to come up with a coupling for diffusions with degenerate generators given by sums of squares of vector which satisfy Hormander's hypoellipticity condition. A related problem is to give a coupling proof of Moser's Harnack inequality. The principal investigator also uses coupling techniques on Brownian motion on Gromov hyperbolic spaces to estimate eigenvalues and gradients of harmonic functions. The principal investigator also studies relativistic Brownian motion. Finally, the investigator is deriving more results on the behavior of processes with dependence on the past.        The work in the current proposal falls into the general area of Stochastic Analysis. This means the analysis of  randomly evolving phenomena. The portions of this proposal on coupling are related to the smoothness of temperature distributions on surfaces, their rate of convergence to a steady state and the dependence of these on the geometry of the surface. The problems on processes whose behavior depends on the past have potential applications to economics (prices e.g.) and to biology (chemotactic phenomena.)  The work on relativistic Brownian motion can have potential applications to cosmology, especially in deciding whether it is possible to observe black holes."

The solution to the Skorokhod Problem defines what   might be considered the input/output map for a number of exact and approximate models   in   queueing, communication, economics, and other areas. Except in special cases, little is   known about the analytical properties of this mapping. This research will build on prior   work of the investigator and H. Ishii which takes a geometric approach to obtaining   regularity conditions for the Skorokhod Problem. The main thrust of the present work is   the   development and application of methods based on convex duality.  The second part of the   project studies large deviations for queueing networks. The main topic here is the   formulation and analysis of risk sensitive criteria for the control and regulation of queueing   networks. In almost all models for networks there are errors, approximations, and model   uncertainty, and one would like to design control schemes that are insensitive to such   errors. Using the duality between exponential integrals and the relative entropy function,   one can (at least in the context of diffusions) give a precise quantitative characterization of   the  additional robustness properties that are obtained when a risk sensitive criteria is used.   The investigator will formulate and analyze via large deviation techniques such criteria in a   queueing context. The final part of the project considers cmmputational methods for   deterministic optimal control problems. The main emphasis here is on the development of   practical algorithms with good qualitative properties. This will be done for a class of   problems with very similar features that arise in large deviation for diffusions, certain   problems fr om computer vision, and robust nonlinear control and robust filtering.   Modern communication, computer, and queueing systems are very complicated,   and   in fact too complicated to analyze in complete detail. As systems become more and more   heterogeneous (e.g., different data classes, different quality of service requirements, etc.)   the control and regulation of these systems becomes more difficult and less intuitive. The   first two parts of this project investigate two approaches to dealing with such systems.   When analyzing queueing and communication systems one needs (relatively) simple   system   models which capture the most important aspects of the true system. Linear systems are   unable to capture the system behavior caused by hard constraints (non-negativity of queue   lengths, limits on buffer sizes, etc.) and discontinuities that occur naturally in well   designed   routing and service protocols. Part of this research is to look at alternatives to linear   systems. The second part focuses on the study of risk sensitive criteria for such systems.   Risk sensitive and robust criteria provide alternatives to traditional criteria for the   evaluation of system performance, and it is now understood that they are very useful in   situations where model uncertainty and robustness against modeling errors are important.   Such robustness properties are always important for communication and manufacturing   systems. The aim here is to properly formulate and analyze risk-sensitive criteria for   random   networks, and to quantify the robustness properties when compared to traditional criteria.   The last part of the project is devoted to the development of usable and efficient   computational methods for deterministic optimal control problems, and in particular to the   class of problems that arise in the second part of the proposal."

Related difficulties appear in other methods of analysis, such as large deviation approximations. An alternative approach is to allow the routing/service decisions to be control variables. When properly formulated, the analogous approximations to these controlled stochastic networks frequently possess better qualitative properties than their fixed policy counterparts. In addition, many approximate models are simple enough that closed form (or nearly closed form) solutions are possible. The investigator will carry out research on several closely related areas that can take advantage of these features: risk-sensitive control and the control of rare events in queueing networks; robust optimal control of law of large number approximations (also known as fluid models); higher order corrections to the control of fluid models. At the heart of each of these topics is a variational problem for processes with constrained dynamics (calculus of variations or optimal control problems for large deviations and control of fluid models, differential games for the problems of robust control of fluid models or control of rare events). The investigator has recently shown how in certain cases one can convert a variational problem involving constrained and controlled dynamics and a relatively simple cost structure into an equivalent problem involving unconstrained dynamics and a different cost. The latter problem is then solved explicitly. The proposed research includes extending this technique to include problems of buffer overflow in large deviations and constrained differential games.<br/> One of the main concerns of applied probability today is the development of tractable approximations for stochastic networks. Stochastic networks are ubiquitous in modern computer, communication and manufacturing systems, but owing to their complexity and detail are very difficult to analyze. As a consequence, much effort is being put into the development of mathematical models that are faithful enough to ""real life"" that conclusions drawn from them can be used with confidence, and yet which can be solved by either analytical or numerical means. The purpose of this project is to develop such methods of approximation and also the techniques for their solution. A new feature is to allow decisions on routing and service (e.g., which data class should be served in a communication network and where the processed data should be sent) to be control variables that can be optimized. Two particular classes of network problems will be given special attention. The first is the control of rare events. In many networks there are events that do not occur very often, and yet which are nonetheless the main concern. An example is data loss in a communication network. The second class is the robust control of networks, which means the control of a network in which some aspects of the network are poorly modeled or otherwise imperfectly known."

The basic idea of IS to simulate the system under a different probability distribution, and correct for biasedness via the likelihood ratio. During the last three decades, most of the IS schemes that were developed were based on heuristics, and led to algorithms with questionable performance.  In contrast, this research project develops a systematic methodology for the construction of simple, efficient IS schemes for broad classes of process models.  This approach capitalizes on the intimate connection between IS and a related differential game.  It turns out that subsolutions to the Isaacs equation associated with the game can be used to build IS schemes whose performance can be rigorously characterized.  The investigators are particularly interested in developing both theoretical and practical aspects of importance sampling in the areas of stochastic networks, metastability analysis, systems with discontinuous dynamics, small noise diffusions, counting problems, analysis of higher-order moments of IS estimators, and heavy-tailed distributions.  The project will also study the use of subsolutions for the construction and analysis of fast simulation methods based on branching processes, such as splitting and RESTART.<br/><br/>Rare events, such as transitions between stable wells in a model from chemical physics, data loss in a highly reliable communication system, or unexpectedly large payouts in insurance claims, are often key quantitative measures of a system's overall behavior.  They also play a central role in risk assessment and management.  Reliable numerical methods are required in order to design systems and protocols that can minimize and mitigate the negative effects of rare events.  The main technique for the fast simulation of rare events is importance sampling.  Importance sampling algorithms have been developed over the last thirty years for many different application areas.  However, the development to date has been largely ad hoc and without a proper theoretical foundation.  Practitioners have relied on a few rudimentary heuristics in constructing importance sampling algorithms.

This project brings new ideas from probability theory and tools from game theory and partial differential equations to the problem of design and analysis of importance sampling schemes.

A large repertoire                 of shapes is assumed known in advance, and the problem is to then               devise computationally efficient algorithms for recognizing                     which, if any, of these objects are present in a given scene.

That is, <br/>the control policies can be adjusted continuously and <br/>instantaneously, or the state processes can be stopped arbitrarily <br/>within some time interval.  However, this assumption is often <br/>violated in practice. The first part of the project is concerned<br/>with some new formulations for stochastic optimization problems <br/>in order to accommodate these practical constraints. These models <br/>share a common feature: random intervention times determined by <br/>exogenous signal processes. In the context of optimal control, <br/>the decision maker is allowed to adjust the level of control <br/>only at times when an exogenous process gives him a green light; <br/>for example, when an Poisson process makes a jump. In the area of <br/>optimal stopping, the state process is allowed to be stopped only <br/>at times when it receives certain signals from an exogenous process.  <br/>Both formulations admit explicit solutions and can be applied to <br/>model practical constraints on control policies or stopping times. <br/>The second part of the project is concerned with a class of diffusion <br/>processes with jumps. The major effort is put on their applications <br/>to economics and finance.  The reason for the introduction of such <br/>processes is that the classical diffusion model for stock prices <br/>cannot explain many empirical puzzles. For example, an abnormality <br/>called volatility smile is often observed in option pricing, and the <br/>return distributions of financial assets exhibit a leptokurtic feature. <br/>We intend to explain these phenomena, using the jump processes to model <br/>stock prices in a financial market or the values of economic projects <br/>in investment problems. The discontinuous behavior in the underlying <br/>processes requires new techniques to obtain explicit solutions to <br/>certain pricing and wealth optimization problems.  The research project <br/>includes pricing commonly traded exotic options, analysis of utility<br/>maximization, and evaluation of investment projects.<br/><br/>Stochastic optimization is one of the main topics in modern applied <br/>mathematics, with many applications in disciplines like engineering, <br/>biology, economics and finance, etc. The purpose of this research <br/>project is to systematically develop mathematical theories that are <br/>more faithful to real life problems, so that the conclusions drawn <br/>from them can be used with more confidence. For example, a better <br/>understanding for the uncertainty of stock prices can help agents <br/>reduce the risk in financial practice. However, in developing more <br/>realistic models, one must be aware of the subtle balance between <br/>complexity and mathematical tractability. A realistic yet too <br/>complicated model can be mathematically untractable. The goal of <br/>the project, therefore, is to develop analytically or numerically <br/>solvable models that embrace the essence of the practical problems. <br/>To this end, some new formulations are considered for general <br/>stochastic optimization problems in order to accommodate some <br/>practical constraints; for example, the controller can intervene <br/>the system only at times when an exogenous process sends out a <br/>certain signal.  Also considered are some new models for <br/>economics and finance that incorporate the drastic changes of <br/>stock prices over short periods of time. These new models can be <br/>used to explain many empirical puzzles that the classical models <br/>fail to do, and to help agents develop better portfolios to reduce risk.<br/><br/>"

Current research is directed towards                    understanding the stochastic behavior of matching functionals.                  This involves finding tight non-asymptotic bounds, limiting                     distributions, and exponential type moment bounds.  This would                  add to the understanding of several combinatorial optimization                  problems as well as empirical discrepancy problems, notably                     finding the rate of convergence of the empirical to the true                    distribution.  Results of this type are useful in stochastic                    bin-packing as well as statistical physics.  Concerning                         discrepancy problems in mathematical statistics, research is also               directed towards further enlarging the collection of known                      Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) classes of sets.  This involves                        establishing general connections between VC classes of positivity               sets, quantifier elimination theorems, and semi-algebraic                       geometry.                                                                            The proposed research will focus heavily on the theoretical                and mathematical aspects of the well-known transportation problem               as well as some of its generalizations.  This problem has                       received wide attention over the years and it is recognized that                a full understanding of its mathematical complexities will lead                 to more efficient and perhaps simpler ways to solve optimization                problems ranging from the shipping of goods, to the routing of                  airplanes and the study of statistical mechanics. In its simplest               and most elementary form the problem may be stated as follows.                  Suppose that one is given n oil wells and n refineries and wishes               to efficiently pair off wells and refineries, so as to minimize                 the sum of the matching distances.  It is easy to see that there                are n| different possible matchings.  The transportation problem                is to determine the most efficient matching, i.e., to determine                 that matching which will minimize the sum of the distances. The                 proposed research will consider variations on this and related                  problems."

Yukich will employ a spatial dependence structure termed stabilization to establish general thermodynamic limits for functionals in geometric probability and to establish Gaussian limits for such functionals.

Two complementary approaches are indicated.  The first approach involves the use of results about the fluctuation of Gaussian processes to explain the variability of the partition function and the convergence of the free energy of the S-K spin glass.  Preliminary results suggest that this approach is quite useful.  The second approach involves investigating the weak convergence of weighted sums of dependent random variables.  This will have immediate consequences for the understanding of the S-K spin glass model, as its partition function can be represented as the moment generating function of a weighted sum of dependent random variables.    The work of the investigator on this proposal is directed toward finding relatively simple mathematical models which provide an accurate description of the complicated probabilistic behavior of so-called ""spin glass"" models.  Spin glass models provide a theoretical description of those magnetic systems for which the interaction strengths (coupling constants) are random.  These systems are found in structurally disordered materials with behavior depending on a threshold transition temperature.  The randomness of the interaction strengths arises because of impurities within the materials.  The theoretical work proposed here promises to provide a better understanding of the variability in the behavior of these materials when they are synthesized under different temperature regimes.  This research draws on recent advances in the study of random processes."

The methods employed are taken from ergodic theory, probability, and statistical physics.   This work consists of four topics:  (i) mathematical properties of neural networks, (ii) extreme value estimation, (iii) continued fraction algorithms, and (iv) random substitution processes.  (i) A neural network is a type of self-programming computer that learns by example, essentially adjusting itself to adapt to its environment.  Neural networks--though not yet well understood, mathematically--are already in commercial use in such areas as handwriting readers, DNA classifiers, and financial forecasters. With greater understanding will come more enlightened use. (ii) The investigator and his colleagues are developing extreme value estimation algorithms to help solve an estimation problem needed in the design of structures such as off-shore oil platforms which require a high probability of withstanding storms.  Typically, there is limited historical data from which to make these estimates.  The algorithms are used to estimate the most powerful storm that is likely to occur in the vicinity of the structure in the next 20 years. (iii) Continued fractions have the property of being the most economical way to approximate a real number by a fraction.  They consist of fractions containing fractions containing fractions, etc., etc. The investigator and his colleagues look at these as dynamical systems to study their properties.  This work ties together ideas from probability theory, group theory, and flows on  surfaces.  (iv) The investigator is studying random substitution schemes as they are natural ways of creating strings of symbols with random properties, using a simple recipe.  This idea may also be used to generate tilings of the plane or space that have properties of randomness and determinism.  The construction begins with a set of tiles (or simple shapes) and decompositions of these tiles so that each piece of each decomposition is a scale replica of one of the original tiles.  This procedure is continued, decomposing to finer and finer scales, zooming the scale.  This may give models of materials in nature, as has been the case for non-random versions of this procedure."

Although the Navier-Stokes equations are essentially deterministic, the approach used in this work will build on a representation of the equations as a functional of an underlying branching random walk. This representation, which was recently discovered by LeJan and Sznitman in France, is clearly intrinsic to the structure of the Navier-Stokes equations. While this is not the first attempt to use stochastic methods in connection with the flows associated with the Navier-Stokes equations, it does represent an entirely new direction which has the potential to transcend much of existing theory. Specific problems considered in this proposal seek to provide a better understanding of the role of spatial dimensions, boundary conditions, multi-scaling exponents and singularities, viscosity, homogeneity, isotropy and rotational accelerations, stationary flows and long-time evolution.<br/> The Navier-Stokes equations describe the basic physics governing the motion of fluid in its various forms of air, water, oil, etc. As such these equations play a fundamental role in science and engineering through the modeling of all varieties of fluid flow, from atmospheric and oceanic circulation to the flow of water beneath the earth's surface. Improved understanding of these equations and their solutions is essential to applications which range from tracking climate change and dispersion of contaminants in the Earth's environment, to more stable aerospace and sea vessel designs. The nonlinearity inherent in these equations makes explicit solutions possible only for the simplest of flows. Consequently the development of a more complete understanding of these equations at all physical length scales ranks among the most important outstanding problems of contemporary mathematical physics. <br/>"

Much of the data collected and reported on these structures is in the form of log-log plots of some quantity versus a length scale.  This leads to the introduction and refinements of new classes of self-similar spatial/temporal models whose scaling structure is inferred from empirically observed sample realizations.  Thus we seek to calculate certain large-sample (fine scale) limits of statistical estimators of exponents and limit laws governing fluctuations.  In addition, self-similarities and scaling exponents are sought for the cascade and network models.  Then connections between the scaling exponents of the flow processes and those of the cascade and network exponents may be investigated.  The prospect of a theory which computes structure functions, (i.e., multiscaling exponents) for extreme flows from corresponding structure function calculations on the inputs and network defines the frontiers of this research.<br/><br/>A fundamental problem from environmental science is to determine the structure of river flows (e.g. extremes) from a basin given data on the local climate (e.g. rainfall) and topography (river network structure, soil moisture).  In most parts of the world the information available for the planning of dams, flood insurance, military tactics etc. is in the form of remotely sensed local climate and topography.  The mathematical formulation is based on a stochastic system of conservation equations (mass, momentum) which relate the flows to the multiplicative stochastic rainfall inputs and complex network topography via scaling and multiscaling exponents which are estimated from remotely sensed data.  One of the practical aspects of results of this type is to assist hydrologists and engineers in extrapolating localized observations to larger scales, and to regionalize predicted flows.  However, the broad mathematical framework contributes to our understanding of diverse natural stochastic phenomena such as fluid turbulence, stochastic investment yields, renewable natural resource distributions, spin glass magnets etc., which are intrinsically multiplicative in space and/or time.<br/>"

The particular case of the additive rate kernel, which has a rich structure relating to continuum random trees, is being investigated in detail.  A novel process combining coalescence with immigration and removal and which appears to have an interesting phase transition is also being studied.  In a different direction, there is increasing interest in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees (indicating relationships between biological species).  Some toy models for sampling from target distributions on tree-space are studied via the weak convergence methodology.<br/><br/>The general area of research concerns large systems with random aspects to their behavior.  As such systems become larger, their behavior gets more difficult to analyze, either via mathematical theory or via computer simulation.  But in some cases it is possible to overcome this difficulty by relating the behavior of sufficiently large finite systems to that of some fixed infinite-size system.  This methodology is being applied in two areas. One area is refining analysis of models of random clustering of mass, a topic of interest in many areas of science (e.g. polymers in physical chemistry, condensation of raindrops in clouds, and formation of galaxies in the early universe).

The PI uses new ideas from metric geometry, a seemingly unrelated branch of mathematics, to advance the study of these objects. A current conundrum in demographic research is the fact that, for a vast array of species, mortality increases exponentially with age up to extreme old age, at which point it levels off. The PI shows that this behavior is a robust consequence of a whole general class of underlying models for the ageing process. <br/>"

Recently the investigator has derived the Boltzmann equation for the macroscopic particle densities for a class of one dimensional lattice gas models. Roughly speaking one shows that after a suitable scaling the microscopic particle density converges to a solution of the Boltzmann equation. The convergence is expected to be exponentially fast and the exponential rate can be expressed by a variational formula.      Our world appears differently at different scales!

Work in three areas is proposed: quadratic (bilinear) forms having a fixed number of summands, ones having a random number of summands, and improved tail probability approximations for Poissonized sums of independent random variables.  In the first such area it is anticipated that results will be obtained which identify the order of magnitude of the expectation of a function of the absolute value of a bilinear form (and also of a generalized U-statistic) of a fixed number of independent real-valued random variables, for any non-decreasing function of at most polynomial growth without further assumptions on the bilinear form, the generalized U-statistics, the distributions, or the number of independent variates.  The second problem area, worked on if time permits, will attempt to establish similar results regarding the expectation of the maximum absolute value of one specific family of bilinear forms of independent and identically distributed mean zero random variates, maximized up to a stopping time determined by the variates themselves.  Thirdly, the proposer and colleagues will attempt to produce improved and best possible tail probability approximations for Poissonized sums of independent random variables satisfying certain constraints.  Probabilistic issues crop up whenever numbers are important and total knowledge or command of the situation is rendered humanly impossible.  For example, the management of a chain store (e.g. Sears or Macy's) must continually make decisions concerning how much of its capital to allocate to each of a multitude of items.  Yet it does not really know the entire sales picture.  Not only does management not know future trends, it doesn't know what the current sales results are for comparable or competitive items sold by other companies in similar locations -- and management may not have full comprehension of the contributory factors influencing its own sales  pattern.  To make good financial decisions, management needs a fairly comprehensive and continually updated mathematical model of its fiscal situation.  For instance, it needs to know what is the chance that it will have more than d unsold dresses of cost c or more in a given store, as well as throughout the company.  To assess the sensitivity of its profitability to variations in materials and labor costs as well as consumer demand the company may want to compute expectations involving quantities which mathematicians recognize as quadratic forms or generalized U-statistics.  Thus, if their utility were properly recognized, the results to be obtained in this proposal might well be of substantial industrial interest."

Perhaps the most celebrated problem in this context is the derivation of the   hydrodynamic and kinetic equations from small scale dynamics governed by the Newton's   second law. This problem is still wide open but some variants have been recently treated.   The investigator's research concerns the analysis of particle systems modeling fluids and   gas. Recently the investigator in collaboration with James Tarver has derived a Boltzmann   type equation for the macroscopic particle densities of a class stochastic particle systems   modeling dilute gases. Roughly speaking one shows that after a suitable scaling the   microscopic particle density converges to a solution of a Boltzmann type equation. The   investigator also shows that the convergence is exponentially fast and derives an explicit   expression for the exponential rate of convergence. This result allows us to go beyond the   macroscopic description given by the Boltzmann equation and obtain some valuable   insight about the microscopic structure of the particle system under study.   Our world appears differently at different scales. For example a fluid or a gas is a   collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move   erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize   themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale? Roughly the reason is   that the local conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy impose constraints not   immediately visible on the microscopic scale. The investigator's research concerns the   relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids and   gases. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting   particles has proved to be useful in understanding  the intricate behavior of fluids and   gases. Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient way of   simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases."

The first concerns development of a computational apparatus to derive asymptotics from mutlivariate generating functions.  This is done using complex analytic methods.  In one variable, the subject of analytic combinatorics is well developed, but in more than one variable, methods are only now beginning to be understood.  Geometric properties of the singular variety of the generating function become important, requiring further work both in the construction of appropriate deformations and in the effective computation of the resulting integrals.<br/>The second area of proposed research concerns analysis of several probability models.  One of these is to find perfect squares in products of random integers.  This model, due to Pomerance, arises in sieving methods of factorization.  In past work, we analyzed a square-finding algorithm believed to have asymptotically the shortest possible run time.  In fact we know it to be within about 30% of the best run time, but would like to prove that it is in fact asymptotically optimal.  A positive result would tell us the algorithm in fact searches for an asymptotically optimal witness.  Other probability models in the proposal include searches and sampling in trees of exponential growth, and computations saddle point integrals for likelihood functions. <br/>Here follows a ""big-picture"" description of how this research is situated with respect to problems of general scientific interest.<br/><br/>Generating functions are perhaps the single most widely applicable technique for counting or estimating the size of combinatorial classes.<br/>Generating functions encode recursive information: tractable generating <br/>functions exist when the sizes of the classes satisfy a recursion.   <br/>An explicit (non-recursive) descriptions of these numbers is usually more desirable.  For example, the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers, a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2), while remakably simple, is less useful for size estimation than the explicit formula a(n) = (1+o(1)) b^n where b is the Golden ratio.  It has been known for several decades how to convert one-variable generating functions into explicit asymptotic formulae.  Recent research of the PI and others extends this knowledge to generating functions for multivariate arrays.  An important component of the proposed research is the automation of these new mutlivariate techniques, which requires development of effective tools for computing algebraic and topological invariants of polynomials.  <br/><br/>One aspect of the utility of the proposed research on square subproducts is obvious: it gives us the run time of the main component of a basic and widely used factoring algorithm.  The method of analysis is to show that the factorizations of random integers converge, in an appropriate sense, to a certain Poisson process.  Probability limit theorems are common in analytic number theory, but the limit structure required for this analysis requires keeping track of the magnitude of<br/>the product of all the factors.   A second aspect of the significance<br/>of the proposed research, therefore, is that it will develop a number-theoretic probability model containing more information than previous models, and to which actual factorizations of random integers may be shown rigorously to converge.  The part of the proposal concerning searches and sampling on graphs of exponential growth is motivated by in part by the connection between uniform sampling and size estimation.<br/>"

Examples of problems that are to be investigated include the  stochastic models of the traveling salesman problem, the minimum  spanning tree problem, and several of  their related  approximations. The more specific objectives of the project  include (1) further development of the  distribution theory for  the traveling salesman problem and minimal spanning tree problem,  (2) more extensive development of Talagrand's theory of  configuration functions, (3) refined understanding of the tail  behavior of the increasing subsequence functional, and (4)  development of the basic limit theory for functionals associated  with non-optimal heuristics. The methods that will be used in  this investigation include Talagrand's isoperimetric theory,   Talagrand's theory of irregularity of distribution, the theory of  subadditive Euclidean functionals, the general efficiency theory  for statistical estimation, and  the theory of vector  quantization.  Each of these tools is of considerable importance  in its own right, and the expectation is that  useful insight  will be gained into the strengths and weaknesses of these tools  through the study of the concrete problems of  probabilistic  combinatorial optimization.     The interface of probability  theory and optimization has experienced remarkable growth over  the last five years, and this development has had substantial  impact on both theoretical computer science and the  practice of  algorithm development. The aim of this project is to build a  deeper understanding of the information and assistance that  probability can provide in some difficult and important problems  of computation. In particular, the project aims to develop  probability theory that helps describe the behavior of several  important quantities in the theory of combinatorial optimization,  a subj ect that studies the minimization and maximization of  functions that are defined very large finite sets. The more  specific objectives of the project include development of a  distribution theory for the length of the shortest path through a  large number of points whose locations are determined by a  probability distribution, and the  development of the basic  probability for some of the most  important approximation methods  of optimization theory."

Also considered are   spectral questions for matrix-coefficient transfer operators.  Some of the convergence questions which will be addressed by Wierdl   concern the mean convergence of averages of measurements made on a   stochastic process at a random sequence of times that is chosen in   advance. Other questions concern subsequence ergodic theorems for   subsequences coming from members of Hardy fields, along bases for the   integers, and along sequences with big gaps. Results obtained by Wierdl in the previous grant periods suggest that in the context of Hardy fields, a meaningful characterization of the ``good'' sequences of measurements is possible.         Campbell and Wierdl will jointly consider another group of convergence   questions concerning upcrossings and related oscillatory behavior of   the ergodic averages. This line of research was initiated by Bishop,   Bourgain, Kalikow, B. Weiss and others.  Wierdl and his collaborators   discovered a fundamental connection between Ergodic Theory and   martingales.  This discovery---which often manifests itself as a   squarefunction of the difference between ergodic averages and certain   martingales---allows one to translate many of the results of   Martingale Theory, such as squarefunction, large deviation or   upcrossing inequalities, to ergodic theoretical results.         The so called Ergodic Theorem (ET) is a theoretical description of a   certain statistical behavior of matter.  Loosely speaking, the ET   makes it possible to make a large class of physical measurements in   two entirely different ways, but arrive to the same result.  It is useful to have an illustration: suppose we want to find out the average speed of the water particles in a cup of water.  Well, we would have to measure the speed of each particle separately, and then  take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average speed is called  averaging in *space* since we go to different points (particles) in space to make the measurement.  But the ET says, that we would arrive to the same result if we pick a *single* particle, and start measuring its speed at 1 second, at 2 second, at 3 second, etc, and after a long enough period of time take the average of these measurements.  This method of calculating the average is called averaging in *time*.      So the above is two very different ways of calculating average speed,   and the method to be chosen depends on the circumstance.  Having  two possibilities gives great freedom in experiments.  The problem with the ET is twofold: 1) It does not specify exactly *how many* times are we supposed to   measure the speed of the single particle; the ET just says ""eventually"" the time average gets close to the space average.  2) The measurements in time has to be made *exactly* at 1s, 2s, 3s, etc.  But in practice, one cannot make measurements so promptly.  The ET says nothing if the measurements are made at, say, 1.1s, 2.8s, 3.2s, ...Our proposal addresses the above two problems:   1) we propose various ways to determine how many times does one need   to make measurements in time to get close with prescribed accuracy to   the space average.  2) We examine various randomly generated times at which measurements made will still give an average approaching the space average.  (Note Randomly generated times are much more likely to model practical   situations.)"

The proposed research falls into   three parts. Part I deals with degenerate diffusions and their impact on linear partial   differential equations. In their recent work, the investigators have proved a very general   Hormander-type hypoellipticity theorem for second-order linear partial differential   operators. The hypotheses of this theorem allow Hormander's general Lie algebra   condition to fail at an optimal exponential rate on smooth hypersurfaces in Euclidean   space. Such operators have been termed superdegenerate. The investigators will establish   the existence of smooth solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann problems associated with   superdegenerate operators. In Part II, the investigators will study the existence of smooth   densities for a wide class of degenerate stochastic hereditary equations. They will seek to   use their methods to establish hypoellipticity of the corresponding operators. In addition   to solving an infinite-dimensional hypoellipticity problem (apparently the first of its kind),   the estimates obtained here should lead to the  existence of a Lyapunov spectrum in   probability for singular hereditary systems. In Part III, they will use their methods to study   quasilinear second-order partial differential operators with superdegenerate principal parts.   These operators are closely related to superdiffusions. The objective of this part of the   research is to seek classical smooth positive solutions of the quasilinear Cauchy, Dirichlet,   and Neumann problems associated with such operators.   This research deals with two important problem areas that arise in physics and   engineering. The first area concerns an important class of mathematical models, called   partial differential equations, that are fundamental obje cts in modern day pure and applied   mathematics. These equations arose from the study of heat conduction, electrical   potential, and fluid flow. Partial differential equations have important connections with   several areas of mathematics, in particular probability theory and geometry. The second   area is devoted to a class of models that are used in physics, engineering and biology in   order to analyze dynamical systems whose evolution is influenced by random fluctuations   and past history. These models are very important in a variety of diverse areas ranging   from signal processing, stock market fluctuations, economic and labor models, aircraft   dynamics, materials with memory, and population dynamics. The investigators will use the   most current probabilistic techniques in order to develop a deeper understanding of these   models."

The measures                to be studied are those induced by Hilbert-valued stochastic                    differential equations of elliptic type.  The proposer has                      previously shown such measures to be differentiable, and has also               established a relationship between the properties of measure                    differentiability and quasi-invariance.

The project on U-statistics and  processes follows up on fairly recent work of this investigator,  J. Cuzick and E. Gine as well as some work of Anda Gadidov (who  has just obtained her Ph.D. under the direction of this  investigator). The project on correlation inequalities work has  been under way for some time and several results have already  been obtained. In particular, Schechtman, Schlumprecht and this  investigator obtained the desired inequality for ellipsoids.  The  third project follows up on a recently submitted paper (with  Hitczenko, Kwapien, Li, Schechtman, Schlumprecht) on  hypercontractivity of alternating maxima and minima of  multi-indexed independent, identically distributed random  variables.    Classical empirical processes can and have been  used by statisticians to obtain information about basic  characteristicq of a ``population'' using samples collected from  the population. The modern theory, developed over the last twenty  or so years, allows one to study many such characteristics  simultaneously  A component of both the classical and modern  theory studied by this investigator is U-processes, which are, in  a sense, building blocks for general statistical functionals.   Such investigations will help to better assess the accuracy of  statistical procedures currently used in the study of censored  and/or truncated data in Medicine, Astronomy and other fields.  The modern theory of empirical processes has also made  connections with another field of probability, namely, the study  of Gaussian processes. Inequalities for such processes have  played a major role not only in probability--as well as many  other fields of mathematics, such as harmonic analysis, Banach  space theory and, more recently, operator theory--but also in  Theoretical Physics (Quant um field theory).  The Gaussian  Correlation Conjecture is one such outstanding problem in this  area. Many correlation results in, for example, statistical  mechanics, attack one-sided problems. This particular conjecture  attacks a two-sided barrier problem. One hoped for by-product of  a solution to this problem is to other two-sided problems present  in a variety of fields. One of the approaches to this problem,  led to the third project under study by this investigator,  namely, hypercontractivity. In our context hypercontractivity  allows one to change the original formulation of the problem, to  a problem more amenable to some recent advances in the theory of  inequalities for Gaussian processes.."

In recent years, there has been a rebirth of                      interaction with other aspects of mathematical analysis -- such                 as harmonic analysis and operator theory -- and probability                     theory.  In particular, Banach space methods, in the hands of                   highly creative and powerful researchers, have led to fundamental               breakthroughs in these other fields, and in turn probabilistic                  methods have enriched the structure theory of Banach spaces                     themselves.  World centers of excellence in this area are in                    Israel, Paris, Warsaw, Ohio, and Texas. Professor Johnson is one                of the leading figures in the United States and internationally                 in this area, and he heads a strong and productive team of                      researchers at Texas A & M.  Professor Pisier, from Paris, joined               this group last year.

Pisier's work sets major directions for research in Banach space                theory, harmonic analysis, and probability.  The year long                      workshop at Texas A & M, held cooperatively with other strong                   researchers at Texas, brings together singly and collectively the               most significant researchers in the field, all of whom have done                fundamental work, to interact on problems of current concern, and               to interact with young researchers in the field.                                        Professors Johnson and Pisier will continue their deep and              important investigations on a variety of aspects of Banach space                theory; for example, local theory of function spaces, weak                      Hilbert spaces, Lipschitz theory, Banach lattices, probability                  theory, and spaces of operators.

In the past, he helped develop techniques which lead to the derivation of formulae for solutions to certain partial differential equations in terms of integrals over an appropriate path space.  He then used these formulae to obtain quite refined estimates on the solutions represented.  More recently, he has been trying to use related methods to gain insight into differential geometric problems suggested by recent physical considerations.  In particular, he hopes to learn how to construct and analyze diffusions on spaces of loops in a Riemannian manifold.    In the Newtonian picture of the world, physical objects were thought to follow definite paths, and the goal of physics was to predict the path that a particular object would follow.  In the quantum mechanical picture, physical objects are no longer thought to be so constrained.  Instead, they are thought to governed by physical laws which can, at best, predict the probability of their following a particular path.  The Newtonian and quantum picture are reconciled by the fact that, with overwhelming probability, a massive object will follow a path which is close to the one predicted by Newtonian physics.  On the other hand, when dealing with very small objects, the Newtonian prediction can be quite far off, and one can only make predictions by averaging over spaces of paths.  For this reason, it becomes important to understand how to average over paths.  The mathematical theory of averaging over various path spaces has been one of the central themes of  mathematics in this century.  Its applications are numerous and are not restricted to physics.  Indeed, over the past two decades, very sophisticated  path-space models are the basis on which commodities and financial instruments of all sorts have been priced.  Averaging over path spaces is the  central theme of the research proposed in  this project."

In recent work, such facts are being extended to suitable non-  linear functions in place of sums.  In the current project, the  sample spaces of observations are being extended from one-  dimensional to multidimensional spaces."

In one dimension, p-variation norms work well for Frechet differentiability. Extensions to several dimensions are being pursued.  In Bayes asymptotics, normal approximations with small relative errors are being found even for small probabilities of intermediate deviations.<br/><br/>In Bayes asymptotics, one of the goals is to choose the best of several statistical models, possibly for multiple data sets.  For example, multiple clinical trials may be done of a treatment for a disease.  Three models are that the treatment is helpful, is harmful, or makes no difference.  Further models incorporate the possibility that the treatment may have substantially different effects in different study populations.  The procedure is to begin with a noninformative prior probability distribution on each model, then adjust it based on the likelihoods from each data set.  Improved approximations of the updated probabilities are being investigated. For differentiable statistical functionals, a data set gives an approximation to a probability distribution.  If a nonlinear transformation is applied both to the true distribution function and to its approximation, one looks for a linear transformation that approximates the nonlinear one as well as possible in the neighborhood of the true distribution.  One is also looking for effective ways of bounding the discrepancy between the true and approximate distributions and their transformations. <br/>"

In addition to their intrinsic beauty, these objects find applications in quantum field theory, statistical physics, and the theory of random surfaces.  A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.  Since the path-breaking work of Belavin, Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov in the 1970's and 1980's, it has been understood---at least heuristically---that the laws of certain macroscopic observables of these systems should be invariant under conformal maps from one planar domain to another.  Over the past two decades, physicists have developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for understanding the properties of random objects with conformal symmetries. During the past few years, several mathematicians have begun to rigorously prove some of the predictions from the physics literature, along with many additional results.  Many of the these problems have natural higher dimensional analogs that we are only beginning to understand.  The investigator's proposed activities include efforts to bring new graduate students into this emerging field and to assist them in their studies and careers.<br/>"

The approach is to consider a limit of measures on discrete structures, where the concept of uniformity is meaningful. The co-investigator intends to construct a limiting measure for the graph metric induced by uniformly chosen planar graphs on n vertices. Experimental and heuristic evidence suggests that the limiting measure will have the structure of a continuum tree. For the second topic, the co-investigator intends to study the implications of previous work on the relationship between random walks and geometry on graphs in the context of Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds. The third topic concerns the stochastic Loewner evolution, introduced by Schramm as a conjectured scaling limit for percolation and loop-erased walk. These and several other conjectures concerning this process have been proved and yet others remain open. The fourth topic is probability in groups. The co-investigator intends to continue to work on automorphism groups of regular trees, which are fundamental objects of study in the theory of p-groups.<br/> All four parts of the project involve more than one area of mathematics, increasing understanding between fields. The common motivation is to understand better fundamental mathematical objects that are often of utilitarian use. In particular, the second part concerns random walks on graphs, a topic which has been applied in the design of efficient computer algorithms. The fourth part concerns randomness in groups, a topic which has been used successfully in the telecommunications industry for encryption and error-correction."

Such processes describe configurations on lattices which evolve by a repeated update of a local rule.  The research goals consist of three main parts.  The first part focuses on deterministic and random growth models, emphasizing emergence of asymptotic shapes, limit laws for first passage times, as well as hydrodynamic and other continuum limits.  The second part is devoted to competition theory, especially to cases which lead to approximation with the motion by mean curvature.  On finite universes, long-time evolution of such dynamics depends on topological properties of the underlying space.  The third part consists of studying percolation on hypercubes in high dimensions; the goal is to understand how the number of species is determined by the structure of viable genotypes and various mating strategies.  This research is accompanied by development of computer software, which is used for simulation, statistical analyses, numerical computation and combinatorial searches.    This project studies several classes of deterministic and random evolutions of spatial configurations.  The basic property of these evolutions is that they are governed by local rules; they are referred to as deterministic and random cellular automata (CA).  The study of CA offers insights into fundamental organizational principles in many scientific contexts. CA complement differential equations, the prevailing method of describing physical processes, by demonstrating how differential equations arise naturally from local rules.  In biological contexts, the CA models under study shed light on how harshness of the environment affects diversity of species, how equally fit species compete for the available space and how spread of biological agents is affected by spatial anomalies.  Emergence of shapes in growth models is often seen as the basic example of global structure arising from local dynamics, and studying proper ties of such shapes leads to challenges in probability theory, geometry and complexity theory.  Finally, computer analyses of CA are not only indispensable for mathematical development, but they also provide a worthy testing ground for parallel computation schemes and visualization hardware."

Another emphasis will be on a probabilistic analysis of random combinatorial objects, and in particular their limit shapes, which are geometric shapes that arise in the asymptotic limit when the size of the model becomes large. More generally, the study of combinatorial models in a probabilistic setting raises many fascinating questions, for example questions about limiting fluctuations and about connections to random matrix theory.

The combinatorial objects of interest have delighted pure mathematicians for many years for their inherent beauty and elegant structure. But also, amazingly, such seemingly ""useless"" mathematics has turned out to have deep connections to branches of physics and to some very applied mathematical disciplines like probability theory and random matrix theory. Thus, for example, alternating-sign matrices are related to ""square ice"", a simplified model for an ice crystal studied by statistical physicists, while at the same time appearing in the study of an algorithm for computing matrix determinants, which are a ubiquituous concept used in practically all the sciences and engineering disciplines. And Young tableaux, which originated with the mathematical study of symmetry, have been found to be related to random matrix theory, an important mathematical theory which has its origins in attempts by nuclear physicists to model the complex interactions in the nuclei of heavy elements. The combination of theoretical elegance and applied utility makes these research topics highly attractive from a scientific standpoint, and also very suitable as the focus for educational activities planned by the investigator, which would have as their goals to attract promising students to mathematics and the sciences and to promote public appreciation of the value of scientific research.<br/>"

The first concerns rates of convergence (to an associated   asymptotic shape) and related properties of infinite geodesics in the context of certain   Euclidean first-passage percolation models (Euclidean FPP). Rigorous unconditional   results about infinite geodesics (time-minimizing paths) in the context of standard FPP are   quite sparse, largely due to technical difficulties associated with lattice effects.  Models of   Euclidean FPP take place on graphs constructed from a homogeneous Poisson process   and their statistical properties enjoy complete invariance under all rigid motions.  In this   sense, Euclidean models are a natural setting in which to study FPP geodesics.  The   second area concerns a host of problems arising from random walks on the integers where   some fixed but possibly random coloring, or ""scenery"", is assigned to the integers.  In this   context, a random walk on the integers produces a record of scenery ""observed"" along the   walk.  The issues under investigation concern, loosely speaking, what can be inferred   about the scenery by observing one such scenery record.  The difficulty stems from the   fact that one does not know the steps taken by the walk, only the scenery observed along   the walk.   Both areas of investigation involve stochastic processes associated with some type   of spatial structure.  While the focus of this research is the mathematical aspects of these   models, models of this general sort arise quite naturally in connection with a number of   interesting physical phenomena.  For example, the standard FPP model was first   introduced as a representation of fluid flow through a random porous medium such as an   aquifer or, on a smaller physical scale, a membrane.  There are also connections to other   aspects of materials science, including the formation and propagation of cracks."

The investigator and his colleagues propose to investigate some of the probabilistic and analytical properties of this process. This process locally exhibits many features of the solutions to a class of stochastic partial differential equations. As such, our proposed analysis would have ramifications in the study of hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations. Also considered will be the properties of the graph of the Brownian sheet viewed as a non-smooth random surface.  The problems of interest include certain questions involving transport problems on some random erratic fractures and surfaces. Idealized versions of such objects appear in recent investigations in the engineering and  physics literature.    The proposed research involves a systematic study of a class of random processes which arise in several areas of mathematics as well as in physics and engineering. Such problems include but are not limited to transport problems, wave phenomena and turbulence. The underlying common theme in many such problems is a mathematical object called the Brownian sheet.  With only a few exceptions, the geometry of the Brownian sheet is a largely unexplored area; primarily due to the fact that there are not many general methods for its study. Among other works, it is the goal of this proposal to make some attempts at remedying this situation."

For random walk on finite groups, the relation between   the behavior of the walk and the structure of the group is studied. The behavior of random   walk on infinite Cayley graphs and its relation with isoperimetric inequalities are   investigated. Examples showing exotic behaviors are produced by considering wreath   products and studying the Laplace transform of the number of visited points and other   related functionals. In the context of Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds, the   investigator will study two-sided global heat kernel bounds on manifolds with ends. This   requires hitting time estimates for compact regions and bounds on the Dirichlet heat kernel   of unbounded regions. Some problems concerning Gaussian measures on locally compact   groups will also be investigated.      This research is concerned with basic properties of certain random processes. A   familiar yet typical example is the question of how many times a deck of cards must be   shuffled to be mixed well. Random processes similar to card shuffling are used in   computer programs to perform tasks for which no efficient deterministic algorithm   is known. Understanding how well these stochastic algorithms work is important and calls   for precise mathematical studies. Different generalizations of card shuffling lead to the   study of random processes on different types of mathematical structures. The investigator   will study the long time behavior of these processes."

Similar difficulties arise in computer science when one seeks to sample randomly from a large combinatorial space whose precise size cannot be ascertained in any reasonable amount of time. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximate sampling approach to such a problem is to construct and run ""for a long time"" a Markov chain with long-run distribution equal to the given distribution.  But determining how long is long enough can be both analytically and empirically difficult. Very recently, researchers have devised an algorithm to use the same Markov chains to produce exact samples from the desired distribution.  However, the running time of the algorithm is unbounded and not independent of the state sampled, so a user with limited patience will introduce systematic bias by aborting a long run.  The investigator assesses the extent of this bias, implements and studies (via a certain ""duality"" theory) the performance of a new algorithm he devises to eliminate the bias, and establishes bounds on the performance of any such Markov-chain-based algorithm.   Physicists are interested in models for ferromagnetism and for phase transitions (such as freezing and thawing).  In such statistical mechanics problems, in image processing (the cleaning up of noisy or blurred images), and in computer science, much can be learned by studying certain probability distributions on sets having enormously large numbers of elements.  The standard ""Monte Carlo"" approach to studying a distribution is to draw a (representative) random sample, but this approach is computationally infeasible for problems of such large size.  To handle such problems, researchers use computers to simulate certain probabilistic processes, called Mar kov chains, which, in a certain precise sense, ""settle down"" to the distribution of interest ""in the long run.""  But determining how long is long enough to run the chain in order to approximate the distribution sufficiently closely can be difficult to assess, both theoretically and empirically.  Very recently, researchers have devised an algorithm to use the same Markov chains to produce exact samples from the desired distribution.  However, the running time of the algorithm is sometimes very large, and the distribution of the output can depend on the running time, so a user with limited patience will introduce systematic bias by aborting a long run. The investigator, a probabilist, assesses the extent of this bias, implements and analyzes the performance of a new algorithm he devises to eliminate the bias, and considers how well any such Markov-chain-based algorithm can perform."

In the former, a particle is driven by its interaction with the non-homogeneous random medium, while in the latter, the particle interacts with other particles present. In the general RWRE model an environment is a collection of transition probabilities between lattice sites, and it is chosen from some mixing shift-invariant distribution. On the other hand, a class of deposition models, introduced by the first PI, not only provides a unified framework for many well-known particle systems, but also gives a broader view on common phenomena arising in such systems. An object of vital importance in particle systems, in spirit similar to a random walker in random environment, is the so-called second class particle. The main goal of these fields is the understanding of the consequences of the randomness in the environment, or caused by particle-particle interactions, respectively. Among the fundamental questions one can consider are the existence of 0-1 laws, law of large numbers, central limit theorems, large deviations, etc. The two fields are very close in spirit and ideas, just as an example, non-reversibility is a major obstacle in both fields to common applications. Sometimes even direct connections can be established between the two fields through different representations of the same system. This research contains an instance where a surface growth process is shown to be the dual of a RWRE model, allowing the flow of results from the latter to the former. Dual connections within the field of interacting systems are known to be a powerful tool.  Analogously, drawing parallels between interacting systems and RWRE's allows for the exchange of methods, insights, and results.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that probabilistic intuition and techniques are often of great relevance to other areas of mathematics, this research has a direct impact on probability theory, combinatorics, statistical physics, and the theory of partial differential equations. The fields of random media and interacting systems also have various industrial, agricultural, sociological, and biological applications. Moreover the methods and problems in these fields are often easy to state, while the solutions involve sophisticated tools. This makes the subject appealing to graduate students and young researchers, generating more interest in probability theory.<br/>"

The first stems from the recent discovery by the investigator and collaborators of a connection between the Tracy-Widom laws of RMT, their generalization to the so called ""beta-ensembles"", and a family of random Schroedinger operators.  This connection opens the door to a deeper understanding of the analytic structure of Tracy-Widom laws. It also presents a new method for investigating the universality question at the spectral edge for both random matrices and random Schroedinger.<br/>The second set of problems concerns bulk fluctuations for ensembles of matrices with no assumed symmetry.  Such questions are of growing interest in theoretical physics on account of the ties between these fluctuations and the Gaussian Free Field.  Finally, the investigator looks at several applications of RMT to wireless technology where probabilistic and analytic techniques from RMT are employed to estimate the capacity and performance of multiple-antenna communication systems with feedback.<br/><br/>Matrices and their spectra (eigenvalues) are fundamental objects throughout mathematics and its applications.  The study of random matrices (again, RMT) addresses the natural question: ""What do the eigenvalues of the typical matrix look like?""  Or, said another way: ""What properties of the spectra are universal in that they depend only on the rough characteristics (e.g. symmetries) of the matrix ensemble?"" It is therefore not surprising that RMT has serious impact in disparate areas of mathematics ranging from Statistics to Number Theory to Operator Algebras, as well as in Physics and Engineering.  On the theoretical front, this project brings new ideas to the study of the universal properties of the largest eigenvalues in symmetric matrices and also the bulk (or generic) eigenvalues in matrices without symmetry.  On the more directly applied side, this project looks at problems in the theory of wireless technology where, interestingly, the design and performance analysis of many efficient communication systems leads to mathematical problems cast in the language of RMT.  The engineering issues here are of the utmost practical importance - while the demand for wireless communications continues to grow, the spectrum remains a limited resource.  Presenting a natural setting for collaborations between mathematicians and electrical engineers, this project will sponsor joint meetings along with jointly mentored graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/>"

P. Feynman as a conceptual tool for the understanding of the quantum field theory of elementary particle physics. They provide a bridge from classical mechanics and field theory to their quantum counterparts.<br/>These integrals have become ubiquitous in physics and provide a foundation for our current understanding of a wide array of subjects: quantum electro and chromodynamics, the standard model of elementary particle physics, the theory of superconductivity, the statistical mechanics of phase transitions, turbulence, financial derivatives, and much more.<br/> From a mathematical standpoint the main question they pose is that of the construction and study of infinite dimensional probability measures in spaces of functions or distributions.<br/>The last decades have seen impressive results and successes in this area, and key to these successes is the renormalization group. The later can be described in nontechnical terms as follows. Consider a very large population of voters which have to opt between say two political parties. One can group them according to a hierarchy of larger and larger geographical regions, for instance county, state, nation, etc. One can also assign a `super elector' for each such region whose vote is determined by the majority at the next more detailed level of representation. In a nutshell the renormalization group is the transformation from the configurations of voting odds at one representation level to the next coarser one.<br/>The iteration of this transformation allows one to make predictions about the macroscopic behavior of this complex interacting system (the odds on say the majority vote at the national level)  starting from the microscopic behavior (a mathematical model for the odds at the level of individuals). The above analogy with voting is given simply for the sake of exposition. In physics, one would, instead of voters, consider for instance spins or magnetic moments at the atomic level, and try to use the renormalization group machinery in order to infer the overall magnetization of a piece of material such as iron.<br/><br/>The importance of the renormalization group in physics lies not in the mere qualitative description given above, but rather  in  the quantitative approximation scheme  which has been developed on the basis of this intuition. The main goal of the proposed activity is to develop mathematical tools which allow a rigorous control of the error terms in this approximation scheme. The PI will in particular focus on the study of complete renormalization group trajectories between two fixed points, i.e., situations where one needs to control a system over the full range of scales from the infinitely small to the infinitely large. The PI will study such trajectories on a variety of models such as phi-four with a modified propagator in three dimensions, and the Gross-Neveu model in two dimensions.<br/>An important component of the proposed activity is graduate education. <br/>The PI will foster the involvement<br/>of graduate students in the proposed research work and will provide them with training in the mathematical tools from constructive quantum field theory and renormalization group theory needed in order to tackle research problems in the area."

He proposes to work (partly with Tom Liggett) to try to extend work of theirs (and others) on contact processes on trees: to prove a conjecture of Liggett which would complete a significant characterization of the three phases of the process on a homogeneous tree; to understand more fully the behavior in the three phases; and to use this detailed knowledge of the behavior to complete work with Robin Pemantle in which certain exponentially growing non-homogeneous trees are found where the branching random walk and/or the contact process only have one phase transition.  Alan Stacey also proposes to extend methods developed by van den Berg to show almost sure uniqueness of the Gibbs measure of a two-dimensional spin-glass model at parameter values where the Gibbs measure for the corresponding Ising model is not unique.  He proposes to work on problems in percolation such as trying to prove that percolation occurs in certain models where this is not known for any non-trivial value of the parameters, including a percolation model with long-range dependencies which arises from a question about random walks on a graph; a more ambitious project (in the light of the unsuccessful attempts by many distinguished probabilists) is to show that the percolation probability at the critical value is zero for standard bond percolation in three dimensions.  Stacey also proposes to work on an appealing conjecture that the rates of convergence are the same for two different Markov chains arising from a card-shuffling situation.    The problems described concern mathematical models for important physical and biological processes such as the spread of disease and the growth of populations (both human, and those consisting of other organisms).  Although the mathematical descriptions are abstract and are not typically based on one specific real-world situation, a detailed understandi ng of the abstract models helps one to understand and predict important physical model; indeed, one or two simply described mathematical models can be of relevance to a very large number of physical systems.  One key phenomenon common to the abstract models and the empirical observations is phase transitions: a system can exhibit two or more quite different types of behavior (or phases) under different conditions; a classic example is that of a disease which may spread out of control under certain conditions and fizzle out under different circumstances.  The change from one phase to another is often quite dramatic and can be the result of a very small change in the parameters on which the system depends, such as the susceptibility of the individuals in a population or (in another classic example of phase transition -- that of a substance turning from a solid to a liquid) the temperature. The work proposed explores the nature of the phase transition and the types of phases that can occur in a number of different models.  They include the contact process --  a model for the spread of disease --  which can exhibit two phases in certain environments, and three phases in others; and spin glasses -- which model magnetism in a substance with impurities -- where, in a certain case, it is thought that no phase transition exists and the system has similar behavior at all temperatures; but this conjecture is not yet proven."

In this case it is of interest to know which   initial configurations converge to which stationary distributions.  For the contact process   the complete convergence theorem provides the perfect answer to the above question.   This solution may be carried over to a large class of supercritical, attractive, reversible   nearest particle systems.  Such a complete convergence theorem cannot hold for the   critical reversible nearest particle systems as finite systems die out almost surely.    Mountford is interested in examining the above question in this case. The convergence   question for the voter model is well understood and a good description of the stationary   distributions is given, but it remains difficult to address large deviation and percolation   issues. Mountford wishes to investigate these and similar questions. Mountford will also   continue his work on the structure of level sets for the Brownian sheet, in collaboration   with Professor Robert Dalang.   Professor Mountford is continuing his work on interacting particle systems.    Interacting particle systems are processes where a large (often infinite) population have   associated variables that evolve in random fashion; a particular individual's variable will   typically evolve according to its value and those of its close neighbors.  For instance the   population may be trees in an orchard, the variable values may be sick or healthy and an   individuals value may change from sick to healthy or vice-versa depending on the health   and sickness values of the immediately surrounding trees.  These processes provide a rich   family of models for the spread of disease, the propagation of knowledge, the   establishment of consensus. The subject of interacting particle systems for infinite   populations becomes particularly interesting when the system admits distinct equilibria.   The n one important issue is to say which (if any) equilibrium a system will converge to,   when starting from a given initial configuration. Another important area of research is to   describe the distinct equilibria.  If the population is large but finite, then although usually   there is only one equilibrium, multiple equilibria in the corresponding infinite population   translate into the existence of initial configurations for the finite system that take a very   long time to reach equilibrium."

The main objects of interest in this proposal are the ergodic behavior and the relaxation patterns of several interacting particle systems, including Ising models and other lattice spin systems, contact processes on arbitrary graphs, growth models and cellular automata.  Several of the proposed problems have their motivation in phenomena observed in nature as, for example, metastable states of systems in the vicinity of phase transition regions.   The Principal Investigator will study problems in interacting particle systems.  These are models for systems which contain a large number of  similar components and in which each component interacts in a simple way with a few other ones.  For instance one can think of the atoms in a crystal interacting when they are close enough, or individuals in a large population which may suffer or not from some infection with contamination occurring between neighbors.  The local interaction may involve a substantial amount of randomness, but since the system as a whole is large, one expects and indeed observes a much more predictable behavior at the global level.  A great deal of interest in such   systems stems from the fact that the qualitative behavior of the whole system may depend in non-trivial ways on parameters which are built into the local interactions, but which only affect those in a smooth way (for example, the rate of infection between neighboring individuals in the second example above).  The general issues of interest are then the understanding of which sort of equilibria can be reached by such types of stochastic dynamics, how an equilibrium state is reached, and how the parameters which affect the local rules may affect the answers to these questions."

Various phenomena such as phase transition, symmetry                     breaking and consequences of renormalization can be predicted by                varying these perameters.  Except in very simple situations, the                proofs of these predictions are difficult to accomplish                         rigorously.

The contact process   on a homogeneous tree has two critical values, and hence three distinct parameter regions   of interest.  The most important from the point of view of this project is the middle one, in   which there is weak survival.  In this region, it is proposed to extend Liggett's earlier   construction of radially symmetric stationary distributions, and more generally, to   investigate the structure of the set of all extremal stationary distributions.  One approach   to this proceeds via a conjecture made by him concerning the size of a certain growth   parameter.  Another problem is to determine the asymptotics of the larger critical value as   the coordination number of the tree increases.  Finally, there is the issue of how long it   takes for the contact process on a finite part of the tree to die out, and how this depends   on the parameter value.  The exclusion process to be considered is one dimensional and   asymmetric, and homogeneous except for one bond, which is slower than the others.  The   problem is to determine the effect of this slow bond on the structure of the set of   stationary distributions.  The problems for voter models and reaction diffusion processes   deal with regions of ergodicity and nonergodicity.     A significant number of areas of physics and biology involve situations in which a large number of agents evolve in time in such a way that the evolution of each agent is affected by the states of the others.  The agents could be atoms in a crystal, or parasites in a host population, for example.  In many of these situations, there is some quantity (temperature, say) which affects the way in which the interaction occurs, and in many cases, the evolution of the system is changed drastically when this quantity changes by a small amount.  The area known as interacting particle systems is the branch o f probability theory that studies such issues.  The models to be studied in this project are among the more important which arise in this area. The contact process is related to spread of infection, exclusion processes model particle motion, voter models have a socio-political   interpretation, and reaction diffusion processes model systems in which growth and   motion both occur.  Stationary distributions are descriptions of the possible long time   states of a system.  A main issue for each class of models is to determine what these are,   and how their structure depends on the quantity which specifies the strength of the   interaction."

These representations contain all of the information of the original spin-system and, in the best of cases, provide a definitive signal (percolation) for phase transitions or phase coexistence.  The most familiar example of such a representation is the random cluster representation for the q-state Potts model.  Recently, a number of new graphical representations associated with other models have emerged.  In addition to their intrinsic interest, the study of these problems is important for two reasons: (i) The representations provide a powerful analytical tool with which to study the underlying statistical mechanics problem.  (ii) The representations are the basis of the cluster methods, a modern class of Monte Carlo algorithms that allow for the rapid simulation of these (underlying) problems. To realize item (ii) and, for the most part item (i) as well, it is essential to achieve ""the best of cases"" i.e. demonstrate that the phase transition in the statistical mechanics problem is mirrored by a percolation transition in the graphical representation.  In general, the PI will continue research on the development of new graphical representations and cluster algorithms with an eye towards the construction of algorithms in equilibrium statistical mechanics and other problems that are computationally complex.<br/><br/>This research may be described as follows:  The primitive mathematical descriptions of interacting systems necessarily involves a great deal of superfluous information.  At best this information is simply of no importance and at worst, it can obscure the subtle effects that are the object of study. Graphical representations present an alternative description.  Although the mathematical content of the description is identical to the original, the form is quite different:  Much of the superfluous information is pushed into the background and the interesting features are often exhibited rather dramatically as geometric phenomena.  Of further importance is that these geometric representations are the key ingredient in a class of computer algorithms (cluster algorithms) that are used in statistical physics.  Until recently, only a handful of systems have admitted such descriptions but the situation has improved a great deal in the last few years.  Progress will continue in expanding the scope of the applicability of these methods both in equilibrium statistical mechanics an in other area where computational complexity forbids the straightforward approach.<br/>"

There are six individual projects, all of which they have already analyzed to some degree. The first project concerns an approach to a general theory of discontinuous phase transitions. For a certain class of nearest neighbor attractive systems on the usual d-dimensional cubic lattices they can show that whenever the associated mean field theory predicts a discontinuous phase transition, the actual system also undergoes a discontinuous transition whenever the dimension d is large. The second project is a proposal to study a model which emulates, through a deterministic evolution of a random environment, the celebrated SOC sandpile models. Third, they study systems at points of phase coexistence in a statistical ensemble fixing the excess of the minority phase in the system. It appears that, in a correct scaling, there is a sharp value of minority-phase volume where a droplet of the minority phase spontaneously emerges. Fourth, they will investigate certain percolation systems which locally appear similar to percolation on the complete graph but contain an underlying geometrical structure that is absent in the usual complete graph systems. In the fifth project, they will study a variety of interacting random walks with both attractive and repulsive (and mixed) interactions. The final project concerns the correct definition of thermodynamic limit of the free energy in polydisperse systems, e.g., systems with a continuum of particle species. <br/> The Principal Investigators will be examining a number of problems (six in the proposal with more on the horizon) in the area of Statistical Mechanics or closely related fields. The essence of these problems concerns systems consisting of simple constituents which interact in a simple manner. However, since there are a myriad of these constituents it turns out that such systems are capable of highly complex behavior. Of particular interest is the phenomena of phase transitions in which the entire collective character of the system undergoes a drastic change. This notion is either at the heart of or just behind the scenes in all of the systems that are proposed for study. One project concerns a demonstration that ""most"" systems undergo a more catastrophic sort of transition sometimes known as a phase change of the first kind. A second line of investigation concerns the formation of droplets (e.g. raindrops) which, as it turns out, takes place on a submacroscopic scale known as a mesoscopic scale. Third, under investigation is the infiltration of ""disturbances"" in a system which -- from one perspective -- models a social network. Fourth, there will be investigations of systems in which the above mentioned elementary constituents are all of different (but closely related) character. The remainder of the investigations concern the so called percolation and random walk systems. While these models have their origins in the study of chemical polymers, the applications cover a large range of topics, one of which, in modern terms, is the dissemination of information in communications networks. <br/>"

These are random systems consisting of an infinite array of connected values which evolve according to simple rules governed by the current state of neighboring values.  What makes these processes interesting, both mathematically and scientifically, is that often there exist multiple, qualitatively different, equilibria for the same process.  A major task is finding or characterizing all possible equilibria.  Currently Professor Mountford is working on this question for the exclusion process.  This is a process where particles try to move independently in a random fashion.  The (interesting) interacting part of the process comes from the rule that no two particles can occupy the same position and so moves by particles that would result in multiple occupancy are suppressed.<br/>"

Recent work of the investigator showed the existence of stationary blocking measures in one dimension under weak assumptions. The next set of problems concerns the existence of nonblocking stationary profile measures in one dimension and of nonreversible stationary blocking measures in higher dimensions -- in neither case are there any known examples. Other problems involve (a) connections between the symmetric exclusion process and negative dependence, (b) the extent to which the known theory of the symmetric exclusion process extends to processes with a few asymmetries, (c) the analysis of some infinite systems motivated by the investigator's recent work on a class of models in sociology, and (d) the computation of the critical values for a family of reversible growth models on homogeneous trees. <br/> Many problems in the natural and social sciences involve the behavior of large numbers of individuals (people, molecules, cars, viruses, etc.) that interact in unpredictable ways. This lack of predictability is modeled by randomness. One of the fundamental contributions of probability theory in the past century is the realization that large populations display a significant amount of predictability and order in spite of the lack of predictability of the actions of the individuals in the population. This project is aimed at gaining a better understanding of several models of this general type. Among them are: (a) the exclusion process, which models particle motion, traffic flow, and the behavior of ribosomes in biology, (b) certain growth models that are partly motivated by tumor growth and conflicts between competing populations, and (c) models from sociology, in which relationships among individuals are altered by the exchange of gifts or rewards.

Specifically, we look at random walks on the d-dimensional Euclidean lattice, whose transition probabilities are a stationary random field indexed by the vertices of the lattice. Most emphasis will be put on i.i.d. environments. In general the behavior of RWRE can be very different from that of regular random walk. Both in one-dimension and in non-elliptic multidimensional environments, one may witness phenomena that do not exist in regular random walk, such as sub-ballisticity (i.e. when the walk is transient in a certain direction, but move at asymptotic speed zero) and sub-diffusivity (i.e. when the typical distance from the origin grows at a scale that is significantly less than the square-root of the time). In many other cases the RWRE is conjectures to behave similarly to the regular random walk. However, proofs are known only for few cases, most notably for reversible environments and for environments that are small perturbations of the simple random walk. Despite the rapid progress in recent years, many basic questions regarding RWRE are still open, most notably the question of 0-1 law for directional transience and the question of ballisticity for directionally transient random walk in random high-dimensional elliptic environments.<br/><br/>Random walks are one of the most studied objects in probability theory. Its importance stems, in part, from the fact that it is a natural model for many real world phenomena such as diffusion, migration and even market fluctuations, and as a natural tool in the study of other objects such as laplace equations, heat conductance and more. While the theory of simple random walks is well developed, most of its techniques rely heavily on the perfect regularity of the environments in which it takes place. Since in many real-world models such regularity does not hold, RWRE is, in fact, a better representation of real-world phenomena than the simple random walk. Thus our aim is to develop new techniques that will facilitate study of RWRE.<br/>"

The third category of projects deals with problems related to conformal invariance in 2D critical models. Here the fractal properties of the so-called SLE boundaries will be investigated and a model of random fractal trees will be analyzed. The final category involves problems of small-world phenomena. The specific problem of interest here is the growth of the graph distance in a critical model of Euclidean-based random graphs.<br/><br/>On a broader level, the proposal hopes to address a series of questions that all have their origin in physics, chemistry, engineering and/or social sciences. A particular attention will be paid to the phenomena of phase transitions in which the overall character of the system undergoes a sudden, and often rather drastic, change while the external conditions vary smoothly through a particular, transitional, value.  Examples of such transitions are ample in physical sciences (e.g., freezing or melting in physical chemistry) and engineering (e.g., jams in internet traffic); but they also have their natural counterparts in social sciences (e.g., opinion spreading in social networks). Much of this proposal is spent on studying very specific mathematical problems of these types. For instance, one of the proposed projects deals with the appearance of magnetism in transition-metal compounds, another offers to shed some light on the theoretical aspects of brine-pocket formation in the sea ice, yet another project is devoted to the ""degree of separation"" of two individuals (or computer servers) in a thinly connected (communication) network. The common ground of several of these problems is the need of proper mathematical tools for their successful resolution. One of the goals of the present proposal is to develop such tools and disseminate their main ideas to the scientific community at large.<br/><br/>"

The main thrust of this research is to pursue the  development of abstract tools of probability in particular in  relationship with the classical idea of isoperimetry. It was  realised by the investigator that the classical idea of  isoperimetry can be made meaningful in a much more general  setting than was previously believed. This gave rise to new  families of inequalities that have solved numerous problems in  abstract probability, and had impact in areas where probability  is a tool rather than an object of study in itself, and in  particular operation research and theoretical computer science.

Another area of interest is the connection with                    nonlinear partial differential equations.  By mixing the                        particles at a fast rate and scaling space, the system converges                to a nonlinear partial differential equation.

The goal is to show that on a macroscopic scale the conserved quantities evolve according to  deterministic conservation laws which usually take the form of nonlinear partial differential equations.  Of particular interest are the transport coefficients and how they arise from the microscopic dynamics, in particular in the nongradient models where there is a net effect of fluctuations.  Several types of nongradient models will be studied:  Models of disordered systems,  models of surfaces and interfaces, and lattice gas models for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.    A fundamental, and still largely open, problem is to understand how large systems of microscopic particles organize themselves to produce the collective macroscopic behavior we see in the world around us.  The investigator is pursuing this goal on models in which the microscopic dynamics has some degree of randomness.  The research includes models of transport in disordered media which come from condensed matter physics, models of surfaces and interfaces, and lattice gas models for incompressible fluid flow.  Besides providing a rigorous justification for the macroscopic conservation laws, other important consequences of these investigations are intrinsic formulas for transport coeffiaients, and precise estimates of the deviations of these microscopic systems from their macroscopic limits."

More specifically, the main problems deal with first-passage percolation, ordinary percolation and central limit theorems for optimizing functionals. For the usual first-passage percolation model the proposer wishes to establish some general properties of the asymptotic shape of the set of points which can be reached in a large time; this asymptotic shape should be strictly contained between a romboid and a cube. He also is investigating how the asymptotic shape varies when one allows the passage-time of a vertex to be dependent on how many neighbors have already been reached. In ordinary percolation the investigator (with several colleagues) is investigating the distribution of the size of the largest cluster in a big box, and hopes to establish a number of analogues to known results for the largest cluster on a complete graph in which each edge is present with a certain probability (the Erdos-Renyi random graph). Finally, in a different area, he is attempting to prove central limit theorems for some optimizing functionals which are somewhat similar to minimal spanning trees.   The problems in this proposal are motivated in part by statistical physics and by behavior of certain optimization algorithms. Through the first part of this work one gains insight into the large time behavior of some stochastic growth models, and how variations in the local rules (i.e., rules for the behavior of the system in small neighborhoods) influence the global behavior of the system. The research on optimization algorithms deal with quantities which depend on the distances between a large number of randomly chosen points.  These studies are expected to give us an understanding of the typical behavior of some difficult and important optimization problems for which no good computational methods are known at present."

This proposal concerns three topics  related to the infinitely-many-alleles model with selection.  The  first topic involves the simplest FV process with selection, and  the aim is to obtain an explicit formula for the transition  function (albeit less explicit than in the neutral case).  The  second topic concerns a model introduced by Tachida (referred to  by him as a nearly neutral mutation model), which can be  formulated as an FV process with an unbounded selection intensity  function.  The aim is establish uniqueness and study the ergodic  properties of the model, with the hope of explaining some of  Tachida's simulation findings.  The third topic involves the  concept of allelic genealogy introduced by Takahata and Nei.  One  can formulate an FV process that keeps track of such genealogies  in the infinitely-many-alleles setting.  There are several open  problems in the neutral case, but the challenge is to analyze the  selective models in a more rigorous way.  This proposal is concerned with certain stochastic (i.e., random)  processes in population genetics.  Each individual in a  population is assumed to be of some genetic ""type.""  The  processes model the evolution of the frequencies of the various  types in the population, taking into account such genetic factors  as random mating, mutation, and natural selection.  Letting the  set of possible types be arbitrary (in particular, infinite)  allows one to model the ``infinitely many alleles'' assumption.   It also allows one to incorporate historical or genealogical  information into the description of an individual's type.  Three  problems, concerning three specific models (each from the  biological literature), are proposed.  The problems are concerned  with providing a better mathematical understanding of the models  and possibly explaining certain phenomena discovered empirically   by biologists.  Each model involves selection, which complicates  it considerably, but makes it of greater interest than simply the  neutral case would be.  The difficulty with selection is that one  cannot obtain closed systems of linear equations for the  quantities of interest.  Nevertheless, several ideas are proposed  that should help to overcome this."

The geometric objects in question are often very simple and natural, and can sometimes serve as mathematical models for phenomena in other scientific fields. For example, geometry and algebra have led to new results about Markov chains, which are used for simulations in many areas of science and applied mathematics. In addition, geometric insights often lead to the discovery of new relations between a priori unrelated concepts.  <br/>"

Much of this rapidly evolving DNA consists of repeated sequences of various length. The mechanisms of creation and evolution of these repeats are important for both theoretical reasons and for understanding the recently discovered disorders involving expansion of repeated DNA. We have been engaged for a long time in building mathematical and statistical models in this field. Now, as more biological information is becoming available, we propose further extensions of our modeling. We managed to enlist collaboration of competent biological consultants.

These estimators are suggested by  blocking techniques and robust statistical procedures such as the  bootstrap and the jackknife. The estimators can be used as  selfnormalizers in the Central Limit Theorem.  One of the main problems of statistics is to provide interval  estimates for some unknown parameters. These confidence intervals  are constructed based on an estimator of the parameter and an  error given by the variability of this estimator. The purpose of  this research is to study this problem in the case when the data  is dependent."

The principal ones deal with systems of weakly interacting random walks and with rho-percolation.  In the random walk systems one starts with one particle at each site of the integer lattice in d dimensions and lets each particle perform a continuous time random walk on this lattice.  Interactions occur only when a particle jumps to a site which is itself occupied or is adjacent to an occupied site.  In this case the particle which just jumped may coalesce with one of the particles at or adjacent to the site to which it jumped.  In another version the particle which just jumped may annihilate another particle.  The asymptotic density of such systems will be investigated.  Rho-percolation has the same set-up as ordinary site percolation.  The sites of a lattice are independently chosen to be occupied or vacant with probability p or 1-p, respectively.  One says that rho-percolation occurs if there exists an infinite self-avoiding path on the lattice whose lower density of occupied sites is at least rho.  The proposer intends to investigate analogues of various power bounds which are already known or conjectured for ordinary percolation.<br/><br/>This research will study problems about systems of particles which undergo random motion and which have an interaction which removes particles from the system when two particles come close to each other.  One motivation for studying such systems is that they can be viewed as crude models for certain chemical reactions.  It is hoped that the variants of the model proposed for investigation here are somewhat more realistic than the models usually considered.  Another, unrelated, class of problems in the proposal considers a system which undergoes a phase transition.  Almost all materials have phase transitions at some temperature or magnetic field.  Even though a great deal is known in statistical physics on the non rigorous level about phase transitions, they are still only poorly understood on a mathematical level.  It is hoped that interesting and instructive calculations can be carried out for the relatively new model of rho-percolation.<br/>"

One of the targets is the boundary theory of superdiffusion on a differentiable manifold  and related problems on the equation Lu=F(u) where L is the second order elliptic differential operator and F is a nonlinear function. Among the problems are the description of all positive solutions and their behavior at the Martin boundary, and criteria for removable boundary singularities in terms of the Martin capacity.  This part of the project has been prepared for by an intensive study, done in the last years,  of the case of a bounded domain with a smooth boundary in a Euclidean space. Another direction iq the investigation of the structure of the most general branching measure-valued process. Previous results have been obtained under an assumption that the second moment of the total mass is finite. There is a hope to remove or to weaken this restriction by using recent progress in the theory of linear additive functionals.  During the last decade branching measure-valued processes  also known as superprocesses  have attracted a great deal of effort from many investigators around the world.  Interest in these processes is motivated by their applications to biology, especially, to population genetics. On the other hand, this class of processes provides new tools for the study of complex physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom."

Conference organizers structure activities to provide as much opportunity as possible for discussions among conference participants, and to create an environment that is welcoming of young researchers and graduate students who wish to present their work.  Several introductory short courses on topics ranging from stochastic calculus with financial applications, to graphical models, and model selection in a Bayesian framework, are taught.  In addition, special discussion sessions on course topics are organized, to facilitate the interaction between young researchers and their more senior colleagues. <br/><br/><br/>In the past twelve years, collaboration between Latin American and US mathematical scientists has increased many-fold.  One important consequence has been the growth of well-trained students from Latin American institutions who choose to enroll in graduate programs in American universities and who then develop close and enduring ties to the US academic community.  In part, this increased interaction is due to the series of Latin American conferences in probability and statistics, that are generally held every two years in a Latin American country, and that typically include a significant contingent of US participants.  The conferences have grown both in size and importance over time, and have contributed to the creation of a community of applied probabilists and statisticians who are eager to work in interdisciplinary teams to solve complex problems of importance to society.  The National Science Foundation, through its funding of travel awards for US scientists and for scientists from selected Latin American countries excluding Cuba , has been an important sponsor of these workshops.  The funding requested from NSF for the IX Latin American conference will be used to partially cover travel expenses of 10 US participants and of six Latin American conference participants  from countries other than Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Venezuela.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>"

Parisi. These models are simple mathematical objects. It is remarkable that they exhibit such a subtle behavior, and that their rigorous study is so challenging. The PI believes that elucidating these models will bring the discovery of an entire new direction in probability theory. He has been trying for 10 years to build new methods to study them. One of the fundamental objectives (the proof of the Parisi formula giving the free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model) has been attained, but this success cannot hide the fact that overall our understanding remains rather limited. In particular, two central questions, (known as the Ultrametricity conjecture and the Chaos problem) seem as hard as ever. They are possibly related to questions of analysis.  The PI plans to work on these very hard questions, but also will strive to make incremental progress on less daunting issues, in particular the study of new mathematically canonical mean field Hamiltonians that exhibit replica symmetric equations of a new type. <br/><br/><br/>     Mathematics and Physics have influenced each other in fundamental ways since at least Galileo, and this mutual influence is stronger than ever. In the seventies, Physicists discovered that certain alloys (called spin glasses) responded in an unconventional way to magnetic simulation. They introduced new models to explain these behaviors. These models are simple and natural mathematical objects. Yet for a long time there existed no mathematical method to study them.  The early work of the physicists uses heuristic methods that need not be completely reliable. The present project it a step in the long range program of eliminating this discrepancy, by developing new tools from mathematics, and in particular probability theory, to completely understand these fundamental models. The long rang outcome of this program could be a new impetus on probability theory, one of the most important branch of mathematics for applications. <br/>"

We will obtain rigorous results for the sequentially Markovian coalescent, which has recently been introduced as an approximation for genealogies with recombination, investigate the nature of regulatory sequence evolution in Drosophila and other organisms with large effective population size; study the subfunctionalization explanation of the persistence of gene duplicates, and consider random Boolean networks, in order to gain insights into gene networks. Inspired by ecology, we will use spatial models to understand conditions needed for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation between individuals, and we will investigate changes that occur when the parameters governing the interactions in predator-prey and epidemic models evolve.<br/>The last decade has seen the generation of incredible amounts of DNA sequence data. However, having the text of the instruction manual that controls life is just the beginning, we need to understand how the expression of genes is controlled and how genes interact in biological networks. These interactions cannot be directly observed so one needs to develop mathematical models to test hypotheses, and to infer how genetic systems evolved to operate as they do. In particular, our research will investigate (i) how rapidly changes can occur due to regulatory sequence evolution, which is commonly quoted explanation for many of the differences between humans and chimpanzees, (ii) whether or not the subfunctionalization hypothesis provides a satisfactory explanation of the paradox of the preservation of gene duplicates, and (iii) to improve our understanding the patterns of variations caused by adaptive evolution. These are just three examples of many at the interface between biology and mathematics. An important aspect of our proposal is to train graduate students to work in this exciting area.<br/>"

The proponent will <br/>continue a study of the likely shapes of random plane and solid diagrams, and will try <br/>to answer open questions formulated in two recent studies of an optimal partitioning <br/>problem, conducted jointly with Borgs, Chayes and Mertens. <br/><br/>However idealized, the random graph methodology provides a way to describe dynamics<br/>of large evolving networks. We hope that our work on the graph processes will contribute <br/>to a better understanding of an ""abrupt change"" phenomenon characteristic<br/>for real-life networks, when addition of few connections leads to formation of a tight<br/>""core"". Our continued study of the partitioning problem will provide a deeper insight<br/>into critical dependence of its algorithmic complexity on the relations between the random<br/>input parameters. We believe that this analysis will serve as a model<br/>for study of a broader class of combinatorial optimization problems important in<br/>applications, such as the ""knapsack"" problem and the ""bin packing"" problems.<br/>"

The first problem is to develop tools for using local mixing properties of a Markov chain to understand convergence in the global sense of the mixing time. The investigator hopes to apply these tools to analyze the connection between spatial mixing and temporal mixing in spin sytems. The investigator will also study problems relating to exclusion processes. One example is Aldous's conjecture that in the symmetric exclusion process the spectral gap does not depend on the number of particles. Further problems concern asymmetric exclusion; for some of these models the mixing time is believed to be lower than the corresponding symmetric version but existing techniques cannot verify this.<br/><br/>  In recent years a large body of mathematics has been developed relating to finding the mixing time of a Markov chain. A problem that illustrates this body of research is that of determining how many shuffles are necessary to randomize a deck of cards. Here, mathematicians have had great success, finding very precise answers for many models of card shuffling. However, interest in mixing times is not limited to card shuffling since Markov chains are a crucial tool for applications in a wide range of areas. Simulations of Markov chains consume an enormous number of computer cycles each year and are applied in such areas as computer algorithms, statistics and statistical physics.<br/>"

Some fundamental problems in this field were solved during the last three years which opens new directions of research.  These directions will be explored.  In particular, new probabilistic tools will be applied to problems on nonlinear differential equations.

The aim of the first project is to show that edge reinforced walks for which each edge is reinforced only once, by a fixed amount, are not so different from the classical random walks.

He will investigate matrix ensembles that share similarities with such laws, and may lead to new matrix models for the corresponding free probability laws.

Such processes, not surprisingly, turn out to be Markov; but surprisingly they exhibit intimate connections to noncommutative probability, and in particular to free probability that usually arises as approximation to spectra of large random matrices.

The physicists predict the emergence   under very general conditions of a kind of self-organization called ultrametricity. We suspect that the root of this phenomenon lies in a family of probabilistic identities discovered a few years ago by Ghirlanda and Guerra and we plan to investigate whether  this is really the case.  A somewhat different direction of the proposal plans to focus on the general theory of stochastic processes. There are indications that some new structure theorems are possible, that would in some precise sense affirm that if  certain types of stochastic processes are well-behaved according to their sample boundedness properties, then there is simple ``witness'' of their good behavior. This would imply that when trying to decide whether a specific stochastic process has a good behavior, this can be done only by finding the appropriate witness and by no other means. Both part of the proposal represent a genuinely new direction of Probability theory. <br/><br/>A growing number of large scale operations (safety of electrical networks, safety of nuclear plants, finance) essentially depend on tools from Probability theory. This proposal investigates two new directions in this theory. The first concerns the emergence in certain large random structures of remarkable kind of self-organization discovered by theoretical physicists. The second attempts to prove that there is a kind of universal method to control how large can be the ``worst occurrence'' of certain random quantities, and that therefore it is useless to attempt to do this in any other way than as prescribed by the universal method."

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) Pinning and depinning of lattice polymers and interfaces due to potentials existing in lower-dimensional subspaces of the lattice. Particular emphasis will be placed on the disordered case, in which the potential varies randomly with location. Competition between a potential in a subspace and random potentials in the bulk will also be considered. (2) Models in which certain features of the freezing of solutions can be rigorously derived from a local interaction. (3) The Ising model, conditioned, by fixing an excess of the minority spin, so as to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, with emphasis on the critical size of this excess and the width of the droplet-formation ""transition"" as this critical size threshold is crossed. (4) Moving interfaces, e.g. between phases of the Ising model, which may ""hang up"" at locations where a weakened interaction reduces the energetic cost of the interface, resulting in an energy barrier which must be crossed. (5) Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the two-dimensional Potts model and their relation to decay rates of certain probabilities in the FK model. (6) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are opposed to each other. <br/> With regard to intellectual merit, this work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reflect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors; (iv) denaturation of DNA; and (v) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small-scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. Some of the systems, which Alexander will investigate--percolation, random cluster models, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems--are examples of such abstract systems. Other systems, which Alexander will investigate, are somewhat more closely based on specific physical systems, such as polymers, DNA molecules, and solutions."

A main thrust of the research aims at deepening our understanding of canonical $U$-statistics and $U$-processes by investigating exponential and moment inequalities (what are the true analogues for $U$-statistics of the Rosenthal-Pinelis and Bernstein's inequalities? is there a uniform Bernstein, or uniform Prohorov inequality such as the recent inequality of Talagrand for collections of sums of independent random variables?) and limit theorems, particularly the law of the iterated logarithm. These results may be obtained for generalized $U$-statistics, including multilinear forms in independent random variables. Applications of these topics in Statistics, particularly censored data, will also be pursued. A second object of study are selfnormalized sums of independent random variables, particularly in connection with the bootstrap and with the Student t-statistic. Finally, the P.I. is also interested in exploring the application of the modern theory of empirical processes and its techniques in different areas such as asymptotics of the fluctuations of the occupation measure process for multiple particle systems, and estimation and testing based on different functionals of the empirical process.<br/> The empirical measure is shorthand for the description of a series of data points. Sums of independent random variables and empirical processes can be thought of as single integrals of functions of one variable with respect to this measure, and $U$-statistics and $U$-processes, as multiple integrals with respect to the empirical measure of functions of several variables. First order asymptotic statistics is often based on limit theorems for sums of independent random variables and processes, but more refined second order properties require limit theory for $U$-statistics and processes (in a way, in analogy with the use of higher order derivatives versus only the first derivative when studying functions in Calculus). Although $U$-statistics were introduced in the forties, their asymptotic theory has not been close to reaching its final form until recently, in part due to previous efforts by this P.I. and collaborators; the proposed research aims at completing this chapter of Classical Probability for $U$-statistics, and at advancing the theory of $U$-processes, by obtaining best possible distributional and moment inequalities and laws of the iterated logarithm. This research will also include applications in survival analysis. In another direction, it is accepted wisdom that normalizing sums of independent random variables by certain quantities that depend on themselves rather than numerical constants improves the convergence properties (in particular, then, statistical procedures based on such selfnormalized quantities may have good properties, the leading and oldest example of this being the famous Student t-statistic and test). But this must be shown at each instance. The P.I. would like to study some questions related to selfnormalized sums, particularly in connection with the bootstrap. Empirical process theory vigorously developed during the last two decades (with substantial contributions by this P.I.) and, since then, its impact on different fields of stochastics has not ceased to increase (in classical asymptotic statistics, information theory, neural networks, machine learning, model selection, statistical mechanics, etc.), and the P.I. would like to continue applying it to different statistics and probability problems of current interest."

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) The Ising model conditioned, by fixing an excess of the minority spin, so as to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, with emphasis on the critical size of this excess and the discrepancy between the actual and ideal shape of this droplet. (2) Percolation models also conditioned to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, with emphasis on lower bounds for the local fluctuations of the boundary. (3) Mixing properties and decay of correlations and connectivities for spin systems and percolation models, particularly in finite volumes. (4) The spectral gap and rate of convergence to equilibrium, for the stochastic Ising model at low temperature. (5) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are opposed to each other. (6) The use of percolation ideas to create a model which mimics certain features of the freezing of water which contains impurities. The project aids human resource development through the support of one Ph.D. student working on similar problems.<br/><br/>This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reflect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors; (iv) composite materials with special properties; and (v) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small-scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. The systems which Alexander will investigate--percolation, random cluster models, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems--are examples of such abstract systems."

Limit theorems play a fundamental role in the development of probability and statistics. The principal investigator continues his study in this direction in general, focusing on self-normalized limit theorems in particular. The investigator intends to systematically study moderate deviations for self-normalized sums of independent random variables, for Hotelling's t-statistic and for studentized $U$-statistic. The objective is to establish a Cramer type moderate deviation theorem under a finite third moment condition. Since the self-normalized moderate deviations require few moment conditions, they not only extend classical limit theorems but also provide much wider applicability to other fields, particularly to statistics. The study should also help us better understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since the t-statistic and U-statistic are their building blocks. Another area where limit theorems prove useful is the study of the real zeros of random algebraic and trigonometric polynomials. Such polynomials with random coefficients arise in many disciplines and their behavior is of interest to statisticians, engineers, economists, and mathematicians. The primary focus of the second topic is on estimating lower tail and small ball probabilities for Gaussian processes. These types of probabilities often arise in estimating the chances of rare events occurring in areas where such events are of fundamental importance such as weather prediction, natural disaster prediction and economic indices. One of the objectives is to develop new methods of estimating small ball and lower tail probabilities. The focus is specifically on small ball probabilities of the Brownian sheet in high dimensions and lower tail probabilities for stationary Gaussian processes. The investigator also intends to study basic sample properties for a newly introduced family of Gaussian processes which have the same scaling and time inversion properties as the Brownian motion but are infinitely differentiable.

Unlike the Gaussian case, there are infinitely many different stable sssi processes. This overwhelming variety may be regarded as a fundamental problem. One now has to understand how these processes are different or what it is that they have in common. However, non-Gaussianity also brings to the picture new tools that were unavailable in the Gaussian case. It has been known for quite some time now that non-Gaussian stable processes having some invariance property, like self-similarity or stationarity of the increments, can be associated with nonsingular flows. It is then based on some properties of these flows that one can describe the structure of the corresponding stable processes. The focus will be at first on an important subclass of stable sssi processes called self-similar mixed moving averages. The connection of self-similar mixed moving averages to nonsingular flows allows one to decompose them into separate, independent processes and then explore each part in the decomposition separately.<br/> The purpose of this research is to better understand a class of random processes that have characteristics that one encounters in many areas of applications. Examples of such processes include the limit of the so-called renewal reward processes applied in telecommunications and ""random wavelet expansions"" introduced in probabilistic modeling of images. These processes are fractal-like. They display scale invariance and tend to take often extreme values that deviate greatly from the mean. Their mathematical structure is complex. The goal of this research is to develop tools that can be used to analyze that structure"

Sensitive criteria in MDP's permit adjustments for the underselectiveness of the average per unit time reward criterion in cases where initial stages are important and they also provide deeper insight into the nature of optimality conditions and equations. Up to now, sensitive criteria have been studied only for MDP's with finite or countable state spaces. Models with a continuous state space are more relevant in many applications, for instance, when there are incomplete observations. The purpose of the proposed research is to extend the theory of sensitive criteria to MDP's with a Borel state space. First of all models with an absolutely continuous transition function will be studied. For such models, we expect to obtain (by means of limit theorems for general state space Markov chains, Laurent expansions of resolvents, and, especially, new techniques for aggregation and compactification of the set of feedback controls) the following results: 1)validity of the lexicographical optimality equation, 2) existence of deterministic stationary sensitively optimal policies, and 3) effectiveness of a lexicographical policy improvement algorithm to get such a policy. Markov Decision Processes provide important tools for the analysis of many control and management optimization problems in which randomness plays a significant role. They are often used to optimize an operation's resource allocations among competing requirements (for example, inventory costs in maintaining a certain number of spare parts for a system versus down time costs for the system versus costs of repairing defective parts of the system in a given amount of time). In many of these problems, the long-run average cost (or reward) is the natural objective function to optimize. However, long-run average criteria are in sensitive to costs or rewards associated with initial stages, which, under certain circumstances, can lead to nonoptimal policies. Sensitive criteria have only been successfully analyzed for the case when the possible states of the system are finite or countable. There are many realistic situations, however, when the appropriate state space is a continuum, for example, when incomplete observations are involved, which is often the case. It is the purpose of this research to extend the theory of sensitive criteria to Markov Decision Processes with Borel state spaces (which are general enough to include all known situations of importance)."

This problem has applications to mathematical physics. Another concerns applying probabilistic techniques to the hot spots problem, a difficult problem in analysis. The hot spots problem is to determine where the solution to the heat equation with reflecting boundaries takes its maximum. A third problem is the estimation of the heat kernel, a problem that is related to partial differential equations. The heat equation for elliptic operators in divergence form has a fundamental solution that is comparable to that for the Laplacian. Is this true when the state space is not Euclidean space, but rather a more general manifold?<br/> Several problems in probability theory will be studied. They are all related to analysis and partial differential equations, in particular, to the heat equation. The heat equation governs the flow of heat as well as many other physical quantities.

In particular, Wiener Chaos decomposition is the key component of several new numerical algorithms for nonlinear filtering and of an efficient computational procedure for statistical moments of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in domains is necessary for development of a complete theory, similar to the one for deterministic partial differential equations. In addition to purely theoretical results about existence and uniqueness of solutions, this analysis leads to new numerical methods for such equations.

The educational objective of the project is to increase understanding of stochastic partial differential equations among the students and researchers both inside and outside of the mathematical community. This educational objective will be achieved by developing several basic and special topics courses and by organizing a research seminar on applications of stochastic partial differential equations."

Currently it is known that generic points have in the limit Poisson distributed return times. However near periodic orbits such regular behavior cannot be assumed and we intend to show that the limiting distribution is a compounded Poisson distribution where the compounded part is Bernoulli and determined by an `escape rate' near the periodic orbit.<br/><br/>(ii) The second area of research is to determine the limiting distribution for return times for non-uniformly hyperbolic systems.

The first topic is devoted to the study of limit theorems for self-normalized processes in general, and for self-normalized partial sums in particular. The normalizing constants in classical limit theorems are usually sequences of real numbers. Moment conditions or other related assumptions are necessary and sufficient for many classical limit theorems. However, the situation becomes very different when the normalizing constants are sequences of random variables. The recent discovery of the self-normalized large deviations shows that no moment conditions are needed for a large deviation type result. A self-normalized law of the iterated logarithm remains valid for all distributions in the domain of attraction of a normal or stable law. This reveals that the self-normalization preserves much better properties than deterministic normalization does. This also suggests many further questions, such as what is the rate of convergence of self-normalized approximation, what are necessary and sufficient conditions for the self-normalized law of the iterated logarithm, finding tail probabilities of self-normalized trimmed and censored sums, and finding self-normalized limit theorems for independent but not necessarily identically distributed random variables. The second topic concerns small ball probabilities for Gaussian processes which serve as models in many applications. Small ball probabilities provide sharp estimates for rare events. A primary focus of this part of research is a better understanding of rare random phenomena related to Gaussian processes.<br/><br/>The self-normalized sums are closely related to the celebrated ``Student t-statistic"" and studentized ``U-statistic"". This part of the research is related to determining when the t-statistic and U-statistic can safely be used. This study will help to understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since t- and U-statistics are their building blocks. The small ball problems often arise in estimating the chances for rare events to occur in areas where such events are of fundamental importance, such as weather, economic indices, and epidemics. The first part of this research may lead to the development of a new limit theory in probability and statistics while the second part of the research may provide significant new knowledge about Gaussian processes as well as about our random environments."

That problem has stymied engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists for years. Two great mathematicians, American, Norbert Wiener and Russian, Andrey Kolmogorov, first approached the problem during World War II. Rather than catching fly balls, Kolmogorov and Wiener were trying, in the days before computers, to develop mathematical algorithms that would help to track enemy aircraft by radar. The research started by Kolmogorov and Wiener has developed into a thriving area of applied mathematics known as Filtering Theory. Filtering, estimation of a signal or an image from noisy data, is the basic component of the data assimilation in target tracking. It is of central importance in navigation, image and signal processing, control theory, automatic tracking systems and other areas of engineering and science. This research is a joint collaborative effort between researchers at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Vilnius, Lithuania, and researchers at the University of Southern California. The project is devoted to applications of stochastic partial differential equations to nonlinear filtering. The focus of the research is twofold: (1) Cauchy- boundary problems for parabolic partial differential equations arising in nonlinear filtering of stochastic processes evolving under some constraints; and (2) nonlinear filtering with distributed observation and applications to tracking of low-observable targets in images. The research will also consider the numerical aspects of nonlinear filtering. It is expected that relatively simple nonlinear filtering algorithms which are not too demanding in computational and memory requirements for on-line implementation and yet are nearly optimal from a statistical viewpoint will be developed for a wide variety of applications. The applications include air traffic control, human-computer interfaces based on motion- capture, and advanced optical and magnetic registration systems."

Typically bifurcation occurs when a Lyapunov exponent changes sign. Stochastic averaging methods will be developed to calculate Lyapunov exponents, and rigorous results will relate the behavior of the linearized process to that of the underlying nonlinear system. The concepts of random sinks (depending on the past) and random sources (depending on the future) will be studied. The random sinks and sources may be single points, or sets of some (non-integer) Hausdorff dimension. A phase portrait for a random dynamical system will then consist of a mixture of past and future information.

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) The use of percolation ideas to analyze the behavior of two-dimensional incompressible flows with random potentials. (2) The properties of a new random cluster model which, like the standard FK random cluster model, is closely related to the Ising model. (3) The use of percolation ideas to create a model, defined on a small scale, for large-scale phenomena which occur when water containing impurities freezes. (4) The geometry of finite clusters, and its relation to the cluster size distribution, for certain continuum models of percolation. (5) The interrelation between percolation behavior of the graph and other properties for the ""minimal spanning forest"" of a stationary random labeled graph. (6) The size of the fluctuations in the boundary of the region which can be reached by a fixed time in first-passage percolation. Additionally, Alexander will investigate a string-matching problem related to the reconstruction of DNA sequences from many short overlapping segments. This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand how small-scale randomness is reflected in large-scale, or ""macroscopic,"" properties of various systems in the natural world. A typical example is a piece of iron--each atom has a magnetic field aligned in a particular direction. These directions are random, but nearby atoms tend to align in approximately the same direction, particularly when the temperature is low. In essence, the tendency toward randomness, which increases with temperature, competes with the tendency to align. Clusters of atoms with similar alignments--all ""up,"", all ""down,"" etc.--are formed, and the random geometry of these clusters--what sizes of clusters occur with w hat probabilities--helps determine macroscopic properties of the iron. When the temperature goes below a certain precise ""critical point,"" there is a sudden change in the macroscopic behavior of the iron--the tendency to align wins out, so that a very large cluster of aligned atoms is formed, and the iron can become a magnet. Such ""critical phenomena""--sudden changes in macroscopic behavior when some measurement crosses a critical value--occur in a variety of contexts; recently, for example, there has been concern that the density of manmade junk orbiting the earth is approaching a critical level, above which the frequency of collisions will dramatically increase. Other systems in which small-scale randomness determines macroscopic properties, and critical phenomena may occur, include (i) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (ii) transport of heat by ocean currents in the presence of turbulence, which affects global climate; and (iii) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. Mathematicians and physicists have long understood that many aspects of the relation between small-scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems which Alexander will investigate are examples of such abstract systems."

The first pertains to the hydrodynamic description of self-organizing systems. Self-organizing automata or particle systems are open driven stochastic systems which evolve to a stationary distribution characterized by the nontrivial scaling behavior (as a function of system size) known as self-organized criticality. We have previously established that many of these systems near equilibrium can be described in certain limits by nonlinear diffusion equations, with a diffusion coefficient which has a singularity at a critical value of the local density. Scaling arguments suggest that the validity of this hydrodynamic description for the open (nonequilibrium) self-organizing automata depends on the size of the fluctuations in the local density in comparison to the rate at which the system converges to the critical density as the system size diverges. The purpose of this research is to rigorously investigate the validity of the singular diffusion description for the open systems, with the goal being general conditions for when fluctuations destroy the diffusion description. In the past several years there has been a considerable amount of activity in a number of scientific communities regarding self-organized criticality. Recent activity has focused on relatively simple systems, which, when simulated on the computer show broad distributions which change in a nontrivial way with the size of the system. The purpose of this research is to look at mathematical models which describe these systems."

In one dimension, classical simulated annealing can be modeled in continuous time as a certain diffusion process with drift. Given a function to be minimized, the drift term is the negative of the derivative of that function; and the infinitesimal variance, also called the rate of cooling, is inversely proportional to the logarithm of time. Under mild assumptions, it has been shown that such a diffusion converges in distribution to a random variable whose distribution is concentrated on the global minima of the function to be minimized. The investigator is studying the conjecture that if one uses a symmetric stable process in place of Brownian motion as the source of noise in the model, then one can cool at a rate proportional to time to a certain negative power, which is much faster than the logarithmic cooling required in the classical model. The genetic algorithm, as might be guessed from its name, is based on ideas from genetics. The investigator is investigating the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for the optimum partitioning problem. She is also comparing the performance of the genetic algorithm with deterministic algorithms. Optimization problems occur in almost every human endeavor. Businesses want to maximize profits and minimize cost. Many industrial robots are programmed so that the robot will accomplish its assigned task with a minimum amount of energy within a finite time period. This research studies ways to improve the performance of two widely-used computer-intensive algorithms for optimization: simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm. Simulated annealing has been used, for example, in computer-aided design of integrated circuits, in image processing, and in modeling the structure of proteins. As its name suggests, simulated annealing is an algorithm based on concepts from the physical process of annealing, where a substance is heated and then cooled slowly.. The genetic algorithm imitates the concept of ""survival of the fittest"" from Darwinian evolution."

Long memory, in the finite variance case, occurs when the covariances tend to zero like a power and the spectral density diverges at the origin. This behavior has been observed in many real-life phenomena. Sometimes long memory occurs jointly with infinite variance, for example when the underlying process is stable but not Gaussian. In this case it is the tail of the distribution that decays like a power function. The research will focus on the probabilistic and statistical properties of time series with long memory and/or infinite variance. Most of the available statistical techniques assume that the data to be analyzed are not very dependent. However, in a number of areas such as economics and geophysics, the data can display long range dependence and can also sometimes fluctuate significantly from their mean value.

One of the objects to study, which will be a useful tool in many directions, is the affine connection associated to a stochastic differential equation. This connection provides the geometrical structure to obtain good estimates for the derivative flow of stochastic differential equations. Those structures arising from degenerate systems are particularly investigated: there are problems of definition and of the existence of singularities. Although the main work is on finite dimensional systems infinite dimensional ones are also considered. Bismut type formulae and integration by parts formulae on path spaces connected to the above are also examined. On a more directly geometrical level the concepts of spectral positivity for curvatures are considered together with its consequences for the geometry of the manifold. Stochastic flows are typically solutions of stochastic differential equations (equations perturbed by white noise). Properties of stochastic flows including the stability and invariance are particularly interesting when considered together with the geometry of the underlying spaces. The techniques described in the proposal are used to study nonlinear equations including the blow ups and regularities of the solutions. The investigator also examines properties of local martingales, which finds its applications in mathematical finance."

The goal is to analyze likely and unlikely behavior of large combinatorial structures such as random graphs, trees, permutations, and partitions of sets and integers. This research will develop new approaches based on combinatorial-algebraic principles and ideas and analytical methods of probability and random processes. The connection between combinatorics and probability is well known. It played a major role in the early stages of development of probability theory, and some classical problems of a combinatorial nature are traditionally used to illustrate how the general theorems work in application to combinatorics. Among them are random walks and allocations of particles among cells (boxes), the latter being quite popular in various models of statistical mechanics. During the last 30-35 years, there has been a tremendous outpouring of research in combinatorial probability motivated by new problems in statistical mechanics (percolation theory, for instance), polymerization theory, computer science (probabilistic analysis of combinatorial algorithms), population genetics, etc. The terms random permutations, mappings, graphs, partitions, etc. have become household names for many researchers who have discovered the importance of analysis of random combinatorial structures. The related theory of random graphs, inaugurated by Erdos and Renyi in the early sixties, has been found indispensable in many important applications. Characteristically, the deepest results have come via a combination of fine combinatorial techniques and powerful probabilistic methods. Besides the problems directly related to random graphs, the investigator will study an optimal assignment problem with random costs, a possible connection between the evolving random graph and the Diaconis- Shahshahani algorithm (""card shuffling"") for generating a r andom permutation, and various problems on random partitions of sets and integers. The accent will be made on searching for probabilistic and analytic methods which can be used for other combinatorial structures important in applications."

The first mathematical problem concerns an integral mean inequality which would constitute a sharpening of a known lifetime result for Brownian motion in convex, simply connected planar domains normalized so that the largest disk they contain has radius one (or asymptotically one.) The second problem concerns a packing measure analysis of harmonic measure which would provide an analogue to the results of Makarov which relate a lower bound on the growth of the derivative of a univalent function to the proper Hausdorff measure function for the support of harmonic measure on the boundary of a domain. The education plan includes redesigning the senior/beginning graduate mathematical statistics courses to give the students a feeling for data and teaching a course for undergraduate mathematics majors by a modified Moore method, in order to give our undergraduates insight into the process of doing mathematical and statistical research. This award will fund both research in mathematics and course development in the mathematical sciences. During the award period, it is proposed to redesign an upper level statistics course to include work with actual data instead of focusing entirely on the mathematical theory behind statistics. There are also plans to teach a course for mathematics majors using self-discovery techniques in order to give undergraduates insight into the process of doing mathematical research. Two mathematical questions will be researched during the award period. One problem involves studying the pathological behavior of a certain class of mathematical functions. The techniques employed are related to those used for the study of fractals. The second pr oblem is derived from considering the lifetime of a particle moving randomly inside a region and dying when it touches the boundary of the region. Different regions allow the particle to live different lengths of time. Applications of this research are relevant in applied contexts, such as in studying stress on beams."

Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) The use of random-cluster representations to study Gibbs uniqueness, dilution and its effect on critical temperatures, disordered models, lattice gases with weak interactions, bounds on critical points, and monotonicity of various quantities as a function of system parameters. (2) Two-dimensional systems (percolation and the Ising model) conditioned so as to exhibit the formation of a large droplet, that is, a macroscopic region enclosed by a long contour, with emphasis on the discrepancy between the actual and ideal shape of this droplet. (3) Confetti percolation, a model which is both isotropic and, in two dimensions, self-dual, and hence is a natural setting in which to study conformal invariance and related phenomena. (4) The use of percolation ideas to create a model which mimics certain features of the freezing of water which contains impurities. (5) The geometry of finite clusters, and its relation to the cluster size distribution, for certain continuum models of percolation. This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena reflect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors; and (iv) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small- scale randomness and macroscopic properties, including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. The systems which Alexander will investigate--percolation, random cluster models, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems--are examples of such abstract systems."

The investigators propose to explore a new distributional transformation, coined the ``zero bias transformation,'' and an associated new coupling that may be used in conjunction with Stein's method for obtaining bounds to the normal for sums of random variables having particular dependence structures. The new coupling can be used to shed light on certain questions where previous methods have yielded only an incomplete picture. In addition, when approximating the sum of symmetric dependent random variables, or those having vanishing third moment, the zero bias coupling is natural and promises to yield smaller bounds on the approximation error. The zero bias technique has numerous potential applications to cases of both local and global dependence, for instance, to nonlinear sampling and rank statistics. Moreover, the zero bias transformation may be defined for general random objects such as random measures and diffusions, with applications to Empirical Central Limit Theorems for dependent observations, and a process treatment of the Wald Wolfowitz theorem. The normal curve is used extensively in a variety of statistical applications, such as when sampling a large lot of goods for quality control, or in opinion polling. In real situations the normal curve is often only an idealization of something too difficult to compute. In the context of sampling, better accuracy of the normal approximation comes with larger sample sizes, but sampling is typically expensive or time consuming. Therefore, it is useful to have an idea of how well the normal curve approximates the true situation for small and realistic sample sizes. The normal curve approximation also appears in a variety of other, often more complex, statistical contexts. There exist a number of approaches for assessing the accuracy of the normal approximation, each best suited to a particular need. In adding to these techniques, the investigators are developing a new method which improves on those existing, for some situations. For instance, use of the new method, applied in the sampling context, would result in more reliable statistical conclusions drawn from realistic samples."

For example, the applied study of genetics naturally involves sampling from populations, which leads to the notion of a size- biased permutation, which simplifies the understanding of a question from pure math, involving the large prime factors of a random integer. In the other direction, results proved about primes, such as bounds on the ""total variation distance"", anticipated by three decades important work in statistics on the comparison of sampling with and without replacement.

The first set of questions relates to the law of the iterated logarithm for degenerate U-statistics, particularly when the kernel is not square integrable, and to applications of U-processes to the asymptotics of lifetime distributions for truncated and/or censored data. In a second related set of questions the investigator and collaborators approximate spectra of compact integral operators by the spectra of certain random matrices and study several aspects of this approximation. The procedure amounts to discretizing the kernel by means of a random grid instead of the usual deterministic grids. The third main area of research concerns selfnormalized sums of independent identically distributed random variables, which are related to the Student t-statistic, and the aim is to determine the set of distributions for which the t-statistic is asymptotically standard normal, or converges in distribution, or is tight. The investigator also studies the bootstrap in some non-standard situations. These seemingly diverse sets of problems have in common the use of many techniques from limit theory, particularly empirical processes and Probability in Banach Spaces, some of them previously developed by the researcher in collaboration with others. One ongoing project of this researcher to study so-called U-statistics and U-processes and to expand the scope of their applicability. Knowing their properties should help us better understand the behavior of large classes of statistical functionals since U-statistics are their building blocks. In particular, some of this research will help to better assess the accuracy of statistical procedures currently used in the study of censored and/or truncated data in Medicine, Astronomy and other fields. Another project involves approximation of spectra of operators, which are mathematical objects that describe the behavior of systems such as chemical reactions. The third main topic of proposed research concerns the celebrated 'Student t-statistic,' a classical statistical object familiar to virtually everyone who does data analysis. This research is related to determining when the t-statistic can be safely used."
