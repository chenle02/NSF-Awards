The scope of a genome project includes the determination of the sequence,
identification of gene, and annotation of the genome. Each step involves a huge
amount of data and is computationally difficult. Often several separate
computational environments are required. To make the system more efficient and
less likely to be dependent on personal expertise, a common, reconfigurable
computational environment for a genome project will be developed. Four major
components will provide a computational environment for prokaryotic genome
projects. These include: toolkits for string matching and clustering; an
ordering procedure for sets of assembled sequence; a platform for comparative
alignment and annotation; an exploratory sequence analysis environment. The work
will provide a single unified computational environment from sequencing to
annotation, alleviating the obstacles encountered at different stages of a
project and contributing to faster, more accurate determination of assembled
sequences and their annotations. Educational activity will focus on developing a
bioinformatics program, with participation in research projects throughout the
institution.
