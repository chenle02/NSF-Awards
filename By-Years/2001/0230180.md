This project is investigating the active deformation of the western United
States by representing the region as a series of elastic, rotating, interacting
blocks. The goal is to see if such a block representation satisfies the
constraints as well as or better than continuum, viscous-flow models.
Understanding the relative importance of the two possible representations is
vital in order to understand what drives the deformation. This work is designed
to lead to better understanding of the tectonics of the western US, how
continents deform in general, and earthquake potential in this region. A
regional, surface velocity field is being developed using Global Positioning
System (GPS) measurements and applying an inversion technique that
simultaneously estimates block motions and elastic strain accumulation near
block-bounding faults. The concept of describing the regional tectonics by a
finite number of rotating blocks on a sphere is similar to plate tectonics and
is in contrast to continuum models of continental deformation. The study region
contains the important transition from Pacific-North America shear to Juan de
Fuca - North America convergence. This work will elucidate how this transition
is manifested in deformation within the continent. While block models have been
proposed and evaluated before, this approach fundamentally differs in that it
explicitly models the short-term elastic strains. Hence it is able to
incorporate a geodetic data set that includes tilt rates and strain rates in
addition to the primary constraints on the regional deformation from GPS.
Furthermore, it can use geologic data such as fault slip directions and rates,
spreading rates, rotation rates, and fault orientations. Hence, geodetic data
from the short-term that are subject to elastic strains are combined with
longer-term geologic data that reflect permanent deformation - the combination
will improve our understanding of the active tectonics of the western United
States.
