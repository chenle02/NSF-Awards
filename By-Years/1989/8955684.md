The University of Nebraska-Lincoln will initiate a 3-week residential Young
Scholars project for 45 new and 45 returning students in grades 9-10 in physics
and earth science. Using the theme of the Physics of the Earth's Environment, we
will offer three-week Young Scholars Institutes for bright girls from rural
schools in Nebraska. Each institute will introduce the girls to basic physical
science and mathematics concepts and computer technology through practical
hands-on activities. On completing her first science institute, each girl will
be provided with a personal computer and modem, and linked to a state-wide
electronic bulletin board. Institute staff will provide ongoing mentoring
through frequent contact with each girl. The entering ninth grade girls will do
instructional and research projects related to The Physics of the Solid Earth.
in the second summer the entering tenth grade girls will do instructional and
research projects related to The Physics of Earth's Water. The girls' parents
and teachers will be involved in the project through workshops and conferences.
