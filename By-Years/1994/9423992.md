9423992 Weitzer Nationwide and city-specific surveys have consistently found
that public attitudes toward the police vary by race, with African-Americans
less favorable than whites. We have little knowledge of whether these attitudes
are shaped by the fact that most police departments are largely non-minority in
composition. This study examines relations between the police and the African-
American population of Washington, DC. Washington is the American city with the
highest proportion of African-American police officers of any of the U.S.'s 50
largest cities. It provides an appropriate setting for examining (1) how blacks
and whites perceive and experience policing in a city with a predominantly black
police force and (2) what factors and policing issues have the greatest effect
on citizens' attitudes toward the police. It will allow us to draw some
conclusions about the extent to which citizen attitudes towards the police are
affected by the racial composition of their police forces. The study will
contribute to theories of police-community relations be examining several
factors thought to be important in the distinct context of a largely black
police force. Its results will also have implications for the assessment of
police policies and programs such as community policing that depend heavily on
community support for police law enforcement efforts. In so doing, it will
increase our knowledge of an important consideration in building safer, more
cohesive neighborhoods and cities. ****
