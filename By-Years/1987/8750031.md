A rock fragmentation and blasting laboratory will be installed at a local open
pit mine for undergraduate mining and geophysical engineering students. Using a
digital seismograph system, the students will enhance their understanding of
blast design and the environmental effects of blasting, ground vibration and
airblast control. The students will also gain experience in seismic exploration
and the interpretation of three dimensional seismometry.
