This award supports the research in the theory of matroids of Professor Klaus
Truemper of the University of Texas at Dallas. Dr. Truemper's project is to
develop new methods of matroid decomposition, and also to apply the body of
matroid theory to the task of producing an algorithmic problem solver or program
generator that will, in most cases, produce highly efficient solutions to
particular problems in a given NP-hard class. This research falls in the broad
category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's
mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the
very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development,
however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide
variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back
several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few
decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.
