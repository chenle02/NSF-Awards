This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic environment and its
role in global change which is promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.
It is a two year study to investigate the effect of heat input into the
atmosphere produced from relatively warm water exposed by a break in polar ice.
The study will use a large-eddy atmospheric model. This model explicitly
simulates the convective turbulent eddies that such inhomogeneous heating
creates and does not rely on assumptions of horizontal homogeneity. This
simulation seeks to bridge the gap between air-sea-ice coupled models and large-
scale primitive equation models, neither of which can accurately model the
turbulent transfer on such time and space scales. The heat transferred upwards
from the water will be analyzed to determine the amount which is recaptured by
ice and the amount and location of that retained by the atmosphere.
