This grant provides funds to partially support U.S. Ph.D. students working in
robotics the opportunity to attend a Doctoral Consortium at the International
Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), one of the major international
robotics conferences. The conference, to be held May 21-25, 2018 in Brisbane,
Australia, attracts an international audience that includes academics, industry,
entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in
the Doctoral Consortium will enable the students to share their knowledge and
interact with each other and with senior researchers outside their own
institutions, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to understand
industry needs, and to become apprised of new technology that will be
demonstrated by vendors. The Doctoral Consortium includes an afternoon of
activities, including oral and poster presentations by students, focused
breakout sessions, a keynote address, and two panels led by researchers in
academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
