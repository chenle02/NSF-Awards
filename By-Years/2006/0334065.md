This project will establish a grid testbed to provide opportunities for faculty
members to develop and test applications. The Grid testbed will allow
collaborators at other schools to gain knowledge and experience enabling
institutions to train their faculty and students to utilize the Grid for their
future applications...Existing and future applications will be used to test the
viability of the grid and provide a means to improve the grid technology. This
project has six primary objectives:

1. To pilot tested Grid technologies (such as Globus Toolkit) as described in
the NSF Middleware Initiatives; 2. To establish a layer of Trust among diverse
constituencies and document experiences with authentication/messaging systems
for sharing resources over the Grid; 3. To experiment with and document a
roadmap architecture for archival, backup;and recovery of data storage and
provisioning best practices among participant site teams; 4. Identify issues
related to job scheduling, load balancing and firewalls interoperability
architecture; 5. To pilot exiting and/or new faculty applications on the Grid
testbed; 6. To disseminate applications, findings, and outcomes of interest to a
broad range of users; and 7. To expand Grid participants upon successful
deployment in order to narrow the existing infrastructure gap."
