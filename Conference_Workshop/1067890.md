This award provides support to defray expenses of US participants to visit the
Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona during the program "The Cuntz
Semigroup on the Classification of C*-algebras" which is being held in the
period January through July 2011. The vast majority of the award funds will
provide the opportunity for young US mathematicians, including graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows, to attend significant portions of the CRM program. In
particular, the award will support the attendance of these young mathematicians
at an advanced course entitled "Dynamical Systems, C*-algebras and
Classification," which will be held during June 14-23, 2011. The award is co-
funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.

The classification of C*-algebras via K-theoretic invariants has recently been
invigorated by the discovery that the Cuntz semigroup - roughly, a semigroup of
isomorphism classes of countably generated Banach modules over a C*-algebra -
contains an enormous amount of information. Explicit calculation of this
semigroup has led to classification theorems for C*-algebras of minimal
dynamical systems, among others. The connections between classification,
C*-algebras, and dynamics have been further strengthened by progress on proving
the hyperfiniteness of amenable group actions on the Cantor set. Another new
front has opened at the interface of descriptive set theory and operator
algebras, where the Borel complexity of various equivalence relations
(including, naturally, isomorphism) allows one to quantify the complexity of
various classification problems in C*-algebra theory. Thus, the Cuntz semigroup
and classification problems in C*-algebra theory form an active and rapidly
developing branch of functional analysis, one which will afford many research
opportunities. The award provides a very good opportunity for young
mathematicians with research interests in the area of C*-algebras to be exposed
to the latest developments in the field, to interact with researchers from other
countries, and to possibly initiate future collaborations. Among other things,
this award will contribute to the future vitality of the field, and hopefully
lead to further applications and connections with other areas of mathematics.
