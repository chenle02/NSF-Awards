The proposed research includes two main projects. The first one, counting
manifolds, is in a sense a continuous analog of asymptotic group theory. The
guiding line is to convert finiteness results about locally symmetric manifolds,
which follow from rigidity phenomenon and arithmeticity, to concrete
quantitative statements. It is closely related to some central questions in
mathematics such as the congruence subgroup problem, and to the remarkable
finiteness theorem of Borel and Prasad, and it has applications in Riemannian
geometry, number theory and theoretical physics. This project continues earlier
work of the P.I. and joint work of the P.I. with Burger, Lubotzky and Mozes. The
second main project concerns embeddings of free groups into groups with some
geometric structure. This plays a central role in the study of linear and
topological groups (in particular subgroups of Lie groups over local fields),
and impacts some topics in differential geometry, ergodic theory, geometric
group theory, unitary representations and profinite groups. One target, which
the P.I. pursues in collaboration with E. Breuillard, is to obtain an effective
version to Tits alternative, a weak version of which was proved by Eskin, Mozes
and Oh, while solving Gromov's exponential growth conjecture. Other problems are
related to the Auslander conjecture. This project is also related to the study
of dense subgroups of analytic Lie groups, and the ``opposite'' problem of
classifying the (analytic) metric completions of a given countable group.

There are several classical finiteness statement concerning locally symmetric
spaces which have been known for more than 30 years, and yet have no
quantitative proofs, or for which the existing estimates are suboptimal. One
example is the classical theorem of Wang (and its strong version due to Borel
and Prasad) about the finiteness of the number of manifolds with bounded volume;
we would like to have good estimates for this number. Another example is the
fact that the fundamental group of a manifold with finite volume is finitely
presented; the size of a minimal presentation can be estimated in terms of the
volume. More generally, we study relations between the volume of manifolds and
their geometric structure. The second project deals with free subgroups. In his
celebrated 1972 paper J. Tits proved that any finitely generated linear group
which is not virtually solvable contains a non-commutative free subgroup. This
result, known today as the Tits alternative, answered a conjecture of Bass and
Serre and was an important step toward the understanding of linear groups. Any
improvement in Tits' theorem has immediate corollaries in various different
fields of mathematics. The P.I. and E. Breuillard had recently established a
topological version of Tits theorem which answered several questions in
dynamics, Riemannian foliations and profinite groups.
