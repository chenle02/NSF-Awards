The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the
broad field of synthesis and application of protective coatings. One specific
commercial application is synthesis of anti-corrosive coatings on variety of
substrate materials. Owing to the unique intrinsic properties of graphene, the
system enables lower coating cost and faster synthesis times. These protective
coatings are utilized in multiple industries including aerospace, automotive,
and oil and gas. This project will explore the commercial potential of the core
technology and will inform further technical developments and possible
commercialization paths and will create new research and commercialization
thrusts in the overall field of plasma nanoscience.

This I-Corps project is focused on advancing the innovative approach of Radio
Frequency plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique for synthesis the
large quantities of graphene coatings on various substrate materials. Recent
research advances indicate that graphene can be effectively generated in the
plasma discharge environment. Plasma CVD synthesis has been shown to be
effective in the production of monolayer and several-layer sheets of crystalline
films of graphene characterized by high quality and low structural defects. In
addition, utilization of plasma flux at synthesis enhances mobility and
reactivity of the species participating in the synthesis process on the
substrate's surface in comparison with that when atomic flux is used. This
enables synthesis at lower temperatures and widens range of substrate materials
that can be used in the synthesis.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
