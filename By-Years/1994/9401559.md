Rodl This award funds the research of Professor Vojtech Rodl in extremal graph
theory and Ramsey Theory. Prof. Rodl will apply probabilistic methods to
problems in random graphs and set systems. These include questions on matching
in graphs and hypergraphs. The research is in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections can be organized. It turns out that some kinds of structure are
unavoidable, and Ramsey Theory studies these basic properties of all
collections. The behavior of discrete collections is extremely important in
modeling communication systems and plays a role in modern computing,
communications and operations. ***
