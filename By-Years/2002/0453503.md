NSF's chemistry (CHE), biological sciences (DBI), and EdEn venture fund jointly
co-fund the Mississippi State University Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site for the summers of 2005-2007. The program director is Gloria Thomas
who is assisted by Adrienne Minerick. The site will bring 10 undergraduate
students to Mississippi State University for a ten-week summer research
experience consisting of four interdisciplinary research groups from the
chemistry and chemical engineering departments. The four research groups: (1)
Biotechnology and Bioanalytical Applications; (2) Nanomaterials and Structural
Studies; (3) Integrated Environmental Research; and (4) Synthesis and Separation
Processes will meet biweekly to discuss topics relevant to the individual's
research project and develop a spirit of camaraderie between the participants. A
three credit-hour professional development course, covering safety, ethics,
diversity, and technical presentations, and visits to local chemical industries,
will be included in the summer program. The Mississippi State REU site will
recruit participants from underrepresented groups through close relationships
with a consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and
the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez.
