9321044 Manski For almost 50 years, national consumer surveys have elicited
subjective reports of economic expectations. Although consumer confidence
indexes are widely employed as leading indicators of aggregate economic
activity, subjective expectations data are not looked upon favorably by most
economic researchers. The rejection of these data can be partially attributed to
the qualitative nature of the survey questions. The purpose of this project is
to collect and analyze quantitative expectations data in order to open up new
avenues of research on consumer behavior under uncertainty. The new survey
questions were included in a national telephone survey of 617 households.
Preliminary data analysis and interviewer comments suggest that respondents
willingly provide sensible responses to these questions. These households will
be re-interviewed and their responses will be analyzed to assess the predictive
value of this information. This project is important because it will provide new
data on the process of expectation formation and the predictive content of these
forecasts. ***
