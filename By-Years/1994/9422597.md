9422597 Elliott Four experiments will be carried out using interference of
optical interactions to control transitions in a two level atomic system. The
experiments are designed to provide a test of the physical principles governing
the coherent control of molecular dissociation and to determine the
spectroscopic parameters of an atomic system. ***
