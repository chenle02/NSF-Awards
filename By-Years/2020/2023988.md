This project aims to transform microscopy from the current low-speed benchtop
system into the first-of-a-kind high-speed miniature/portable device that will
enable wearable, handheld applications. The microscope will include many of the
currently available separate optical modalities into a single multi-parameter
system. The proposed system will retain these modalities with no reduction in
performance yet with improved portability, reduction in size, and increased data
collection efficiency for functional imaging capabilities. This breakthrough is
expected to find broad applications in areas spanning from neuroscience to
clinical treatment of cancer, personalized screening of cardiovascular drugs,
and management of wound healing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology
developed in this program will significantly expand the scope of multi-
parametric PAM beyond basic research in anesthetized of restrained animals. The
multidisciplinary nature of the proposed research involving optical and
mechanical design, numerical simulation, microfabrication, data processing,
instrument development and testing will offer well-balanced training
opportunities for all participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
