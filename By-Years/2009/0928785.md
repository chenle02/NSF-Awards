This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this work is to
develop accurate and efficient computational methods for the simulation of
resonant damping in micro-electromechanical devices such as are planned for next
generation sensing-arrays and communication circuitry. To address the central
difficulty associated with such problems, the researchers will develop special
iterative methods for solving the governing equations in the frequency domain;
they also will examine the use of time domain analysis methods involving system
excitation by narrow-band Gaussian pulses in combination with discontinuous
Galerkin methods. The project will further address the central question of the
development of accurate efficient infinite domain radiation boundary conditions
as well as reduced order models for enhanced efficiency. The theoretical work
will be complimented by a set of benchmark experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the methods developed will provide device designers the ability to
simulate, understand, and modify resonant based designs to optimize performance
before engaging in costly prototype fabrication. This will result in more rapid
and cost effective design cycles. It is also hoped this will enable designers to
create the next generation of resonant based micro-electromechanical systems
sooner rather than later. The work on radiation boundary conditions and model
reduction techniques can also be leveraged for use in a wide variety of
situations where simulation of infinite domains is needed ? such as in weather
prediction, sonar applications, etc. The benchmark data to be collected and
disseminated will also advance the work of other research groups examining
similar problems.
