The focus of this research is the use of the photochemical generation of
heteroatom ketenes by photolysis of chromium carbene complexes. Catalytic
processes to prepare cyclobutanones and beta-lactams will be explored along with
synthetic approaches to sterically hindered carbene complexes. Photochemical 2+2
and 3+2 cycloadditions will be used to afford beta-lactams and an efficient
route to alpha-heteroatom stannanes, which will be used in Pd catalyzed
reactions, will be developed. Optically active chromium carbene derived
intermediates including ene carbamates, butenolides and tetraazamacrocyclic
cyclams will be used for asymmetric synthesis. %%% With this Renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Louis S. Hegedus of
the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. Professor Hegedus will
focus his work on the development of new synthetic methods using transition
metal complexes to permit new modes of reactivity for organic functional groups.
Efficient synthetic approaches to a variety of heterocyclic and carbocyclic
systems will be developed.
