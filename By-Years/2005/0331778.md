The objective of the proposed research is to perform an experimental exploration
of the impact of ion beam irradiation on the liquid-phase transport properties
of polymer membranes. Commercially-available nanofiltration membranes will be
exposed to ion irradiation of varying energies. Specific objectives of the
project include (i) determining the effects of ion beam irradiation on surface
morphology, microstructure, chemical structure, and hydrophobicity, (ii)
determining the stability of modifications, and (iii) evaluating the performance
of modified membranes in water separations experiments to determine effects on
transport, selectivity, fouling, and resilience. FTIR will be used to probe the
evolution in chemical structure of the polymer that constitutes the selective
layer of the membrane. AFM will be used to track the evolution in surface
morphology induced by ion beam irradiation. In terms of broader impacts,
improved water purification techniques could lead to better removal of pathogens
and pollutants. This multidisciplinary project will provide educational
experiences for both graduate and undergraduate students.
