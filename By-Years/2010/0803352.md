Funds are provided to apply the stable isotope techniques pioneered by the
principal investigators for Axel Heiberg terrestrial fossils across a Trans-
Arctic trajectory of Eocene field sites. The principal investigators will
retrieve fossil materials from the Eastern High Arctic (Axel Heiberg and
Ellesmere Island; 2008), the Western High Arctic (Banks Island; 2009), and near
Anchorage, Alaska (2010). Fieldwork and the resulting analyses of sediments and
plant/vertebrate fossils across these sites will provide global quantification
of Eocene northern high-latitude paleoclimate. In addition to the 채13C, 채18O and
채D techniques pioneered for fossil wood, cellulose, resin, organic matter and
carbonate, they will apply two new chemical techniques: the use of 채18O in
phenylglucosazone derived from cellulose to imply the oxygen isotope composition
of environmental water, and the use of lipid biomarkers known as glycerol
dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) to infer soil temperature. They anticipate
that their analyses will yield a quantification of organismal carbon-cycling,
soil temperature, atmospheric relative humidity, environmental water source and
inference of weather pattern, across a global Eocene Arctic transect. These
analyses are specifically designed to exploit the exceptionally well-preserved
terrestrial organic compounds of the mummified trees and litter layers within
Arctic Eocene sediments.
