Furman University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will include: o
Solid State Fouorescence and Phosphorescence of Chromium (III) macrocycle
complexes o ESR matrix isolation applied to the study of Ion- Neutral Reactions
and Reactive Laser Sputtering o Mechanistic, Synthetic and Photochemical Studies
of Organomagnesium Compounds o Synthesis and Characterization of PT olefin
Complexes
