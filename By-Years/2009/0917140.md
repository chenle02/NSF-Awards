The research will develop the foundations for a framework for reasoning about
the formal properties of programming languages, compilers, software
specifications, concurrent systems and other related computational systems. The
framework will be based on two separate but interacting logics. One logic will
be geared towards specifying and prototyping varied software systems. The second
logic, referred to as the meta-logic, will provide flexible and powerful
mechanisms for reasoning about specifications written in the first logic. The
objects to be specified and reasoned about typically have complex syntactic
structures, often involving some form of binding. Use will be made of a higher-
order approach to representing syntactic structure in both logics to facilitate
a natural treatment of such objects. Useful new logical capabilities will be
exposed and embedded in actual computer systems that can be used in prototyping
and reasoning tasks in the intended domains. The insights and the tools produced
will be used pedagogically to expose high-school students and beginning
undergraduates to important ideas in logic and computation. A close
collaboration with a group of French researchers will provide an international
dimension to the research, co-funded in part by the NSF Office of International
Science and Engineering. In the long run, mechanized formal specification of
(and reasoning about) programming languages has clear application to the
improvement of software infrastructure in the real world: its correctness,
reliability, maintainability, and security.
