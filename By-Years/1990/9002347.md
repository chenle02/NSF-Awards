The principal investigator will study the vertex and edge connectivity of the
giant component of a randomly evolving graph. One aspect of an Erdos-Renyi
randomly evolving graph is a sudden appearance of the giant component, right
after the moment when the average vertex degree becomes equal to 1. This
research will lead to a better understanding of the likely behavior of such
important extremal characteristics of the random graph as the chromatic number,
the independence number and the matching number. The investigator will also
study the giant component phenomenon in two other models, bipartite random graph
and a Flory-Stockmayer-Whittle model of polymerization process. Finally, the
investigator will work on fast probabilistic algorithms for Hamilton circuits
and matchings.
