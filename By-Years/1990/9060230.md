Today's complex system environment and competitive economic environment demand
precise answers to questions concerning dependability and quality. Current tools
are not providing the ability to model complex fault handling scenarios and
often require simplifying assumptions about failure rates, repair rates, and
initial states which lead to incorrect solutions. Accurate dependability
evaluations are a concern of both manufacturers and users of systems who often
invest millions of dollars to keep systems operating correctly. A dependability
tool that can address these concerns is in demand in both the commercial and
military environments. The development of a simulation tool based on Rainbow
Nets is investigated. Rainbow Nets overcome limitations of previous net-based
models by significantly reducing the model complexity. This reduction is
achieved by hierarchical tokens, which can be created, destroyed, and have
identities and features, and by transitions whose activation is governed by a
set of rules or an algorithm.
