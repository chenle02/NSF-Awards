CHEMISTRY (12)&lt;br/&gt;The problem of how to approach the teaching and
learning of interdisciplinary material, such as the chemistry necessary to
understand even introductory molecular biology, is complex and difficult to
solve (otherwise it would have already been done). This project supports the
research based development of an integrated curriculum for an introductory
chemistry sequence for science majors, entitled "Chemistry and the Logic of
Life." The project is completing the following activities: A text using the
emergence and evolution of life as the scaffold and context for introduction of
chemistry concepts; Learning objects such as interactive electronic materials
that can be used separately or in conjunction with each other to enable students
to learn concepts, principles, how to solve specific types of problems and how
to handle and manipulate data; Formative and summative course assessments and
concept inventories are developed and tested. In conjunction with the American
Chemical Society Examinations Institute, the project is also developing an
examination that can be used nationally as an assessment of chemistry principles
in biological contexts. Instructor resource materials help guide instructors in
effective ways to use the materials. Since this approach is new, the project
provides considerable instructor support. A student workbook provides activities
for large and small classes that reinforces the concepts and skills needed to
understand the material presented in the text.
