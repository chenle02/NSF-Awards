A Behavioral Sciences Laboratory is being established specifically dedicated to
support of student research projects, including those required in research-
related courses as well as those of individual students. The IBM AT computers,
related hardware, and SPSS/PC Plus Statistics and Graphics software package is
greatly enhancing the level and sophistication of student research projects
assigned for all students in the Anthropology, Sociology, and Psychology
research sequence. The students are gaining hands-on experience in creating,
storing and manipulating their data files. They are doing basic to complex
descriptive and inferential analyses and graphic presentations of their data.
These research capabilities are greatly enhancing the existing curriculum by
providing students with an up-to-date, technologically advanced learning
experience in behavioral science research.
