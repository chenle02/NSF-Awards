The goal of this project is to offer students experience with modern
instrumentation and computing equipment for nuclear physics. The equipment
centers on high resolution gamma ray dector and IBM computer with a math co-
processor. Supporting equipment includes a plotter to produce hard copy output
from the computer, as well as electronic modules to shape, amplify, and analyze
the signals from the detector. Other supporting equipment includes radioactive
sources which will be studied with the equipment requested. The equipment will
be used to instruct students bound for employment as teachers or engineers or
bound for further education in physics, chemistry, geology or engineering.
Specifically this equipment will be used to improve teaching of the
instrumentation and methods of nuclear physics. The University will match the
award with an equal amount of funds.
