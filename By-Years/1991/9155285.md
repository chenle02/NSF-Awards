The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA, in collaboration
with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America, the largest voluntary
organization for girls in the world, requests NSF support for the National
Science Partnership for Girl Scout Councils and Science Museums. This three-year
project establishes partnerships between seven Girl Scout councils and six
science-technology museums in six regions across the nation to promote science
interest and knowledge in young American women. The project provides hands-on
science activity kits and training workshops for Girl Scout leaders that assist
them in conducting science activities with their troops. The science activities
are directly linked to the existing Girl Scout badge program and help Brownie
and Junior Girl Scouts (ages 8-11) fulfill science-related badge requirements.
Each council/museum partnership will develop a specific program that involves
the local underserved populations in Girl Scout science activities. during the
three years of federal support, the National Science Partnership will develop a
specific program that involves the local underserved populations in Girl Scout
science activities. During the three years of federal support, the National
Science Partnership will directly serve 11,500 leaders and 138,000 Girl Scouts.
Extensive project dissemination will encourage the involvement of new
partnerships and the institutionalization of the National Science Partnership by
GSUSA, councils, science museums, and other formal education organizations so
that the project has the potential to reach the more than 2.3 million Girl
Scouts and 780,000 leaders across the United States.
