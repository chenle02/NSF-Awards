Mobile technology is becoming the hub of future biosensor development. The
proposed work attempts to develop an Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor
utilizing existing mobile (smartphone) technology, transforming what was
traditionally an expensive and bulky biosensor technology into a portable and
affordable one. ECL sensors work by a simple principle - when a small electric
voltage is applied to an ECL chemical, the chemical emits light. The ECL
combined with mobile technology enables minimal instrumentation and mobile app
analysis. Our goal is to make this new sensor platform equivalent not only in
performance to that of existing expensive biosensors, but also more affordable
and for many different biosensor needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to advance the traditional electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
immunosensor instrumentation to make it more portable and inexpensive using the
latest mobile technologies. When an ECL reaction is triggered by the application
of electric potential, the emitted light is in a visible spectrum, providing a
great potential to satisfy the requirements for an ultra-sensitive immunoassay
and in an ultra-compact format. Successful development of the proposed ECL
biosensor will significantly enhance biosensor instrumentation by maximizing the
practicality of mobile technologies while providing the sensitivity realized by
expensive and specialized instruments. There have been attempts to develop ECL
sensor with cell phone detectors but they have not been successful in detecting
biomarkers at clinically relevant concentrations. The key effort of the proposed
work are enhancing the inherently low ECL signal to a level that is detectable
with consumer cameras and developing minimal instrumentation for efficient ECL-
based detection. The research will focus on design as well as development of
protocols with co-reactants, microfluidic channels on screen-printed-electrodes,
electric circuits to trigger reactions, and a mobile app to control the circuit,
imaging, and data analysis. The ECL immunosensor can be used for diagnosis of
disease biomarkers. Its inexpensive and portable nature will make it an ideal
platform to use in disaster rescue and recovery situations. The project will be
performed at an undergraduate predominant institute maximizing educational
aspects and emphasizing the community outreach.
