The objective of this project is to develop improved instrumentation for protein
and nucleic aid analysis. The instruments are a high-sensitivity solid-phase
protein sequencer, an automated DNA/RNA hybridization machine and a new type of
peptide synthesizer. The emphasis in development of the protein sequencer will
be on miniaturization of fluid handling components, assessment of alternative
sequencing reagents and a study of the side reactions of the Edman degradation
with the aim of optimizing the chemistry and improving the ovevall performance
Edman method. Second, the investigator will construct an automated device for
carrying out DNA and RNA hybridization experiments (e.g., Southern and Northern
blots), with the aim of improving the convenience, reproducibility and safety of
these techniques. Finally, the investigator will plan to build and evaluate a
device for the rapid synthesis of a series of overlapping or analogous peptides
for use in epitope mapping of antigens and for antigen structure/function
studies. This new technique will take advantage of recently developed technology
that permits the synthesis of peptides on membranes.//
