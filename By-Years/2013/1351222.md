This award will enable Professor Edward Cackett at Wayne State University to
analyze archival X-ray data and carry out new observations of low-mass X-ray
binaries. He will use both timing and spectral information to probe the
kinematics and geometry of the inner regions of accretion disks. His procedure
involves modeling the reverberation of emission from a corona or boundary layer
as it reflects off the inner accretion disk. Models of this process will be
constrained by the spectral-dependent time lag of two emission components. The
PI has been a key player in applying these techniques to active galactic nuclei
and stellar-mass black-hole accretion, and he will extend this work to neutron
stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron stars provide the
only way to probe fundamental questions regarding the behavior of matter under
the most extreme conditions, with densities at their center being many times
nuclear density. This award will facilitate a better measurement of the radius
of neutron stars, and it will use neutron stars with low-mass companions as
laboratories to study the physical process of accretion, which happens in a wide
range of astrophysical contexts. Professor Cackett is actively building an
integrated research and education program at Wayne State University. As part of
this award, he will develop a program to provide solar telescopes to
metropolitan Detroit area high schools to add a hands-on daytime observing
aspect to their science curricula. To multiply the effectiveness, he will
conduct workshops for high-school teachers and provide sample curricular
materials and independent research projects. These workshops will also include a
review of all astronomy topics in the high school science standards, with a
particular focus on contemporary topics of interest that are associated with the
original and creative research funded by this award.
