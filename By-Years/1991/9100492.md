Manufacturing firms that operate at more than one site can use a variety of
strategies to respond to changes in their competitive situations. Many
strategies entail technological adjustments; others are locational in nature. In
the U.S., locational changes have been common mechanisms for reducing operating
costs, because factors like connections with other firms and employment costs
(including wages and workers compensation payments) vary dramatically from one
locale to another. The degree to which these factors influence decision making
in other nations is uncertain, however. Preliminary research conducted in the
U.S., United Kingdom, and Germany indicate that technological adaptations are
more common in other nations. This project will expand research on this topic
through analysis of information gathered from executives of U.S.-owned machine
tool, computer, and semiconductor manufacturers that operate in Australia. The
data will be analyzed using multivariate statistical procedures. This project
will provide new information on locational and technological adjustments made by
high-technology manufacturers in Australia. Because the data collected during
this project parallel those gathered in other nations, they also will establish
a sound basis for cross-national comparisons of industrial adjustment.
