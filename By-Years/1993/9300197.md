This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Tulsa to continue a successful REU SITE. The program will help
train undergraduate students in the philosophy, mechanics, and execution of
scientific research. This project will enhance an already strong program in
undergraduate research participation, and will extend this program into the
summer. Another goal is to enhance opportunities for participation in scientific
research for members of underrepresented groups. The Undergraduate Summer
Research Program will consist of a research workshop, independent research
projects, weekly group meetings, invited speakers, and a research colloquium.
The research workshop will introduce the students to the philosophy and
mechanics of the various fields in biology represented by the participating
faculty. One result of the workshop will be the development by each student of
an individual research project. These projects will focus on nectivore foraging
ecology, reproductive behavioral ecology, vertebrate reproductive physiology
(ecology &amp; evolution), algal evolution &amp; systematics, or cyanobacterial
microbiology. The students will complete their projects over the course of the
summer. The weekly group meetings will provide a forum for review of literature,
progress reports on research projects, and for solving problems that arise
during the course of the projects. The invited speakers will expose the students
to a wider variety of view points in biology than is available through the
participating faculty. Finally, students will communicate the results of their
projects and experience critical peer review through the research colloquium.
