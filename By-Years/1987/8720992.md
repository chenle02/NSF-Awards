Accretionary prisms are one of the major components of convergent plate
orogens, forming the pliant leading edge of the overriding crustal plate. The
Shimanto accretionary complex in southwest Japan has received recent study
because portions are well-exposed so that detailed structural and stratigraphic
relation-ships can be investigated. Results of that study have revealed t hat
parts of this accretionary prism are a typical of simple accretion at convergent
plate margins. The structural anomalies include a 180o reversal in structural
polarity between Eocene and Miocene accreted packets and late stage oroclinal
flexing. This renewal will test the hypothesis that these anomalies are
attributable to a Miocene episode of spreading-ridge subduction, by a program of
computer modeling and further analysis of existing data. Results are expected to
clarify the significance of the Shimanto deformational data and explore the role
of subduction of actively spreading ridges in accretionary complexes.
