A twelve day summer workshop for chemistry and physics faculty is being offered
in computer-based laboratory instruction for introductory students. The faculty
are being recruited nationwide. The workshop is: demonstrating new ways of
teaching introductory students to use personal computers as a laboratory tool to
log, manipulate, analyze, interpret, and present experimental data; exploring
the novel experiments being used in the interdisciplinary science course,
"Matter and Motion;" exploring laboratory as a means of integrating physics,
chemistry and introductory calculus at the college level; and expanding the
network of chemistry and physics faculty who are engaged in developing computer-
based laboratory work in chemistry and physics.
