The project studies techniques for performing efficient communication in
parallel computers that have faulty components. Parallel computers with a large
number of identical processors have a great potential for fault-tolerance. The
main challenge that must be overcome in order to exploit this potential for
fault- tolerance is the fact that faults also affect communications between
processors. Hardware faults in processors, routers, and communication links
force messages to take new paths that avoid the faulty components. In addition,
the mapping of computations from faulty processors to nonfaulty ones changes the
pattern of communication. As a result, faults can have a major impact on the
performance, and even correctness, of the communication subsystem in a parallel
computer. Specifically, the project focuses on the following two key issues;
creating efficient, deadlock-free routing algorithms for parallel computers with
faulty components, and developing efficient mappings of communication-intensive
real-time applications to parallel computers that contain faults. This research
will result in more efficient use of parallel computers and a better
understanding of how their inherent potential for fault-tolerance can be
utilized.
