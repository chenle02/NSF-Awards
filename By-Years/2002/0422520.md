Del Mar College is awarding 36 scholarships annually in the amount of $2500 for
the academic year to academically talented and financially needy students
majoring in computer science, mathematics, engineering or electrical engineering
technology. Del Mar College serves South Texas including the city of Corpus
Christi. Within the college's service area 40% of the adults lack a high school
diploma, Spanish is the primary language for 57% of the population and about
one-third of the households have an annual income of less than $20,000. This
project is building on other NSF supported programs at the institution including
ATE, Cybersecurity and AMP projects. &lt;br/&gt;Del Mar College's student body
reflects the composition of the local population with 56% of the students being
of Hispanic origin. The project is increasing the numbers of individuals from
this underrepresented group entering CSEMS supported fields. With over 900
students engaging in CSEMS eligible studies considerable demand for the
scholarships exists. The institution has an outstanding student support services
program and this project is enjoying broad faculty support.&lt;br/&gt;
