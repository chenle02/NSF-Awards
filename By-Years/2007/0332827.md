The project consists of a workshop designed to address the widely recognized
cyberinfrastructure issues associated with distributed, networked, observing
systems. The goals of the workshop are to refine the definitions of these
issues, to search for solutions to these issues, and to catalyze collaborative
research between engineers, environmental scientists, computer scientists,
statisticians and mathematicians to address these issues. Results will be
published both in print form and via the web. As well as bringing together a
diverse range of disciplines, the workshop will also include participation by
graduate students and international experts. The latter reflects the
increasingly international nature of the collection and use of research data in
the environmental sciences.
