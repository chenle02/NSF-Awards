Professor Spielberg's research project centers on certain boundary actions of a
Fuchsian group, related to the action of the group on its limit set. The
fundamental example is that of the modular group PSL(2,Z) acting on a Cantor set
obtained by disconnecting the extended real line at the points of a countable
invariant set. In this case the crossed product C*-algebra is isomorphic to a
certain Cuntz algebra. The objects of study here are more general Fuchsian
groups which give rise in an analogous fashion to other algebras of Cuntz and
Krieger. Professor Spielberg's research is in the area of C*-algebras. These
algebras consist of families of operators (infinite matrices of complex numbers)
with a certain reality property: the algebra is generated by elements whose
value in any state of the system is a real number. The study of these algebras
was originally motivated by physics, and they are still of major interest in
this area and in other branches of pure mathematics.
