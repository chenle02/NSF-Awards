0214911&lt;br/&gt;Kane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research Phase I Project proposes to develop an enhanced spectral interferometry
method for biological and biomedical applications. This method will provide
rapid, high resolution optical imaging and can be easily coupled with fiber
optics for in-vivo applications using endoscopes, catheters and similar devices.
The Phase I Project will demontrate the utility of enhance spectral
interferometry for cross-sectional imaging in biological tissues. In the follow
on Phase II Project, a fiber&lt;br/&gt;optic imaging spectral interferometer
capable of high speed will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
applications of this project are in the area of biomedical devices and
instrumentation. This technology will be applied to a variety of biomedical
research and clinical needs including monitoring of tissue response to drugs or
radiation exposure, detection of cancerous and pre-cancerous tissues, and the
imaging of venous and arterial structures and ocular pathologies.&lt;br/&gt;
