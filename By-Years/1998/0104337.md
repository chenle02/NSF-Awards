NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0104337&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Workshop on
Soliton Equations: Applications and
Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0104337
Carlson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports U.S. participants (primarily
young researchers and graduate students) in the Workshop on Soliton Equations:
Applications and Theory, held at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs,
on August 10-12, 2001. The workshop involves interdisciplinary examination of
soliton equations by experts in both theory and applications. Nonlinear problems
of optical communications are emphasized, particularly the use of the nonlinear
Schroedinger equation and its variants for the modeling and design of long
distance fiber optic communication systems. Additional applied topics include
the appearance of solitons in other optical problems, magnetic thin films, and
Bose-Einstein condensates. Theoretical topics include extensions of inverse
scattering and inverse spectral theory to Schroedinger or Dirac type operators,
new methods of analyzing Riemann-Hilbert problems, connections of soliton
equations with geometry, and new insights into meromorphic or real analytic
solutions of soliton equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the initial
discoveries relating the Korteweg - de Vries equation to the
scattering&lt;br/&gt;transform, soliton equations have provided a veritable
fountain of physical and mathematical surprises. This workshop offers
researchers in this field a chance to exchange new results and new problems, and
it provides young researchers with an overview of the field. The workshop aims
at interdisciplinary presentation, with a healthy mix of successful applications
of the ideas to physical problems, computational studies which can illuminate
applications and suggest new theoretical issues, and new theoretical
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
