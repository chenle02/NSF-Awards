Studies in the Turkana Basin of northern Kenya are currently yielding important
evidence of the development of early humans in East Africa. Few localities are
as ideally suited to answer some of the major questions being asked in
paleoanthropology today. This is largely due to the extent of our knowledge of
the detailed stratigraphic relations, chronology and environmental significance
of the deposits which enclose the fossils and artifacts there. Expanding the
geographic range of that knowledge to peripheral areas of the basin holds
considerable promise, as recently discovered deposits there represent habits
thus far poorly known. This proposal is for continued study of the
tephrostratigraphy of the Turkana Basin sequence and of other distal deposits
(including the Awash Valley, Baringo Basin and Lake Albert Rift) erupted from
the same sources in order to allow temporal integration of these widespread
localities. In addition, continued study of the detailed stratigraphy and
paleoenvironmental context of the Turkana Basin deposits will further refine our
understanding of the context from which one of the richest record of early
humans has been recovered.
