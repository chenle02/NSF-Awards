The Atmospheric Science Education Program for Teachers of Grades 5-9 is designed
to improve the Atmospheric Science background of 24 Indiana teachers utilizing
eight atmospheric science topics. Teachers will spend four weeks in residence at
the Purdue University, West Lafayette campus. Participants will spend a
considerable amount of time in the field and will be furnished with a set of
basic materials that they will keep and take back to their classrooms. The
project staff will conduct considerable follow-up in the classroom for the
purposes of providing expert resources to the participants and to assess the
implementation of the atmospheric science topics into the curriculum. An
extensive evaluation process will determine the impact of this project.
