The nonholonomic structures of the title are modeled on physical systems with
velocity constraints not arising from position constraints. The simplest example
of such a system is a ball rolling without slipping on a hard surface.
Nonholonomic structures and especially distributions that correspond to linear
constraints for velocities, are common in robotics (car-like robots) and
neuroscience (models of the motion of articulated bodies), as well as in areas
of physics and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the thrusts of the
project, devoted to inverse optimal control problems, will provide explicit
algorithms for recovering a cost functional from the given set of optimal
trajectories. Another thrust of the project, devoted to the Gromovs h-principle
for distributions, will answer important questions of global existence of
several new classes of distributions with prescribed differential properties and
the possibility to avoid singularities of such distributions by continuous
deformations. Other thrusts of the project are devoted to equivalence problems
for new classes of distributions, CR structures, and other filtered structures.
The principal investigator, in collaboration with his students, will continue to
develop a special Maple based software package for computation of state-feedback
and gauge invariants of various control and mechanical systems of practical
interest, and for new variants of Tanaka prolongation needed in the project,
which are beyond the scope of the existing standard packages. Broader impacts
will include training and advising of several PhD students, and undergraduate
research projects on topics of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
