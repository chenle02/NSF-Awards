9503654 Fairall Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.
Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year
research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of
the Arctic Ocean and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA
are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice
processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic
climate, including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and
(2) to improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic
for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model
input, model validation and climate monitoring. This work will develop,
construct, and prepare for deployment two new instruments that will be built
specifically for autonomous operation at the main SHEBA ice camp. These are a
wind profiler to provide wind and temperature profiles continuously to 2.5 km
altitude; and a lidar for cloud and aerosol monitoring which will measure
optical depth and provide ice/water determinations. The instruments will be
designed to optimize performance under Arctic conditions. This instrumentation
will be useful in addressing an identified critical issue of SHEBA, the sea
arctic cloud- radiation feedback mechanism.
