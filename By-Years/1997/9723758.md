Garland 9723758 The proposed research will test hypotheses concerning the
morphological and physiological determinants of interspecific variation in
locomotor performance of lizards. This will constitute one of the first
integrative, multilevel studies of locomotor abilities in any group of animals.
It will provide unique information concerning the mechanisms underlying the
origin of biological diversity in performance abilities. It may also provide
important clues as to how adaptation can overcome potential morphological and
physiological constraints. Because the lizards to be studied are fairly
generalized in their locomotor modes, the results will also provide an important
baseline for future investigations of other tetrapod groups. Members of the
North American family Phrynosomatidae will be emphasized because this group is
readily accessible and exhibits a remarkable diversity of ecology, behavior,
locomotor abilities, and morphology. Endurance running capacity will be measured
on a motorized treadmill. Maximal sprint running speed will be measured both on
a photocell-timed racetrack, an established method, and on a high speed
treadmill. A range of traits that probably affect speed, endurance, or both will
be studied for approximately 19 species of Phrynosomatidae and 11 outgroup
species, including body size, fimb and tail proportions, body temperature, and
muscle fiber type composition.
