Serotonin plays an important role in neurodevelopment by causing changes in
forebrain naturation, neurite outgrowth, expression of postsynaptic receptors,
and on the apprearance of inhibitory behaviors. This research will focus on the
proposition that a component of the action of 5-HT on serotonergic neurons
(autoregulation) may be its intracellular metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO).
The hypothesis is based on the fact that metabolism of 5-HT by MAO generates
H202, which is highly toxic to neurons because it can form hydroxy-free
radicals. The enzyme MAO exists in two forms, A and B. MAO-A has a higher
affinity for 5-HT than MAO-B, but this latter form is localized to serotonergic
neurons and astrocytes. Preliminary studies indicate that inhibition of MAO-B is
effective in augmenting fetal 5-HT development. The studies are clinically
relevant because of the widespread use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in
depressed patients. They may also help understand age-related degenerative
processes underlying dementia since MAO-B is increased during aging while
serotonergic neurons, important in learning and memory, are reduced.
