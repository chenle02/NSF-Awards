Two interdisciplinary workshops will focus on ecological change and human
impacts during the Holocene on the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Islands
represent a model ecosystem to track human-environment interactions over the
past 10,000 years. The Aleutians contain a 9,000-year record of human
occupation. For most of the Holocene, the archipelago has formed the boundary
between the North Pacific Rim and Bering Sea. The region is a rich ecotone with
ocean fisheries, large sea mammal populations, thick kelp forests, complex near-
shore ecosystems and intertidal zones, spawning streams, and a highly diverse
avian fauna. The workshops will be used to (1) identify existing oceanographic,
climatological, geophysical, and biological data that document complex
environmental change in the Aleutians; (2) identify research areas and
investigators needed to provide additional data necessary to reconstruct
environmental change in the Aleutians; and (3) correlate existing data from the
physical and biological sciences with the recorded history of human occupation
of, and adaptation to, the island chain; and (4) design a research strategy to
provide a more precise temporal framework for Holocene environmental change and
concomitant human responses. This project is an award emanating from the FY 2001
special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics
of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.
