This proposal will provide support for an Intensive Workshop for Macaulay2
Development, to be held on August 5th-9th, 2012 at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, NC. Approximately 30 researchers will attend the workshop. The
main objective is to implement algorithms in the following three rapidly growing
areas: enumerative geometry, numerical algebraic geometry, homological algebra,
and algebraic statistics. These areas have significant applications in fields as
diverse as computational biology, data analysis, statistics, and theoretical
physics. It is the expectation, therefore, that the packages developed through
this workshop will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple
disciplines. Some emphasis will also be placed on enhancing the multithreaded
capabilities of Macaulay2.

Macaulay2 is one of the leading computer algebra systems for research and
teaching in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The ability to perform
increasingly complicated computations in more areas of these two fields
continues to revolutionize both research in algebraic geometry and commutative
algebra, and the breadth of the applications of these fields to other areas of
research. Most of the other related computer algebra systems are based in
foreign countries and continued competitiveness of Macaulay2, a leading United
States--based program, depends on both a broad community contributing to its
development and the funding to support this community through intensive
workgroup meetings.

The participation of both experienced and novice researchers from a variety of
institutions is crucial to the work of these workshops. These intensive
workshops are also a great opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows to enhance their package-writing skills early in their careers, taking
advantage of the experience and research expertise of the more senior
researchers as well as sharing their own expertise with the group. A strong
presence from young researchers also helps the base of mathematicians
programming for Macaulay2 to grow over time. Travel and lodging support for
these workshops are critical to both the intensive nature of the workshop and to
the future development of Macaulay2.
