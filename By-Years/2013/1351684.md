The proposal is to study the design of feedback control strategies which
stabilize and steer systems by affecting them in only a few variables. The
motivation comes from applications which are either large-scale or
geographically distributed and therefore cannot be feasibly affected in many
places. A primary motivating application is the control of metabolic chemical
reaction networks within the human body which can be affected by drugs typically
interacting with only a few out of the tens of thousands reagents in the human
metabolism. The goal is to design sparse strategies which stabilize models of
metabolic networks away from undesirable equilibria with an eye to developing
algorithms which could one day be used to design drugs regulating human
metabolism.

Intellectual Merit:

The design of efficient algorithms which find the sparsest possible controllers
for linear and polynomial dynamical systems will be investigated. Whenever this
is not possible intractability results rigorously demonstrating this
impossibility will be developed. A central focus of the work will be on
computational complexity issues as the search for sparse controllers turns out
to be intractable in many cases of interest. The main contribution will be in
the development of algorithms which take advantage of the generic properties of
real-world systems to avoid intractability barriers and efficiently find very
sparse controllers.

Broader Impacts:

The algorithms have potential to become standard tools of control engineering
practice whenever large systems are involved or when the number of sensors and
actuators available is limited. The PI will work to ensure that the protocols
developed here enter into the control curriculum. Both undergraduate and
graduate students will be involved in the execution of the research. Outreach
activities are planned, especially for beginning undergraduate students with the
aim of increasing retention rates of under-represented groups in engineering.
