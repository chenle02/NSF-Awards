A program of laboratory experiments in gravitation is to be continued and
expanded. Emphasis will be on instrumentation for tests of Einstein's weak
equivalence principle (EP), and a high accuracy measurement of the gravitational
constant G. The instrument best suited for this research is the classic torsion
balance. In modern form this instrument is remarkable in its capability to
measure slowly varying extremely small forces, but it is now approaching the
limits of its abilities when operated at room temperature. An important thrust
of this research program will be the development and application of a new
generation of torsion balance instruments which operate at cryogenic
temperatures with greatly increased sensitivity due to lower thermal noise and
greater mechanical stability.
