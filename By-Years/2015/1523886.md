This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of
groups under-represented in science. The title of the research plan for this
fellowship to Eric M. Johnson Chavarria is "Investigating force dependent
release of regulatory proteins from actin filaments under tension." The host
institution for this fellowship is Yale University and the sponsoring scientist
is Enrique M. De La Cruz.

The cytoskeleton is dynamic protein network in living cells that generates
forces that drive cell migration, division and transport of intracellular
components. One of the protein components of the cytoskeleton, called actin,
organizes into filaments. The research sponsored by this fellowship focuses on
the growing ends of these filaments and the proteins within the gelsolin
superfamily that cap those ends. Flightless I is a protein within this
superfamily and was first isolated from fruit flies that could not fly. This
protein expressed in eukaryotic cells has been shown to inhibit cell migration
by capping actin and is a key component of normal actin function and also a
potential therapeutic target. This single molecule system offers a powerful tool
for quantifying actin filaments and capping proteins under applied tension by
microfluidic shear flow and imaged directly by fluorescence microscopy in real-
time. Training goals for this fellowship include acquiring expertise in protein
purification, labeling, and single molecule microscopy techniques and career
advancement activities for a member from a group underrepresented in biology at
the postdoctoral level. Educational outreach includes mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students and developing lesson plans on actin cytoskeleton using
3D printing for visual learning. Lesson plans and materials are being
disseminated through summer workshops for local K-12 educators, website creation
and web based videos.
