9416820 Greenland The investigators will perform a comparative climatological
analysis of the LTER sites. The intersite analysis will include four items: 1. a
systematic time series analysis of temperature and precipitation records of all
19 LTER sites using the same methodology for each site; 2. a compilation of
projected climate change scenarios from a range of climate model experiments
interpolated to LTER sites and regions and a discussion of uncertainties
associated with these projections; 3. descriptions of the climate and water
budget of the LTER sites; 4. a comparative analysis of the climate of all 19
sites, including analyses of regional climates for the sites. The analysis will
be published as an electronic book by means of the LTER Network MOSAIC
information system as well as an LTER Network paper and will also be submitted
for publication in peer reviewed journals.
