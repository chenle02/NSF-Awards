Using a five-month planning grant, the International Society for Optical
Engineering (SPIE) will develop a comprehensive 10-year, educational initiative
to address the needs of the optical science and engineering communities. A
series of workshops will be held at professional meetings of SPIE and the
Optical Society of America (OSA) to assess regional needs and resources.
Workshop recommendations will be used to create a plan to enhance the scientific
and technological literacy of the public and raise the level of awareness about
career options in this exciting and expanding field. The meetings will
incorporate a diverse array of stakeholders including optical engineering and
science professionals, formal and informal educators, as well as representatives
from industry and underrepresented groups in science and engineering. Strategic
emphasis will be placed on informal science education and efforts to recruit and
retain minorities and women in optical engineering and related sciences. The
resulting education blueprint will be disseminated to the field in electronic
and print media, and subsequently implemented by SPIE and OSA.
