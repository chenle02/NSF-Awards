Refinements are being made to a system which achieves name placement without
ambiguity and without overlap. The current system is able to achieve maps of an
acceptable quality. Many cartographic conventions are successfully incorporated:
avoidance of having a feature and its name separated by an intervening line
feature; splitting a line feature to permit a point feature name to overlap it;
curving all horizontal point and area feature names to parallel the curving of
constant-latitude lines; and placing area-feature names to span the feature. To
achieve area-feature name placement that more consistently yields good results,
a new approach to area-feature name placement is investigated. The new approach
uses a different scheme for abstracting area shape than the medial-axis
transform (skeleton) scheme used in earlier work. In essence, it first
approximates a given area boundary by means of a polygon of relatively few
sides, using the Ramer algorithm.
