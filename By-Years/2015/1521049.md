Whether evolution of the Ebola virus will lead to changes in infectivity is
currently unknown. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, evidence
suggests that the virus has had a higher rate of genetic change, substitution
rate, than in prior outbreaks. The investigators will study how genetic
evolution may make the virus more or less infectious, how it will either help or
hinder the human immune response to Ebola virus infections, and how viral
evolution will impact existing and future therapies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
region of interest on the Ebola genome encodes for a glycoprotein that is
located on the surface of the virus and infected cells. It is an important
target for neutralizing antibodies and changes in its function and morphology
could impact antibody recognition. The investigators will determine the
functional implications from the recent and historic evolution of the Ebola
virus, as well as model all possible mutations that could interrupt binding
between the glycoprotein and antibodies but that would not significantly reduce
folding stability. This research will provide health agencies an essential
"watch list" of potential Ebola virus mutations with corresponding predictions
of how these mutations are expected to impact the disease process.
