The geochemistry of Be and B in marine sediments will be studied, with
particular attention to sediments in subduction zones. The purpose is to
determine the intial inputs of Be/B into the subduction zones. This will include
a study of dissolbed boron in pore fluids from different environments, a study
of the istopic geochemistry of boron from sediments from two subduction zones
(ODP sites 671 and 672 in the Nankai Trough) and a study of boron geochemistry
from cores that have undergone temperatures of well over 100'C.
