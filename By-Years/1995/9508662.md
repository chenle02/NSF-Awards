9508662 Drew The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
mathematical sciences. The University-Based Graduate Research Assistantships
provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend part of their time in the
classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting. These awards are a
means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the
nation. This research will model the flow of a fluid containing a large number
of small paramagnetic particles. When this fluid is subjected to a magnetic
field, the particles tend to align (polymerize), and the flow properties of the
fluid change dramatically. The aligned states will be modeled using a
probability density function for the length of chains of particles. A Monte
Carlo model for the distribution function will be derived, and appropriate
attachment and breaking models tested. This model will be coupled to the fluid
flow. The result of this work will be a prediction tool that incorporates the
microscopic physics of the processes involved in the lengths of the chains, and
that can be compared to flow data.
