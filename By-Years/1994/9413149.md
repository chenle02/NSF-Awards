9413149 Singhal The Production and Operations Management Society is holding two
workshops for engineering and business faulty in the areas of International
Technology Management and Total Quality Management, (TQM). The workshop on
international management of technology will cover a wide range of related
topics, including design, manufacturing, and decision making. The TQM workshop
will cover both design and manufacturing. These two areas are quite critical to
the nation's competitiveness, and yet their development in education, research
and training is lagging. Almost all business and engineering colleges are trying
to develop courses and research agendas in the areas. The objective of these
workshops is to facilitate these efforts.
