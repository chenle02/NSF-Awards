This research seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of developing large-scale
cultivation methods for producing "lymphokine activated killer cells" (LAKs).
Recent clinical trials have shown that these types of cells have strong anti-
tumor activity. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACI) treatments for cancer
involve the administration of such cells to patients to induce tumor regression.
One ACI method involves the extracorporeal treatment of a patient's own
lymphocytes obtained by leukaphersis with the lymphokine interleukin-2. These
cells are then reinfused back into the patient. Additional interleukin-2 is also
administered to the patient. The goal of these studies is to achieve the higher
cell densities and lower media costs needed for trulyu practical ACI methods.
Improved culture methods for T-cells developed in these studies may then be
tested in patients by medical immunology groups.
