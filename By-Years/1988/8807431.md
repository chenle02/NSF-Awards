The basic plan of this project is to assemble a complete set of thermodynamic
and structural data for a well defined set of peptides in order to explore
specific questions concerning the nature of protein/bilayer interactions. This
project is expected to lead to a refined view of such interactions and to
provide information about hydrophobicity scales and their application in the
assessment of membrane protein structure. The generally accepted image of
membranes is that of a quasi two-dimensional solution of hydrophobic protein
"solutes" partitioned into a lipid bilayer "solvent". It is important to develop
a quantitative understanding of the bilayer as a solvent for hydrophobic
molecules with the goal of describing not only interactions of hydrophobic
peptides with bilayers but eventually the interactions of protein with
membranes.***//
