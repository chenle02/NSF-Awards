The purpose of this project is to characterize the structure and function of the
plant vacuolar H+-ATPase. The specific goals of the project are (i) to determine
the complete subunit composition by further purification and
immunoprecipitation; (ii) to study the subunit organization by dissociating and
identifying the peripheral subunits; (iii) to deduce the primary structure and
later to define the functional domains of selected subunits by cloning and
sequencing the gene encoding the 16 kDa proteolipid; (iv) to test the function
of the 16 kDa proteolipid by reconstitution and molecular genetic methods; (v)
to localize the subcellular distribution of the ATPase; and (vi) to begin
preliminary studies on the biosynthesis of selected ATPase subunits. Plant cells
contain a large central vacuole that occupies up to 80% of the cell volume. They
are important for maintaining cell turgor and for the storage of ions and
metabolites. Transport processes across the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) are
controlled by electrochemical gradients that are determined in part by the
tonoplast localized vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPases) which is a proton-pumping ATPase
(H+-ATPase). The V-ATPases represent a class of ATPase that is present in the
endomembrane system of all eukaryotic cells. Thus, investigations on the
structure and function of the plant vacuolar ATPase has relevance to the
function of the endomembrane system in all higher organisms.
