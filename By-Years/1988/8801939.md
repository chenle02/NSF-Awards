Heuristic search is a fundamental problem solving method in artificial
intelligence. Current algorithm such as A* and IDA*, however, do not scale up to
large problems, due to their focus on finding optimal solutions. Removing the
optimality constraint should allow the development of heuristic search
algorithms that can effectively solve arbitrarily large problems. The reason is
that heuristic evaluation functions capture the long-range strategic component
of problem solutions, while the discrepancy between heuristic estimates and
actual costs is primarily a short-range or tactical phenomenon. Thus, an
algorithm with a sufficiently wide search horizon should be able to cope with
error in the heuristic function. A two-pronged attach on this problem is
proposed. The first is the development of real-time search algorithms that run
in constant time and can commit to actions based on limited information or
computation. The second is the development of parallel search algorithms in an
attempt to significantly extend the search horizons achievable by such
algorithms. Parallel tree-search algorithms should generalize to arbitrary tree-
recursive programs, such as those generated by divide-and-conquer algorithms.
