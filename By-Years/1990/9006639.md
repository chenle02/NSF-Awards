In the usual methods of muscle stimulation muscle motor units are activated from
large to small, which is reverse to the order of recruitment during
physiological stimulation. The proposed work is to further explore a novel
technique for electrical muscle stimulation that maintains the physiological
order of recruitment. The method relies on high frequency collision block
produced by a cuff electrode. The project is to determine the characteristics of
muscle under a variety of conditions using this new method of stimulation; the
intent is to improve the control of muscle contraction. If successful, the
project may contribute a new technique to rehabilitating paralyzed individuals.
