This study examines the nature of interfirm networks among large U.S. and
Japanese corporations in order to assess the effects of network affiliation and
position on company structure, strategy and performance. The Principal
Investigators will collect longitudinal data from published sources on
directorship interlocks, trading relationships, debt relationships, and
reciprocal shareholding relationships among firms. They will also use published
sources to obtain information on internal company organization, size and
diversification, and such performance dimensions as profitability, sales growth,
and share price. Network analytic techniques will be applied to these data for
the purpose of uncovering and comparing structural patterns in U.S. and Japanese
business networks. Of central interest is the question of how clusterings
uncovered by network analysis correspond to keiretsu (enterprise) groupings in
the Japanese economy. Firm level outcome variables of structure, strategy, and
performance will be modeled as a function of network position and linkage. The
Japanese and U.S. economies appear to differ dramatically in terms of the
structural relationships among organizations. There is strong support for the
characterization of Japan as a network economy, which relies upon a dense web of
social bonds and obligation to manage and coordinate transactions. By employing
network theories and methods this study will serve to advance our understanding
of such network economies and their competitive advantages relative to the
United States.
