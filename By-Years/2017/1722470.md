This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for a workshop
to be held May 19-25, 2017 at Truckee, California. This workshop aims to
introduce aspiring mathematicians in the fields of symplectic and contact
geometry and from many institutions to vibrant areas of research, fostering
collaboration, forming strong research ties between young researchers, and thus
promoting future collaboration and research. The workshop is specifically
designed to encourage the development of a diverse group of researchers in the
fields of symplectic and contact geometry. It is a week-long intensive workshop,
in which all activities occur under one roof. The lectures are delivered by the
graduate student participants with the help of three mentors: Roger Casals
(MIT), Laura Starkston (Stanford), and Steven Sivek (Bonn), who are emerging
expert researchers in the field. This setup enhances communication skills,
encourages active involvement or the participants and forging new
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of the 2017 workshop is
symplectic fillings of contact manifolds, a topic with both a rich history and
lots of new ideas that are currently being developed. One major aspect of the
modern understanding of symplectic fillings is via an ever-growing dichotomy in
symplectic and contact geometry: flexibility versus rigidity. Some fillings can
be flexible, in which case they are completely determined up to isomorphism by
differential-topological data; otherwise, there is a hope that some count of
J-holomorphic curves implies that the symplectic geometry is more nuanced than
the underlying differential topology. One goal of the workshop is to form
bridges between these two different perspectives. Notes from the lectures and
further information will be available on the website
