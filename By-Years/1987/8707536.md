The Tertiary gabbroic dikes of the Kangerdlugssuaq region, East Greenland,
offer for study the products of a natural laboratory experiment on the chemical
and physical processes that occur when mafic magmas incorporate blocks of wall
rocks. A combination of superb glaciated alpine outcrops, structural relief of 1
km, and good background studies of field relations and igneous petrology
(including the classic work of Wager, Deer, and others on the Skaergaard
Intrusion) make this an ideal study area. It should be possible to make a
definitive test of the competiting hypotheses of wholesale vs. selective
chemical contamination. The mechanisms of chemical interaction and mechanics of
mixing hybrid magmas may be determined by direct observation of the abundant,
remarkably clean outcrops. It is proposed to use a multi-disciplinary array of
methods including field, geochemical, isotopic, and experimental techniques to
test the hypothesis that gabbros were selectively contaminated by remobilized
sialic basement and hydrothermally altered basalt wall rocks. The geochemical
data will be used to evaluate existing models of assimilation - fractional
crystallization and to refine such models, if necessary. The results should
materially aid understanding the physics and chemistry of crustal contamination,
a process essential to the accurate interpretation of geochemical
characteristics of continental volcanic rocks and consequent deductions
regarding the nature of subcontinental mantle.
