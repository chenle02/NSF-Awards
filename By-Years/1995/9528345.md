9528345 Thouless This is a proposal to continue work on two fundamental problems
in materials theory, quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. The specific
problems here are all derived from the topological symmetry derived conservation
laws and the corresponding quantum numbers. The questions that need to be
addressed, include the location where the current is generated in a Hall device
and in a superfluid or a superconductor, the question of the mass density of a
vortex and whether the Magnus force on a vortex is finite or zero. In addition
there will be exploration of some aspects of quantum chaos, for example the
notion of a distance between two states in quantum mechanics. %%% Much of the
metrological work (measumenent of fundamental constants to high precision, or
high precision measurements of voltage and resistance) involve use of
topological quantum numbers. These quantum numbers are found in a variety of
diverse situations and yet there are deep underlying similarities. The
fundamental properties associated with the topological quantum numbers are the
subject of this study. The applications include the stability of superconductor
or a superfluid and more specifically the detailed dynamics of the vortices. A
comprehensive review, in the form of lecture notes and reprints of classical
papers on the subject of topological quantum numbers will be prepared.
