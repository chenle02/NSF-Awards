This award will fund research on topological phases of quantum matter, an
interdisciplinary research area encompassing physics, computer science, and
mathematics. A longstanding goal of this field is to produce novel materials
with properties that are inherently immune to defects and noise. For example,
they can carry electrical currents that do not decay in time and do not
introduce errors in computations based on their topological properties,
prioritizing them for the construction of quantum computers. Primary
investigators (PIs) will develop a mathematical theory to understand the
properties of such materials better, especially how to classify them and how to
quantify their robustness to defects. The students working on the project will
work alongside the PIs and gain expertise in the area. Developing a pool of
young people proficient in quantum mechanics is a crucial part of quantum leap,
and the award will help to build this pool through students' apprenticeships.

Integer Quantum Hall effect is the primary example of a topological phase of
matter. The mathematical theory of Quantum Hall effect in the absence of
interactions was developed in the 1980s and 1990s. In recent years there was a
strong push to develop the tools in the presence of interactions with the
potential of extending the theory to topological phases requiring interactions.
This award will merge two prominent directions in this research, many-body
localization, and many-body index theory. PIs aim to show that the recently
constructed indices are robust to many-body localization, both as mathematical
and physical indices, which means that they are integer valued and constant in
each topological phase and that they retain the meaning of electrical
conductance. This task requires a better understanding of the transport
properties of disordered many-body systems than is currently available. Study of
these properties is another focus of the project.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
