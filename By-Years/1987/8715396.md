The lack of knowledge and the inadequacy of tools and techniques for effective
management of information has serious negative impact on the management and
control of enterprises. Industry is beginning to recognize the need for research
about the creation, storage/retrieval, display, transmission, management, and
use of information, as well as how to integrate all of these processes through a
total systems approach. One of the ways industry can support the research
necessary to address their problems is through an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center. This planning grant is studying the feasibility and
viability of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Information
Management at the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with the
University of Arizona. The study is addressing the research interests and needs
of industry, alternative organizations, policies and operations of a Center, and
the potential for such a Center to become self-sufficient. The Co-Principal
Investigators and their colleagues are noted researchers in their fields and
have the necessary expertise and industry contacts to perform this study. The
planning grant is being co-funded by the U.S. Army Institute for Research in
Management Information Communication and Computer Science. The Program Manager
recommends that the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with the
University of Arizona be awarded a $100,000 grant for one (1) year to fund this
study.
