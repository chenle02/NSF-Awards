The project examines calculations of protein electrostatic properties and
electrostatic interactions with charged surfaces. The detailed molecular
structure of the proteins is used in calculating the local and the mean
molecular surface potential. A new boundary-integral method, which includes
calculation of nonlinear electric double layer effects, is used. The results are
used as a basis for precise calculations of electrophoretic mobilities and
adsorption equilibria of proteins. Experiments aim at determining
electrophoretic mobilities for electrophoretic separations and ion exchange
chromatographic retention separations.//
