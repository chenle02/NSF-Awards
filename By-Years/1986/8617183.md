The PI proposes to develop efficient methods of processing iron and phosphate
ores. The proposed work deals with the interfacial processes in iron oxide-
silica system with the specific purpose of developing flocculants that can
produce selective aggregation of component minerals. Topics such as adsorption
of surfactants and polymers on mineral surfaces, electrokinetic studies under
conditions similar to those encountered in actual seperation processes and
possibilities for selective flocculation seperation between hematite and clays
by flocculants with functional groups such as hydroxamates will be investigated.
