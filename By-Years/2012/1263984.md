This workshop brings together US and non-US representatives of the marine
geology and geophysics community, as well as the offshore hydrocarbon industry
to discuss shared data challenges in the marine geophysics area, in particular
issues surrounding the collection, processing, and availability of 3D seismic
data. Workshop Goals are to review successful examples of academic and industry
shared-use activities in marine geophysics and discuss lessons learned, to
discuss the possibility of R/V Marcus Langseth (the NSF-owned 3D seismic
research vessel) operations that could both benefit the academic and industrial
sector, and to discuss a possible joint industry-academic data acquisition and
data interpretation scenario. Data discovery and accessibility issues and
cyberinfrastructure needs related to EarthCube, the new NSF activity to
integrate and improve the computing and data management needs of the NSF
Geosciences Directorate, will also be discussed and summarized in documents to
be made available to the public. This meeting is designed to address problems
that have a significant present and future influence on the marine geophysicsl
research and the education of the next generation of marine geophysicists. It
will also explore improved sustainability of the Langseth 3-D seismic platform.
