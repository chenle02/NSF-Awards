0314100&lt;br/&gt;Scoccimarro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Roman Scoccimarro, New
York University and Professor Diego Hararri of the University of Buenos Aires
are organizing the Fifth Winter School of Physics "Precision Cosmology" which
will provide a series of lectures and seminars aimed at advanced graduate
students on the subject of modern cosmology. It will be held July 28 - August 1,
2003 at the University of Buenos Aires. There will be eight short courses,
specialized seminars, poster sessions, and informal workshops on special topics.
The focus will be an overview of the significant advances of the last decade.
Around 40 graduate students will attend, coming from Argentina, Brazil, as well
as the U.S. The funds will be used to pay for U.S. graduate students as well as
for several U.S. speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first school solely
devoted to this topic of current interest. It will play an essential role in
educating graduate students in Latin America and the U.S. on these issues. It
will play a significant role in fostering the exchange and collaboration between
young scientists of both countries.&lt;br/&gt;
