Mathematics faculty members at Southwest Misssouri State University (SMSU) will
conduct a four week summer workshop in the teaching of problem solving, as
applied to most scientific disciplines, for 30 junior high school teachers from
southwest Missouri. Four key personnel, called "helping teachers," selected
during the workshop, will receive additional leadership development and be
actively involved in the further planning and implementation of this project.
All participants will assist fellow teachers, to implement strategies in problem
solving throughout their curricula during the academic year. Participants will
construct lessons and teaching aids which demonstrate application problems in
the fields of physics, astronomy, computer science, chemistry, biology, and/or
geoscience. After implementing the problem solving materials developed in the
workshop and evaluating them, a monograph of the activities considered effective
will be produced and distributed to each middle and junior high school principal
in the 24 county service area of Southwest Missouri State University. This
project will become self-sufficient in 1988 when SMSU institutionalizes a course
based on the workshop which will be made available and attractive to teachers
under the State reimbursement law. The monograph and teacher developed materials
will be available at the Problem Solving Materials Center at the University. A
network of "helping teachers" and former participants will work together to
conduct in-service workshops for fellow teachers. "Strategies for Problem
Solving" clearly and comprehensively addresses the dire need for more creative
and innovative strategies for mathematical problem solving. It acknowledges and
seeks to address science and mathematics instruction in rural, minority and
economically disadvantaged school districts.
