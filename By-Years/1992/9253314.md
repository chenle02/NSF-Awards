North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) is offering a four
year program to create a network of twenty-five pairs of high school lead
teachers from across the nation to disseminate exemplary materials in
precalculus and calculus developed by the NCSSM faculty. The participants will
attend a series of residential summer workshops and will return for
progressively more advanced curricular work and leadership training over the
course of three summers. During the school year they will be supported with an
annual conference, a quarterly newsletter, and on-line conferencing, and thee
teams will share the new concepts and materials with other teachers in their
regions. Non-NSF sources will provide cost sharing of 24% of the award.
