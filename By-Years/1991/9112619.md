This study will investigate the mitochondrial variation of Trimerotropis
saxatilis. This grasshopper is found in subdivided populations throughout its
range. Ecological experiments have determined that population size is smaller
than expected from previous genetic studies and suggest gene flow is
nonexistent. Mitochondrial DNA is a non-recombining molecule, so nested
cladograms of mitochondrial haplotypes will be constructed and tested for
significant differences at a variety of levels. Indirect methods of estimating
gene flow and the coalescent theory will be used to determine whether
"historical events" (e.g. bottlenecks) have taken place in the past or whether
gene flow is ongoing, but rare. Populations throughout the range of T. saxatilis
will be sampled in order to compare the genetic variation found at the extremes
of the range to that in the center. Aside from questions pertaining specifically
to T. saxatilis, this study has broader applications to the field of
conservation genetics. T. saxatilis populations have undergone habitat
fragmentation in the last few thousand years due to climate change. The
statistical methods developed and used in this project can be used to assess the
genetic status of endangered species.
