"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses fundamental and
challenging questions that are common to robotic systems that build their own
maps and solve monitoring tasks. In particular, the work contributes to our
general understanding of the interplay between sensing, control, and computation
as people attempt to design systems that minimize costs and maximize
robustness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerful new abstractions, planning algorithms,
and control laws that accomplish basic mapping and monitoring operations are
being developed in this effort. This is expected to lead to improved
technologies in numerous settings where mapping and monotoring are basic
components.&lt;br/&gt;Ample motivation is provided by technological challenges
that involve searching, tracking, and monitoring the behavior of people,
wildlife, and robots. Examples include search-and-rescue, security sweeps,
mapping abandoned mines, scientific study of endangered species, assisted
living, ground-based military operations, and even analysis of shopping habits.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is particularly transformative because it lives
outside of the traditional boundaries of algorithms, computational geometry,
sensor networks, control theory, and robotics. Furthermore, national interest
continues to grow in the direction of developing distributed robotic systems
that combine sensing, actuation, and computation. By helping to break down
traditional academic and scientific barriers, it is expected that the work will
transform the way we think about robotics algorithms, the engineering design
process, and the education of students across the robotics, computational
geometry, and control disciplines.
