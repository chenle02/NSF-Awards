Quasi-one-dimensional conductors such as niobium triselenide exhibit striking
transport properties resulting from the collective motion of charge-density
waves (CDWs). A detailed understanding of these phenomena has been difficult
because of the many factors, including pinning by impurities and other defects,
surface pinning, finite size effects, and contacts which may affect the
behavior. This work will study niobium triselenide doped with hydrogen
impurities which very weakly interact with the CDWs and permit study of the
weakly pinned regime. Both the nature of CDW-surface interactions and finite
size effects will also be studied. This program will be supported by a strong
materials effort involving the characterization of defects and the development
of improved crystal growth methods.
