The proposed research builds on previous research examining public policy and
cultural values of stakeholders in land use policy for arctic wilderness areas.
The proposed research expands on the previous research by investigating ways of
reducing land use conflict in arctic wilderness areas. Through both quantitative
and qualitative research methods, Dr. Gladden will do a comparison of three case
studies of wilderness areas in Finnish Lapland, Alaska, and the Yukon
Territories of Canada. Four research hypotheses will be examined to explain the
variation in conflict between local and non-local groups in the three case study
areas: 1) increased policy control by local residents reduces conflict, 2)
increased participation in planning processes reduces conflict, 3) legal
integration of national laws leads to decreased conflict, 4) reduced focus on
ideological values in the planning process, decreases conflict.
