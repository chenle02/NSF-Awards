9707512 Edwards The goal of the proposal research is to investigate molecular
transport across the major transport barriers of the eye. Despite the importance
of sight, a fundamental understanding of transport in the eye is still lacking.
A mathematical model without fitted parameters will be developed to predict
solute transport rates across the cornea and the sclera given the physiochemical
properties of the compounds. The model will be vased on the real ultrastructure
of each barrier, and will relate the geometrical parameters and chemical
composition of each tissue to its macroscopic measurable transport properties.
The importance of understanding molecular transport in the eye is several fold.
The natural function of the eye, like all organs of the body, is directly
related to the transport of water, solute, and ionic species. For instance,
glucose is required by the corneal epithelium for energy production, and it
reaches the cells by diffusion from the aqueous humor. Another example is that
of keratocyte migration to the wound site following stomal injury, possibly
under the attraction of an electrical field. Characterization of the structure
and function of the eye is often made by measuring transport properties such as
diffusivity, permeability and electrical conductivity. A quantitative
understanding of transport in the eye can aid in the interpretation of these
data. The ability to predict transport rates also has direct application to eye
drug delivery. The principal aims of the model are: 1) to predict the water and
solute permeability of the cornea and the sclera as a function of hydration,
collagen and proteoglycan content, fibril distribution, and the size and
partition coefficient of the solute; 2) to determine the electrical resistance
properties of the two barriers; and 3) to simulate transient transport of
nutrients in the cornea. ***
