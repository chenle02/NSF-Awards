The University of California Berkeley is developing courseware for a computer
class laboratory that is a central feature of a new four-semester calculus
sequence. Students spend three hours a week in this computer laboratory working
in groups of 25 using the courseware with a trained Graduate Student Instructor.
This laboratory work is fully integrated with three hours of lectures in a
traditional large class format. The courseware consists of detailed lesson plans
and worksheets together with implementation in MatLab. The laboratory courseware
attempts to balance individual and group work, integrates computer and paper and
pencil work, and integrates with an existing traditional curriculum. Further,
the overall project is creating an infrastructure in the department that makes
it inviting and easy for all faculty to teach in these new courses. The project
pays particular attention to the proper training of the Graduate Student
Instructors. The project is collaborating with the Professional Development
Program at Berkeley by featuring elements that are aimed at improving the
success rates of at-risk students in these key gateway courses. Project results
are being widely disseminated through presentations, a World Wide Web site, and
commercial publication.
