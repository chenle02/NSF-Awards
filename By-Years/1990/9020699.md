This project supports a linguistic anthropologist who will identify and explain
cross-language patterns in ways Native American languages have named new objects
or concepts encountered in contact situations. At least 100 Indians languages
will be surveyed for words of 50 items of Occidental culture (e.g., chair, cow,
week, clock). Such words are either loanwoards (e.g., from Spanish into Indian
languages) or manufactured from native vocabulary. The hypothesis is that
languages that are heavy adopters of loans for these items have histories
involving significant bilingualism, while languages that show considerable use
of native terms do not have such histories. This research is important because
understanding of how languages adopt new concepts and words for new objects
advances our basic understanding of language as a human element.
