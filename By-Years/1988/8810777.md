This action is to support the training activities of a young neuroscientist
under the NSF Career Advancement Awards. There are two main, interrelated
activities which will be conducted with this award: 1) Training of the applicant
in the technique of intracerebral microdialysis, with the development of
sensitive high-performance liquid-chromatographic and radio-enzymatic assays for
acetylcholine; and 2) Incorporating the newly acquired research techniques into
the applicant's ongoing research program at Marshall University School of
Medicine. Training in the stated techniques will enable an expansion of the
applicant's research program from one of descriptive observations at the
organismal level to one of elucidating interneuronal communication at the
molecular level.
