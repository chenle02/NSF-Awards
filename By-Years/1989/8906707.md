Speciation - the process through which new species arise - remains one of the
most controversial (and poorly understood) aspects of the study of animal
diversity. Natural hybridization events between closely related species provide
unique opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of species differences and
the nature of the barriers to gene exchange that tend to keep species distinct.
Information about the distribution and number of genes that contribute to
genetic isolation can be gained from analysis of the distribution of genotypes
within and adjacent to a hybrid zone. This project will document, at high
resolution, patterns of genetic variation in a very well-characterized zone of
hybridization between closely related insect species. These genetic analyses
will be coupled with studies of both pre-mating and post-mating barriers to gene
exchange (factors that cause reproductive isolation). The project will take
advantage of recombinant DNA technology to identify a set of restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), which will serve as the genetic markers
to analyze the extent and direction of hybridization and backcrossing and the
consequences for the flow of alleles from one species into the other. The
discovery of RFLPs has provided an enormously useful set of markers for human
geneticists studying inherited diseases and holds great promise for genetic
studies of natural populations of other species as well. The approaches and
understanding developed in the course of this study will be useful in a variety
of contexts.
