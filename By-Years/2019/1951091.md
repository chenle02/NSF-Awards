The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will result from development of a technology to automatically detect
controversy and disinformation, providing a means for financial institutions to
reduce risk exposure. Controversies and disinformation have received public
attention and political concern recently. Application of the technology in the
finance industry is part of a growing trend toward "alternative data" products
relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning, saving analyst time and
enabling faster reactions to news stories and social media. Demonstrating the
innovation in a quantifiable application, such as finance, is expected to lead
to more far-reaching societal impact by enabling users to critically and
quantitatively evaluate the often-overwhelming stream of online
content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project advances the development of novel algorithms that automatically
detect controversy in social media, news, and other outlets. The proposed
project will apply a real-time controversy detection signal to financial data,
using methods such as language models and machine learning. Additionally, this
project will: 1) build core capabilities based on existing controversy detection
technology; and 2) construct novel algorithms with broad
applicability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
