9414391 Turkevich It is proposed to repeat the determination of the half-life of
238U for producing 238Pu, which has a half-life of 88 years. The decay rate of
this heaviest available nucleus by a second-order weak process (double beta
decay) tests our understanding of the nuclear structure of heavy nuclei and of
the nature of the antineutrinos that are thought to be involved. The rate to be
confirmed is 12 orders of magnitude times slower than that of alpha decay of
238U, discovered about 100 years ago, and is one of the slowest spontaneous
processes that has been measured. A radiochemical method will be used to isolate
the 238Pu that has accumulated in about 50 years in about 7kg of uranyl nitrate.
The amount of 238Pu will be determined by measuring the characteristic alpha
particles in special detectors with very low backgrounds. A parallel blank
experiment using the same chemicals will be carried out to make sure that no
plutonium has been introduced. The results should have more statistical
significance and be more easily defended against criticisms of the earlier work.
Recent theoretical predictions of the double beta decay rate in 238U differ by
two orders of magnitude, but are expected to improve. Extensive and increasing
world-wide radioactive contamination by 238Pu is another important reason for
checking the experimental results now. A sample of 1945 uranium salt is
available for the experiment.***
