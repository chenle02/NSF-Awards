9302137 Kushner The project deals with several basic areas in stochastic control
with emphasis on numerical methods. The PI has recently published a book on the
subject, and the techniques allow the effective treatment of many of the
standard types of problems. The techniques are applicable to deterministic
problems and examples (and proofs and data) are given for hard problems arising
in the calculus of variations. The aim is to encourage the wider use of
stochastic systems methods via the numerical possibilities. The proposal also
concerns a variety of approximation and limit problems in complex control
systems. For example, the control of admission and routing in networks in
communications, when there are several classes of customers and the work is in
the heavy traffic regime. There are significant mathematical problems here. The
associated numerical problem is also of interest. ***
