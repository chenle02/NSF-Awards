9615357 Vidale This grant provides $47,000 as one-half of the costs of acquiring
computer equipment for the UCLA Department of Earth &amp; Space Sciences for use
in seismological and geodetic research. Equipment to be purchased will include,
multiple SUN workstations, one high end SUN workstation dual processors and
expanded memory and disk storage and additional peripherals. This equipment will
greatly enhance the research capabilities of a large group at UCLA which
conducts a broad range of geophysical research that is computationally
intensive. Studies that will utilize the new computer network will include,
modeling of earthquake clustering determined from seismic data and displacement
data determined from GPS measurements in an attempt to provide earthquake
forecasts, the nature of seismicity based on analysis of fault geometry and rock
types, statistical analysis of pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic data to
aid in understanding the spatial and temporal nature of seismic risks,
determination of seismic energy from analyses of broadband digital seismograms
to aid in the understanding of deep focus earthquake physics within subduction
zones, seismic tomography via analysis of PASSCAL data to examine mantle
dynamics beneath areas of active rifting (i.e. East African Rift, Baikal Rift)
and studies of the lateral heterogeneity of near-surface seismic velocities from
the Landers earthquake in southern California. ***
