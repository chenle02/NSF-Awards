The focus of this research project is to develop an integrated compiler and run-
time system for global data distribution. The goal is for the integrated system
to execute large-scale, multi-phase parallel scientific applications more
efficiently than can be done with static analysis alone. First, compiler
analysis will be developed to divide a program into its component phases as well
as pass useful hints to the run-time system about intra-phase behavior, such as
the communication pattern. Second, the necessary run-time analysis will be
developed to support multi-phase applications and to make use of the compiler
information. A framework will be investigated to determine at run time an
efficient global data distribution over a reasonable set of possible
distributions. This means that a distribution will be determined for each array
in each program phase, with possible redistribution between phases, that results
in good application performance. Furthermore, if application characteristics
change during execution, the distribution will be changed accordingly. The
integrated system will be measured on a variety of large-scale, adaptive
parallel scientific programs.
