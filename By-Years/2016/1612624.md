This award provides support for students to participate in the Fifteenth Summer
School on Exotic Beam (EBSS) Physics at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory, July 17 - 24, 2016. The school is designed for graduate students,
senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research and postdocs
(within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures
and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an
opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to
educate the next generation of scientists that will drive the research at the
Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online and other existing
rare isotope facilities. In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy
nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our
understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national
security.

Previous sessions of these summer schools have had broad participation of under-
represented minorities, with slightly more than 40% of the participants of the
Fourteenth EBSS being female. The organizers of the Fifteenth EBSS will continue
the use of accepted best practices to increase diversity and have an inclusive
summer school.
