Irving Epstein and Anatol Zhabotinsky of Brandeis University are funded by a
grant from the Theory and Computational Chemistry Program of the National
Science Foundation to continue experimental and theoretical research in
oscillating reactions and in general nonlinear chemical dynamics. Mechanistic
investigations will be conducted to determine the role of the elementary steps
in oscillating reactions, which could lead to the development of new chemical
oscillators. These studies employ both experimental and computational methods.
New chemical oscillators will be developed such as those involving Nitrogen
oxides. Mechanistic studies on systems such as those involving chlorites and
magnetic fields will be done. Waves and patterns such as the Turing patterns
will be studied. Chaotic dynamical coupled systems will be investigated. The
chaotic dynamically coupled systems are relevant to such things as combustion of
fossil fluids and the formation of smog, as well as the action of
neurotransmitters. The treatment of drinking water through chlorites are also a
part of this research. The effect of electromagnetic waves on living organisms
will be studied.
