Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include work on the
nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking, supersymmetry, string theory, conformal
quantum field theory, and the problem of the confinement of quarks and gluous.
The research involves creative approaches to centrally - important problems in
elementary particle theory.
