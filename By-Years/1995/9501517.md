9501517 Ahern The project involves research on several problems related to the
automorphism group of n-dimensional complex Euclidean space. For automorphisms
of finite period the two main problems are the linearization problem and the
related fixed point problem. Another theme treated in this project is the
question of describing, in some sense, all one parameter subgroups and the
related question of determining which automorphisms have square roots in the
sense of composition. This project is a synthesis of complex geometry, algebra
and analysis. The project involves understanding the algebraic and fixed point
structure of certain transformations on n-dimensional complex space. These
transformations are called automorphisms which means that they preserve the
shape of the space. In one direction the research asks whether certain of these
automorphisms are linear, i.e., preserve linear structure. In another direction
one tries to determine whether these automorphisms behave like linear
automorphisms in the sense of having fixed points. These automorphisms play an
important role in the study of complex manifolds. ***
