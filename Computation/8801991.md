This project consists of three subprojects on analytical and computational
methods in fluid mechanics. Professors Krasny, Borgers and Harabetian will work
in collaboration with each other as a group. They will attack the following
problems: 1. Computation of vortex sheet evolution. This project is concerned
with extending the so-called vortex blob method for computing vortex sheet
evolution. One planned application is to determine the structure of the spiral
which forms in a periodically perturbed vortex sheet. 2. Fast elliptic solver on
locally refined meshes. This research will combine domain decomposition methods
with the FAC algorithm developed by McCormick. These methods will be tested on
Neumann problems for Laplace's equation on regions arising in fluid dynamics
applications. 3. Numerical and analytical problems for systems of conservation
laws. Problems with small viscous perturbations, with vanishing viscosity
method, and with the incompressible limit of a contact discontinuity are going
to be considered. Research performed under this grant will have potential
applications to studies of aerodynamics and combustion, and will rely
extensively on computational tools related to nonlinear partial differential
equations.
