During the development of the nervous system, neurons undergo a number of
processes, including proliferation and differentiation. The purpose of this
research is to study the role of a growth factor receptor-like molecule (brain
specific kinase, Bsk) in neuronal differentiation. Growth factors and their
receptors are known to induce neuronal differentiation and support the survival
of neurons, and Bsk has been shown to be associated with neurons in the limbic
system of the brain during development. The studies will, first, investigate the
timing of the production of Bsk by neurons in the limbic system, and then will
attempt to modify the timing of its production by introducing into limbic system
neurons an altered Bsk gene. The results of these studies will further our
understanding of the development of the limbic system as well as the role of
growth factors in neural development.
