9351652 Tuchman The Department of Biology has a diverse undergraduate curriculum
with the majority of the resources directed towards courses and undergraduate
research in health-related subjects (e.g. Histology, Vertebrate Physiology,
Microbiology, and Neurobiology). We will enhance laboratories in limnology and
plant physiology using a configuration of microscopes and video systems that
will allow students to study plant cellular process and the aquatic environment.
The new laboratories will use a compound microscope that magnifies within the
range of 40X to 1670X, including feature for bright field, phase contrast,
Nomarski and fluorescence, and a stereoscope that magnifies from 3.8X to 128X
including fiber optics. Attached to the microscope stages are video cameras.
Each unit also has photographic capabilities. In addition, a video cassette
recorder with time-lapse capabilities will be used to record responses to
stimuli, behavior, and development. Thus, this equipment will enhance the
Department of Biology's ability to provide a current state-of-the-art hands-on
education to undergraduate majors interested in pursuing non-health related
disciplines. ***
