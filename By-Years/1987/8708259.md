This is a one-year pilot study to investigate the slow-wave characteristics of
modulated-doped A1GaAs/GaAs heterostructures. The objective of this project is
to experimentally determine the feasibility of utilizing A1GaAs/GaAs Schottky
barriers as phase shifters, attenuator, and switches in the microwave/millimeter
wave regime. Combined with the promising modulation-doped field-effect
transistor technology, integration of compatible active and passive elements is
of great significance in the development of microwave/millimeter wave monolithic
integrated circuits. High quality A1GaAs/GaAs heterostructure will be grown by
OMCVD and characterized by electrical and optical methods. Slow-wave devices in
microstrip and coplanar waveguide configurations will be fabricated for
preliminary studies. DC and microwave measurements will be made with frequency
characteristics over as broad a range as possible. These results will provide a
basis for future design of slow-wave devices using heterostructure materials.
