&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center plans to create a new technology for materials
processing whereby design, analysis and synthesis of materials are integrated to
produce material, devices and systems of desired performance. The mission of the
center is to develop a fundamental understanding of laser aided intelligent
manufacturing to reduce lead-time for "concept to product" manufacturing for
U.S. industries by; establishing the science base for laser materials
processing; producing materials and devices with novel properties using
economical processing methods; transferring this technology to industry by
providing a test bed where optimal manufacturing processes and applications can
be developed without heavy initial investment by industry; educating university
students and industrial personnel in both the basic and cross-disciplinary
science and latest technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach of
the center will be to develop and deploy atomistic level scientific
understanding of laser materials processing for industrial applications. The
broader impact of the center is to improve the competitiveness of U.S.
industries and by reaching out to the underrepresented minorities; the manpower
base of the nation will be significantly enhanced.&lt;br/&gt;
