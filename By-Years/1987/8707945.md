It is the long term objective of these studies to learn about the genomic
structures required for the expression of particular proteins in particular
neuronal and glial cells and the factors which regulate that expression. The
hypothesis generally accepted by molecular biologists that trans-acting factors
act at specific sequences to stimulate transcriptional initiation. The factors
and the sequences at which they act are known for only a few genes at present.
Many proteins of the central nervous system (CNS) are thought to be expressed in
only a subset of neurons. Dr. Sutcliffe specific hypothesis will test the
particular sequences or sets of sequences determine which genes are actively
transcribed in particular cells in response to the set of trans-acting
transcriptional stimulatory factors present in those cells. The specific studies
described in this proposal will involve characterization at the nucleotide
sequence level of the 5' ends of the mRNAs and the regions upstream from the
transcriptional initiation sites on the genes for neuron- specific enolase and
non-neuronal enolase. These studies will define the promoter regions for these
two genes so that appropriate transfection assays for their function can be
designed. Those assays will allow deletion and mutagenesis experiments to be
performed which will indicate the particular nucleotides required for specifying
brain cell-specific gene expression, and will provide information necessary for
identifying the trans-acting factors which regulate transcription of these two
genes. Both promoter and enhancer elements will be investigated. These studies
should provide insights into the specific mechanisms which regulate
transcription of these particular genes and also illuminate the features of
general classes of gene regulatory sequences which determine developmental
stage- and lineage-specific gene expression in the brain.
