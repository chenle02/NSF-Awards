Dr. Sara Wadia-Fascetti is an Associate Professor of Civil Engineering at
Northeastern University, and has served as a mentor to undergraduate and
graduate female and male engineering students since 1994. She developed the
e-mentoring program to give students a mechanism for communication with their
mentors and mentees between meetings. The program links female pre-college
students, college students, and professionals in discussion groups with two to
five additional women. Professional women are recruited from the college of
Engineering alumni as well as local companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Wadia-
Fascetti has also created a program, Connections, that offers weekly after-
school activities for Boston girls, including a computer clubhouse for middle-
and high-school girls to work alongside college women, an "introduction to
college" series for female high-school students so they learn how the higher
education system works, and a number of other programs for college
women.&lt;br/&gt;
