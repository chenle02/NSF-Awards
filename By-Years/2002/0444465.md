The goal of this project is to explore compilation technologies for high-
levelscripting languages that make it possible to run the generated code on
leading-edge parallel com-puters without sacri .cing application
performance,programming clarity,or programming system responsiveness.The
intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in research on the trade-o
.sbetween di .erent compilation times .language generation time versus
application compilation orinterpretation time .to achieve higher optimization
levels without making compile times unaccept-ably long.
