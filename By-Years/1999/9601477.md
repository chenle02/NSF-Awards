This proposal from a consortium of faculty from six different departments at
the University of Minnesota and researchers from surrounding institutions (e.g.,
the Mayo Clinic) and the commercial sector seeks support from the NSF Academic
Research Infrastructure Program to assist in the establishment of a cutting edge
NMR resource. The University of Minnesota is committed to a developing Program
in Structural Biology that will be housed in the new Basic Health Sciences
Building scheduled for completion in August, 1996. The NMR facility (4,000 sq.
Ft.) will be located on level one along with other integral components: X-ray,
EPR and other spectroscopies, electron microscopy, mass spectroscopy,
microchemical facilities and computational resources which will include a
supercomputer center sub-site. The centerpiece of this application is the
acquisition of a 1 7.6T NMR spectrometer (1H resonance frequency of 750 MHz) as
well as upgrades of existing 11.7 and 14.2 T NMR spectrometer consoles. Over the
past few years, multidimensional and high field NMR methodology has
revolutionized the role that NMR plays in the chemical and biological sciences.
In recognition of these developments, the University of Minnesota has pledged a
substantial commitment to the establishment of a premier NMR facility to support
its own faculty and those from other academic/research institutions and the
commercial sector in the State of Minnesota. As part of this undertaking, it is
proposed that the NSF play a pivotal role in the establishment of a broadly
based NMR facility. An initial group of 14 scientists who would use the facility
has been identified. Research pursued in these laboratories impacts upon a wide
spectrum of problems ranging from health to material science whose solutions are
rooted in the NMR structural elucidation of proteins, nucleic acids, membrane
assemblies and inorganic polymers.
