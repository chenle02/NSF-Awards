The Systems Analysis Department at Miami University has a long history of
educating software engineers who are in high demand by computing industries. The
hardware and software currently being used in this educational process is state-
of-the-practice technology, rather than state-of-the-art. This project involves
6 workstations and associated software to be connected via an Ethernet. The
emphasis in this equipment is on (1) a visual approach to analysis, design, and
programming; (2) automation of tasks; (3) the use of integrated tools; and (4)
resource sharing. The computing industry has been faced with a "software crisis"
in the past two decades in which the size and complexity of software has
exceeded our ability to control. Quality has lagged, schedules have been
delayed, and cost estimates have been overrun. The use of automated, more
visual, integrated tools and better resource sharing holds much promise as a
solution to this crisis. By introducing students to this technology, they can
eventually help to improve the quality of software produced in industry.
