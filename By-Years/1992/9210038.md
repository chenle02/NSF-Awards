This is a project to build and operate a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-
Wave Observatory (LIGO) and to continue research and development of
interferometric detectors of ever higher sensitivities. The proposed LIGO
includes interferometer installations of 4-km arm length and support facilities;
these installations would be located at two widely separated sites in the
continental United States and would operate in coincidence for the detection of
gravitational waves. The LIGO project is a joint effort of scientists at the
California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and includes collaborative programs with scientists at Stanford, University of
Colorado, and other institutions. The observatory will be operated as a user
facility, open for use by the national community, and will become part of a
planned worldwide network of gravitational- wave observatories. The proposed
LIGO is based on almost two decades of science research and development. The
ultimate objectives of the LIGO program include (1) tests of Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity---in particular, measurement of the velocity and
polarization of gravitational radiation and studies of the domain of highly
nonlinear, dynamic gravity, and (2) the opening of an observational window on
the universe that differs fundamentally from that provided by electromagnetic or
particle astronomy.
