The P.I. will try to determine analytically the receptive field sizes and the
nature of the map from the stimulus to the cortical layer in a class of Hebbian
neural network models. In particular, he proposes a generalization of Cooper's
network model and shows that it always gives rise to continuous maps if certain
constraints are satisfied. Other models to be studied include Amari's network in
two dimensions, and an extension of Linsker's model. Highly discontinuous maps
occur if the cortical lateral interactions are sufficiently plastic as in
Edelman's model, giving rise to neuronal groups. The analysis will provide
further insight into the plasticity of neural systems. The P.I. will also try to
extend the Hebbian models the treatment of control and change of coordinate
problems which have been successfully tackled with feed.forward networks with
non.local synaptic rules. This will first be done using simulations of a
sensory.motor system with two Hebbian networks working together. He will also
show how the encoding of the input and output affects the performance. This will
lead to more robust control systems implementable with less human effort.
