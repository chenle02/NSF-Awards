Professor Richard S. Varga of Kent State University will be principal lecturer
at an NSF-CBMS Regional Conference to be held at Butler University,
Indianapolis, in June of 1989. The lectures will describe the interesting recent
interplay between very high-precision calculations on supercomputers and
mathematically vigorous approaches to long-outstanding mathematical conjectures
from such diverse fields as function theory, approximation theory, and classical
analysis.
