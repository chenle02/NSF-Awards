Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This PI will use advanced molecular simulation tools to
investigate and quantify the effects of key variables such as hydration level,
carbohydrate excipients, and temperature on the structure, stability and
dynamics of proteins undergoing dehydration and rehydration. The impact from the
successful outcome of this project will help develop quality therapeutic
proteins and advance the development such therapeutics for the pharmaceutical
industry.
