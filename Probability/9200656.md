The investigator plans to continue research on stochastic matching and
empirical discrepancy problems in Euclidean and general metric spaces. Current
research is directed towards understanding the stochastic behavior of matching
functionals. This involves finding tight non-asymptotic bounds, limiting
distributions, and exponential type moment bounds. This would add to the
understanding of several combinatorial optimization problems as well as
empirical discrepancy problems, notably finding the rate of convergence of the
empirical to the true distribution. Results of this type are useful in
stochastic bin-packing as well as statistical physics. Concerning discrepancy
problems in mathematical statistics, research is also directed towards further
enlarging the collection of known Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) classes of sets. This
involves establishing general connections between VC classes of positivity sets,
quantifier elimination theorems, and semi-algebraic geometry. The proposed
research will focus heavily on the theoretical and mathematical aspects of the
well-known transportation problem as well as some of its generalizations. This
problem has received wide attention over the years and it is recognized that a
full understanding of its mathematical complexities will lead to more efficient
and perhaps simpler ways to solve optimization problems ranging from the
shipping of goods, to the routing of airplanes and the study of statistical
mechanics. In its simplest and most elementary form the problem may be stated as
follows. Suppose that one is given n oil wells and n refineries and wishes to
efficiently pair off wells and refineries, so as to minimize the sum of the
matching distances. It is easy to see that there are n| different possible
matchings. The transportation problem is to determine the most efficient
matching, i.e., to determine that matching which will minimize the sum of the
distances. The proposed research will consider variations on this and related
problems.
