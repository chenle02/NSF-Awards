This project focuses on the design of an
infrastructureless&lt;br/&gt;communication system that makes it easy for people
without expertise&lt;br/&gt;in computer security to safely communicate with
friends and family&lt;br/&gt;members without being subjected to third-party
surveillance,&lt;br/&gt;censorship, propaganda, or reprisal. The primary goals
of this work&lt;br/&gt;are to (1) further open access to information people
require to&lt;br/&gt;educate themselves and (2) make sharing information
easier.&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention is paid to designing protocols that do
not rely&lt;br/&gt;on centralized control points, which are subject to attack.
The&lt;br/&gt;influence of patterns in human behavior on communication
system&lt;br/&gt;performance, energy efficiency, and security are being studied,
and&lt;br/&gt;the findings used to guide the development of better, user-
aware,&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols. Design and analysis of
communication&lt;br/&gt;protocols; defenses against side-channel attacks on
portable&lt;br/&gt;communication devices; distributed system architecture;
and&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficient software systems play central roles in the work.
