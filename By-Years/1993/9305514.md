This award supports the research of Professor Adolphson to work in number
theory. This project will explore the connections between exponential sums over
finite fields and toric varieties. Two major topics will be pursued. The first
topic is the study of the p-adic differential equations that arise from the
variation of cohomology of families of exponential sums. The second topic is the
study of the p-adic cohomology of complete intersections. This is research in
the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
