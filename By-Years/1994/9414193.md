The 1994 IEEE/IMS Information Theory Workshop on "Information Theory and
Statistics" will present papers in the related fields of (1) Stochastic
complexity and universal data compression, (2) randomization complexity and
information theory, (3) Markov random fields, (4) Vector quantization,
classification, and regression trees, (5) theory and applications of wavelets,
and (6) nonparametric function estimation. In addition to these specific topics,
there will be two open poster sessions supporting research in all fields related
to the theme of the workshop. The workshop will be held in the Old Town Holiday
Inn, Alexandria, Virginia over the dates of October 27 through October 29, 1994.
The IEEE Information Theory Workshops play an important role in exploring and
supporting critical research trends in the broad areas of communication system
utilization and digital data storage. This area of research is commonly referred
to as the field of Information Theory and over the last forty years has played a
central role in the development of the nation's communications infrastructure.
Recently, there has been a significant rise in common research conducted by
Information Theorists and Statisticians. It is the aim of the 1994 IEEE/IMS
Information Theory Workshop on "Information Theory and Statistics" to enhance
this work and improve the cross-fertilization of ideas between the respective
research communities. To support this collaboration, this workshop is being co-
sponsored by the IEEE Information Theory Society and the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics.
