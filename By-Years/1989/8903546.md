Enzyme structure-function studies require both dynamic and static approaches.
Among the various kinetic methods, isotopic exchange at chemical equilibrium can
provide a unique approach for addressing mechanistic questions. The theoretical
basis and practical basis for this method was dramatically advanced recently by
the PI's development of computer simulation methods for exchange data analysis.
Equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics was proven to be especially useful for
determining kinetic mechanism and defining which steps are altered by bound
effectors or by mutation of specific amino acid residues. The enzymes proposed
for study were selected for their potential to advance fundamental knowledge,
the crucial regulatory role each plays in a key metabolic pathway, their complex
responses to effectors, and identification of important, yet unanswered
mechanistic questions that can be addressed uniquely by EIEK methods: a)
Aspartate transcarbamylase regulates biosynthesis of pyrimidines needed for DNA.
Substrate analogs and mutant enzymes have been selected that will allow the
dissection of the mechanisms by which the effectors ATP and CTP operate and to
determine how interaction of substrate with active site groups triggers the
dramatic conformational change of allosteric transition. b) Phosphorylase
controls energy metabolism by mobilizing stored glucose (glycogen) into the
glycolytic pathway. The major challenges with this system will be determine
which step (s) are altered by selected modifiers in an enzyme for which chemical
catalysis, rather than substrate binding, appears to be the rate-limiting
process in net turnover. Development of more advanced computer programs, to
simulate complex enzyme behavior and for data fitting, is also essential to this
project. Routines for linear regression analysis will also be incorporated, to
optimize data fitting and to help define confidence limits for the derived rate
constants.
