0242579&lt;br/&gt;Phaneuf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award provides
support for Raymond Phaneuf of the University of Maryland to work with Roberto
Cingolani of the University of Lecce, Italy. The primary goal of their research
is to investigate the coupling of self-assembled quantum dots in the
InxGa1-xAs/GaAs system. They plan to accomplish self-assembly and to control
coupling of small numbers of dots, and to selectively probe individual coupled-
quantum dot molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two laboratories have
complementary capabilities. The US laboratory will compare results for thin
stressor layers grown on patterned substrates with those for lithographically
produced arrays of alloy mesas to pattern the surface before regrowth. Parallel
investigations using patterning and MOCVD growth will be carried out at Lecce.
The Italian laboratory has developed the technique of using scanning tunneling
luminescence to selectively probe individual coupled-quantum dot molecules.
Existing applications of self-assembled quantum dots include optoelectronic
devices such as quantum dot lasers. A potentially important application is the
use of coupled quantum dots and qubits for quantum information
processing.&lt;br/&gt;
