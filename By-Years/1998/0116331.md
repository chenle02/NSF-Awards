OIA-0116331&lt;br/&gt;PI: Solomon&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
and six colleagues in the Departments of Chemical engineering, Materials Science
and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the University of Michigan are requesting funds to purchase a confocal laser
scanning microscope. This will enhance their research and research training in
nanoscale engineering of complex fluids and biomaterials. Specifics proposed
applications of the instrument are: to quantify defect dynamics during annealing
of colloidal crystals, to detect self-assembled proteins, to observe
microfluidic flows on cellular development, and to facilitate the efficient
design of microfabricated devices.&lt;br/&gt;
