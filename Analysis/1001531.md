The goal of this project is to further the mathematical understanding of two
simple physical models: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the classical
Coulomb gas associated with random matrices. The central theme in our
investigations of the Coulomb gas is to develop the theory for arbitrary values
of the inverse temperature, as opposed to the three special values, namely, 1,
2, and 4. In particular, we wish to show that there is no phase transition. A
second goal is to better understand the empirically observed occurrence of
random matrix statistics in manifestly deterministic scenarios, by first
considering models with very little randomness. The second part of the project
concerns well-posedness questions for the nonlinear Schrodinger equations at
critical regularity. Our primary goal is to complete the picture in those cases
where the critical regularity corresponds to a coercive conservation law,
specifically, the energy- and mass-critical equations. We will further attempt
to make some initial inroads into the case of non-conserved critical regularity
in a particular case where this seems most feasible.

The theory of random matrices is driven by empirical data as surely as any
physical science: Its roots lie in statistical analysis (specifically, ANOVA)
and the analysis of experimental energy-level data. More recently, random matrix
statistics have been observed in the vibrations of drums and the behaviour of
the prime numbers. The researches of this project are aimed at helping to
elucidate and explain the results of these truly mathematical experiments.
Although the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is used as a simple effective model
for several physical phenomena, the goal of this project is to further our
understanding of the long-time behaviour of solutions to this equation
principally as a model for general dispersive evolution equations. By choosing
to work with (scaling-)critical initial data, we place ourselves precisely at
the border between the well-studied subcritical regime and the terra incognita
of supercritical equations. As an example of how developments of such simplified
equations has fed into more physical models, we note one past off-shoot of the
theory of dispersive equations at critical regularity: we now know that the
well-posedness of the equations of fluid flow (as opposed to the spontaneous
generation of extremely turbulent behaviour) is something that can be rigorously
verified by computer for any prescribed size of initial data.
