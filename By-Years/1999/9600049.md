This research program will continue to extend post-Newtonian calculations of
gravitational radiation to the highest practicable order, with the goal of
developing more accurate and reliable theoretical templates for gravitational
radiation observatories, as well as of achieving deeper understanding of
Einstein's equations as applied to highly dynamical, strong-gravity situations.
This effort will involve (i) formal theoretical work on the foundations of such
approximation methods, (ii) specific calculation of higher-order effects in both
the gravitational radiation and the equations of motion, and (iii) development
of an interface between the post-Newtonian methods and those of numerical
relativity, which must be used to analyze the late inspiral and merger of the
two bodies. Inspiralling binary systems of neutron stars or black holes are
promising sources of gravitational radiation detectable by kilometer-scale,
laser-interferometric gravitational observatories, such as the US LIGO and
Italian-French VIRGO projects, scheduled to be completed by the end of this
decade. Detection and study of this radiation will open a new field of
gravitational-wave astronomy, and provide important new tests of general
relativity. In order to make maximum use of the output of these detectors, it is
crucial to have on hand extremely accurate gravitational-waveform "templates":
detailed theoretical predictions from general relativity of the shape and
frequency evolution of the waves for ranges of source parameters. These
templates will be used as "filters" to extract from the noisy output of the
detectors useful information such as whether or not gravitational waves are
detected, and the intrinsic characteristics of the source, such as its direction
and distance, and the masses and spins of its components. For all but the final,
strongly general relativistic coalescence of the two bodies, theoretical methods
based on successive "post-Newtonian" approximations to general re lativity have
proved to be extremely valuable in developing these templates.
