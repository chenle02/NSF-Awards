The proposed studies will result in a better understanding of the SMES/utility
network interconnection problems. The Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage
(SMES) system is a constant current source connected to the power network which
operates at constant voltage. The interconnection of these two systems is
complicated because the variable voltage and constant current of SMES has to be
matched to the constant voltage and variable current of the network. This is
particularly difficult under dynamic conditions. The objectives of this research
project are to analyze a new interconnection concept and present a feasible
engineering design that can be utilized in the design of the first large system.
