This project combines analog circuit design and CAD to produce digital circuits
that can operate at substantially reduced voltages, which will result in lower
power consumption. The project has introduced the QuadRail logic family, which
allows voltage control of transistor thresholds to maintain constant logic
thresholds. Use of this family permits lower supply voltages because of the
tighter control of device thresholds. However, use of this family requires
optimization of individual digital cells, new device layout methods, and new
strategies for floorplanning, placement, and routing. The research in this
project is exploring all of these optimization areas, and is producing a battery
powered demonstration system for speech signal processing.
