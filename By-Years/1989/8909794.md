This is a "Research Opportunities for Women (ROW) Planning Grant" for Dr.
Zinaida Kogan. Her objective is to better understand why "supercell"
thunderstorms are long-lived (several hours instead of tens of minutes) by
studying the effect of helicity on thermal convection in an unstable atmosphere
with rotating wind shear.//
