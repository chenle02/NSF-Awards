9307969 Hylander Both Experimental research and theoretical biomechanics have
contributed to current understanding of mandibular function. What remains
unkown, however, is how well theoretical models correspond to actual mechanical
behavior of the mandible. Through experimental observations, this project will
provide an empirical foundation from which to evaluate the accuracy of
theoretical biomechanical models of the mandible, and to establish data base
from which more realistic theoretical models can be developed. The results will
be important not only to understanding the forces impinging on the human
mandible, but to differing forces among primate species. *** cknowledgment of
