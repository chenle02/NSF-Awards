The community college offers the first two years of science and engineering
curriculum heavily relying on traditional methods of analysis and theory. Most
modern laboratories rely on sophisticated instrumental analysis. Therefore with
the acquistion of an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer the students are being
better equipped to enter their junior year in a senior institution with skills
that are demanded for proficiency in their career. This project is providing
lower level students access to the actual "hands on" instrumental analysis and
solution preparation. In addition they are gaining experience in the assessment
of the quality of laboratory generated data which will assist with developing
problem solving skills required in any life situation. The grantee is matching
the award from non-Federal sources.
