The flowering plant family Sabiaceae comprises three genera and about 150
species of trees and shrubs that are distributed throughout the Neotropics and
Southeast Asia. This group has not been subject to modern evolutionary research,
and thus questions remain about the relationships among its members, as well as
about the placement of the family among flowering plants. The main goal of this
study is to generate a phylogenetic framework across taxonomic levels that will
answer these questions and also allow the study of other aspects of the biology
of the group, such as biogeography and the evolution of reproductive characters.
To achieve this, modern methods, such as the comparison of gene sequences and
phylogenetic dating using fossil information, will be
used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will generate data that will improve our
understanding of a recalcitrant part of the angiosperm tree of life.
Furthermore, this study will test biogeographic hypotheses that have been
proposed for other groups of plants with similar disjunct distributions, and
fossil-based dating will provide geological timeframes in which the divergence
and evolution of the family took place.
