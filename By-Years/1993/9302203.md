9302203 Liu Research is to be carried out on breaking surface waves. The
approach is largely experimental, with some modeling of the breaking process
also included. Both periodic waves and wave groups with a modulated amplitude
will be investigated in a wave tank at constant depth. Breaking wave groups on a
sloping bottom simulating beaches will also be investigated. Experimental tools
will be both two dimensional LDV, as well as Particle Imaging Velocimetry. Wave
breaking and associated sediment transport are of great importance in coastal
stability and storm erosion, and mitigation strategies are hampered by
incomplete knowledge of the breaking the process. ***
