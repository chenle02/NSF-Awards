This award supports a two-day symposium on the topic `Chemical and Biological
Controls on Mineral Growth and Dissolution Kinetics` and is made jointly by the
Division of Chemistry and the Division of Earth Sciences. The symposium will be
held in April 1995 in Anaheim, California, in conjunction with an annual meeting
of the American Chemical Society. Participants from geology, chemistry, biology,
and physics will discuss the factors which control the rates at which minerals
dissolve and reform in the environment. The presence of microorganisms in
geologic environments has only recently been understood as an important factor.
One example of mineral dissolution is weathering of rocks, and the process
generally plays a major role in atmospheric carbon dioxide release, transport of
chemicals in waters, acidity of lakes, and soil formation and fertility. The
conference is intended to encourage collaboration among scientists in many
disciplines and to focus attention on an issue that is important both in
obtaining accurate climate models and in remediation of contaminated surface-
and groundwaters, soils, and sediments. The symposium organizer is Dr. Lisa L.
Stillings, Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wyoming.
Proceedings of the symposium will be published.
