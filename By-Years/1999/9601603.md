Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of computation and visualization tools for
disciplinary and interdisciplinary research training of undergraduates in
astronomy, chemistry, geology and physics. This Academic Research Infrastructure
award supports the acquisition of computation and visualization workstations.
The workstations are to be used for faculty and undergraduate research in
computational science. The research projects supported by the equipment include
projects on astronomy and chemistry using spectral studies of galactic clouds;
geology and physics using predictive techniques to determine mantle viscosity
from rebound effects of the glacial age - this research also will involve GIS
access and use; interdisciplinary research involving novel uses of computational
visualization.
