Abstract: 9318178, PI-Cox: This National Challenge award will support a
multidisciplinary group of computer scientists and biologists to develop
distributed imaging technologies of a gigabit network. The objectives of this
project include implementation, experimentation with and demonstration of high
performance computing and communication technology focused on research in 3-D
microscope; designing and experimental evaluation of a number of key networking
and protocol control mechanisms to allow multirate network access to support
distributed computing involving multimedia, visualization and multiparticipant
collaborations; deployment of an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) gigabit
network providing connectivity among participating facilities at Washington
University and at lower rates between Washington University and NIH. Thus, the
project effort includes important research on 3-D microscopy necessary for the
Human Brain Project initiative, requiring the development of gigabit network
technology and associated high speed communication protocols. This award is
being jointly supported by the following NSF program s: New Technologies,
Networking and Communications Research, and Computational Biology.
