This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "Wavelets". This conference will be held at the University of Lowell
June 11-15, 1990. The recent development of wavelets as a major tool in several
areas of applied mathematics, as well as its connections in pure mathematics in
group representations, harmonic analysis, singular integrals, function spaces,
and partial differential equations, make this a timely topic for a CBMS
conference. Knowing both the analysis and application side of the subject makes
Dr. Ingrid Daubechies a natural choice as principal speaker.
