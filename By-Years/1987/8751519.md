The purpose of the project is to design, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a
mathematics curriculum sequence for middle school students expressly designed to
introduce them to the notions and arts of mathematical thinking and to develop
foundational skills of mathematical inquiry. This will be accomplished partly
through a laboratory presentation centered on mathematical design activities
that span a rich variety of compelling projects, and partly through the use of
intelligent tools designed to support and guide constructive exploration and
design tasks. The sequence will comprise modules in the areas of algebra,
elementary functional analysis, and mathematical modeling. The mathematical
content will be developed to support the needs and goals of the inquiry
activities. Three major types of tools will be developed, corresponding to
qualitatively different ways of embedding intelligent support for open-ended
inquiry activities. This work builds on a pilot project which led to the
development of prototypes of these tools and their successful classroom trial in
an introductory algebra course. The goal of the present project is to extend and
deepen the approach and to establish it as a national model for future
mathematical curricula.
