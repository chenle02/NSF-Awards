9706219 Wallace This research is to study the rupture characteristics of deep
earthquakes. The cause of deep earthquakes remains one of the most important
scientific questions in earth sciences. Most of the work to date has
concentrated on the rise time of the seismogram and the implied rupture
initiation phase. Work on the later growth of the fault surface area and
termination of the rupture process has waited on the development and
installation of very wide-band seismometers of the Global Seismic Network. In
the two largest recent deep earthquakes, the 1994 M=8.3 Bolivian and 1996 M=7.9
Flores Sea events, the rupture velocity appears to be very slow, less than 2.6
km/s as compared to shallow earthquakes. It is possible that this slow rupture
is a product of an exotic slip-weakening mechanism, for example, pressure-
release melting. However, not all deep earthquakes appear to have
extraordinarily slow rupture, complicating any single explanation. This research
involves the investigation of the rupture of more than 20 events ranging in
depth from 80 to 640 km. ***
