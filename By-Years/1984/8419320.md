A study group of leading investigators will participate in a planning and
assessment project to examine opportunities for engineering research in visual
perception. Emphasis will be placed on requirements for new knowledge needed to
support progress in artificial intelligence, robot vision, and machine vision
systems generally. Topics to be covered include theory of vision, image
interpretation, display systems, image integration, and human-machine
optimization.
