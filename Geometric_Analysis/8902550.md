The principal investigator will solve a number of problems in the area of
isometric inequalities. These involve generalized convex hypersurfaces,
inequalities for affine surface area, intersection and projection problems, and
the dual Brunn- Minkowski theory. Generalized convex bodies are related to
convex bodies in the way generalized functions (distributions) are related to
ordinary functions. Their utilization will enable the principal investigator to
establish a number of conjectured affine isometric inequalities. The classical
Brunn-Minkowski theory is ideal for handling questions involving projections of
convex shapes. The slow progress on a number of important questions is due to
the fact that this theory is unsuited for dealing with intersection problems.
The principal investigator will use a dual Brunn- Minkowski theory to overcome
these difficulties. This work has applications outside mathematics to such
fields as stereology.
