9316279 Cobabe Bivalve shells are common fossils in near-shore marine strata
from the early Paleozoic to the Recent. The diversity and abundance of bivalves
makes them an important research target for molecular paleontology. Based on our
preliminary research, the geologically stable and easily extracted class of
compounds known as lipids offers a promising new approach to interpreting the
biogeochemical record of bivalves. Recent and fossil shells contain a wide
variety of mineral-associated lipids, including fatty acids, cholesterol,
ketones, phytadienes, and alkanes. The shell-lipid assemblages contain compounds
that are 1) present in all of the studied bivalves (recent and fossil), 2)
specific to a single taxon, and 3) environmentally specific. In the cases of
extraordinary fossil preservation, lipids trapped in the shell may provide a
clean molecular and isotopic record of trophic strategy, biosynthetic pathway,
and paleoenvironmental conditions. We propose utilizing the molecular structure
and 13C content of shell lipids to determine the biogenic source of the
compounds. We will then apply these compounds to studies of 1) chemosymbiosis in
the fossil record and 2) the use of fatty acid saturation to assess
paleotemperature.
