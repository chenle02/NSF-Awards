The Whittier Narrows earthquake offers an opportunity to assess the impact that
research conducted as a result of the 1971 San Fernando earthquake has had on
the earthquake design and performance of lifelines. The San Fernando earthquake
was a major turning point in the seismic design of these systems, and Los
Angeles has had the opportunity to benefit from research conducted in this area.
Therefore, collecting response and recovery data from the Whittier Narrows
earthquake would not only allow the preservation of important but perishable
data, but also an assessment of research application and effectiveness. The
objectives of this proposed study are to (1) collect, review, and document
lifeline system performance (i.e., response and recovery) data from the October
1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake; (2) develop preliminary response and
recovery models for different lifeline systems using data from the Whittier
Narrows earthquake and the 1971 San Fernando earthquake; and (3) assess the
impact that research in the lifelines area conducted after the 1971 San Fernando
earthquake has had on the improvement of seismic design and emergency response
and preparedness procedures for lifelines. Specific tasks that will be performed
include (1) data collection and review; (2) interviews with lifeline personnel;
(3) development of preliminary response and recovery models; (4) comparison of
lifeline response and recovery performance during 1971 San Fernando earthquake
and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake; and (5) assessment of impact of research
conducted after 1971 San Fernando earthquake on seismic design and performance
of lifelines.
