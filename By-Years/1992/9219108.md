We will reconstruct late eocene to Miocene continental climate from the oxygen
isotopic composition of fossel equid enamel phosphate. This interval is an
important period of global climatic deterioration inferred from
paleoceanographic data with scant quantitative geochemical information from
continents. The 18O mammalian apatite precipitates in equilibrium with body
water, whcih reflects ingested water. Body temperature of mammals is constant
and known so 18OPO4 records the 18O of local water sources which are dominated
by the global hydrologic cycle. The 18OPO4 of fossil enamel may record
continetal paleoclimate. Fossil equids are ideal because they are geographically
widespread, common from the Eocene to late Pleistocne, and have modern
analogues. We will determine the isotopic fractionation between teeth, body
water, and ingested water in modern equids to quantitatively reconstruct 18O of
ingested water for fossil equids. We will determine if a continental climatic
signal is preserved in fossil tooth enamal; if continental climate reflects the
marine record in magnitude, direction, and timing; and if equid evolutionary
change occurred concurrently with continetal climatic change. We will analyze
fossils from Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nebraska, where fossil samples are
available, regional stratigraphy and chronology are well known, and location
near the center of the continent is advantageous for climate studies. Our
preliminary data indicate a primary signal is retained by most enamel samples
and diagenesis can be detected. We will further develop criteria for evaluating
diagenesis with infrared, XRD, and elemental analyses. If diagenesis is
negligible, we will develop a quantitative record of late Eocene to Miocene
paleoclimate from 18O of ancient precipitation.
