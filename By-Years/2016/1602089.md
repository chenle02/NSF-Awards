This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating agricultural
soil sensor development research into accurate monitoring of spatio-temporal
variation of soil properties of agricultural interest. The development of the
proposed soil sensors is important because they can enable the real-time, in-
place monitoring of soil moisture, salinity, and nutrients in production
agriculture, thus enabling precise nutrient management. This project will result
in a feasible design/prototype of an in-situ soil sensor for agricultural
application. This soil sensor has the unique features that it can measure the
soil properties mentioned above in real-time when deployed in an underground
grid configuration with support for wireless interaction. Current sensing
systems do not support continual in-situ monitoring and also require manual
operation, while the proposed system is a fully-automated solution, capable of
continual in-situ monitoring and wireless transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project addresses technical gaps as it translates from research discovery toward
commercial application in soil sensors for agriculture. Specifically in this
project, sensor prototypes, using dielectric-based moisture/salinity sensing and
electrophoretic nitrate sensing packaged with signal processing and wireless
capability for underground deployment, will be tested and
evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project,
namely the two PhD students, will receive innovation and technology translation
experiences through soil sensor development and evaluation research, regular
participation in interactions with the Iowa State Office of Intellectual
Property and Technology Transfer for disclosures and patents, and further
interactions with agricultural domain industries for licensing, technology
transfer and commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages
Microwaves by the Weber, Inc. as a consultant with experience in product design,
development and commercialization to augment the team's research capability, and
guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from
research discovery toward commercial reality.
