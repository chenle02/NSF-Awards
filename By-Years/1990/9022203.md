Symbolic dynamics and related areas are currently undergoing dramatic
developments. The recent introduction of deep and powerful machinery has solved
some of the hardest and most tantalizing open problems. In addition, symbolic
dynamics is having a substantial impact in other areas, such as in
characterizing the non-zero spectrum of non-negative real matrices, or in
constructing codes for data storage and transmission. This grant will partially
support a conference on symbolic dynamics and its applications to be held at
Yale University in July, 1991. The topics to be emphasized include symbolic
dynamical systems, applications to geometric dynamics, information theory, and
linear algebra as well as connections with ergodic theory. A significant portion
of young researchers will be among the invited speakers, and the conference
should advance this active and important area of current research in a
meaningful way.
