Professor Franco Basile at the University of Wyoming is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division to study a
challenging area of an important analytical detection method - mass
spectrometry. Specifically, Professor Basile's research centers on the use of
non-enzymatic processes (e.g., microwave digestion, pyrolysis, and
electrochemistry) as alternatives to typical enzymatic digestion for pre-
treatment of biological samples for mass spectrometric analysis. The research
combines historical techniques with modern practices. Outcomes of Dr. Basile's
work are likely to make a significant contribution to many areas of mass
spectrometry. For example, field portable mass spectrometers would greatly
benefit from shortened sample preparation protocols and the dramatically reduced
need for reagents - focus areas for this research
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Basile integrates aspects of this work with
the Summer Research in Analytical Chemistry (SRAC) Program, which includes
participation of high school students and their teachers from around the State
of Wyoming. The program fosters independent research skills and excitement about
science for students, and equips teachers with better understanding of some of
the tools used in modern analytical chemistry techniques.
