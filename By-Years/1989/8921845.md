The focus of this research is on robust adaptive control with improved
performance. The direct, indirect and variable structure methods will be used
for this purpose. In the first stage, methods for combining all three approaches
in a stable fashion will be investigated for the ideal case. In the second
stage, the effect of perturbations on different combinations of the methods will
be considered. In the final stage, the effect of additional prior information
concerning the plant and the perturbations will be used to improve performance.
In all cases the effect of persistent excitation on robustness and performance
will be investigated. The most difficult theoretical question among the many
that are suggested in the proposal deals with the adaptive control of a plant
with unmodeled dynamics. This problem will be studied in detail using different
levels of prior information concerning the unmodeled part.
