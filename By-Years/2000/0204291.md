This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this
fellowship is entitled "The directionality of acoustic communication in
passerine birds." The goal of the research is to develop a system for mapping
the radiation of sound from vocalizing animals. The system is to be used to
measure the directionality of different call types from passerine birds in open
and forest habitats, and to test hypotheses about the functional significance of
directionality in acoustic communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
