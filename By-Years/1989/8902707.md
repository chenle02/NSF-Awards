Conventional database management systems (DBMS's), in representing the state of
an enterprise at a single point in time, do not provide support for storing or
accessing time-varying data. In this project, the issues involved in the
implementation of temporal DBMS's that provide such support are investigated.
The adopted approach is the architectural refinement of a three-level store: one
containing current data, one containing data concerning the past (and future),
and one containing data that has been corrected. The impact of these refinements
on all components of a temporal DBMS are to be studied, paying especially close
attention to storage structures, concurrency control, and interaction between
the main memory cache manager and the asynchronous archive manager. Simulation
is used where possible, with a model built on an extensible DBMS when
implementation experience and empirical data are desired. The goal is to develop
techniques that will add to conventional DBMS's the ability to efficiently
perform operations involving time while not impacting the performance of
conventional queries. This research will provide theoretical basis and
understanding of temporal database system, as well as practical applications in
areas beyond database community, e.g. software engineering as concepts developed
may form the basis for programming environment, helping to manage versions or
concurrency control.
