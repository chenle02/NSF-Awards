The award supports research on a collection of projects, all of which address
the problem of individuals or groups learning to be more productive in an
environment containing other individuals and groups. The gamut of multi-agent
learning scenarios covered ranges from completely cooperative groups, where the
sole goal of each individual is to server group interests, to purely competitive
situations in which individuals learn to exploit the weaknesses of competitors.
On another dimension, the award treats both individualistic learning schemes,
where each agent learns by itself, and shared learning approaches, where two or
more agents actively participate in learning about each other. To enable shared
learning in cooperative groups, a group infrastructure is necessary. Work under
this award will study a group architecture and a flexible commitment framework
that allows agent to make sensible decision about predictability-versus-
responsiveness tradeoffs as necessitated by environmental dynamics.
