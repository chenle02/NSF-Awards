Enrico has compiled a large dictionary of Masset Haida and is engaged in
elicitation of Skidegate Haida lexical material and texts from the few aged
speakers remaining alive today for the purpose of producing a comprehensive
Skidegate/Masset/English dictionary with an English/Skidegate/Masset index.
Entries will include syntactic, morphological, and semantic information. Haida
has three dialectal variants; the two northern variants, Alaskan and Masset, are
much alike and divergent from the southern dialect, Skidegate. Skidegate Haida,
though until now less well documented, appears to be more conservative, hence of
importance in reconstructing earlier forms of the language and defining the
relationships among the dialects. Beyond internal questions, a better
understanding of Haida as a whole is crucial to the reconstruction of North
American linguistic prehistory. More data are required for effective comparative
study to determine whether Haida is truly a language isolate or whether it is
related to other languages in the Alaska/Pacific Northwest area. Enrico knows
Haida well and enjoys the confidence of the communities where it still survives.
