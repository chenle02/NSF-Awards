The goal of this research is to develop novel techniques for the analysis of
filtered discrete self-similar signals and investigate their application in
speech modeling and recognition, image texture segmentation and object
recognition based on contour information. Specifically, filtered discrete self-
similar signals are used as tools for modeling both the long term and short term
characteristics of signals of interest and novel multiscale algorithms for
estimating their parameters are constructed. A multiscale solution to the
problem of finding an iterated function system whose attractor best approximates
a given M-D curve in the Hausdorff measure is also being developed. Particular
attention will be given to parallel implementation of the algorithms. Filtered
discrete self-similar signals are also studied as models for speech signals with
particular emphasis on the naturalness of the produced speech. Furthermore,
their parameters and the parameters of iterated function systems approximations
to speech demisyllables are tested for use as feature vectors in speech
recognition systems. M-D experiments are also being performed to investigate the
usefulness of M-D filtered discrete self-similar signals and iterated function
systems in texture segmentation and object recognition tasks.
