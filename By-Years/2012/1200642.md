In this project, fundamental science and technology will be developed for
Mapping in Information Driven Autonomous Exploration Systems (MIDAS). Such
systems operate in dynamic, spatially distributed, uncertain and hazardous
environments where human presence may be undesirable. Examples are emergency
response systems to building/forest fires, mine safety, environmental monitoring
and structural health monitoring among many others. These systems consist of
multiple sensors either in-situ or mounted on mobile robotic platforms whose
objective is to explore and map the spatially distributed environments they
operate within in real-time such that the information content regarding the
environment is maximized. In this project, computationally efficient techniques,
with guaranteed performance, will be developed to solve the mapping problem for
dynamical spatial fields. Deliverables will include a suite of algorithms for
the mapping problem including software, research publications pertaining to the
same, engineering student education, and engineering research education for high
school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the ramifications of this
work are many folds and highly significant: it is anticipated that the results
will have applications ranging from autonomous robotic exploration to homeland
security while leading to the discovery of fundamental science and technology at
the confluence of estimation theory and computational intelligence. In
particular, application to the wildfire prediction problem can avoid the
billions of dollars worth of property loss as evidenced in recent wildfires. An
"app" for tablets and smartphones will be developed to solve the online mapping
problem on a handheld smart phone, which may provide an invaluable tool for
first responders in such scenarios. The assimilation of
K-12/undergraduate/graduate students, and high school teachers, in projects
related to the research will disseminate the results of the project to a broad
audience, and help engender interest in science and engineering.
