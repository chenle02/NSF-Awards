Online learning environments are rapidly expanding the nature of the data that
can be collected about student opportunity to learn and the details of the
learning process. As high schools, community colleges and universities enroll
more students in blended or online courses, the volume of data about what
students are doing surpasses typical educational research methodologies.
Borrowing from multiple traditions, analysis of educational discourse data
addresses multiple persistent problems in education, including the development
of ways to better predict student success during a course and to design
interventions to provide support. The researchers in this proposal will build a
community to address three important areas: ethics in data sharing; technical
issues in data sharing; and, plans for an infrastructure to support and develop
capabilities in both of these. The community built in this effort will
collaboratively create the necessary metadata and standards for data sets and
tools, templates for appropriate approval to use online discourse data, and de-
identification algorithms that can be shared across data platforms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted through two interrelated
workshops parsed by planning meetings with an expert advisory board. An initial
workshop will focus on educational discourse and the undergraduate experience to
identify the issues around the infrastructure necessary to support collaborative
education discourse research. The second workshop will focus on the specific
infrastructure needs for working with discourse data from massive open online
courses (MOOCs). A white paper will be constructed and disseminated that
addresses ethical and technical issues and solutions, as well as infrastructure
needs to facilitate collaborative educational discourse research.
