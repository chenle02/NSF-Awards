Objective: To acquire a nano-imprint lithography system to support device and
materials research in the Houston area.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Nano-
imprint is a power tool enabling 50-100 nm technologies and eliminating the need
for e-beam lithography. Incorporation of nano-imprint in an educational facility
will enable students to gain insight into the imprint process. &lt;br/&gt;Broad
Impact: The proposed research has a broad impact in micro and nano-fabrication
technologies. A "nano-engineering minor" exists in the university and they aim
to enhance this program, and the acquisition of this new instrument will help
their program. The existing team is quite large consisting of over sixty (60)
graduate and undergraduate students, whose research projects will benefit from
nano-imprint lithography capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
