The Literacy for Engineering Access and Participation Conference (LEAP) would
convene researchers and teachers from the engineering education, literacy
education, equity and other stakeholder areas to establish a research agenda and
gather resources related to the literacy considerations for informal and formal
learning settings. The conference participants will learn about engineering and
literacy perspectives that impact students' learning with a particular emphasis
on multi-lingual students and engaging a more diverse student population in
engineering. The conference activity will focus on four themes: (1) engineering
and literacy education for broadening participation; (2) engineering literacies
in K-16 settings; (3) engineering literacies in informal settings; and (4)
preparing students for the workplace. The conference will share findings with a
range of audiences in engineering education, science education, literacy
education and includes the sharing of resources for schools, teachers, and
informal learning settings. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative
Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better
understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and
capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or
mathematics (STEM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes for the conference
include new direction for research, expansive instructional strategies for
broadening participation in formal and informal settings, knowledge about the
systemic and social factors of teaching and learning that affect possibilities
for broadening participation in the engineering workforce and interdisciplinary
partnerships. The project has identified participants from engineering,
engineering education, literacy education, multicultural education, bilingual
education and other disciplines in order to inform the creation of the research
agenda and examination of theory in this area.
