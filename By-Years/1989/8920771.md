Biological vision systems employ cooperating gaze controls to acquire, fixate,
and stabilize images. This grant will help develop similar gaze-control
capabilities for an experimental robot head at the University of Rochester. A
pilot study has simulated these mechanisms for fast gaze shifts, target
tracking, eye compensation for head motion, and verging of stereo cameras on a
target. The new work will implement, validate, and extend the control algorithms
for use in active robotic systems.
