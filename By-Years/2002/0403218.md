PROPOSAL NO: 0403218&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Case Western
Reserve&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Tabib-Azar , Massood&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:
NER: Solid Electrolytic Flash Memory
Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main
objective of this exploratory study is to develop a new class of non-volatile
?memory devices based on solid-electrolytes such as CuxS and AgS&lt;br/&gt;These
devices are based on nanometer scale metallic wires grown by passing electric
currents through electrodes on thin solid-electrolyte films. Very much like
mechanical switches the "1" and "0" states of the memory is given by the
presence (i.e., high conductance) state or lack (i.e., low conductance) state of
a metallic wire between the electrodes. The proposed devices have a simple
"cross-bar" geometry that makes them ideal for very large scale integration with
high yield. Non-volatile memories are an integral part of "embedded systems"
with growing importance in emerging systems where operating systems are stored
in non-volatile memories for easy updating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many
other applications of the proposed studies in self-organized and forced assembly
of nano-objects self-healing and programmable interconnects and break junctions
and in weakly-coupled quantum particles for sensing and information processing.
The proposed devices can be used to study and demonstrate real-time growth of
wires with fractal geometry in optically transparent solid electrolyte films
with interesting and important quantized electrical properties.&lt;br/&gt;
