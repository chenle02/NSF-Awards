The objective of this research project is to extend interior-point methods so
that they can be applied to smooth nonlinear optimization problems. In
particular, an existing linear/quadratic solver will be enhanced so as to become
an easy-to-use and efficient system for the solution of these problems. If a
problem is convex, the system will find a globally optimal solution. If it is
nonconvex, then the system will find a locally optimal solution in a
neighborhood of a given initial solution. The algorithmic issues to be addressed
include: (a) which merit function to use, (b) when and by how much to perturb
indefinite Hessians, (c) how to adapt the predictor-corrector variant, (d) how
and when to sparsify Hessians, (e) how much to push initial values away from
bounds, (f) how to detect and handle problems in which the constraints don't
satisfy a constraint qualification condition, and (g) how to ensure that the
infeasible interior-point method doesn't evaluate any function outside its
domain. As part of this research, a database of real-world nonlinear
optimization models will be assembled. This database will be freely available
via the internet. Finally, techniques will be sought that will enable one to use
the interior-point-based nonlinear-programming system to solve semidefinite
programming problems.

Nonlinear optimization plays a fundamental role in all branches of applied
science and engineering. Whether it is maximizing the speed at which flutter
destroys a wing, minimizing the use of nonrenewable resources in hydrothermal
power generation, designing a structure that can bear a specified load with
minimal amount of material, or minimizing side-lobe signal strength in the
output of an antenna array while preserving main-lobe characteristics, there is
one commonly shared theme: optimization. Interior-point methods provide a new
approach to the solution of these problems, which promises to enable one to
solve them more reliably and much more efficiently than before. This research
project will focus on resolving the issues involved in producing an efficient
and robust interior-point algorithm for nonlinear optimization.
