0842268&lt;br/&gt;Kaufman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition
of equipment to upgrade the stable isotope facility at the University of
Maryland, Department of Geology. Specific equipment that will be acquired
includes: 1) a Carbon/Sulfur analyzer (CS analyzer) for combustion of bulk
samples for total S, total C, and total inorganic C (TIC) abundances of bulk
samples; and 2) a gas chromatograph/combustion/pyrolysis (GC/C/P) inlet system
for the separation of organic extracts from sediments and sequential combustion
for C and H isotope compositions. The equipment will support PI and colleague
studies of biogeochemical processes and climate variability on the early Earth
(Archean and Proterozoic eons) and allow expansion of this research through new
analytical capability for characterization of compound specific stable isotopic
ratios and the structure of organic molecular compounds preserved in ancient
sedimentary rocks. The expanded capabilities fo this laboratory will also
support visiting scientists, graduate, undergraduate and high school student
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
