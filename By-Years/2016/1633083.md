Open source software is an engine for innovation and a critical infrastructure
for the nation and yet it is implemented by communities formed from a loose
collection of individuals. With each software project relying on thousands of
other software projects, this complex and dynamic supply chain introduces new
risks and unpredictability, since, unlike in traditional software projects, no
contractual relationships with the community exist and individuals could simply
lose interest or move on to other activities.&lt;br/&gt;The big data-based
approach to software supply chains will stimulate academic and practical work.
The tools and practices to quantify and mitigate risks in the rapidly changing
global environment with no centralized control or authority will lead to
dramatic reductions in risk manifested in, for example, the spread of
vulnerabilities thus making the nation both safer and more innovative. The
theoretical frameworks and approaches developed will likely influence research
and practice in other supply chain contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective
of this research is to advance the state of knowledge of software supply chains
by collecting and integrating massive public operational data representing
development activity and source code from all open source projects and using it
to develop novel theories, methods, and tools. The construction and analysis of
the entire open source supply chain provides static and dynamic properties of
the network, risk propagation, and system-level risks. Novel statistical and
game-theoretic models are used to assess and mitigate these risks, while methods
to contextualize, augment, and correct operational data provide ways to cope
with data?s size, complexity, and observational nature.
