This award is made as part of the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
Program. This Program funds innovative new projects for undergraduate physics
laboratories. This action will supply equipment principally focussed on
computer- oriented data collection and processing and on the introduction of
several experiments elucidating key principles of physics.
