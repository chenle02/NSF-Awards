The University of Washington (UW) seeks an extension for the Alliance for Access
to Computing Careers (AccessComputing). AccessComputing aims to increase the
number of students with disabilities who successfully complete post secondary
degrees in computing and enter the computing workforce. It is lead by a
collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the
DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center at
UW and it includes Gallaudet University, the Rochester Institute of
Technology/National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and Landmark College as
partners. The AccessComputing alliance engages individuals with disabilities as
well as those who support, serve, guide, educate, and employ them. Specifically,
this extension will (1) increase the capacity of postsecondary institutions,
precollege educators, veterans associations, other projects that broaden
participation in computing, and industry to fully include individuals with
disabilities in computing fields; (2) create synergistic and lasting
relationships among stakeholders to foster systemic changes toward inclusiveness
in computing education and careers; (3) implement evidence-based practices
(e.g., mentoring, internships) to increase the number of individuals with
disabilities moving through critical junctures to computing careers; and (4)
expand an online resource center to share research and promising practices
worldwide. Applying methods grounded in multidisciplinary knowledge management,
collaboration, and social network theory and practice, the AccessComputing
Extension will formalize earlier and new relationships into a multi-tier
organizational structure of partners, collaborators, and affiliates. Outcomes
for individuals with disabilities will be documented by tracking the progress of
student participants as well as institutional enrollment and graduation data;
results will be compared to local, regional, and national data with respect to
the academic and career success of people with disabilities.
