With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University will acquire a
300 MHz Multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
carry out research on synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry, natural product
characterization and mechanistic chemistry. NMR will be used in the
characterization of new main group and organometallic compounds, natural
products, novel organic precursors for organic materials development, bioactive
organic reagents, supramolecular transition metal complexes, and analysis of
products from organic reactions carried out in zeolites. In addition, faculty
from Loyola University and Xavier University will have access to the equipment.
&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
