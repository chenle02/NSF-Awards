The objective of this project is to improve a Simulation, Instrumentation, and
Control Laboratory and the associated curriculum. The College of Engineering
employs this facility and curriculum for instructing mechanical, chemical,
aerospace, and electrical engineers as well as students minoring in biomedical
and ocean engineering. It is used annually by over 900 students for core
courses, senior electives, and senior projects including those which are
sponsored by local industries. A modern distributed control system and computers
for simulation have been purchased to add to the existing controllers and
sensors in the present laboratory. The instruments will be used by students to
simulate, configure, and study multiple loop and cascaded systems that have been
beyond the capabilities of this facility in the past. Computers and recorders
are used to analyze experimental results and display them graphically. This new
laboratory equipment improves students comprehension and reduces learning time.
It also reduces the time students spend on repetitive tasks such as manual data
acquisition so that more advanced topics and supplemental material can be
covered in the same course. The award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
