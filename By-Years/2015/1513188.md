Micron Technology has announced a new hardware accelerator, the Automata
Processor, and helped establish a center at the University of Virginia to
facilitate training for potential users, help create a research community around
this paradigm, and catalyze new collaborations. The Automata Processor is
designed to enable massively parallel pattern recognition. It is claimed that
speedups of 10-1000X or greater are possible on a wide range of applications
involving complex pattern matching, such as in bioinformatics, cybersecurity,
data mining, and natural language processing. While the potential impact of
automata computing technology is significant, no automata computing
infrastructure currently exists to catalyze new research opportunities around
this technology.

This planning project will bring together a broad-based community of Computer
and Information Science and Engineering researchers who can develop new
applications of, and advance the capabilities of automata computing, with the
goal of defining the needs of a community infrastructure involving automata
technology, and defining the needs for a future, full Community Infrastructure-
New proposal. Researchers from diverse institutions will be invited to
participate in this planning project. These researchers and their students will
learn about the technical capabilities of the Automata Processor and new models
for heterogeneous computing, and will have the opportunity to engage with an
emerging research community as well as to begin initial research and educational
projects involving automata technology. Because of its widespread commercial
potential, new technologies developed by users of the community infrastructure
are likely to have high value as communal research artifacts, with numerous
licensing possibilities or the potential to form spin-off companies.
