This proposal addresses a funding request both for operations and new
construction for the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The
operations budget includes dedicated storage ring costs for one month per year
for the operation of a hard x-ray undulator. Construction is for the creation of
four new experimental stations and the insertion of a high power permanent
magnet hybrid wiggler in the East straight section of the CESR storage ring. One
station will be especially suited for experimentation on biological specimens.
