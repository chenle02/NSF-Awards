Ahrens&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207934&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund a range
of studies of the equations of state, sound velocity, thermochemical properties,
and thermal conductivity of important model earth materials in the system MgO-
SiO2 under conditions accessible only by shock loading of targets that are
porous, pre-heated, or specially synthesized dense starting phases. The
investigators' multianvil method allows routine preparation of polycrystalline
samples of mantle minerals of a size and shape suitable for high-quality shock
compression studies. Experiments with majorite, ilmentite, wadsleyite,
ringwoodite, and perovskite starting materials and completion of studies on
MgSiO3 glass and gem quality enstatite, will yield data at multiple internal
energy states, from which the Gruneisen parameter will be extracted under lower
mantle conditions. This award will also fund construction of an optical line-
imaging VISAR (Velocity Interferometer System For Any Reflector) that will allow
measurement of longitudinal and bulk sound velocities under high shock pressure
by the overtaking method. This method allows comparison of mineral sound
velocities with the Earth itself as well as determination of melting
temperatures at ultra-high pressure. Experiments on both porous and preheated
MgO will determine its melting behavior above the range previously studied with
diamond cell anvils, resolving the enormous discrepancy between theoretical high
pressure melting models for MgO and present data to 40 GPa.
