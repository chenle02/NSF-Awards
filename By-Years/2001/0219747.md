This proposed research project aims to explore several unanswered questions in
the area of differentiated services for next generation Internet. In particular,
the issue of routing SLAs in the presence of multiple alternative physical paths
is a topic that has been seldom researched&lt;br/&gt;upon. It is an important
issue since the objective is to maximize the probability of success for an SLA
without opting for over-provisioning. Also, in the presence of multiple physical
paths, which is typical in large networks, there is a need to choose the optimal
path based on appropriate criteria. The proposed research directly addresses
this critical issue. Currently, there are no standard schemes for hierarchical
QoS routing. One of the most crucial problems in hierarchical QoS routing is to
make intelligent decisions in the presence of out-of-date or stale network
stateinformation. The proposed research will address this issue by making use of
local statistics collected at each router and obtaining a time history of the
network state information. Furthermore, every domain will have a finite traffic
handling capacity. This capacity is bound above by the domain topology and the
maximum link bandwidth. For computing feasible paths, current QoS routing
schemes take only the individual link bandwidth into account as a constraint but
not the domain capacity as a whole. The research will address this shortcoming
by incorporating the domain capacity as a constraint in the path computation
algorithms. Additionally, this research project will also study the problem of
splitting aggregated flows in a transit domain with the goal of maximizing the
domain resource utilization. The motivation comes from the fact that splitting
of aggregated flows will lead to better utilization of the network
bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
