Conodonts of middle Ordovician age collected by he PI as part of a
biostratigraphic project were found to have tissue preserved in and below their
basal cavities. This 450 million year-old material from eastern Australia
appears to be the oldest known fossil tissue. The horizon with the conodonts
also contains these remains of several other groups with tissue preserved. These
groups include trilobites, gastropods, inarticulate and articulate brachiopods,
corals, sponges, bryozoans, and fish. Some prelimi- nary microscopy has been
begun on the material already collected. Discussions with members of the
Institute of Molecular Biology at the University of Oregon have led to offers of
facilities necessary for gel electrophoresis protein analysis, residual protein
immunological analysis, protein sequence determination, amino acid analysis,
transmission electron ultrastructure studies, and other techniques to obtain the
most biochemical information from the preserved tissues. During the first year,
the work will a) aim to determine the extent of the tissue-rich fossil horizon
in the field, b) attempt to discover the reasons for the exceptional
preservation, c) establish the biochemical condition of the organic remains, and
d) explore the suitability of the various known methods for analyzing the
remains. During the second year this information will be applied to as many
groups as possible to gain the maximum biochemical and taxonomic knowledge about
the organisms present in the deposit, many of which belong to major groups that
are now extinct.
