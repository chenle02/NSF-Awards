CTS-9416702 Davis Univ. of Colorado Research will focus on understanding of the
role of hydrodynamic interactions in the microflotation process. Microflotation
involves the capture of very small suspended particles from liquids by rising
microscopic bubbles. Theoretical work will be conducted to determine the effects
of Brownian motion, solid particle size and shape, and also bubble deformation
on the rate of particle capture. Some experiments will be performed to test the
validity of the models. The research may improve the ability to design more
efficient separation of particles by microflotation technique for various
environmental, mining and manufacturing applications.
