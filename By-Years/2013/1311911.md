Gilmer will continue to study integral topological quantum field theories (TQFT)
and their applications to low dimensional topology. He will continue to study
representations of mapping class groups that can be defined using integral
topological quantum field theories. In particular, he will study the induced
modular representations. Gilmer plans to compute strong shift equivalence class
invariants of knots and other spaces, which can be defined using TQFT. He wishes
to calculate further strong shift equivalence invariants to uncover their
topological meaning. He has used topological quantum field theory invariants to
find obstructions to fibered knots being ribbon knots. He wants to see if there
are further obstructions. In general, he will try to use quantum topology as a
tool in low-dimensional topology. Gilmer also plans to use 4-dimensional
topology to study the topology of real algebraic curves in the real projective
plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is
sometimes called "rubber sheet" geometry as the objects that one studies can be
twisted and stretched but not torn. Recently topology has experienced a large
influx of ideas from physics. Topological quantum field theory is one of the
most current and exciting areas of topology with intimate connections to high
energy physics, quantum computing as well as other areas of mathematics, for
instance number theory. Gilmer will use topological quantum field theory as a
tool to study low dimensional topology. Low dimensional topology is important
for chemistry and biology as it has implications for the mechanism of DNA, and
other molecular configurations.
