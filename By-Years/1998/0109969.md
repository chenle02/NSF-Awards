Identifying areas rich in biological diversity is a critical step towards the
conservation of biological resources. This research will evaluate traditional,
geographic-based biodiversity assessment methods and develop and evaluate
improved methods that use biological collection data. The traditional methods
based on species range maps will be the first investigated, followed by two
alternative methods using biological collection data for creating tend surface
maps of occurrence. Software tools based on all of the methods will be made
available. The study will have three main uses. First, it will determine whether
traditional methods of biodiversity assessment are subject to error propagation
from species range maps, and how and where the errors are likely to manifest.
Second, new techniques with trend surfaces should reduce estimation errors in
predictions. Third, the software will facilitate the use of collection databases
for biodiversity assessment.
