This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a versatile, high-
resolution, analytical scanning electron microscope (HRSEM). The instrument will
serve the research needs of at least 15 investigators from several different
departments or centers on the Texas Tech University campus. The research areas
to be positively impacted are diverse and multidisciplinary - they include:
plant pathology, slime mold development and cryopreservation, plant functional
genomics and genetics, reproductive endocrinology, geochemistry, igneous
petrology and structural geology, molecular dynamics of liquid crystals,
catalysis, metals research, and nanotechnology. The acquisition of this
instrumentation will have a large impact on infrastructure in the region, and
will also aid in establishing collaborative and interdisciplinary relationships
with industry and other universities. The institution is committed to graduate
and undergraduate research training, and is also active in community outreach.
