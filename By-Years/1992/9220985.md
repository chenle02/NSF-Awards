This Symposium entitled, Mind Matters, held at Carnegie Mellon University on
October 25-27, 1992 features unpublished papers of a technical nature describing
original research in the areas of computer science and cognition. It is held in
honor of Allen Newell, who has made seminal contributions to computer science
and cognitive science . He is generally regarded as one of the founding fathers
of the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Newell>s research for the past
decade has focussed on the development of SOAR, as both an integrated
architecture for building intelligent systems and as a unified theory of
cognition. Soar is the unifying thread for this symposium. A member of the Soar
community follows each invited speaker>s talk, discussing the implications of
the results just presented for the Soar architecture. The speakers, leading
scholars in computer science and cognitive research, and their topics are chosen
to reflect the diversity of Professor Newell>s interests. The proceedings of the
symposium are to be published as a book by Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers, as part
of their Carnegie Symposium on Cognition series.
