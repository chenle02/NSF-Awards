The Seventh Conversation in Biomolecular Stereodynamics will be held in June at
SUNY/Albany. Started in 1979, then repeated every two years, the conference has
become a main event to discuss and debate the developing ideas and discoveries
in the broad context of biological structure, dynamics, interactions and
expression. Over 500 scientists from 15 countries participated in the last
meeting. The following areas will be covered: 1) RNA structure and activity; 2)
DNA protein modular structural motifs; 3) protein- nucleic acid interactions; 4)
protein structure; 5) DNA structure & dynamics; 6) unusual DNA-drug
interactions; 7) DNA damage and repair; and 8) DNA footprinting. Every effort
will be made to devote a significant part of the time to talks by graduate
students, postdoctorals and young faculty. The main lectures will be published
within a year of the meeting as the Proceeding of the Seventh Conversation.
