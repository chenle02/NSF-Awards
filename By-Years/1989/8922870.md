will take place on the campus of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, Alaska

Consortium of the United States. The purpose of the meeting is bring together
experts from a wide variety of scientific disciplines of relevance to the polar
regions and global change. The role of polar regions in global change is

indicators of change, but they also actively interact through feedback processes
with the global system, and amplify climate change.
