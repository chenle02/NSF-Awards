9302938 Chronopoulos This project will study the performance of numerical
schemes which combine approximate inertial manifolds with variable step
numerical integration. Special emphasis will be given to manifolds which are
defined only implicitly, and which result in systems of differential algebraic
equations. This research is expected to lead to stable and efficient
computational methods for determining the long-time behavior of solutions to
certain dissipative nonlinear partial differential equations. Application will
be made to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 2-D Navier-Stokes equations. ***
