This project provides resources for tribology equipment, including a surface
profilometer for characterizing surface finishes and wear, an analytical balance
for measuring weight loss during wear, and a microhardness tester for
characterizing surface hardness of very thin implanted layers. The equipment
enhances the Colorado State University's tribology laboratory's ability to
investigate the effects of ion implantation of metal surfaces. The goal of ion
implantation is the improvement of sliding wear resistance and alteration of the
coefficient of friction.
