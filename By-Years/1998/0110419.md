This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
platinum-transition metal alloy catalysts that are supported on high area carbon
for oxygen cathodes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The Phase II project
will build on the success of Phase I by optimizing the alloy composition and
particle size of supported Platinum (Pt) alloy catalysts for efficient oxygen
reduction. Low temperature synthesis methods allow T/J Technologies to produce
supported Pt alloys with minimal Pt aggregation. Alloy compositions that reduce
the over potential toward oxygen reduction by >50 mV versus Pt alone and will be
produced with particles sizes (3-5 nm) that maximize Pt utilization and oxygen
reduction efficiency. Performance will be demonstrated in half-cell and full
fuel cell experiments. Catalysts resulting from this project will enable PEM
fuel cells to operate more efficiently.

The potential commercial applications from this project would be improved oxygen
reduction catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells for vehicle
propulsion and kilowatt-scale off-grid electric power generation. These are
potentially large markets with beneficial impacts on energy efficiency,
international competitiveness, and emissions reductions.
