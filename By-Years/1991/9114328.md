Research will be conducted on quantum chaos, which is the study of wave systems
in low dimension where the eikonal (classical) limit is chaotic. This field is
highly interdisciplinary since many intriguing fundamental and technologically
important problems in chemistry, molecular physics, atomic physics, condensed
matter physics, device engineering, etc, are related to work being done. In many
cases problems in quantum chaos can be cast in the form of waves in pseudo-
random potentials, which makes a connection to related problems of waves in
random and incommensurate potentials. %%% Quantum chaos is an exciting cross-
disciplinary field which combines the behavior of classical nonlinear dynamical
systems with quantum mechanics. It is even unclear how these two highly
disparate concepts should be merged to provide models for physical systems. The
present research contributes to the foundations of this field, particularly as
it relates to condensed matter physics, and develops models for real systems.
