The research objective of this award is to develop a sampling-based algorithmic
framework for sequential decision making problems such as those that arise when
supply chain systems experience input certainties, e.g. in demand, capacity,
lead time, yield, or product lifetime at the beginning of the decision period.
The algorithmic framework can simultaneously learn the input uncertainties
through observed data and optimize the system-wide objective on the fly. If
successful, the algorithms developed will help decision makers better cope with
uncertainties in complex supply chains by analyzing and utilizing data in an
online fashion. This project will also help broaden participation of
underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.
The models and results of this project will be incorporated in the courses
taught by the principal investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the goals
of this research, the principal investigator will advance methods to jointly
learn and optimize stochastic inventory and supply chain systems, based on past
observable data in an online fashion. Such decision rules strike a balance
between exploring the underlying random processes and exploiting the processes
that have been learned. The principal investigator will provide explicit
performance guarantees of the performance of the algorithms. The performance
measure is regret, the difference between the objective value of adaptive
sampling-based algorithms and the clairvoyant optimal policies that are computed
with respect to the true underlying probability distributions, if the latter
were known. Among the specific applications, the principal investigator will
study inventory and supply chain systems with multiple and perishable products,
random capacities, and joint inventory and pricing decisions. If successful,
this research will advance the theory and practice of stochastic inventory and
supply chain systems for data-rich environments, and provide new decision tools
for practitioners.
