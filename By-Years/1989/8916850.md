This project will initiate a geochemical, petrographic petrologic study of
Quaternary Kamchatka volcanism. Work will be concentrated on about 90 basaltic-
andesitic samples, and within that on particular volcanoes and suites in a
thematic fashion, i.e. Central Kamchatka Depression volcanoes; magapagioclase-
bearing high-alkali basalts; xenoliths. XRF analyses of major and selected trace
elements will be run at the Smithsonian. Thin sections will be examined
petrographically and by scanning electron microscope.
