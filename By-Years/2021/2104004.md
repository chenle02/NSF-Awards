Extreme space weather events such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections,
energetic proton events and geomagnetic storms can cause massive disruptions in
many technologically complex systems, including radio communications,
telecommunication and navigation satellites, electrical power systems, or space
and even commercial airline flights. This project builds a detection and
analysis cyberinfrastructure, and investigates one of the most distinctive
features in the solar atmosphere â€“ magnetic polarity inversion lines, which are
hotspots of the most intense eruptive activity. Analyzing these features enables
solar physicists to advance understanding of extreme space weather events and
provide needed predictive capabilities for space weather
forecasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates an innovative and
sustainable software infrastructure to detect, characterize and analyze polarity
inversion lines. The first step toward that objective is the identification of
polarity inversion lines, and quantitative characterization of these multi-
faceted features through image descriptors. In subsequent stages, this project
analyzes the time series of these features and descriptors using advanced
machine learning and data mining techniques, specifically for improving space
weather forecasting capabilities. This includes analyzing the spatiotemporal
patterns of emergence and disappearance for polarity inversion lines, selecting
and understanding important shape characteristics of these lines pertinent to
solar eruptive activity, and creating a prototype eruption forecasting system
with discovered precursors. Automatically identifying and analyzing polarity
inversion lines has several direct benefits: physically understanding solar
magnetic shear layers and the transition from typical non-eruptive active region
states to intense, eruptive ones; making contributions to forecasting of solar
eruptions; and generating descriptors and measures that can be useful to the
study of shear layers in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Office
of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Solar Terrestrial
Physics Program and the Division of Integrative and Collaborative Education and
Research within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
