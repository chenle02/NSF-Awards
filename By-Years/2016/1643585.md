Massasoit Community College will develop the "STEM Scholars Associates" project,
to provide annual scholarships for twenty low-income, academically talented
students pursuing associate degrees in STEM disciplines. By leveraging
scholarships with structured activities designed to increase academic success
and workplace readiness, this project aims to increase the number of qualified
STEM professionals prepared to address the challenges of the 21st
century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the "STEM Scholars Associates" project
is to increase the number of low-income students who complete associate degrees
and enter the STEM workforce either directly or after transferring to a
baccalaureate-granting institution. In addition to scholarship assistance, this
program will provide students with evidence-based curricular and co-curricular
experiences focused on improving academic performance and confidence, building
professional aptitude and reasoning abilities, and establishing a community of
peers. Trained faculty mentors will help students explore career goals and
ensure that they remain on track to degree completion and transfer. Industry
partners will engage in a career speaker series and provide students with
internship opportunities. Scholarship recipients will also have the opportunity
to engage in on-campus research to build skills in critical thinking, problem
solving, and workplace readiness. Carrying out this project will also provide
insights into the conditions under which such curricular and co-curricular
activities prove effective.
