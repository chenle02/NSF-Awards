Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Albany State University seeks to
build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-
American students in STEM disciplines. A component of the project is a Learning
Community-as-Teaching Laboratory where faculty will focus on pedagogical
approaches that best assist students to develop the skills needed for success in
the STEM disciplines. The project will employ a cross-disciplinary approach,
using faculty from both the natural sciences and education, who will employ
evidence-based methods of teaching to enhance student
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four specific goals: 1) to
increase the number of entering freshmen in STEM majors; 2) to increase the STEM
graduation rate; 3) to develop strong STEM skills, such as problem solving
skills, critical thinking skills, research skills, and the application of the
skills in the content areas in gatekeeper courses; and 4) to implement a
professional development partnership in STEM teaching. The goals will be
accomplished through faculty professional development, a support system for
students, a learning community, and an integrated vertically aligned curriculum.
The project seeks to create an intensive Sustained Support System for Students
who are interested in STEM but who are at risk of not performing well and
dropping out, providing them with the skills and motivation to persist in STEM
majors. Through the evaluation plan, the project seeks to study the effects of
these interconnected approaches as models for other HBCUs that are predominantly
teaching institutions.
