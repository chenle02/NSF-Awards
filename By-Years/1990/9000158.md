The University of Delaware will operate the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN during 1990 as a
general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The R/V
CAPE HENLOPEN is a '120 general research vessel constructed in 1976 and owned by
the University of Delaware. The ship operates primarily off the U.S. east coast
from North Carolina to New York. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the
National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institutions around the country.
