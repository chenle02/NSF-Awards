DMS-9986086 ABSTRACT

This award is for the partial support of a conference in the field of Partial
Differential Equations. The conference will address problems in the areas of:
Dispersive Equations, Free Boundary Value Problems, Fully Nonlinear Stochastic
Partial Differential Equations, Geometric Partial Differential Equations and
their connections with Harmonic Analysis. All these areas are currently in the
stage of significant development motivated by new ideas and new applications.
The conference will be held right before the special session of the AMS,
allowing the organizers to attract leading researchers in the field and many
young investigators. The conference will definitely have a significant impact on
the development of the field and will be beneficial to the mathematical
community. I strongly recommend the award.
