The PI will experiment with a variety of atmospheric phenomena, such as aurorae,
Venus nightglow, lightning and space vehicle reentry, particularly pertaining to
the lowest excited state of nitrous oxide. He will measure loss rate
coefficients for a variety of quenchers over a large range of vibrational
levels. Further, the PI will investigate details of energy transfer processes
between nitrous oxide quartets and doublets in high vibrational levels, and
develop methods for studying low vibrational levels. Finally, he will
investigate the reactivity of this state with molecular oxygen and nitrogen to
determine whether oxygen and nitrogen atoms are produced.***
