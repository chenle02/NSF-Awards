Objective: The objective of this program is the heterogeneous integration of
graphene with silicon integrated circuits for next generation nanoelectronics
that leverage the complexity, scale, cost, and technology proliferation of
mature silicon systems with the unique functionalities of graphene for future
ubiquitous advanced systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
intellectual merit is the pioneering of a new cross-disciplinary research to
create graphene devices integrated with silicon electronics for advanced systems
for the first time. These systems will offer tunable functionality and greater
computational efficiency beyond the performance of stand-alone silicon
technology. The effort is organized into five essential tasks which are
necessary to overcome the existing challenges ranging from wafer-scale growth,
optimized devices with minimal non-idealities, and the first realization of
graphene-silicon terahertz electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
The broader impacts are the future proliferation of new advanced graphene-
silicon integrated systems for the benefit of the broader society. Such systems
are transformative because the integration of graphene extends the capabilities
of low-cost ubiquitous silicon technology into the terahertz regime with added
tunability leading to revolutionary new products much like gigahertz silicon
electronics revolutionized mobile communications. Example systems include:
terahertz transceivers for imaging, security, communication and spectroscopy;
sensor arrays for electronic-nose applications; and graphene enabled
optoelectronics. In addition, tight coupling between the research program and
educational outreach initiatives will provide undergraduate research experiences
at the forefront of nanoelectronics, and also afford secondary school students
exposure to nanoscience. The outreach initiatives will impact scores of
underrepresented students and inspire them to pursue technical careers.
