Matroids are combinatorial objects that appear in many important areas of
mathematics because they capture the notion of “independence” in diverse
mathematical constructs, such as graphs, field extensions, hyperplane
arrangements, matchings, and discrete optimizations. Using various techniques
developed in recent years, the PI aims to deepen the interaction between
combinatorics and algebraic geometry, both in matroid theory and in contexts
beyond matroids such as Coxeter combinatorics and algebraic statistics. The PI
plans to involve undergraduate and graduate students in the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will work on several projects in matroid
theory are proposed using the new framework of "tautological classes of
matroids." Many of these projects concern new properties for numerical
invariants of matroids that have implications to some long-standing conjectures
in matroid theory. These projects also inspire projects in Coxeter combinatorics
and algebraic statistics. Completion of these projects will reveal new
structural properties of combinatorial objects such as polymatroids and delta-
matroids, and will inform the complexity of maximum-likelihood problems in
algebraic statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
