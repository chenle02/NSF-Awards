INT 9515504 De Long The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research project
between Dr. Lance De Long of the University of Kentucky and Dr. Vladimir
Sechovsky of Charles University, Prague, is to examine the effects of high
pressure and magnetic field on electronic structure, magnetic anisotropy and
electrical transport in Uranium containing compounds. Contributions to the work
will emphasize high-pressure measurements on the U.S. side involving special
vibrating reed and torque techniques and, on the Czech side, high quality single
crystal sample preparation and structural characterization. Results are expected
to improve our ability to study such intermetallic materials across the
localization boundary. In the course of this work, the researchers also intend
to construct a refined high field vibrating magnetometer located at the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. This joint research
project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence. ??
