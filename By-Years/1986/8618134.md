This project involves the development of a method for monitoring the extent of
specifically induced protein biosynthesis by genetically engineered
microorganisms. The approach induces the formation of another enzyme (at a
related but must lower rate) which can be easily measured by spectrophotometric
techniques. This project has the potential to provide a general method for
monitoring the productivity of genetically engineered microorganisms.
