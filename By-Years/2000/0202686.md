The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twelve-month research fellowship by Dr. Arturo
Hernandez to work with Dr. Angela Friederici at the Max Planck Institute for
Cognitive Neuropsychology in Leipzig, Germany.

This project will involve the exploration of the neural correlates of
grammatical gender processing in German. The PI will explore the nature of
gender processing in a three-gender system and studies which compare gender
decision to error detection. These studies are expected to further extend our
knowledge about the neural correlates of grammatical processing. This work will
involve a new line of research on the neural correlates of second language
processing.

The Max Planck Institute will provide access to a state-of-the-art Magnetic
Resonance Imaging System especially designed for psychological experimentation.
