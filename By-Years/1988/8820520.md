The main objective of this research is to explore new techniques to aid in the
interpretation of results generated by structural analysis programs. Emphasis
will be placed on results generated by earthquake analysis of building
structures. The techniques developed will be tested with the results generated
by the three-dimensional computer analysis program ETABS. Previous research lead
to the development of a new interactive graphical interface for the ETABS
program. The techniques developed in this research are applicable to other
structural analysis programs as well. Earthquake structural analysis of a
building structure typically generates a vast quantity of information that
requires careful evaluation for it to be useful in design. Information such as
natural frequencies, mode shapes, maximum response quantities, and story drifts
are generated and saved in results files. The research will focus on new
techniques to simplify the interpretation and evaluation of this data. The
primary goal of these techniques is to make the 3- dimensional earthquake
structural analysis of building structures a practical design tool.
