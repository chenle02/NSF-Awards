This research deals with an investigation to design, synthesize, and
characterize helical polymers and to study their properties. The primary thrust
will still be the preparation of isotactic helical polymers, those polymers
whose structure consists of only isotactic macromolecular helices of one screw
sense and which display optical activity based on macromolecular asymmetry. The
goals are: a.)To identify clearly the initial propagation mechanism by
determining the absolute configuration of all the linear oligomer of the chloral
polymerization now obtained in the crystalline state. b.)To prepare
polyperhaloacetaldehydes of one screw sense by initiation with bulky chiral
initiators. c.)To use pure chiral fluorochlorobromoacetaldehyde as monomer for
the perhaloacetaldehyde polymerization to ascertain the influence of the chiral
center of the monomer on the handedness of the helical polymer. d.)To establish
the limits of this newly discovered method of measuring the optical rotation of
solids. e.)To perfect the potential energy calculations of configuration and
conformation for the developing of the helix during chiral initiation and follow
it up with computer simulation to show the "locking" of the helix based on the
bulkiness of the isotactic polymer chain. f.)To investigate the synthesis of
helical polymers of one screw sense in the presence of polarized light and the
fabrication of helical polymers in the solid state or by direct monomer casting
techniques to forum oriented high tenacity fibers.
