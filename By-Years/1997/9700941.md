Lewontin 9700941 We now know that natural selection can result in exquisitely
precise convergence at the molecular level. One area in which molecular
convergence has been demonstrated is vision. Opsins, the proteins that are
primarily responsible for determining the spectral sensitivity of a
photoreceptor, have undergone convergent evolution in response to selection for
similar sensitivities. The purpose of this research is to extend these studies
by investigating opsin evolution in a group of butterflies famous for mimicry.
This study tests whether or not opsin amino acid sequences are correlated with
the convergently acquired mimetic morphologies. Because butterfly eyes are in
part like morphologies will have resulted in the evolution of like opsins. The
methods employed will be to finish sequencing the opsin genes of pairs of
mimetic Heliconius butterflies, and then to examine the pattern of opsin amino
acid substitution by mapping the opsin sequences on a recent phylogeny of this
group based on mitochondrial DNA.
