This SGER proposal will make it possible to sustain an effort by precollege
classroom teachers to investigate diagnosis of students' knowledge and reasoning
in physics and mathematics, especially as the results of the diagnoses are used
to guide subsequent instruction. The project is an example of a practical
interaction between research on teaching and learning. Development of
instructional materials and teacher development. The investigators will revise
and use an diagnostic teaching system (begun under an earlier private sector
grant) to build a knowledge base of student thinking from which
interrelationships between thinking in various topic areas within physics and
between thinking in physics and in mathematics. The assessment of student
thinking will guide revision of instructional materials and activities to make
them more relevant to students' initial conceptions and reasoning. Four
teachers, including the two PIs, will interact as peer mentors addressing
questions relevant instruction. Expected products include a publication on
diagnosis of student thinking in physics and mathematics and a paper about
collaboration among peer teachers as a framework for developing more reflective
practitioners, for developing the teacher as researcher.
