MacAyeal/0944248&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to develop a
better understanding of the processes and conditions that trigger ice shelf
instability and explosive disintegration. A significant product of the proposed
research will be the establishment of parameterizations of micro- and meso-scale
ice-shelf surface processes needed in large scale ice-sheet models designed to
predict future sea level rise. The proposed research represents a 3-year effort
to conduct numerical model studies of 6 aspects of surface-water evolution on
Antarctic ice shelves. These 6 model-study areas include energy balance models
of melting ice-shelf surfaces, with treatment of surface ponds and water-filled
crevasses, distributed, Darcian water flow modeling to simulate initial firn
melting, brine infiltration, pond drainage and crevasse filling, ice-shelf
surface topography evolution modeling by phase change (surface melting and
freezing), surface-runoff driven erosion and seepage flows, mass loading and
flexure effects of ice-shelf and iceberg surfaces; feedbacks between surface-
water loads and flexure stresses; possible seiche phenomena of the surface
water, ice and underlying ocean that constitute a mechanism for, inducing
surface crevassing., surface pond and crevasse convection, and basal crevasse
thermohaline convection (as a phenomena related to area 5 above). The broader
impacts of the proposed work bears on the socio-environmental concerns of
climate change and sea-level rise, and will contribute to the important goal of
advising public policy. The project will form the basis of a dissertation
project of a graduate student whose training will contribute to the scientific
workforce of the nation and the PI and graduate student will additionally
participate in a summer science-enrichment program for high-school teachers
organized by colleagues at the University of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
