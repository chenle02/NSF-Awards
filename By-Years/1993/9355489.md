9355489 Bad Wound Oglala Lakota College has made the commitment to initiate a
new institution-wide effort to significantly increase the number of American
Indian students that earn bachelor's degrees in the natural sciences, computer
sciences, engineering, and mathematics fields (SEM). This planning proposal is
unique because: The application would benefit students of the only two-four-year
accredited Tribally Controlled Colleges in the Nation, in addition to two-year
Tribal Colleges. South Dakota National Science Foundation Statewide Systemic
Initiative has committed comprehensive technical assistance to enhance the
planning process. Resources provided by the SSI will significantly increase the
likelihood that Oglala Lakota College will be able to develop a successful plan,
and further to implement new SEM programs for American Indian students. Oglala
Lakota College proposes to fully enhance telecommunication systems through
collaborative effort in the implementation stage of this initiative in order to
serve American Indians nationwide. South Dakota is a small state where
collaboration among Institutions is extensive and permits maximizing of scare
resources. Oglala Lakota College proposes a six month comprehensive planning
process to develop four-year cooperative degrees. Cooperative degrees could than
be offered through other institutions including two-year Tribal Colleges, in
addition to Oglala Lakota Colleges' offering and thus significantly increase the
number of students impacted.
