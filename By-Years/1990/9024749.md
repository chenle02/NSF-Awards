A collaborative research effort by institutions in the U.S., France, and
Madagascar will result in a modern conspectus for the flora of Madagascar.
Current information on the flora of Madagascar is incomplete and/or dispersed,
and inadequate for addressing critical conservation needs. Utilizing the
TROPICOS database system developed at the Missouri Botanical Garden,
investigators will compile a checklist of all the vascular plants indigenous to
and naturalized in Madagascar. The computer database will include place of
publication, accepted synonymy, typification, overall distribution and
distribution within Madagascar by province and protected area, habit, and
vernacular names, all vouchered by specimens tied, to as great a degree as
possible, to latitude and longitude, and hence, directly available to a GIS-
based biodiversity inventory and planning center in Madagascar. Capture of data
for the conspectus will involve: 1) extraction from all known literature at each
of the collaborating institutions; 2) verification of type material, principally
located at the Museum National d'Historie Naturelle (P) in Paris, and
secondarily so at Kew (K) and the British Museum (BM) in London; 3) exhaustive
inventory and computerization (and therefore annotation) of the existing
collections in Madagascar at the Parc de Tsimbazaza (TAN) and FO.FI.FA. (TEF)
herbaria in Antananarivo, as well as those at the Missouri Botanical Garden
(MO), which, along with type material, will form the basis of vouchered
distributional occurrence. Data from each of the collaborating institutions will
be collated at MO, where investigators from the Malagasy institutions will
receive training in botanical data collection and management, and its direct
application to pressing conservation imperatives. A complete checklist of the
vascular flora of Madagascar will serve to stimulate and facilitate further
taxonomic work, while immediately providing critical data on the current
conservation status of one of the world's richest, most unique, and highly
threatened floras.
