The project addresses the measurement of quantum-statistical properties of
light on the femtosecond time scale. New measurement techniques will be
developed which will target the extraction of the state function from a series
of determinations of the probability density function relative to the phase of a
reference, local-oscillator field. The work is, first of all, important to the
fundamental interpretation of measurement in quantum mechanics. Secondly, the
outcome in terms of techniques for measurement of photon statistics and phase
noise of weak light will have a broad practical impact in the interpretation of
results from other quantum-optical measurements such as atom interferometry and
quantum computing.
