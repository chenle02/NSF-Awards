This project would develop instructional materials for integrating nanoscale
science and engineering content into the secondary STEM curriculum. The proposed
modules will present nanoscience activities, experiments and assessments in an
interdisciplinary context that relates to traditional standards-based topics of
force, properties of matter, scale and instrumentation. The modules are intended
as replacement units rather than additions to existing curricula and will be
accompanied by teacher's guides and a professional development protocol.
Expertise in materials development and curriculum project coordination will be
provided by the Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL) Co-PIs
Ristvey and Morrow. Collaboration with Prof. Yoshio Nishi, Director of the
Stanford Nanofabrication Facility (SNF) and his colleagues will provide content
expertise to the development team. &lt;br/&gt;
