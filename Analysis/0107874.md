This project is mainly concerned with the study of the regularity of solutions
of partial differential equations that arise in the theory of several complex
variables and on CR manifolds. In particular we plan to study various properties
of subelliptic multipliers and also hypoellipticity when subellipticity fails.
Related questions are Hoelder continuity and real analyticity of solutions. We
also will continue our study of global regularity on CR manifolds using
microlocal methods.

Partial differential equations arise naturally in physics, chemistry,
engineering, economics, and in several diverse areas of mathematics. Sometimes
these equations can be solved explicitly but more often they cannot and, in that
case, the problem is to find whether the solution exists and if so to find
various of its properties and to approximate it. This is accomplished by means
of estimates. Here we study estimates for certain special fundamental partial
differential equations but the techniques we develop are applicable in much
greater generality. The basic concept that we use are "subelliptic multipliers"
this is a tool which converts the search for estimates into problems of algebra
and geometry. This concept has proved very effective not only in proving
estimates but also in the study of various algebraic and geometric problems.
