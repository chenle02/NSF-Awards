This project will: 1) Determine repose periods and frequency of eruptions at
large silicic centers by dating key stratigraphic units by 40Ar/39Ar method. 2)
Provide insight into the nature and timing of overlapping volcanic activity at
Quaternary- Holocene stratovolcanoes using 14C and paleomagnetic secular
variation. 3) Establish the nature and geometry of a paleomagnetic excursion
previously reported at Santa Maria. 4) Evaluate the long-term statistical
behavior of geomagnetic secular variation at low latitudes. In addition, the PIs
plan to develop long-term volcanic hazard assessment and hazard zonation maps.
