ABSTRACT CTS-9622235 A high-speed rotating drum camera and the components to
build a particle field holography system which will be purchased to supporting
research in multiphase flows. The equipment will be used to generate a analyze
data in two independent research programs: the high-speed breakup of
viscoelastic and Newtonian liquids in a mach 6 shock tube, and the dynamic
behavior of turbulent particle-laden flows. The objective of the breakup project
is to generate the first systematic data and the first understanding of how
viscoelastic liquids breakup when exposed to supersonic flows. The drum camera
will provide data on the mechanisms governing the breakup event, which is
essentially complete in less than 500 ( sec. The particle field holography
system will provide three-dimensional data on the size, shape, and distribution
of the fragments after initial breakup. The objective of the particle-laden flow
project is to understand the dynamical behavior of turbulent flows that are
laden with particles or fibers. The drum camera will provide high resolution,
high repetition rate sequences of flow events. The holography system will yield
three-dimensional information on fiber orientation and flocculation. ***
