Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate
education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty
member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution,
and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at
Lincoln University in Missouri will investigate aspects and applications of
computational audio signal processing, drawing from disciplines such as computer
science, engineering, mathematics, and music, and will include undergraduate
students in the research activities. Results from this work could have potential
applications in areas such as improving hearing aids in noisy environments or
automatic transcription of musical recordings.

The project at Lincoln University proposes to create an interdisciplinary
research group in computational research on music and audio that will involve
undergraduate students. Specific research aims are the detection of onsets and
offsets in musical audio; sound source separation based on binary masking of
time-frequency elements; and development of mathematical methods to quantify and
decompose sound mixtures and components of sounds mixtures. An advisory
committee has been established to guide the project, as well as facilitate the
establishment of research collaborations.
