Project COOL: Chemical Oceanography Outside the Lab brings together
geoscientists, undergraduate students and middle school youth. The program
begins with professional development and curriculum design workshops for
geoscientists who teach (e.g. professors, postdocs). Then a course at the
University of Washington is offered to geoscience majors at both the
undergraduate and graduate level through the UW's "Pipeline Project". Finally,
participants opt into participating in an Out of School Time (OST) Program run
through Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Seattle Public School District.
Project COOL OST is offered at multiple Seattle area middle schools and will
engage underrepresented youth in authentic scientific research through
collaboration with SoundCitizen (http://soundcitizen.org), a university-housed
citizen science collective that fosters public involvement in geosciences
research. This project will: a) create a scientifically-grounded lab and field
research experience for middle school youth at a time when data shows they are
consciously and unconsciously making decisions about the role of STEM science in
their futures; b) scientifically investigate identity development, learning
practices and engagement for both the middle school youth and the undergraduate
student scientists that participate together in scientific research; and, c)
produce high quality data and information that will be used by the aquatic
chemists leading the teams to further research and educational missions. This
project is driven by two objectives; a need to provide geosciences opportunities
and mentoring for scientists and students at different career and educational
stages (specifically professors, undergraduate students and middle school
youth), and a need to develop measurement models and methods that can be used
across programs to further understand how youth learn from place-based programs.
