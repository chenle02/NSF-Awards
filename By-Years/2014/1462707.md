The award funds work that will develop new methods for analyzing economic data.
Researchers working with economic data often rely on asymptotic approximations
in making statistical inferences. However, we know that standard asymptotic
theory fails when identification is weak. Therefore these approximations are not
very accurate in a number of cases. The PI proposes a possible solution. The new
methods could potentially be used in a variety of applications. The project
advances science by developing new methods for conducting formal statistical
tests of certain kinds of economic theory.

The PI plans to develop testing procedures in nonlinear Generalized Method of
Moments (GMM) models that have correct asymptotic size for a virtually
unrestricted parameter space, except for uniform moment bounds on the moment
function and its derivative. The proposed test is a generalized form of the
Conditional Likelihood Ratio (CLR) test. He then wants to show that this tests
have (near) optimality properties in terms of power for certain models and
classes of tests.
