Whitney &lt;br/&gt;0106673 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A novel technique for
determining the mechanisms, rates, and magnitude of decompression during
unroofing of mountain belts, including quantifying the magnitude of high-
temperature decompression and the unroofing pressure-temperature trajectory of
formerly deep rocks, involves interpreting microcrack patterns in garnet. Of
particular interest are microcracks that radiate from mineral inclusions, as
their formation is likely initiated by decompression. By documenting the
conditions at which the difference between lithostatic pressure and the internal
pressure on mineral inclusions will fracture a host garnet in a radial pattern
about the inclusion, it may be possible to calculate tectonic variables related
to exhumation of mid- to lower-crustal rocks. This research involves (1)
determination of the fracture toughness of silicate garnets as a function of
temperature, composition, and crystal orientation, and (2) documentation and
comparison of garnet microstructures in inclusion-rich and inclusion-free
regions of garnets with well-constrained tectonic histories. Microstructures in
the vicinity of inclusions surrounded by microcracks are compared with those
near inclusions with no microcracks. Garnet properties will be determined using
micromechanical testing apparatus, microstructures will be observed with high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy, and structural domains will be
assessed using electron backscatter diffraction techniques. Results from this
research have applications to other decompressed materials (e.g., garnet-bearing
mantle xenoliths) and provide fundamental information about the brittle behavior
of garnet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
