ABSTRACT CTS-9528708 The PI has proposed the use of acoustic coaxing methods to
promote acoustic cavitation be produced and used of chemicals as in present
deinking processes. Bubbles in the application of chemical free deinking. By
combining a strong sound field of low frequency (1 MHZ) with a weal should field
of high frequency (30 MHZ), microcavitation can generated in the process would
also aid in the floatation of particles away from the paper.
