9308124 Yu A challenging task in molecular engineering is to synthesize
multifunctional materials that exhibit predetermined chemical and physical
properties. We will extend the scope of the so-called Stille reaction as a new
methodology to synthesize multifunctional polymers. The materials we are seeking
include those with properties of liquid crystallinity/electroactivity,
electroactivity/second order/third order optical nonlinearity, and
conductivity/photoconductivity/photorefractivity. Two goals will be achieved by
the proposed research: 1) conceptually new materials will be synthesized and
their physical properties will be studied by using state-of-the art instruments;
2) novel polymerization methodology will be developed. ***
