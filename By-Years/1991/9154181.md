The program will be directed at the thoughtful introduction of modern technology
into the undergraduate mathematics classroom using the University of Arizona's
software and will consist of two components. A ten day workshop during which the
participants learn about technology in the classroom and create instructional
material which they can take back with them. The workshop will be divided into
several parts: Seeing software demonstrations and completing software
assignments; Textbook examination for appropriate incorporation of technology;
discussion of new material, and individual experimentation with software. A
three day follow-up meeting held the following January during which participants
will report back on what they did, sharing the ideas and experiences they gained
from implementing technology in the classroom and raise specific problems they
have encountered.
