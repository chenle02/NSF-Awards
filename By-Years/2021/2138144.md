Maria Wimberly is awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research
and education at the University of California, Riverside. She plans a study of
near–field cosmology and numerical modeling of galactic star formation. She has
extensive experience with hydrodynamic simulations that include star formation
models. These models yield different predictions of heavy element production in
ultra–faint dwarf galaxies, which depend on the environment where the stars
formed. She will improve the Cal–Bridge Scholarship’s peer mentorship program,
to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in Physics &amp;
Astronomy by strengthening genuine camaraderie. The program includes specific
personalized professional development planning for these young, diverse
scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wimberley will compare models of predicted
element abundances to observations of galaxies in different environments, to
determine which physical processes are most important in these environments. A
key question she seeks to answer is what fraction of the Milky Way’s ultra–faint
dwarf galaxies were never satellites of other smaller galaxy systems, prior to
entering the Milky Way’s system. She seeks to learn what fraction of the Milky
Way’s satellite galaxies are true, pristine relics of the first galaxies ever
formed. These galaxies are optimal sites to search for signatures of the first
stars ever formed. Within the expanded Cal-Bridge program, she plans a vertical
mentoring structure. These peer mentorship activities provide space for students
to create a community around equity through normalizing common struggles,
individual holistic success, and determining how to improve their academic
experience. This type of group work/mentoring organically creates leadership
opportunities and a thriving community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
