A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) has been acquired and used to
perform undergraduate research and teach undergraduate students. The instrument
is quite versatile in terms of capillary GC separation, and mass spectral
identification by both electron-impact as well as chemical ionization. It is
easily operable so that students can obtain hands-on experience. The instrument
is used to teach a variety of upper level undergraduate courses, such as
Instrumental Analysis, Qualitative Organic Analysis, and Physical Chemistry, as
well as being used in several undergraduate projects. The students obtain a
thorough knowledge of fundamental and analytical aspects of GC-MS as well as
exposure to modern chemical instrumentation. The institution is matching the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
