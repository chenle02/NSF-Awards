The goal of this proposal is to improve undergraduate instruction in cell and
molecular biology for freshman and for advanced biology majors, by placing more
emphasis on cells and nucleic acids in the laboratory than on introductory
chemical techniques. The equipment includes an incubator, water baths, biosafety
hood, and centrifuge for cell culture, and electrophoresis units, and
spectrophotometer for studying nucleic acids and proteins.
