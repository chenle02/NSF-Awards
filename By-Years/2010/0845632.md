Dealing with the world's most pressing problems requires an ability to
understand and reason about causal complexity. For instance, understanding
topics such as ecosystems and global warming involves reasoning about non-
obvious causes, spatial gaps, temporal delays, cyclic causality, and distributed
causality where the agency/intentionality of one's actions is on a different
level than those of the emergent outcomes. The focus of this proposal is on how
children learn to reason about complex causality and how that reasoning can be
stimulated and taught in classrooms. The literature on child development
suggests that children are capable of understanding complex causal concepts to a
greater extent than earlier research suggested. Yet, paradoxically, students'
misconceptions in science have been linked to students' difficulties reasoning
about complex causality. This study will explore how children learn to reason
when provided with activities and materials that support three types of
reasoning: distributed causality, probabilistic causality, and action at a
distance. By conducting and videotaping close interviews at multiple points in
the school year with small numbers of students in grades K-6 (the microgenetic
phase), the study will characterize children's reasoning at different ages and
how it shifts over time and with different learning supports. It will consider
the contexts of biology, mechanical reasoning, social reasoning, and games.
Classroom-level interventions will then be introduced and studied. In the last
year of the project, using what was learned about children's reasoning and how
to support it, ecosystems and global warming curriculum units will be designed
and tested in a larger number of classrooms.
