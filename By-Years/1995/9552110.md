This project makes possible the incorporation of more physiology into
traditionally anatomy-based biological sciences laboratories in order to more
effectively tie in laboratory with lectures in human anatomy and physiology.
Additional physiology is imperative in order to prepare future health care
workers or future scientists as relates to the assessment and management of
real-life situations concerning the recovery of and maintenance of homeostasis.
This can be accomplished through the use of computers and two types of computer
software package. Quantitative Circulatory Physiology (QCP) is a computer that
allows students to challenge people's homeostatic capabilities through the
application of various stressors such as trauma, exercise, or environmental
changes and noting the body's responses through changes in various
cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine parameters. Physiological data
acquisition can also be accomplished by combining computer software components
with traditional lab equipment. This setup allows students to see themselves as
models to determine the effects of exercise, various drugs, etc., on their
cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems. Ideally, this computer-
supplemented laboratory allows the student to exit a biology course with a much
better understanding of how living organisms interact with their environment.
