An Application Centric Approach to High Performance
Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop new
methods that allows runtime performance optimization by an enhanced monitoring,
resource modeling, evaluation and remapping of the application at runtime,
depending on runtime resources and application performance. The specific
approaches to be pursued include application algorithm adaptation, run-time
software optimization, system configuration selection and tuning reconfigurable
OS services.&lt;br/&gt;
