9521288 Zeng The overall aim t his University-Industry GOALI project is to
eliminate or reduce "stiction", the adhesion of microscopic surfaces present in
micromachined microelectronic systems (MEMS), which can result in the
malfunctioning of such system. Humidity-induced stiction is of particular
concern. We propose to alleviate the problem by coating the MEMS surfaces with
an organic film having the property that two such coated surfaces repel one
another on close approach. The surfaces therefore cannot adhere but remain
hydrophobic. The project, which involves a collaboration among physical
scientist a the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UN-L) and engineers at Analog
Devices, Inc. of Waltham, MA, will be divided into four phases: 1) Organic chain
molecules that have an embedded polar group with an effective dipole moment
projecting parallel to the molecular long axis will be synthesized. These
molecules will be covalently bonded to the polysilicon substrates that make up
the bare MEMS elements, sot hat a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with a net
dipole moment normal to the surface will cover the substrate. Two such coated
surfaces will repel each other. (2) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and chemical
force microscopy (CFM) will be used to determine the quality of the SAM's and
toe measure the forces of adhesion and friction between SAM-coated substrates.
(3) Monte Carlo computer simulations of model SAMs will elucidate the molecular
mechanism of stiction that operate in real dipolar SAMs. Feedback from phases
(2) and (3) will guide the design of "smart" SAM coatings being synthesized in
phase (1). The possible detrimental effects of humidity will also be assessed.
(4) The testing of candidate SAMs in an actual MEMS, the ADXL50 accelerometer,
will be accomplished by means of standard drop, shock-survival and electrical-
capture tests at Analog Devices.
