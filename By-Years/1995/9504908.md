9504908 Poon The proposed research deals with smooth 4-manifolds and complex
algebraic surfaces. The investigator will use twistor theory to tackle various
problems in smooth 4-manifold theory; algebraic surfaces of general type are to
be considered as well. This latter project is a continuation of the Kadaira-
Enriques program, where they give a coarse classification of (algebraic) complex
surfaces. Smooth four-manifolds are generally considered to be the most
difficult and interesting class of manifolds. For example, it is known that only
in dimension 4 there exists an 'exotic' smooth structure. These manifolds also
pertain to various models of the universe according to general relativity
theory.
