PI: Spitzer IBN: 9603978 Dr. Spitzer will analyze the molecular mechanisms that
underlie expression of potassium current in embryonic spinal nerve cell. Nerve
cells transmit information with electrical signals, and acquire the ability to
generate these signals called action potentials at very early stages of
differentiation. Initially, these action potentials allow the entry of
substantial amounts of calcium ions. Dr. Spitzer has shown that this calcium
influx generates important signals that regulate several aspects of the
development of nerve cells. However, since this amount of calcium entry is toxic
to mature nerve cells, the neurons must dramatically reduce the amount of
calcium entry as they mature. In earlier work Dr. Spitzer showed that the
reduction of calcium influx is the result of an increase in potassium current
that flows out of the nerve cells through protein pores, called potassium
channels, opposing the calcium influx. In the work supported by this grant he
will determine the basis of the developmental increase in this potassium
current. Preliminary results suggest that expression of a particular gene, known
as Kv2.2, which encodes the protein of which potassium channels are composed,
may be responsible for the increase in this potassium current. Dr. Spitzer will
use antisense DNA sequences to suppress the synthesis of the protein in nerve
cells isolated and growing in culture. He will take advantage of the
availability of a toxin, hanatoxin, that is a specific blocker of these
channels, to check the success of these experiments. If the antisense treatment
suppresses expression of the Kv2.2 protein, the toxin will no longer affect the
potassium current. The results from the project will provide new knowledge about
the regulation of excitability in the spinal cord. The fact that the central
nervous system of young vertebrates is especially vulnerable to epileptic
seizure activity may be partly due to the calcium influx that is part of the
early signaling mac hinery. In the future it may be possible to suppress this
calcium influx selectively by regulating the expression of particular potassium
channel genes.
