Chabot Space and Science Center is developing an exhibit of Chinese astronomical
artifacts and organizing a United States tour of the exhibit. "Dragon Skies:
Astronomy of Imperial China" consists of 31 exhibit pieces, including seven
large astronomical instruments, chronographs, stone carvings and star maps. Many
of these artifacts have never before left China. In order to increase the
awareness and understanding of students, teachers and the public about Imperial
China's rich astronomical achievements, Chabot will develop a variety of
interpretive materials and programs that address interests and learning styles,
present scientifically and historically accurate information, and serve both
informal and formal educational audiences. These materials will include a
planetarium show, an audio tour, special signage, multimedia
animations/interactive kiosks, a web site, student activities, community events,
a science drama program, activities for the general public and a variety of
printed materials. Many components will be developed in English, Mandarin and
Cantonese.
