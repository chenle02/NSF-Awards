Forming engineered nanostructures is a major challenge in the field
nanotechnology. There is a general agreement that such structures should be
formed by self assembly, in contrast to controlled lithographic approach adopted
in MEMS and micro electronics. In this project, we intend to form self assembled
nano-wires, and investigate the underlying mechanics that govern the self
assembly. We have shown experimentally that plasma deposited silicon di-oxide
may crack when annealed due to residual stress. We successfully formed nano
wires by simply depositing (electroless) Nickel in the cracks.&lt;br/&gt;Nickel
bonds with the substrate and forms wires with lateral dimension of around 100nm.
The length of the wires can be several micro meters. Thus a network of self-
assembled nanowires is obtained. In this one-year project, we plan to study the
parameters that govern the dimension of the wires in order to reduce their width
to 20nm. The electrical and mechanical properties will also be investigated to
explore any size effect due to confinement. The study may have a considerable
impact on the field of nano-electronics, and will enhance fundamental
understanding of the mechanical behavior of nano-wires and their transport
properties.&lt;br/&gt;
