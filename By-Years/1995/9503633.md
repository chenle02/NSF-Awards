9503633 Abeyaratne This award is part of a combined theoretical-experimental
program to study shape memory alloys, a class of materials that have qualities
of "memory" and "trainability". This program will involve cyclic and biaxial
loads and temperatures from -70 to 1500 C as well as higher strain rates. The
main goals of the research are to study the dependence on the transformation
stress, and the resistance of martensite detwinning to multiaxial states of
stress. Special emphasis will be given to biaxial states of stress where
inhomogeneous deformations, which are inherently associated with the
instability, occur. ***
