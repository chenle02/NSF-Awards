The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia workshop is to bring leading
geographers together to examine and compare land use and environmental
degradation in both countries. Results of the workshop should help determine
spatial extent and variations in environmental degradation and may prove useful
in understanding effects on public health and economic productivity.
Participants will also examine related governance and policy concerns along with
issues of relevant research methodology and data adequacy for future joint
efforts. This cooperative geography workshop fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
