HRD 03-28144&lt;br/&gt;The Women in Engineering Program (WEP) at Penna. State
University involves women participants across a broad range of points in career
development. This is a very strong nomination; the panelists indicated that it
targets well what a mentoring program should be. Notably, 25% of participants
are women of color. WEP has identified barriers to women in academic engineering
programs and strategies/methods to overcome them. Women in engineering are
retained at a high rate (60-70% at the end of sophomore year). WEP provides
mentors for women early in their collegiate experience. It is a program with a
variety of activities, and involves one-on-one mentoring and team leadership
activities. WEP has a good success rate with proven results and is supported by
the University. Other programs on campus are using the WEP orientation component
as a model and other universities are adapting the overall WEP as a model.
