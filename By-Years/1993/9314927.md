9314927 Dorn Pilot results from glacial moraines in the southwestern United
States demonstrate that it is possible to obtain 14C ages from conventional
radiocarbon measurements on disseminated organic extracted from the matrix of
moraines. Two moraines that were previously mapped as 'late Wisconsin', based on
moraine morphology, morphostratigraphic positioin, soils and weathering
characteristics, yielded conventional radiocarbon ages that fall within 'state
2' of the marine oxygen isotope chronology. One mapped as 'early Wisconsin'
yielded an infinite 14C ages could expand rapidly. this is potentially
dangerous, because there are a number of confounding factors that could produce
misleading ages. The objective of this proposal is to assess if this method is
subject to confounding factors, by sampling tills at sites with independent age
control.
