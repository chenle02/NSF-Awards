This award supports participation of eleven US scientists in a joint seminar
with Taiwan on phytochemical ecology (to include allelochemicals, mycotoxins,
and insect pheromones and allomones) and its relevance to agriculture and human
health. Plant allelochemicals are secondary plant metabolites that play an
important role in plant-plant, plant-microorganism, and plant-insect
interaction, both beneficially and detrimentally. Allelopathic chemicals also
act as important ecological factors which influence plant dominance, succession,
climax vegetation, and crop productivity. Mycotoxins, another focus of this
conference, are a variety of highly toxic, secondary metabolites produced by
fungi. Mycotoxins have been recognized as an important class of hazardous
substances in the human food chain. Pheromones are semiochemicals produced by an
animal to communicate with another individual of the same species. These
compounds play a significant role in agriculture as population regulators. This
symposium will discuss research in these areas and investigate opportunities for
collaborative research.
