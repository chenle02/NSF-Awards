This award will be used for a new state-of-the-art Nikon microscope with
transmitted-reflected light, fluorenscence, phase contrast and Nomarski
capabilities for geologic and microbiologic studies. The scope will also have
high-resolution color and black and white digital cameras, and an advanced image
analyses system that will allow documentation and analyses of spatially co-
registered petrographic and microbiological observaions. Cost share provided by
UW is about 14%. The new scope is needed for research focused on the linkages
among geological and microbiological processes within submarine environments.
Fundamental to understanding these complex systems is the ability to make
detailed, integrated, microbiological observations in the context of the rocks
that host these unique communities.
