Many cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce a yellow pigment in the sheaths or
capsules surrounding their cells when exposed to high intensity sunlight. The
goal of this project is to determine the chemical nature of this pigment, and to
assess its effectiveness in protecting these organisms from the harmful effects
of short wave solar radiation, in particular, ultra- violet radiation. The
experiments will use laboratory cultures and will determine the various effects
of normal and enhanced levels of ultra-violet radiation on photosynthesis,
growth , and survival, with and without the protective pigment. This research is
particularly relevant because stratospheric ozone depletion may result in
significantly greater levels of ultra-violet radiation. It is important to
understand all the "strategies" employed by living organisms to protect against
this potentially damaging radiation. Shielding by sheath pigments in
cyanobacteria may represent one of the earliest and most primitive adaptations
to excess light and short-wave radiation.
