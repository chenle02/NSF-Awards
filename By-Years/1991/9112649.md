This research evaluates image motion analysis using a model- fitting estimator
developed by the Principal Investigator. This estimator, which fits the unknown
likelihood function with a function selected from a multi-scale family of model
likelihood functions, is claimed to be highly robust, less dependent on initial
guesses, and resistant to data confusion in multi-object tracking. The method
has so far been tested with simulated data; tests would be expanded to real data
from both laboratory and outdoor scenes, including mixed modalities with range
and visual images.
