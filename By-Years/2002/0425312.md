Coral reefs have been identified as some of the most threatened marine
ecosystems globally, ones whose management depends critically on scientific
understanding. Flow-controlled mass transfer between corals and the fluid around
them plays a key role in determining how corals live, grow, reproduce and die.
The investigators will create a comprehensive physiochemical model of a given
coral, i.e. a virtual coral, to examine the morphological plasticity in
branching corals by determining changes in calcification rates driven by changes
in mass transfer. The model will include detailed representations of flow and
mass transfer, given the geometry of the coral, light field incident on the
coral and the internal biochemistry of the polyps and zooxanthellae. Beyond
examining the connection between morphological plasticity and flow, the model
should also be capable of testing hypotheses relating flow, changes in nutrient,
light level, or temperature to a wide range of responses including bleaching.
The experiments and computations proposed by the researchers will provide a
comprehensive model of corals at the level of an individual colony. The model
will provide a valuable means for testing hypotheses on the interactions between
corals and their environment.
