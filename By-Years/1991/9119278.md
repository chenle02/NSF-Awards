This grant will support continued operation of the Fly's Eye (FE I and FE II)
detectors by the University of Utah. The research addressed concerns the
fundamental questions surrounding the very highest energy cosmic rays which
enter Earth's atmosphere from space. The nature, source and energy of these rays
are examined by FE I and FE II situated at Dugway, Utah approximately 90 miles
from Salt Lake City, by measuring the minute amounts of light emitted by
nitrogen in the air as cosmic ray fragments pass through. Nitrogen fluorescence
produced in cosmic ray showers is focussed by two arrays of mirrors (FE I and FE
II, respectively) onto photomultiplier tubes. Data are recorded electronically,
and shower track directions are reconstructed from position and timing
information by off line computer analysis. Shower shape, direction and size are
used to determine the nature, origin and energy of the primary cosmic radiation.
