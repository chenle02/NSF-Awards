&lt;br/&gt;Vidale&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0119507&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pls propose to
hold a Gordon Research Conference on the Interior of the Earth from June 10-15,
2001 at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. As discussed in
detail in the proposal, the conference is being held to bring together an
interdisciplinary group of experts to discuss major unanswered questions about
the composition, structure and dynamics of the Earth's interior. Funds will be
used to cover travel and accommodations to enhance participation of student and
early-career scientists. It is expected that a broad and interdisciplinary
cross-section of researchers from academia, government labs, and the broad
international community will participate in the conference. &lt;br/&gt;
