This award provides funds for a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site in
Cognitive Science at Carlton College. The project provides for a ten week summer
research experience for eight undergraduates. Students will work individually
with faculty collaborators designing and executing different research projects.
Weekly seminars will involve discussion of broader issues relevant to the
research projects and to cognitive science more generally. Issues of ethics in
research design will be stressed. The common theme of the project is `Acquiring,
Organizing, and Using Knowledge.` Individual projects include an investigation
of self-verification processes, the application of PROLOG programming in
knowledge representation, a study of real-life decision making, an investigation
of the processes used in racial stereotyping, and a survey of how students
acquire full understanding of biological principals. This award contributes to
the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
science through active undergraduate research experiences.
