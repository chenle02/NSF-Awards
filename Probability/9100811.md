The principal investigator will work in several areas of probability theory,
including Brownian motion and random walk. Four specific problems are addressed:
the porosity of certain sets associated with a Brownian motion, weak and strong
limit theorems for trimmed sums, the overshoot of d-dimensional random walk, and
the expected lifetime of Brownian h-paths. The principal investigator will work
in several areas of probability theory, including Brownian motion and random
walk. The investigators previous work has been in the classical area of
probability theory, limit theorems. Limit theorems are used both in statistics
and in other areas of probability, here in random walk. Questions concern the
long run behavior of the sums of random quantities.
