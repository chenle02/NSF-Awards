9616245 Blidberg Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology has matured to
the point where it offers ocean scientists a solution to the data collection
problem: intelligent autonomous mobile platforms. In order to realize the full
potential of such sensor platforms, however, some basic AUV research and
development must be undertaken. This project is designed to address a
fundamental "dual" need currently experienced by AUV researchers. One aspect of
that need can be expressed as the lack of an underlying description of the
behaviors necessary for intelligent mobile autonomy. The other aspect of this
need is the lack of a good implementation environment for candidates to this set
of behaviors for autonomy. The goal of this project is to develop that
description, and to develop a set of tools with which to evaluate the
description. There are, therefore, two objectives to pursue: (1) answer the
question "what are the required behaviors for a truly autonomous underwater
mobile agent?" and (2) develop the tools necessary to validate candidate
behavior sets. ***
