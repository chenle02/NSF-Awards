The Chemistry Department at Appalachian State University has recently acquired
an ion trap mass spectrometer and a microcomputer system which when interfaced
with a gas chromatograph affords undergraduate students opportunities to expand
their experience with modern instrumentation. Student use of this system is an
integral part of a course in natural products chemistry, and one devoted to the
use of computerized instrumentation. In addition, the instrument is used in
introductory courses as a lecture demonstration tool and as a qualitative and
quantitative tool in the organic chemistry laboratory.
