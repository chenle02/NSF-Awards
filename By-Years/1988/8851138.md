The American Museum of Natural History proposes to design and build a new
permanent 9,000-square-foot Hall of Human Biology and Evolution over a three-
year period. The exhibit is to start out with human biology and then move
smoothly to human evolution and the fossil record and other evidences of early
humans. The new exhibit will range from the molecular/genetic level to the
emergence of human beings, and will include archeological excavations and
findings, reconstruction and discussion of humanoids, early human evolution,
human structure and function, and human diversity. In addition to stimulating
the interests of visitors (2.7 million in 1986-87) in human biology and
evolution through the use of traditional and interactive technology, the new
exhibit program will provide curriculum supplement for elementary and high
school classes and teacher-training guides and workshops to assist in the
integration of the exhibition materials into classroom studies. The primary
educational goal is to give the widest possible audience a concrete sense of
where and how the human animal fits in the natural world through examination of
the traits that we share with all creatures and those that are peculiar to
humans. The exhibit promises further contribution by bridging the current
exhibits on animal life and those on the rich ethnological collections on the
diversity of human cultures. NSF dollars are to cover the costs only of
planning, building and evaluating the exhibit, with no funds for staff.
