The CombinaTexas 2018 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, College
Station, Texas, on February 10-11, 2018. The conference will take place on
Saturday and Sunday to make it easy for researchers to attend, and will feature
six fifty-minute plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks, each of
twenty minutes long. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to enhance
the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas and the
surrounding states, increase communication between mathematicians of the region,
and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent
developments in the field of Combinatorics. Ever since Texas A&M University
hosted the first conference in 2000, it has been held almost every year at
different institutions in the South Central United States. CombinaTexas 2018 is
the seventeenth conference in this series. About 50 participants are anticipated
in 2018, with about 20 contributed talks in parallel sessions. The conference
will be publicized using distribution lists and on related conference websites
(a conference website is at http://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/,
including titles and abstracts of the speakers).

The conference will feature a broad selection of combinatorial research.
Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open
discussions to explore unsolved problem in the field. The confirmed plenary
speakers are Professor Matthias Beck (San Francisco State University), Professor
Matthew Kahle (Ohio State University), Professor Caroline Klivans (Brown
University), Professor Kyungyong Lee (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), Professor
Isabella Novik (University of Washington), and Professor Pavlo Pylyavskyy
(University of Minnesota).
