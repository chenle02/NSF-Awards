With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Richmond will acquire a liquid
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (LC/MS). This equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including a) characterization of small molecules prepared in
organic, inorganic, and organometallic synthetic studies; and b) structure
elucidation of small- to medium-sized biomolecules in biochemical studies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection
(LC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis
of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific
research at the University of Richmond, a primarily undergraduate institution.
These studies will have a solid impact in the area of synthetic chemistry and
biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
