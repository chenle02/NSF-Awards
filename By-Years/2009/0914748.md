CIF: Small: Digital Mitigation of Spurious Tones in Fractional-N
PLLs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fractional-N phase locked loops (PLLs) are critical
components in most modern wireless communication systems including cellular
telephones and wireless local area networks. Unfortunately, the error introduced
by conventional PLLs contains period disturbances referred to as spurious tones,
which only can be suppressed sufficiently for typical wireless applications with
techniques that increase power consumption and cost. Furthermore, these
techniques become less effective as integrated circuit (IC) technology continues
to scale to smaller dimensions. Therefore, the spurious tone problem negatively
affects power consumption, cost, and manufacturability of wireless communication
systems, and the problem gets worse as IC technology scales with Moore?s
Law.&lt;br/&gt;The ÄÓ modulator in a conventional PLL is the fundamental cause
of spurious tones. The spurious tones are induced when the ÄÓ modulator?s
quantization noise is subjected to nonlinearity from non-ideal circuit behavior
in the PLL. The goal of this research is to develop a ÄÓ modulator replacement,
called a successive requantizer, that avoids this problem. The successive
requantizer has a different principle of operation than a ÄÓ modulator and its
quantization noise is much less susceptible to nonlinearity-induced spurious
tones. The research tasks are 1) to further develop the theory underlying
successive requantizers to improve their performance, 2) to investigate how PLLs
can be optimized at the circuit level to take advantage of the reduced
sensitivity to nonlinear distortion offered by successive requantizers, and 3)
to develop a proof-of-concept fractional-N PLL IC enabled by the theoretical
results of the project that is compliant with a demanding wireless standard such
as IEEE 802.16 and exceeds the present state of the art in terms of minimizing
power consumption and circuit area.&lt;br/&gt;
