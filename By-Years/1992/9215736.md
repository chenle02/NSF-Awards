It is widely believed that most of the mass in our Galaxy lies in one or more
unseen "dark" components. In the absence of direct detection, the distribution
of dark matter can be mapped by observing its gravitational effects on suitably
chosen tracers of the Milky Way's potential energy. Observations of two
different tracers, Cepheid variable stars and K dwarfs, will be used to
determine (a) the distance from the Sun to the center of the Galaxy, (b) the
deviation from axisymmetry of the closed orbits passing near the Sun, and (c)
the mass surface density of the disk of the Galaxy at the Sun's position. The
deviation from axisymmetry will be obtained by way of a search for new Cepheids
toward galactic longitude l = 60 degrees, complementing a recent successful
search carried out toward l = 300 degrees. Followup photometry will be obtained
in the near infrared at 1.2, 1.6, and 2.2 microns, where the effects of
interstellar extinction are substantially reduced.
