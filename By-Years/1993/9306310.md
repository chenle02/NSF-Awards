Athanas Field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices represent a relatively new
technology that provides a means of implementing hardware functionality which
can be modified under software control. When integrated into a computing
platform these devices can provide direct hardware execution for operations that
have been conventionally evaluated using software. The purpose of this workshop
is to assess the current state of FPGA computing and establish goals for further
development of reconfigurable processing platforms.
