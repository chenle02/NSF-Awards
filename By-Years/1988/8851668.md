A new laboratory course in polymer chemistry is being introduced with the
acquisition of a thermal analysis system for differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The equipment is also being used in
five undergraduate courses covering analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical
chemistry. The equipment is being utilized to expand the offerings in
undergraduate research. Sophomore, junior, and senior students are studying the
properties, structure, and reactions of a variety of compounds using thermal
analysis as a probe. The thermal analysis instrumentation provides a dual
benefit in improving the course offerings and updating the instrument holdings
to enable the characterization of polymers. Instruction in polymer chemistry in
the undergraduate curriculum has been neglected in many institutions. With the
thermal analysis system with DSC and TGA capabilities new experiments can be
introduced throughout the curriculum meeting the recommendations of the
Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society in this
important area. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
