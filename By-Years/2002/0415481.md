Effective prediction of prolonged dry or wet periods, or delays in the onset of
summer rains in northern Africa on regional space scales and intraseasonal to
interannual timescales would improve resource management and disaster
preparation. For this, a better fundamental understanding of the cycle of
rainfall must be achieved. The objectives of this research project are an
improved understanding of the physical processes that lead to the observed
seasonal evolution of rainy seasons over northern Africa and their association
with interannual variations. The focus is on the West African monsoon-type
system and on the drought-prone regions of East Africa. Observations, reanalysis
data and regional numerical modeling will be used to identify the factors in the
forcing or the internal regional climate system that explain what drives the
rainfall season. An undergraduate student, graduate students and a post-doctoral
researcher will participate in the research.
