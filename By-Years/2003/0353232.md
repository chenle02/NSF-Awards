The 10th International Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS
'04) is an important international conference covering all the major topics at
the interface between particle physics, string theory and cosmology . There will
be a mixture of talks in all three areas, and especially on the interfaces such
as SUSY/strings, dark matter string and brane cosmology. The results of the
latest experiments in particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics will be
presented as well as talks on future experiments and detectors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The funds will be used to pay for U.S. Graduate student
participation as well for several of the U.S. speakers. The lectures will be
published.. The school will be held at the facilities of the Physics Department
of Northeastern University. &lt;br/&gt;
