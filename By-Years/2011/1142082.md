Krill, Euphausia superba, is a keystone species in the Antarctic ecosystem and
provides the trophic link between microscopic plankton and charismatic megafauna
such as penguins and whales. Recent evidence suggests krill may not be
exclusively planktonivorous, which introduces the potential of new pathways of
carbon flux through krill based ecosystems. A change in our view of krill from
one of being herbivores to omnivores opens up several questions.

Climate induced change in the extent, thickness and duration of overlying sea
ice coverage is expected to change the prey fields available to krill, and to
have subsequent effects on the suite of predators supported by krill. The nature
of this benthic prey?krill link, which may be crucial in those parts of the
seasonal cycle other than the well studied spring bloom, is yet to be
determined. DNA techniques will be used to identify and quantify the prey
organisms.

This project will measure the in situ feeding ecology and behavior of krill and,
ultimately, the success of this key species. An overall goal is to investigate
seasonal changes in Euphausia superba in-situ feeding and swimming behavior in
the Wilhelmina Bay region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) area, known
to be a region of changing climate. Understanding the biological impacts of
climate change is important to societal and economic goals. The project
scientists will additionally team with a marine and environmental reporting
group to design presentations for an annual journalist meeting.
