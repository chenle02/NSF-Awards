The objective of this EAGER proposal is to design, theoretically model, and
experimentally demonstrate a novel class of large-area ultra-thin metasurfaces
based on intersubband polaritons with giant nonlinear optical response, orders
of magnitude larger than any device reported so far in the scientific
literature. Proof-of-concept demonstration efforts will focus on development
highly-efficient second harmonic generation mirrors in the mid-infrared regime.
The proposed concept is, however, much broader and can be readily extended to
other nonlinear optical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The proposed
research will introduce novel concepts in nonlinear optics and in metamaterial
technology. For the first time, nonlinear response of intersubband excitations
strongly coupled to optical modes in metal-dielectric-metal microcavities will
be investigated. Already giant intersubband optical nonlinearities in coupled-
quantum-wells systems can be further boosted by coupling intersubband
transitions with ad-hoc engineered resonant modes in metal-dielectric-metal
metamaterial cavities. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research
combines elements of metamaterial theory, optoelectronics, nonlinear optics, and
semiconductor physics. This combination offers a rich, interdisciplinary
educational environment for graduate and undergraduate students. Knowledge and
techniques developed during our research efforts will be incorporated into
focused graduate-level courses currently taught by the PI and Co-PI. The
metasurfaces developed in this project are expected to find numerous industrial
applications. The PI will continue his annual participation in the NNIN REU
program with students involved in the proposed research and involve the co-PI in
this effort. At the K-12 level, PI and co-PI will collaborate with NSF-sponsored
UTeachEngineering program.
