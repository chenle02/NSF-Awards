Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are critically important in
maintaining a healthy pipeline of domestic graduate students in computer science
and related fields. These early research experiences are often formative for
their participants, giving them both an understanding of the research enterprise
and the confidence required to consider a research career. In addition, REUs
provide valuable skills and long-term mentoring relationships that are likely to
contribute to personal satisfaction and success in graduate school. The current
demand for REU opportunities exceeds the supply. The goal of this proposal is to
increase the supply of REU opportunities by offering encouragement, resources,
and support to research-active faculty members. This award will fund four short
workshops on undergraduate research at major research conferences over the next
two years. The conferences will be chosen to represent a broad cross section of
areas covered by the CISE Directorate.
