The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance a technology for converting wind
energy into electrical power. Wind turbines need massive support structures,
generate noise, require ongoing maintenance, and negatively impact some
wildlife. This project will advance a method to harvest the windâ€™s energy using
novel transformers requiring no moving components. Current estimates indicate
that this approach to electrical power generation would require less
maintenance, lower costs, and have lower environmental impact.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will advance electrostatic
generation of wind power. The proposed design of the power generator creates
negative air ions by coronal emission. As the wind carries negative ions away
from the power generator, the latter is left with net positive charge and a
large positive voltage relative to the ground. The proposed project will explore
the trade space of wind-to-electricity transformers at
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
