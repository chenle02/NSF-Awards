Support is sought for travel and registration fees for invited speakers,
undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, and under-represented,
female and junior faculty to attend and present at the Symposium BI1: Today
Teaching and Learning in Materials Science: Challenges and Advances at the Fall
Materials Research Society (MRS) National Meeting in Boston, MA, November 28-30,
2016. Throughout the two-days oral and poster sessions and discussions held in
this symposium, the focus will be on improving the efficacy of undergraduate and
graduate student education in materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
tutorial will encourage the participation of graduate students, postdoc
researchers, and junior faculty, especially from the under-represented groups.
The topics addressed in this Symposium, namely: Curriculum and Course
Development; Active Learning and Student Engagement; Research Based Teaching
Initiatives and Active Learning Oral; Use of Computers; Data, Analysis and
Simulations; Ethics, Diversity and Global Issues; Outreach; Challenging
Approaches to Instruction; Laboratory: hands-on Formats are very relevant and
require major efforts to insure progress in this critical field. MRS meetings
provide an ideal setting for such interchange because of its healthy melding of
all aspects of STEM research and education.
