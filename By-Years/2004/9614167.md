9614167 Pachavis The symposium OElectrochemical Synthesis and Modification of
MaterialsO is part of the Materials Research Society meeting held in Boston, MA,
December 2-6, 1996. It is the aim of the symposium to bring together
investigators from different communities to promote discussion of new
opportunities and applications for electrochemical synthesis in materials
science, characterization of growth processes and instabilities, and surface
modification. Over the past ten years a variety of electrochemical processes
have been developed for the synthesis of novel materials and structures. In
addition, the ability to characterize the solid/liquid interface has improved
with the development of various in-situ probes. It is now possible to examine
surface phenomena with atomic resolution allowing detailed mechanistic analysis
of composition and structure. The NSF funding supports participation of student
travel grants and partial travel support for experts in the field. %%% The
trends discussed above are being accelerated by the increased use of
electrochemical methods in commercial applications. This Materials Research
Society meeting is a unique forum for exploring future opportunities in
electrochemical synthesis. ***
