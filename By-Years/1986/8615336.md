The tailoring of materials to improve performance and reduce manufacturing cost
is applicable to a wide range of products from cars to civil engineering
structures to jet engines. However, the efficient utilization of tailored
materials requires the design integration of several disciplines. This
integration of the design process is addressed by this research. The proposed
research is focussed on integrating the processes of aerodynamic and structural
designs as a prototype for design integration. Two methods will be explored;
simultaneous analysis and optimization, which seeks to optimize the combined
equations for structures and for aerodynamics, and second, partial-decoupling,
which optimizes each part separately and fits them together through a modally
reduced number of cross-sensitivity derivatives. It is expected that the
research will lead to improved and more efficient techniques for multi-
disciplinary design optimization. Although aircraft structural-aerodynamic
optimization is considered here, the mathematical and computer techniques have a
wider application and importance to future inter-disciplinary designs. The
principal investigators have a good reputation in the area of optimization
techniques and structural mechanics.
