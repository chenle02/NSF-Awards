This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be used to support
research projects in the department of statistics at Carnegie- Mellon
University, including Images Generated by Random Affine Maps; Statistical
Modelling of Random Sets; Graphical Analysis of Parallel Algorithms; and
Bayesian Methods for Image Reconstruction.
