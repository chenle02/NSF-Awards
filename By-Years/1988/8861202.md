This Phase I SBIR award is to explore the feasibility of separating isotopes,
in this case C12 and C13, based on possible differences in the surface activity
of compounds containing these atoms. The difference results in different
concentrations in droplets produced by bursting bubbles rising through liquid
solutions. The technique is extremely simple and, if a suitable separation is
achieved, could be adapted readily to a multistaged process for the separation
of isotopes.
