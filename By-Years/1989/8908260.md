The researcher will investigate the acquisition of general theory of causality
by observing examples of events and their consequences. A theory of causality is
information about the principles that lead one to believe that an action has a
necessary consequence. For example, people tend to select a cause which is close
in space and time to an effect. The work builds on prior implementation of a
computer model which uses a theory of causality as an explicit bias to
facilitate the acquisition of a theory of causation (i.e., inference rules
encode knowledge of the effect of actions, such as "glass objects break when
struck with sufficient force."). The new work is an investigation of
computational models for acquiring these general principles from examples. Input
to the learning program will consists of a temporal sequence of propositions
representing the states of the world. The input representation will be
constructed by simulation (to allow systematic experimentation by varying
parameters such as the amount of noise in the data) and by hand coding examples
of causal changes from children's introductory science texts (to insure that the
learning program will be able to account for a wide variety of common causal
relationships).
