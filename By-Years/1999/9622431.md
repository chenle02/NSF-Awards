9622431 Prakash A study will be made of the high speed shear deformation of
surfaces under varying normal pressures and at various temperatures. From the
shear deformation behavior the frictional forces will be determined and it is
intended to eventually build a constitutive model for interfacial friction. Two
different experiments will be performed to obtain complementary data. One uses a
conventional split Hopkinson bar to simulate rubbing of surfaces in contact
under varying normal stress. The other uses a modified high speed impact
apparatus where two parallel plates are impacted at high speed. By varying the
speed of impact and the inclination of the plates, both normal forces and
surface traction forces can be varied. Tangential displacements are measured
optically and are used to with one-dimensional wave theory to derive variations
of shear stress and slip velocity with time. ***
