This model project is designed to encourage women, minorities and the disabled
to enter careers in science and mathematics teaching at the precollege level.
The project will establish a Career Ladder model which identifies critical high
school and college entry points into secondary school science teaching careers
for minorities, women and the disabled. The model includes recruiting,
mentoring, training, and professional employment for the target population. The
first activity is a high school internship component involving ten hours of
internship each week for one semester for selected members of the target groups.
The second activity is the College Explainer component in which, at the New York
Hall of Science, local undergraduates from the target groups are prepared to:
orient school groups, offer workshops and floor demonstrations to families and
school groups, deliver outreach programs to school and community groups, and
represent the Hall at national conferences and professional meetings. Explainers
work for up to 20 hours a week. Explainers are selected for their interpersonal
skills and ability to understand and communicate science. The Explainer role
will provide opportunities for interaction with scientists and technologists,
politicians, and people of all ages and walks of life. In the third activity,
Explainers, in their junior year enroll in a formal academic program leading to
certification as secondary science teachers. The Hall of Science, Queens
College, area school districts, and the New York City Board of Education are
collaborators in this activity. In the fourth activity students, upon graduation
from the pre-service program, are eligible for secondary science teaching
positions. The personnel division of the New York City Board of Education and
local school districts will ensure employment in city schools.
