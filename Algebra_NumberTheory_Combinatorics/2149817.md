This project will establish a new framework that connects the physics of certain
two-dimensional physical systems, called conformal field theories (CFTs), with
the mathematics of certain well-studied algebraic objects, called quantum
groups. Establishing such a connection will greatly advance our understanding of
both subjects, and provide novel tools for studying two-dimensional CFTs. In
implementing this project, new research opportunities will be created for
undergraduates and early graduate students. These research opportunities will be
supported by grant funding. The PI will also provide direct support for
preexisting programs which seek to increase access to mathematics among women
and underrepresented minorities.

In more detail, one component of the project is to find an equivalence of
(ribbon tensor) categories between the representation category of the so-called
triplet vertex algebra, and the representation category of small quantum SL(2).
Such an equivalence was conjectured by mathematical physicists in the
mid-2000?s, and some explicit progress has been made towards its resolution in
recent works of the PI and others. A positive resolution to this conjecture will
provide the first direct link between logarithmic CFTs and quantum groups, a
phenomenon which should be endemic among the most fundamental classes of
logarithmic CFTs. A second component of the project is the computation of the
Balmer spectrum for small quantum groups associated to arbitrary simple
algebraic groups. This computation will employ and establish new links between
support theory and geometric representation theory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
