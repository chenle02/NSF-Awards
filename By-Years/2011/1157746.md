Through this planning visit, Prof. David Anastasio of Lehigh University and
colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania will initiate cooperative research
with Spanish partners to examine tectonically driven landscape evolution at the
active African-Eurasian convergent plate boundary, an area of slow tectonic
activity. The counterpart, Prof. Juan Soto, with the Department of Geodynamics
at the University of Granada has established expertise in geologic and
geophysical knowledge of the Betic Cordillera of southern Spain, where a
workshop and exploratory fieldwork will take place. The U.S. team's strengths in
structural geology, paleomagnetism, process geomorphology, geodesy and
analytical techniques complement the Spanish partners' deep knowledge of the
Beltic-Rif field geology and data. Together, their goal is to refine plans for a
study of the key processes that underlie seismic hazards and coastal uplift
characteristic of the Betic Cordillera, where regional crustal strains are
poorly qualified but offer an example of synonvergent extension and continental
growth associated with continental collision and subduction slab rollback.
Results from this collaboration will improve our fundamental understanding of
continental collision and tectonic processes as well as the geologic hazards
associated with living on an active plate margin.

This research activity fulfills the program objective of advancing basic
knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to share research
resources and plan beneficial projects in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence. Broader impacts include early career international research
experience for participating U.S. graduate students, development of a new
international collaboration, and a better understanding of seismic hazards in a
densely populated region. If successful, the project will contribute to our
understanding of the linkage between surface process with subduction zone
processes.
