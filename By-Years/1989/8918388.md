The Chicago group is concerned with a broad range of research in theoretical
gravitational physics. The areas of classical general relativity which will be
investigated include further studies of the "two-center" problem, the closed
universe recollapse conjecture, generalizations of the notion of total mass, and
the equations of relativistic dissipative fluids. Issues to be studied which are
closely related to classical general relativity include a general analysis of
hyperbolic systems of equations and an investigation of possible new types of
gauge theories. Research in quantum gravitational physics will continue, with
research planned on certain topics in quantum field theory in curved spacetime,
as well as in quantum cosmology and canonical quantum gravity.
