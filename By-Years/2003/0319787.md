This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will test the
feasibility of using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a non-linear, topology-
preserving pattern recognition technique, in the design of small molecules with
biological activity. Due to a serious unmet need for computer-based tools that
can accurately predict early development issues such as potency, safety, and
efficacy of drug candidates, the pharmaceutical industry currently relies almost
exclusively upon expensive prototyping to evaluate candidates. Many drug
candidates fail only after costly pharmaceutics development and/or clinical
trials, limiting the ability of drug companies to address anything beyond the
most profitable markets. The early stage technology proposed in this Phase I
project will significantly advance the state-of-the-art of drug design by
addressing one of the major problems with which current computer-aided drug
design has long struggled: how to model the non-linear feature-target
relationships with dependent features commonly associated with biological
systems.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of drug discovery and
development. The innovative software to be developed through this project will
allow the drug companies to computationally evaluate a vast number of drug
candidates, resulting in more candidates being investigated and more effective
drugs discovered.
