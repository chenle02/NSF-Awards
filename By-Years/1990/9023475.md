This study investigates whether work conditions influence emp- loyer continuity
among women following childbirth. Certain work conditions are hypothesized to
improve continuity rates. Inter- views with 300 expectant women in northern
Indiana ask their perceptions of employment conditions, job factors in their
plans for work after the birth, and effects of organizational charac- teristics
on the provision and use of family benefits for emp- loyed women. Results will
document obstacles to work following childbirth among women who originally
planned to return, and will tell what employment practices maximize retention
and job satis- faction among mothers.
