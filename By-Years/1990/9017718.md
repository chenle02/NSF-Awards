Available data show that the anorthositic rocks of the Nain Plutonic Suite carry
Sr and Nd isotopic enrichments, which are due either to crustal assimilation or
to derivation of parent magmas from enriched mantle sources. These conflicting
hypotheses can be tested by rare-earth element (REE) and Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic
studies of available samples from country rocks and contact zones of the
plutonic suite, as well as better characterization of the interiors of plutons.
Combined with new Pb isotopic data from the Kiglapait Intrusion, the studies
will furnish a definitive test of contamination versus source enrichment.
Tectonic and thermal history of the region before, during, and after the
anorthosite episode will also be illuminated by comprehensive study of mineral
closure ages by the argon-argon method.
