The Archean rocks of West Greenland represent some of the best- exposed, best-
studied, oldest rocks known and thus constitute a prime target for crustal
reflection studies. This grant will support a crustal reflection study across
the oldest Archean deformation zone. This will be based on vertical-incidence
marine reflection profiling across the strike of Archean structures along the
coast and wide-angle recording of the marine air guns on land. The ship will
also traverse several fjords firing the air guns to also obtain 1000 km if
vertical-incidence reflection data and extensive wide angle recording to give a
very extensive data set. The vertical incidence data will produce structural
detail and the wide-angle data will give crustal velocity profiles. The research
is a cooperative project between Norwegian, Danish, and U.S. scientists.
Problems to be attacked by this research include: 1) continuation of the
deformation zone to depth; 2) crustal shortening and mode of deformation, 3)
role of volatiles in the deep crust, 4) change in Moho depth, 5) Archean crustal
development, 6) nature of deep crust under granulites, and 7) continuation of
supracrustal rocks to depth.
