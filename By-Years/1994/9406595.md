9406595 JAROSZ Determination of the total costs of agricultural production
traditionally has been difficult because considerable labor contributed by women
working on farms has not been compensated or has been reimbursed at very low
wages. As women have increased their participation in non-farm labor markets and
as agricultural industries have changed in recent decades, the role of women in
farm production has been transformed, but little scholarly attention has been
given to the form and implications of those changes. This doctoral dissertation
research project will investigate changes in the agricultural work of women in
the fresh apple industries of Washington state. Apple production and processing
has become more labor intensive and more capital intensive over the last half
century. Special attention in this project will be given to identifying
differences in the responses of women in different ethnic groups, socioeconomic
classes, and age cohorts to changes in the industry. These differences will be
identified through analyses of census data and a mail survey of women working in
north central Washington. More detailed information will be obtained through
intensive interviews and focus-group discussions of both Chicana and Anglo
working women. In order to ascertain whether preliminary conclusions are valid,
project findings will be discussed at community-based workshops. This project
will provide new insights into the impacts of technological and organizational
change on workers employed by agricultural businesses. This case study of female
workers in the Washington apple industry will employ a complementary set of
research methods to contribute new empirical knowledge about social change, with
special emphases placed on the roles of gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic
class. As a doctoral dissertation research improvement award, this award also
will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong
independent research ca reer.
