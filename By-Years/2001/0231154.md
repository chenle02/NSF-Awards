This project is creating materials to promote conceptual development for
calculus students, by helping instructors to raise the visibility of the key
concepts, to stimulate student peer-to-peer discussion of concepts, and to
connect calculus concepts to what students know and understand about their
world. In addition to creating materials to enhance student learning, the
project is investigating the hypothesis that tapping into mathematicians'
emphasis on conceptual understanding, and their beliefs about how mathematical
understanding is built, can motivate faculty to experiment with new methods and
approaches to enhance student learning. In this case the approach is modeled
after Mazur's reformation of introductory physics course through the use of
ConcepTests that actively engage students to think about, discuss, and clarify
their understanding of basic physical concepts. Student peer-teaching is also
featured.
