This is an award to continue an NSF-REU site in Computational and Information
Sciences and Engineering at Caltech. Based upon the success of last years'
program much enthusiasm has been expressed by the faculty and by the students.
The 1989 program is aimed at encouraging 8 students to participate in a
"player/coach" relationship with faculty who are interested in neural networks
and parallel computing. Faculty contacts at other colleges will be used to
encourage women and underrepresented minorities to participate. In addition to
the research, other opportunities for professional and personal growth will be
made available; these include "overview" seminars in other fields, informal
lunches and talks with the math faculty, and social events. Students will be
recruited from several of the 40 local colleges who have underrepresented
minority students. Special efforts will be aimed at encouraging students from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities to participate.
