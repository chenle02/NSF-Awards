CMS-9622645 Ernian Pan University of Colorado A two-dimensional coupled boundary
element and edge function method (BEM/EFM) is proposed for the first time to
study rock fracture propagation problems. The most outstanding features of this
combination are its ability to handle complex crack geometries and to simulate
crack propagation without discretization along crack surfaces. In addition, any
kind of rock anisotropy can be handled and the effect of a gravity body force
will also be considered.
