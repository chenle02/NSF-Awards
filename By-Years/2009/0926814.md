Where should ambulances be placed to minimize the time required to reach calls
for help? Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers increasingly rely on
sophisticated operations research (OR) models for such ambulance-deployment
questions. These models depend on reliable forecasts of call-arrival rates over
different parts of a city and at different times. Unfortunately, current
forecasting methods are not very effective, and result in poor inputs to the OR
models. This can lead to poor deployment decisions and thereby inflated response
times for calls. The first part of this research will investigate advanced
statistical methods for better estimating these arrival rates. The OR models
also rely on accurate representations of travel times on road networks. Travel-
time estimation is also in its infancy, and still does not effectively use the
plethora of GPS data that ambulances accumulate. The second part of this
research will investigate advanced statistical methods for better estimating
travel times on road networks.

The key issue is that there is a lack of guiding theory to help software
developers and EMS providers determine how to best use their available data to
make quality decisions. If successful, this research will improve this
lamentable situation, resulting in more effective representations of arrival
rates and travel times that are the key determinant in ambulance-deployment
decisions. The outcome for society is that ambulance deployment decisions will
be more effective, leading to reduced response times for calls, with the
associated medical benefits. In addition, we will advance the state of the art
in statistical methods for complex engineering problems, and raise the profile
of advanced statistical methodology in the operations research arena, as well as
the profile of operations research problems within the statistical community.
