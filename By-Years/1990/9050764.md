A computer-aided test station, including bust test equipment (power supplies,
signal generator, digital oscilloscope, multimeters, switching unit), a
microcomputer controller and appropriate software will be established for the
testing of thick and thin film hybrid circuits. The computer and test equipment
will add major capabilities not now available in the senior-level hybrid circuit
program. The thick film technology program at Drexel serves approximately 60
students per year. The Thick Film Laboratory serves as a circuit prototyping
facility where students work in design groups of 4 to 6 to fabricate circuits of
their own design. All fabrication processes are done in-house by the students.
The principal purpose of the equipment in this proposal will be the
automatically test the functionality of the designed circuits, with the
capability of handling circuits will serve as teaching examples for learning
test programming techniques as well as illustrating basic hybrid circuit
concepts. The equipment will also be used as a design station for circuit layout
and simulation.
