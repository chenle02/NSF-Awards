The Mathematics REU at UConn will involve a small group of students,
approximately 9 per year, in research on problems from several active areas of
mathematics and mathematics education. In pure mathematics typical projects will
involve using computational tools or hands-on combinatorial arguments to
investigate properties of basic examples that are expected to illuminate some
larger part of the theory. Specific projects will vary from year to year, and
may include problems from algebraic geometry, stochastic processes, analysis on
fractals and disordered spaces, and exotic metric geometries. The projects in
mathematics education will vary depending on student interest; specific topics
that are available include research on key questions about the content-knowledge
needed for effective teaching and how it can be translated into effective
pedagogy, and methods for evaluating the use of instructional technology in
large classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the REU is to contribute to
the development of human resources in mathematics and mathematics education by
engaging a diverse group of undergraduates from primarily non-PhD granting
institutions in research that yields publishable results, produces conference
talks and posters, and encourages the students to pursue graduate studies and
careers in mathematics and mathematics education. In addition to research
experience the program will give students practice in writing and presenting
their work, teach them how to use software for mathematics (e.g. Mathematica,
Matlab) and for writing mathematics (LATEX), expose them to a broad range of
mathematical topics through a weekly seminar series, and include workshops on
how to apply to graduate school and the ethics of scientific research.
