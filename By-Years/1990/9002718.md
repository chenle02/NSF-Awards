This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage data due to the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. The focus of this project is to assess the performance of previously
retrofitted buildings, a unique opportunity for this kind of study made possible
by this particular event. The work to be conducted includes: (1) documentation
of observed damages of several (3-10) buildings, (2) detailed analysis of
seismic behavior (3) field testing of damaged buildings for their dynamic
properties, (4) destructive tests as necessary and as permitted by the owner,
and (5) identification of improved retrofitting techniques. In addition, tests
of wood frame connections will be carried out to assess the seismic performance
of plywood shear walls.
