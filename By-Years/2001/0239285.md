This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
new generation of fluorescence amplifying reagents based on poly (phenylene
ethynylene (PPE)) nanoparticles. Because of the role of the amplifying polymer
in the enhanced sensitivity of these compounds, these compounds are called
Amplimer reagents. The project will develop and launch two types of Amplimer
reagents: microarray and quantitative PCR reagents. The Amplimer reagents will
improve the sensitivity and performance of fluorescence-based assays by
providing brighter, more stable fluorescence signals and by improving
sensitivity through fluorescence amplification effects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial and broader impacts of this technology are
consumable fluorescent reagents that improve the sensitivity and reliability of
two rapidly growing diagnostic platforms for genetic sequence analysis:
microarray-based assays and quantitative PCR assays. Diagnostics based on
genetic sequence information currently account for $1 billion of the $24 billion
dollar diagnostics market. This figure is expected to grow significantly as the
follow-on of the human genome project filters through drug discovery and medical
science. &lt;br/&gt;
