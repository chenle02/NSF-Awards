Dextral strike-slip faults play a major role in the disruption of the collage of
accreted terranes in Washington and British Columbia. The major goal of this
project is to place firm structural and geochronlogic constraints on one of the
major fault zone in this region, the Ross Lake fault zone, which disrupts
several terranes and was active during metamorphism and plutonism in the
adjacent crystalline core of the North Cascades. The kinematics of mylonite
belts in the fault zone will be determined through detailed mapping, study of
small-scale structures and kinematic indicators, while the timing of movement
will be constrained by dating plutonic bodies in the fault zone which show
varying degrees of deformation and metamorphism. Results should substantially
increase knowledge of the late Mesozoic - early Cenozoic history of the
crystalline core of the North Cascades.
