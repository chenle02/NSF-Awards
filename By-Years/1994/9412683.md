9412683 Bond A deep multichannel seismic reflection survey of the Aleutian arc
and the extensive Alaskina continental shelf will delineate and differentiate
arc magmatism and terrain accretion. The high-quality images of the deep
structure of the crust and uppermost mantle, when combined with the well-mapped
onshore geology, should allow the principal investigators to constrain the
mechanisms of accretion and magmatism.
