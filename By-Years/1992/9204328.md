This project involves three components: i) a study of the mathematical aspects
of discrete or continuous models of highly distorted conductors, ii) an
investigation of the mechanical properties of guasiperiodic media, and iii) the
computation of bounds on mechanical properties of composite materials. The
project addresses some challenging mathematical questions concerning models of
heterogenous materials, such as those of composites, semiconductors,
superconducting composites, porous media, and modulated structures.
