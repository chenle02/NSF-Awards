Kesner lay abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years there has been an
increasing interest in developing computational models of the hippocampus aimed
at providing mechanisms for understanding the processing of mnemonic
information. These processes include encoding, consolidation, and retrieval as
well as pattern separation, short-term and intermediate memory, pattern
association, and pattern completion. The hippocampus is a very complex brain
region that can be subdivided into a number of different subregions, including
dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1. The computational models emphasize subregional
specificity of function based primarily on anatomical and physiological
recording data, but rarely take into account behavioral data. The purpose of
this grant proposal is to determine whether there is subregional specificity of
function within the hippocampus using neurotoxic lesion techniques to ensure
specificity of lesion effects in conjunction with behavioral paradigms designed
to measure encoding, consolidation, and retrieval as well as pattern separation,
short-term and intermediate memory, pattern association, and pattern completion
processes. The outcome of this research should provide for some critical tests
of the assumptions made by computational models and should aid in the
understanding of the multiple mnemonic functions of the hippocampus.&lt;br/&gt;
