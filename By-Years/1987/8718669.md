This research will include a series of experiments investigating the properties
of the human perceptual and cognitive systems involved in detecting and
recognizing the emotions on the face of another human being. The researchers
will test the hypothesis that an angry face can be found very easily even when
it is "hidden" in a large crowd of nonangry faces. The researchers intend to
show that threatening faces draw attention, that angry faces "pop out" of a
crowd. In a second experiment, the researchers will explore the way in which
memory for faces influences attention to faces. Extending the idea that the
systems controlling the type of faces which will attract attention are governed
by a principle of threat detection, the investigators will attempt to show that
attention is drawn to a stranger's face even when it is hidden in a crowd of
familiar faces, that a stranger in a crowd of friends is more likely to be
noticed than a friend in a crowd of strangers. A third experiment will be
conducted to discover which of two changes is more likely to be attention
grabbing: a friendly face that becomes hostile or a hostile face that becomes
friendly. All of the research is designed to explore the way in which facesare
remembered and how attention comes to be drawn to some faces but not others. The
experiments use what can be called a "face-in-the-crowd" method. A person is
shown a crowd of faces in which there is one discrepant face--say an angry face
in a crowd of happy faces or a stranger's face in a crowd of friends. The
researchers will (a) track eye movements to discover which face draws attention,
and (b) measure how long it takes to find the discrepant fact. These studies
test the general hypothesis that threatening faces attract attention when they
are seen and are better remembered later. The Principal Investigators have
produced interesting research in the past. They are well-trained in the
psychophysiological techniques to be used in the current research.
