The Department of Geosciences at Elizabeth City State University will purchase a
dual ocular polarizing microscope with television monitor and ancillary
equipment. This instrument will be used primarily to improve instruction in
three upper-division geology courses: mineralogy, optical mineralogy, and
petrology. It will allow instructors to demonstrate the properties of both
coarse and fine grained mineral specimens to the classes. It also will allow the
instructor and student to observe specimens simultaneously to ensure that the
student correctly interprets the various features of the specimens. Elizabeth
City State University is one of three historically black institutions offering
an undergraduate degree in geology. The NSF grant of $5,550.00 will be matched
by an equivalent amount from the university.
