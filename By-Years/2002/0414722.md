Artificial intelligence planning systems are being put to use to determine the
activities of a wide range of intelligent interactive systems. The ability for
these kinds of systems to explain their plans to human users is essential for
the systems' successful adoption and use. This project is investigating the
generation of natural language descriptions of computer plans.

This work is developing a cognitive and computational model of task context and
its role in the generation of action descriptions, specifically, the means by
which negative constraints and justifications are used to create more effective
task descriptions. The project methodology includes both experimental and
theoretical aspects; naturally occurring text corpora collected by the project
is used to form a computational model for the production of plan descriptions
that accounts for the discourse features described above. This model is then
empirically evaluated to determine the model's efficacy.

The work demonstrates the effective use of automatically generated plan
structures as underlying knowledge representations for task-based discourse. The
results have a direct impact on the use of intelligent information technologies
used in training and education. This enables applications that provide context-
sensitive help to computer users that are themselves not experts in information
technology, for example in the automatic generation of instructions in
situations where pre-designed instructional materials or other resources are not
available.
