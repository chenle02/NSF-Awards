This grant provides funds for four workstations plus ancillary hardware and
software. The hardware will be capable of running the PC-McIDAS software
developed by the University of Wisconsin. The PC-McIDAS software provides near
real-time meteorological data including satellite imagery and has an interactive
capability. The goal of this project is to build an interactive PC-McIDAS
meteorological system within the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science
which can be used by students, faculty and staff. The emphasis in the
educational area will be on synoptic meteorology. In the research area, the
system will be used for the study of explosive cyclogenesis and pollutant
deposition by storms over eastern North America.
