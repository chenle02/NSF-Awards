The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is requesting $74,982 to provide public
understanding to the research results and methods related to the impacts of
European earthworm invations in the hardwood forests of Minnesota. Dispite
commonly held beliefs that earthworms are beneficial to ecosystems, research
results indicate that the invation of European earthworms into previously worm-
free hardwood forests has a serious effect on both plants and animals. This
project provides training and support for non-formal educators to initiate and
maintain monitoring and survey activities related to exotic earthworm invasions
in their communities. &lt;br/&gt;
