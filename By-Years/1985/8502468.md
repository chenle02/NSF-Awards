Travel support is provided to allow a participant to attend and present a paper
at the Third European Meeting on Improved Oil Recovery in Rome, Italy on April
16-18, 1985. Very little work on CO2 foam is being conducted in academia in the
United States, and it is important to the advancement of research progress to
permit interaction of the participant with his international counterparts.
