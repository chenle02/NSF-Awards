This research will be devoted to the analysis of problems in the calculus of
variations in which singular minimizers may arise. In particular they include
problems where gap effects like those described under the heading "Lavrentiev
phenomenon" can arise. It is anticipated that successful results in this
investigation may have important consequences in the study of nonlinear elastic
materials. Thus they have the potential of providing additional expertise in the
analysis and development of "smart" materials. The effective development of such
materials could be of considerable aid to our current materials technology.
