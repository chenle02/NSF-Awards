Metric spaces, especially Banach spaces, form the conceptual framework in which
mathematicians, scientists, and engineers work when investigating problems that
involve estimation or approximation. Discrete metric geometry, including
dimension reduction results established by the PI, is important in the design of
algorithms and in compressed sensing. Non-linear phenomena often occurs in
nature but is difficult to deal with. This makes it important to understand when
non linearity actually conceals underlying linear structure, and this is central
to the non linear study of Banach spaces. Parts of this research project are
coordinated with the Workshop in Analysis and Probability Theory at Texas
A&amp;M University. The efforts of the principal investigator and other
participants in the Workshop are helping to break down barriers between
different areas of mathematics and also promote the outreach of pure mathematics
to other sciences, especially to computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
problems in Banach space and metric geometry to be considered fall into several
subcategories: the structure of the Banach algebra of bounded linear operators
on classical Banach spaces, approximation properties of Banach spaces, the non
linear classification of Banach spaces, and discrete metric geometry. These
topics are at the heart of the geometries of Banach spaces and of metric spaces
and make contact with many other areas within mathematics, including operator
theory, group theory, geometric analysis, and linear
algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
