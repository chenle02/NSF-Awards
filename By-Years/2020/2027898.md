A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these
institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the
traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project
aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the efficacy of
partnerships between TCUP institutions and their mainstream university or
private sector partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Indian Higher
Education Consortium (AIHEC) will organize and convene a group of TCU STEM
research and education stakeholders and national CI program representatives for
a 2-day meeting hosted by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The
meeting will provide opportunities for participants to share and explore leading
practices and innovative approaches to developing and sustaining research and
education partnerships employing national CI resources. The aim is to foster the
collaboration needed to support and strengthen TCU STEM research and education
programs. A primary purpose of the meeting is to form a TCU Cyberinfrastructure
Working group to advance CI capabilities among the schools through cross-TCU
partnerships and also partnerships with leading members of the national CI
Ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
