AST 0204853&lt;br/&gt;Oey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiative feedback from massive
stars is energetically fundamental to galaxy and cosmic evolution, and it also
provides essential emission-line diagnostics of conditions both locally and in
the distant universe. Our current limited understanding of radiative feedback
greatly hampers investigations of present-day local processes as well as of
galaxy formation and the early universe. Dr. Sally Oey, at Lowell Observatory,
will carry out a comprehensive investigation of radiative feedback
processes&lt;br/&gt;ranging from specific nebular ionization conditions to
large-scale, global ionization processes in galaxies and the intergalactic
medium. The goals are: 1) To understand specifically how ionizing spectral types
and chemical abundances affect nebular emission, and to calibrate corresponding
nebular line diagnostics; and 2) to understand global radiative feedback
processes in galaxies by investigating large-scale properties of diffuse ionized
gas, HII region populations, and implications for the escape of ionizing photons
from galaxies. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
