The 2020 Noncommutative Geometry Festival will be held at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, New Hampshire, from August 10-14. This award provides support,
especially for graduate students, early-career researchers and researchers who
are members of underrepresented groups, to attend the conference which will have
international participation by leading researchers in the field. The rapid
growth, breadth and technical nature of noncommutative geometry, which can make
it hard for beginning researchers to enter, has given rise to a growing need for
an annual meeting specifically dedicated to noncommutative geometry and its many
applications, in both mathematics and physics. The theme of the conference this
year will be: "Noncommutative Geometry, Groupoids and Index Theory‚Äù.

The goals of the conference are to highlight some of the most significant recent
advances in noncommutative geometry, identify promising new research directions,
and acquaint graduate students and early-career researchers with the most
current results and applications in the field. This year, topics will include
the connections of noncommutative geometry with the theory of groupoids, such as
the tangent groupoid and deformations to the normal cone, generalized and higher
versions of the Atiyah-Singer index theory of partial differential operators,
condensed matter physics, and more. More information about the conference can be
found at the following website https://math.dartmouth.edu/~ncgf2020/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
