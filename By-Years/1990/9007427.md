This is a SGER project on a controversial subject: transient stability
methodology for electric power systems. The investigators are examining new
indices and measures for transient stability including measures of security
margin, critical parameters, critical contingencies, vulnerability, and indices
of stress. The project includes methodologies which are capable of direct
calculation of these parameters. Additional project foci include expert system
sorting of stability indices and on-line methodologies. The project is
controversial in that it is at odds with traditional methods and their use for
transient stability assessment.
