With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.
Weston T. Borden of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington.
The proposed research includes an integrated combination of experimental and
computational chemistry leading to the preparation and understanding of the
chemistry of highly strained organic molecules. In the experimental portion of
the work, the preparation and study of the properties of a series of
pyramidalized alkenes will be undertaken. The compounds will be isolated using
matrix techniques and will serve as precursors to other interesting strained
molecules and to a series of Pt complexes. In the computational work, among
other projects, ab initio calculations will be carried out in order to test the
effect of substituents on cubyl cation, homocub-1(9)-ene, and the Cope
rearrangement. Calculations will also be carried out that will serve to guide
and interpret experimental studies of Pt complexes of pyramidalized alkenes.
