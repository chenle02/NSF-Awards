This research project in nuclear theory will develop the quasi-particle RPA
technique to study the usefulness of 127 I as a solar neutrino detector and for
improved calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis. Other topics include using
mapping techniques for multi-quark Hamiltonians, modeling cosmic ray cascades,
exacting the n-p monopole interaction from data and shell model calculations in
deformed nuclei using Nilsson- based truncations.
