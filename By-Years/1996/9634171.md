9634171 WERNER This project represents a continuation of a site-specific
biophysical modeling study of Georges Bank and the adjacent shelf as part of the
U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2 program. The project will
use the Dartmouth finite element models to investigate water circulation and
transport on Georges Bank and adjacent shelf areas. Individual-based models of
early life stages of fishes will incorporate the role of turbulence,
stratification and feeding. Retrospective studies of MARMAP and GLOBEC data will
also be conducted to examine shelf-wide and interannual/decadal scales. Modeling
analysis of historical zooplankton distributions will address the relative
importance of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf as sources of Georges Bank
populations. A moored field component is included in this project to measure the
key inflows to the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine system. The investigations will be
closely coordinated with the proposed Canada GLOBEC studies on the Scotian
Shelf. ***
