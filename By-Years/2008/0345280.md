William Miller of the University of California, Berkeley, is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop the theoretical
concepts and computational methodologies that aim to provide a quantitative
description of many kinds of dynamical phenomena in molecular systems, focusing
on chemical reactions. Applications of recently developed semiclassical initial
value representation (SC-IVR) methodology to real molecular processes will be
made, including projects that will both demonstrate and validate the methodology
as well as enable specific applications. One application aims to determine
molecular structure (i.e., the radial distribution function of some interesting
degree of freedom) on a femtosecond timescale, and another is to simulate
vibrational relaxation in clusters. Both of these phenomena have the possibility
of exhibiting significant quantum effects that lie outside the realm of
classical molecular dynamics.

This research continues to explore the development of a potentially universal
treatment of chemical dynamics, including the quantum mechanical effects that
are important for very small particles. This approach may improve the predictive
capabilities for chemical processes that occur in solids and solutions, with
resulting impacts in chemistry, biology, physics, and nanoscience.
