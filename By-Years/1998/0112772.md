A new axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code will be developed for
determining the evolution of the solar wind as a function of both heliocentric
distance and helioaltitude. It will include the effects of the solar wind
termination shock, and the interstellar pick up ions. Stream and transient
structures will be imposed at the inner boundary using single-point spacecraft
measurements combined with an helioaltitude extrapolation scheme inferred from
Ulysses and SOHO observations. This MHD code will be combined with an existing
axisymmetric cosmic ray transport code which accounts for particle drifts and
allows the prescription of a very general diffusion tensor. The resulting
compound code will greatly enhance our capability to understand the primary
causes of galactic cosmic ray modulation throughout the solar cycle.
