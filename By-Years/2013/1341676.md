Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the project is to study
morphology, taxonomy, ecological structure, and geochemical variations in
fossils across the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction (~ 65 million years
ago). Previously visited outcrops in the James Ross Island Basin in Antarctica
contain numerous well-preserved animal and plant fossils which are ideal for
testing evolutionary hypotheses and possible environmental links to extinctions.
The project will focus on an extinct fossil group (ammonite cephalopods) that
characteristically showed rapid evolutionary change, and two groups which are
thought to evolve at much slower rates (bivalve and nautilid mollusks). The
research will include a new geochemical proxy for temperature: clumped oxygen
isotope measurements. The study will yield new insights into the marine
environments at high southern latitudes both before and after one of the most
devastating mass extinctions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will include the direct engagement of one
undergraduate and one graduate student at the University of Washington (UW) into
the research, a unique opportunity. The project will allow an early career PI,
Huntington, to become involved with Antarctic research. Huntington will
incorporate the Antarctic Research into her efforts at promoting STEM in K-12
education. She has a CAREER project that includes teachers from minority serving
high schools in her research, and will host one teacher as part of this project.
Both Huntington and Ward will broadly disseminate the results through peer
reviewed publications and their UW teaching. Ward has a long track record of
outreach through science books for the public and will incorporate the results
into his newest book, which involves paleontology and extinctions. Ward will
incorporate the results into a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum of
London.
