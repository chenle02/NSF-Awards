9604916 Xu and Michelli This award supports travel costs for a group of U.S.
researchers in computational mathematics to meet with Chinese researchers. The
workshop will be held August 1997 at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, China,
and is intended to provide a forum to identify common priorities in
computational mathematics and to provide a basis for development of
collaborative research. China is increasingly emphasizing computational
mathematics, and while U.S. researchers are familiar with the work of Chinese
researchers located outside China, there is little known about what is happening
inside China in this field. This workshop is intended to introduce U.S.
researchers to developments in the field of computational mathematics in China,
and to define possible areas of future cooperation. Technical topics to be
highlighted at the workshop include some of the most active fields in scientific
computation.
