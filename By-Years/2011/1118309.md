This project will provide support to primarily Arctic indigenous scholars and
students to&lt;br/&gt;participate in the Seventh International Congress of
Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS VII) to be held June 22-27, 2011 at the Stefansson
Institute in Akureyri, Iceland. The ICASS is a major international conference,
administered by the International Arctic Social Scientists Association (IASSA)
and meeting every three years to bring together international arctic social
scientists, scientists from other fields, indigenous scholars and community
members, and students for 5 days. The meeting provides a venue where these
groups can discuss their research findings, update on the progress of IPY
research in the social and human disciplines, and create new opportunities for
collaborations between scientific disciplines and with northern communities for
future research. The main theme of the VII Congress is "Circumpolar Perspectives
in Global Dialogue: Social Sciences beyond the International Polar Year" and
will build on the success of the ICASS VI held in 2008 in Nuuk, Greeland, which
featured 300 participants from 17 countries involved in IPY-funded social
science research. &lt;br/&gt;
