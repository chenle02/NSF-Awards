The Center for Assessment and Evaluation of Student Learning (CAESL) CLT
proposes a project in collaboration with German researchers from the DFG. The
project grew out of joint meetings between CLTs and projects funded through the
DFG. This project focuses on creating a common analytic framework on the use of
evidence in specific science domains and the kinds of teacher actions that
enable students to use evidence effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
