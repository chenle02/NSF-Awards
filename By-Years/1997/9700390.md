Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program support of this research project will
enable the further development of near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM)
for the study of organic thin films. Professor Barbara and his students at the
University of Minnesota will study the mesoscopic structure of important non-
linear optically active materials, and other organic thin film materials. The
connection between mesoscopic structure and electronic and optical properties of
these materials will be determined, with wide ranging applications to the
development of optoelectronic materials resulting from this work. The connection
between the mesoscale structure and the function of organic thin film materials
is very poorly understood, primarily because of the lack of methods available
for the determination of the structure of these materials on this scale. The
development of a method for this structural characterization is the focus of
this research project. Near fields canning optical microscopy in the
fluorescence detection mode will be developed and applied to the study of a
range of organic thin film materials with applications in optoelectronic device
design.
