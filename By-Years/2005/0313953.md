North Dakota State University has been awarded funds for the Virtual Conferences
on Genomics and Bioinformatics. The objectives of these conferences are to
advance genomic and bioinformatic science, by increasing the understanding and
integration of post-genomic data, by illuminating the functional roles of genes
through sequence homology and DNA microarray data analysis, and by facilitating
discussion of the limitations of current genomic and bioinformatic tools and
potential solutions to these limitations. Because they are free and broadcast
around the world, the conferences transcend geographic and economic factors
limiting researchers across the globe. The audio-video streaming versions of the
conferences are retained on a server for replay by anyone from anywhere at
anytime. In addition the conferences have a peer reviewed paper session and a
Proceedings of the Virtual Conference on Genomics and Bioinformatics series.
