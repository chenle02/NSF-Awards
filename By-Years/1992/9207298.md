The pitutary gonadotropin hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH), play an essential role in mammalian development and
normal reproductive function. These two gonadotropin hormones are composed of
two subunits, a common alpha-subunit and a beta-subunit which is unique and
confers specificity. Dr. Attardi has demonstrated that gonadotropin releasing
hormone, a hormone found in the hypothalamus of the brain, and the gonadal
hormones, inhibin, activin and follistatin, cause rapid and profound effects on
the synthesis of FSH but not LH. These changes are mediated through alternation
in the messenger RNA which codes for the beta-subunit of the FSH protein. Dr.
Attardi will examine whether these effects result from changes in synthesis rate
of messanger RNA for FSH beta-subunit or from changes in stability of the FSH
beta-subunit molecules. The results from these studies will help elucidate how
hypothalamic and gonadal hormones regulate gonadotropin synthesis and secretion.
This will increase our understanding of how pituitary cells communicate among
themselves as well as with hypothalamic neurons and cells in the ovaries and
testes. Moreover, the results could lead to the development of safer and more
effective methods of fertility control and increased ability to diagnose and
treat problems of infertility.
