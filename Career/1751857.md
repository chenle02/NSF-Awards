Topology is the study of the shapes of different spaces. Low-dimensional
topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are the
dimensions that are substantially least understood. One-and two-dimensional
spaces are "small" enough that nothing interesting can happen; five-dimensional
spaces are "large" enough that interesting things have room to become
uninteresting. A major question in low-dimensional topology is the structure of
the homology cobordism groups, groups of three-dimensional spaces with many
algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere. This group has
deep connections to the substantial difference between the topological and
smooth categories in four-dimensions, and to structural issues in higher
dimensional topology. In the past thirty years, substantial progress on this and
other central topological questions has been made using invariants from gauge
theory (which deals with solutions of partial differential equations from
physics) and Floer theory (which deals with rigid curves in spaces with a notion
of area). This project will use tools from Floer theory to study the homology
cobordism groups and other topological questions, and to undertake new
theoretical work in Floer theory that will produce useful tools for low-
dimensional topology. In parallel to the research component, the project
includes plans to further the PI's mentoring and outreach efforts, with a focus
on increasing the accessibility of mathematics at early stages and on building
pedagogical and mentorship skills in young researchers. These plans include an
extending Michigan State University's existing undergraduate research program,
running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and arranging for
workshops for building academic communication skills.

The tools of this project are equivariant versions of invariants from Floer
theory. The first part of the project uses an equivariant version of the three-
manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology constructed by the Principal
Investigator and C. Manolescu, which gives new invariants of homology cobordism.
The Principal Investigator plans to construct a refinement of this theory, in
analogy with work done in parallel gauge-theoretic invariants, and use it to
address questions of torsion and indivisibility of elements in the homology
cobordism group. The second part of the project focuses on Lagrangian Floer
homology, the symplectic geometry construction underlying Heegaard Floer
homology and many other topological invariants. Equivariant versions of
Lagrangian Floer cohomology that incorporate the information of a Z/2Z-symmetry
have been extensively and fruitfully developed in the past six years, including
by the Principal Investigator. However, the literature lacks an analogous theory
for Z/pZ-symmetries. With R. Lipshitz and S. Sarkar, the Principal Investigator
plans to construct one, and to use it to study many situations in low-
dimensional topology that possess natural symmetries.
