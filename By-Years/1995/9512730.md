9512730 Chuang This is a two year award proposed by Dr. Steven Chuang, the
University of Akron and Professor Ivan Lin, the Fu-Jen Catholic University in
Taiwan. This proposal requests funds to support a Ph.D. graduate student for one
month at the Fu Jen University in Taiwan to work with Professor Ivan Lin, and
for the P.I.'s travel to Taiwan. The investigators propose to use in situ
infrared spectroscopic techniques to analyze reaction mechanisms of
carbonylation. This is an important project for developing the highly active and
selective catalysts for carbonylation of nitrocompounds. The chemical industry
considers the carbonylation reaction the most promising environmentally benign
process to replace the conventional method of isocynate synthesis from the
reaction of phosgene. The development of environmentally benign chemical
processes has been a priority area in the NSF. Furthermore, this project also
provides opportunities for a U.S. graduate student to have international
research experience at a university in Taiwan .
