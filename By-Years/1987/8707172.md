In a packet-switching computer communications network, a "routing protocol" is
used by network nodes to format the information they exchange with one another
concerning the current path (or route) that packets must traverse to travel
between arbitrary source and of which it is a part, comprises heterogeneous
network nodes employing several different routing protocols. For harmonious
operation of the networks, a translator among the different protocols is needed,
as well as a way to mediate their occassionally inconsistant information.
Cornell University propose to complete the development of software to accomplish
these complex tasks, "part" it to the most prevalant versions of the ubiquitous
UNIX operating systems, and make it available to the NSFNET and Internet
communities.
