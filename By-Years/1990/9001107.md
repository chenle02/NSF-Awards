The objective of this dissertation is to explore the impact of organizational
linkages, class linkages, and the local organization of work on the structures
and ideology of contemporary Latin American popular religious organizations,
both evangelical and Catholic. A case-based comparative approach is taken to
data gathering and analysis. Cases (within the metropolitan area of Caracas,
Venezuela) will be chosen on the basis of the class composition of the
neighborhood and type of organizational network within which the local church is
embedded. In keeping with the community studies tradition, techniques will
include participant observation, interviews with leaders, and member surveys, as
well as analysis of background information on the communities. The study will
fill a gap in substantive knowledge and contribute to understanding the relation
between religion and social class.
