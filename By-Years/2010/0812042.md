Online recommender systems are widely deployed as tools to guide users towards
items they will like. There is a growing concern that recommender systems may be
manipulated by people with a vested interest in having certain items recommended
(or not recommended). This is exacerbated as it is often easy for a manipulator
to create multiple online accounts to execute an attack. The goal of this
project is to develop general techniques for the design of manipulation-
resistant recommender systems as well as specific solutions for applications in
which such a recommender could have a significant impact. The applications
studied include Internet sites that use user-provided ratings or tags to
recommend items to users, and a recommendation system for job candidates that
aggregates informal information from former employees and colleagues.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses three research methods: (1) Theoretical
modeling and analysis of provably robust mechanisms, building on techniques from
economic mechanism design and online learning; (2) Simulations of such
mechanisms against known attack strategies; and (3) Empirical tests on
recommendation datasets. The results and software will also be used to enrich a
Masters-level course on recommender systems, and related
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A manipulation-resistant recommender algorithm
will be valuable to numerous Internet organizations, allowing them to offer
reliable recommendations without obtaining and verifying personal information.
The development of a recommendation mechanism for job candidates will directly
benefit both employers and candidates, especially those who lack formal
credentials. Algorithms and simulation software developed through this project
will be made publicly available via the project Web site
(http://icd.si.umich.edu/MRRS) that will include additional information on the
project.&lt;br/&gt;
