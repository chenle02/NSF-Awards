9452316 Miller A powder X-ray diffractometer will be used in teaching and
research in the departments of Chemistry, Environmental Studies (Environmental
Geology and others), and Physics. Powder X-ray diffractometry is one of the most
widely used methods for crystal structure analysis and mineral/rock/material
identification. UNCA long ago had a diffractometer, which became obsolete when
it could not meet tightening safety standards and the repair costs exceeded its
value, so currently we have no facilities here or in the community with which to
teach students X-ray methods or to analyze mineral/rock/material samples. The
acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer will allow the faculty authors, all of
whom who have had prior experience with X-ray diffraction, to include
experiments and techniques based on X-ray methods and theory in solid state
chemistry, geology, physics, and soils classes. Topics that would be covered in
classes and used in student and/or faculty research include crystal structure
analysis and X-ray techniques in combination with Mossbauer, NMR, and other
analytical methods; mineral/material identification and determination of
relative amounts in rocks, heavy mineral sediments, and materials (such as
synthesized inoraganic compounds and municipal incineration ash); chemical
analysis of specific mineral species by peak shifts in diffraction patterns; and
characterization of clay minerals, soils, and soil components.
