Funds are requested for acquisition of a time-of-flight, matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization mass spectrometer (TOF-MALDI-MS) for analysis of proteins,
covalent protein-ligand complexes, glycopeptides, phosphopeptides, designed
peptides with nonprotein amino acids, photoaffinity modified peptides, and
enzymatic digests of posttranslationally-modified proteins. Projects will be
conducted by seven major faculty users from the departments of Chemistry,
Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology, Allergy, Rheumatology &amp; Clinical
Immunology, and Physiology &amp; Biophysics whose research requires analysis of
modified peptides. The instrument will be housed in the Center for the Analysis
and Synthesis of Macromolecules in the Department of Physiology &amp; Biophysics
and operated as a user-accessible, operator-maintained shared facility. The
Center for Biotechnology, a New York State Center for Advanced Technology will
provide staffing and administrative oversight for the instrument.
