The goal of our interdisciplinary e^ort between computational scientists,
physicists, engineers and applied mathematicians is to build an all{scales
unified simulation system that can exploit the next generation of petascale
systems and beyond. The advances proposed herein hold the potential of greatly
enhanc-ing possible breakthroughs in various research disciplines involved with
continuum mechanics. Specifically, the novelties will include: high-order
discontinuous Galerkin methods with simultaneous adaptive h-p unstructured non-
conforming meshes, multi-methods for time integration including multirate,
implicit-explicit(IMEX), strong-stability preserving (SSP), exponential
integrators, Parareal time-integration, adjoint-based error estimates, and new
optimal iterative solvers. These ideas will ultimately be targeted for use on a
deep atmosphere and ocean model.
