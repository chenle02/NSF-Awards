9724820 Baragiola This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Dr. Raul Baragiola, University of Virginia, and Dr. Edith
Goldberg, Instituto de Desarrollo Tecnologico para la Industria Quimica (INTEC),
Argentina. They will investigate fundamental processes in insulating thin films
and at metal surfaces resulting from high energy excitations by UV photons, ions
or electrons. The main questions to be addressed are how electrostatic charges
are developed under irradiation, and how the resulting electric fields affect
the relaxation of the electronic energy into light, damage, and the emission of
atomic particles. The problem of how the interface between the insulator and a
metal electrode neutralizes holes and relaxes energy will also be studied. These
are fundamental problems central to a number of disciplines, including
industrial applications of insulators (electrical, electronic and xerography
industries), atmospheric physics (electrical charging), and in biology
(radiation damage to cells). The complementary expertise of both research groups
will allow a range of experimental and theoretical approaches to the project
that will prove beneficial to both countries. ***
