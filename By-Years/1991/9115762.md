The principal investigator will conduct research in three areas of the theory
of stochastic processes and related partial differential equations. The first
area is concerned with proving the large deviation principle for Markov
stochastic processes with "discontinuous statistics," a class that includes
diffusions with discontinuous drift and small diffusion coefficient as well as
certain scaled queueing systems. The second area considers the problem of
obtaining the full asymptotic expansion for certain important classes of jump
Markov processes. The last part of the proposed work involves research in the
area of numerical methods for continuous time stochastic control problems. The
principal investigator will conduct research on several problems that are at the
interface of stochastic processes, a branch of probability theory, and
stochastic control, a branch of applied mathematics. The problems are motivated
by issues involved with understanding systems of queues, which arise naturally
in several applications, for example communications.
