This research will investigate the feasibility of utilizing stochastic
interpolation techniques for merging precipitation data from three sensors: rain
gauges, radars, and satellites. Linear and nonlinear interpolators for
stationary and nonstationary spatial processes will be studied. The
interpolation techniques will include universal and disjunctive kriging.
Emphasis will be given to comparing the new techniques with the methods
currently in use. The comparison will be carried out using synthetic spatial
precipitation data. The results of this study are expected to have implications
for flood hazard mitigation.
