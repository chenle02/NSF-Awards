9634143 Eggleston This grant provides $88,976 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring a scanning probe microscope system (SPM) at the University of Wyoming.
This instrument will allow high resolution (sub-nano scale) imaging of
electrostatic forces on mineral and/or material surfaces. As such, it can be
used to study the in situ redox conditions at site-specific mineral surfaces,
allowing an understanding of the kinetics of oxidation of sulfide minerals.
Additionally, the imaging capabilities of the SPM WILL be used for high-
resolution studies of mineral dissolution and precipitation mechanisms. This
facility will benefit a wide range of researchers within the Department of
Geology and also within the Departments of Chemistry, Zoology and Physiology.
