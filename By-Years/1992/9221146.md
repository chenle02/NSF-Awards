Theoretical investigations will be done on relaxation of polymer chains and
liquid crystals in random environments, and on the time evolution of
morphologies in polymer blends and solutions with liquid crystals. The full
mathematical expressions will be derived to describe the nonuniversal features
of (a) dynamics of polymer chains trapped in gels and controlled pore glasses;
(b) phase separation kinetics leading to controlled pattern formation in polymer
blends; and, (c) formation of polymer-dispersed-liquid- crystal morphologies by
phase separation kinetics and the relaxation of liquid crystalline domains in
these morphologies. The theoretical work complements many experimental
investigations which are being actively pursued in many laboratories worldwide.
The results of the proposed work are also relevant to the technologically
important areas of separation techniques such as chromatography, preparation and
processing of molecular composites, and switchable windows and light shutters
for optical processing. %%% This theoretical work in polymer science will use
analytical and computational techniques to address a number of problems of
current fundamental and applied interest. Primary focus will be on the behavior
of polymer chains and liquid crystals in disordered environments and on the
patterns formed when polymer mixtures are combined with liquid crystals.
