When DNA molecules are injected into Xenopus oocyte nuclei,they recombine with
each other, provided certain conditions are met. These include requirements that
the DNAs be linear and that sequence homologies be available to support the
recombination events. This proposal suggests continuing studies of the mechanism
of recombination in oocyte. First,the rules of oocyte recombination will be
investigated by injection of modified and marked DNA substrates; some of these
will be designed to test specific models of genetic recombination. Second,
intermediates in the recombination process will be characterized by isolation of
DNA at short times after injection and by use of specific inhibitors. Third,
efforts will be made to develop a cell-free recombination system from the
oocyte. This will allow characterization of individual steps in the
recombination process and purification of components which catalyze them. The
overall goal is to provide a mechanistic and biochemical description of
recombination processes in oocytes. Recombination of DNA molecules resulting in
chromosome exchange is a basic genetic process in most eukaryotic cells. While a
few of the parameters in some cell types are known, much remains to be
investigated. This investigation into the mechanics of DNA recombination in
Xenopus oocyte nuclei should expand our knowledge of the critical factors in the
recominbational process. Such knowledge is important for genetic engineering to
progress.
