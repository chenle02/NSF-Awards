The capacity of organisms to respond to selective pressures on multiple traits
is determined in part by the genetic covariances between those traits. This
project will map regions of the genome associated with genetic variation in
glucosinolate traits in a population of Boechera stricta, a model plant for
evolutionary genetics. B. stricta makes several types of glucosinolates,
compounds that defend the plant against insect herbivores. By mapping the
regions of the genome that control glucosinolate profile in each type of plant
tissue, the investigator will determine whether the same or different loci
control glucosinolates throughout the plant. Then, using population data at
these genomic regions, the amount of covariation in glucosinolate traits
controlled by each locus will be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing the
genetic architecture of covarying traits is essential in predicting how those
traits are able to respond to selection; if one gene controls multiple traits,
evolutionary constraints are likely to be stronger than if trait correlations
are caused by correlated selective pressures. Genetic covariances have been
important to plant breeders, as well, as they may affect the response to
artificial selection. Understanding the genetic basis of glucosinolate
allocation, which is agriculturally relevant and affects cancer risk in humans,
will lend insight into how breeding programs may affect crop plants. This grant
will also support training of a young scientist in important genomic techniques
and analyses, as well as outreach efforts in traditionally underperforming
schools encouraging students, particularly girls, to pursue college and a career
in the STEM fields.
