As the recent banking crisis in the United States has reminded us, effective
supervision is an important instrument for avoiding crises and promoting
financial stability. While there was a large and complex supervisory network in
place, the banking and financial agencies failed to detect and prevent excessive
risk-taking and even illegal activities. Although the Frank-Dodd Reform made
some important changes to the supervisory structure, it is generally agreed that
it did not attempted an overall reform of the system. Any such reform requires a
thorough understanding of the development and issues underlying the system of
supervision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is a vast scholarly literature on
the history of the Federal Reserve and the operation of monetary policy, there
is no general history of bank supervision in the United States. This project
addresses this critical gap by collecting a comprehensive data base on all
aspects of the multiple federal bank regulatory agencies from 1863 to
2008.&lt;br/&gt;Part of the difficulty in collecting such data mirrors the
difficulty that Congress experienced in managing oversight of the supervisory
system. Each agency has a different structure, mission and funding. Combined
with considerable independence, the result has been a lack of transparency and
regulatory failure. This new data base will provide economists, political
scientists and other researchers with key information to assess the development,
operation and effectiveness of the American supervisory
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analytical part of this project is framed by
five distinctive supervisory regimes that reflect five different approaches to
bank supervision, yielding a natural experiment in how to manage risk-taking by
financial intermediaries. The objective of this study is to examine how the
incentives created by the regulatory and supervisory systems yielded specific
trade-offs between efficiency and growth on the one hand and safe and sound
institutions on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing the first
comprehensive statistical study of bank supervision in the United States, this
project will yield some of the necessary information for theoretical and
empirical economic analyses that will be needed as guidance for future reform.
