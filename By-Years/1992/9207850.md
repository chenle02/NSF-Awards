This work includes several topics in price theory. The first major topic
develops analyses of multiproduct pricing and related problems of taxation,
regulation, and contracting. This includes several tasks: elaboration of some
basic results to take advantage of implicit bundling, extensions of an
alternative formulation that relies only on observable demand data, development
of computational methods for both formulations, and exposition of applications
to practical aspects of multiproduct pricing in industries such as
communications and power. Also, these methods will be used to elaborate a more
general theory of optimal mechanism design that allows risk aversion, correlated
information, and other realistic features. The second major topic develops the
theory of the option value component of the prices of flexible substitutes for
irreversible durable investments, including the characterization of optimal
investment policies in such contexts. The main applications are to prices of
sulfur dioxide emission allowances for electric utilities, and to investments to
reduce or alleviate the effects of global warming. Additional topics include
studies applying theories of bargaining to labor negotiations and to pre-trial
negotiations between litigants, and development of computational methods for
computing stable equilibria. This study will have important contributions in
many fields. For example, the solution to the class of pricing problems may be
helpful in such matters as space shuttle cargo allocation and allocation of
computer time among several users. The option value study would be relevant for
policy issues concerning the abatement of global warming by limiting carbon
emissions.
