This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to the University of Massachusetts Lowell will employ researchers to
investigate and assess how service learning (S-L) components in engineering
education bring about cognitive and affective changes in students and
faculty.&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of the SLICE program (Service-Learning Integrated
throughout a College of Engineering) on alumni, employers, administration, and
the community will also be assessed. The broad goal of the SLICE program has
been to develop better engineers, better citizens, and better communities. A key
objective involves every undergraduate student taking at least one required
course every semester with a meaningful service-learning (S-L) component. The
nature of this approach to S-L in engineering core courses allows it to be
emulated relatively easily by individual faculty members or by whole colleges.
Newly created instruments and protocols developed by this project will lower
barriers to adoption of S-L by other institutions. The large sample size
available in this project will add significantly to the body of knowledge of
student and faculty development based on a compelling, empowering approach to
technical education. Integrating S-L into the curriculum has improved retention
of engineering students and helps faculty and students expand their focus of
engineering the common good.&lt;br/&gt;
