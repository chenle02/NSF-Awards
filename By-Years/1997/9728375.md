This project proposes to plan, conduct and assess a "Shaping the Future"
regional workshop the purpose of which would be able to improve the science,
mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) education at the undergraduate
level within the state of Arizona. This workshop would have as invitees teams of
faculty and administrators from three public universities and and the community
colleges within the state, along with appropriate representatives of government
agencies and the K-12 system. The proposed workshop would be one and one half
days in length and tentatively set for January 1998. A steering committee with
representation from each of the three state universities and the community
college districts will be formed to work with a meeting facilitator so that the
meeting format would best address the Shaping the Future: New Expectations for
Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology
report (NSF 96-139) goals as they relate to: SMET faculty : Building "a sense of
wonder and the excitement of discovery, plus communication and teamwork,
critical thinking, and life-long learning skills into (SMET) learning
experiences". SMET departments: Setting "departmental goals and accept
responsibility for undergraduate learning, with measurable expectations for all
students... offer a (SMET) curriculum engaging the broadest spectrum of ... use
technology effectively to enhance... work collaboratively with departments of
education, the K-12 teachers". Governing boards and administrators: Reexamining
"institutional missions in light of needs in undergraduate SME&amp;T education;
provide strong programs of faculty development;...(and) reduce organizational
rigidities". During the meeting, facilitated discussions will be used to address
these issues. A review of how each institution (or district) is approaching the
issues will also be conducted. The meeting results will be summarized in a
report and captured on a state-wide SMET web page. The steering committee will
be reconvened in the late spring or early summer of 1998 to assess the progress
made on all campuses and to plan appropriate follow-up SMET activity. *
