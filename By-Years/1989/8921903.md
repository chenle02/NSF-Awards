Bethune-Cookman College faculty will be given access to CSNET which includes
partial functionality on the Internet over a two year period. This will
encourage cooperative research and collaboration with researchers at other
institutions. Services provided will include electronic mail, remote file
transfers, a subset of USENET News, and some experimental use of remote logins.
Faculty at the college who need access to these services have been identified
and will be tracked to measure the impact of this project on their research
productivity.
