ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0306538&lt;br/&gt;Zuck, Lenore D.&lt;br/&gt;New York
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The is a continuation of a project whose
ultimate goal is to develop a&lt;br/&gt;methodology for the translation
validation of advanced optimizing compilers, with an emphasis on EPIC-targeted
compilers and the aggressive optimizations characteristic to such compilers. The
methods developed will handle an extensive set of optimizations and could be
used to implement fully automatic certifiers for a wide range of
compilers.&lt;br/&gt;Previous work has developed:&lt;br/&gt;1. the theory of a
"correct translation"; 2. a general proof rule for translation validation of
"structure preserving" optimizations;&lt;br/&gt;3. TVOC -- a tool that
implements the proof rule on an EPIC compiler (SGI Pro-64) and sends the proof
obligations to be verified by a theorem prover (SRI's ICS.) &lt;br/&gt;4. a
proof rule for dealing with many "structure modifying" transformations, mostly
loop optimizations; The proposed work extends the previous work as
follows:&lt;br/&gt;1.develop the theory, and the supporting tools, that deal
with inter- and intra-procedural optimizations. &lt;br/&gt;2. build a special-
purpose theorem prover will be built on top of CVC that will be tailored to
handle the verification conditions generated by the methodology.&lt;br/&gt;3.
identify and construct run-time checks of speculative optimizations. In
addition, it will perform a compile-time validation of the
transformation.&lt;br/&gt;4.Extend scoppe of project to machine-dependent
optimizations, involving instruction scheduling and (software as well as
hardware) pipelining. This project will provide a major step towards ensuring an
extremely high level of confidence in compilers in areas, such as safety-
critical systems and compilation into silicon, where correctness is of paramount
concern. &lt;br/&gt;
