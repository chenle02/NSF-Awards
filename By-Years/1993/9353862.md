9353862 Wardle Brandeis University seeks to provide enrichment experiences for a
four-week summer residential Young Scholars program for 30 students entering
grades 10-12. The program is multidisciplinary and provides students an
opportunity to engage in hands-on class work, career counseling workshops, field
trips and independent projects that enhance thinking and research skills. The
students will also participate in directed research projects, in which they
learn research methodology and practice through work in one of the three
Brandeis centers; the Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory; the Volen
National Center for Complex Systems; and Brandeis Environmental Studies.
