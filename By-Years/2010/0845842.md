This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project develops WiFi-based Rural
Extensions (WiRE), a new wireless architecture that can provide high bandwidth
connectivity to rural regions at extremely low costs. WiRE is a comprehensive
rural connectivity solution that can support a wide range of applications with
performance, robustness and functionality guarantees. The design of WiRE
addresses several research challenges across different protocol layers
including: (1) an adaptive, high-performance unified Medium Access Control layer
that seamlessly works across different network environments; (2) a secure and
scalable naming and addressing solution to enable cellular access using mobile
devices; (3) robust solutions for fault-tolerant network design, failure
recovery, network management and unreliable power; (4) Quality of Service
mechanisms to provide predictable end-to-end performance. The project enhances
the understanding of networking and systems challenges in the developing world
and can have enormous societal benefits to billions in rural regions. It makes
fundamental advances in wireless networks including understanding complex
interference interactions, protocol design and mobile applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities in this program include cross-
disciplinary collaborations in the areas of electrical engineering, economics,
public health and sustainable development. The PI has organized several
important workshops and conferences to increase the awareness of important
computer science research challenges in the rural areas and the developing
world. The education plan for this project includes new curricular development
for this emerging area, inter-disciplinary education, mentoring students from
various disciplines and training of underrepresented groups in rural
regions.&lt;br/&gt;
