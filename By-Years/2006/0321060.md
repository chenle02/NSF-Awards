This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports the acquisition
of a low vacuum scanning electron microscope (LV-SEM) for research and
undergraduate student training in geology, environmental science, biology,
chemistry, physics, ceramics, anthropology and forensic science. The instrument
will be configured with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and
cathodoluminescence spectrometer (CL) to provide a very flexible imaging and
microchemical analytical system to support broad research and educational
programs in the physical and life sciences. Specific areas of research that will
benefit including studies of ore deposits, Appalachian tectonics, archaeological
studies of paints and coatings, taxonomic investigations of aquatic insects, and
forensic investigations of fingerprints and human hair. ***
