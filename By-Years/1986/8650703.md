With computer-automated telemonitoring equipment provided through this grant,
the Wildlife Biology faculty of the Arkansas Tech University has created a
facility for recording and analyzing the activities of radio- equipped animals
at a 200-acre outdoor laboratory adjacent to the campus. The facility will
provide students in ecology, animal behavior, and fisheries and wildlife
management courses an opportunity to study daily and seasonal activity patterns,
movements, habitat use, territoriality, dispersion, and social organization of
the animals inhabiting this area. Instruments to be purchased for the facility
include an integrated radio-telemetry system for the transmission and reception
of each animal's location and activity, and an interfaced microcomputer for data
storage and analysis. Use of the telemetry- computer system, in concert with
traditional methods of wildlife observation, will provide a unique opportunity
to supplement classroom learning with a dynamic, problem-oriented learning
experience in the field. In addition to use in regular undergraduate courses,
the facility will serve the needs of local high school biology teachers enrolled
in in- service workshops, of upper-division students enrolled in individual
directed-research projects, and of local area high school students participating
in ATU's "gifted and talented" science program. This relatively low-cost effort
promises to have an enormous impact upon the teaching of animal ecology and
ethology in this institution, and to have a valuable spillover benefit for
biology programs in the local high schools.
