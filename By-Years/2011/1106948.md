Lev D. Gelb of Washington University is funded by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study fluid phase equilibria at extreme
conditions using Monte Carlo simulations based on first-principles energy
evaluations. This method is being applied to a survey of the high-temperature
fluid phase behavior of elemental systems across the periodic table.
Applications include liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor transitions in a variety of
elements. The solubility of elements in liquid metals is also under
consideration, with future extensions to molecular fluids and coupled chemical
and phase equilibria. This work is having a broader impact in providing high-
quality phase coexistence data for systems for which experimental data are
inaccurate or unavailable. These data are valuable for scientific and
engineering applications from materials processing to energy productions. The
codes developed in this project will be freely available online. They provide a
platform for any project involving large numbers of semi-independent electronic
structure calculations. The PI integrates the results of his research in his
teaching activities, and actively involves undergraduates into computational
research and training.
