0208329&lt;br/&gt;Wing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term focus of our research
is to develop and exploit the tools of genomics to make the Oryza genus the most
advanced and tractable model system to study plant evolution, development,
physiology and crop science in the world. The specific objectives of this
proposal are to construct and distribute eleven high quality deepcoverage large
insert BAC libraries for the ten genomes of Oryza (Table 1). With
the&lt;br/&gt;complete sequence of the A genome of rice on the horizon, having
convenient public access to the other nine genomes of rice in the form of BAC
libraries, will permit rapid advances in both basic and applied research for the
most important food crop in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genus/species,
genome type and genome coverage are listed below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O.
rufipogon - AA, 5X&lt;br/&gt;O. glaberrima - AA, 5X&lt;br/&gt;O. punctata - BB,
