An interdisciplinary approach will be taken in the investigation of the forming
of amorphous, semicrystalline, and fiber-reinforced thermoplastic polymers
having thermal gradients prior to forming. This is known to increase material
drawability for solid materials under certain conditions. Such thermal gradients
may also change the manner by which the formed part recovers upon subsequent
heating. Throughout the program, efforts will be made to understand the
underlying principles that govern the sheet forming processes in the presence of
temperature gradients. An emphasis will also be placed on a thorough
experimental verification of the methodology. Development of such a basic
understanding of the forming process may lead to new and innovative methods for
sheet material forming.
