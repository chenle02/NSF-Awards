The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)proposes to continue the on-line
publication of Icelights--a sub-site of the NSIDC Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis
website--which offers scientifically accurate articles, created to be accessible
to the general reader, that help NSIDC interact more directly with the public on
issues related to Arctic sea-ice extent and trends and to respond directly to
the public inquiries on timely scientific topics.

The proposal aims to achieve several specific, and measurable, goals:

? To continue the on-line publication of Icelights. ? To increase the frequency
of Icelights posts per month to an average of 2 to 4 from the current 1 to 2 per
month. ? To launch a series of special posts on the site, including blogging
from scientific conferences where sea-ice topics are discussed, such as the
American Geophysical Union?s annual meeting. And to launch a series of ?guest
posts? open to scientists or science bloggers. ? To increase the amount of two-
way communications with readers of the site, including the general public, but
also members of the traditional news media and the ?blogosphere.?
