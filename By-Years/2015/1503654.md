The United States has taken a leadership role in initiating and funding research
in Cyber security over several decades. Although the research has yielded
significant advances in both understanding the underlying issues associated with
cyber security and describing increasingly effective measures for securing
information systems, only a small fraction of this insight has been transferred
to fielded systems, government or commercial. Deficiency in the area of
transferring technology to practice is a pressing issue in the U.S. today.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cyber Security Transition to Practice workshop seeks
to identify means by which NSF can facilitate technology transfer at multiple
points in the process: for the researcher, institution, funding agency, and
investor.
