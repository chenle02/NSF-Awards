The investigators study asymptotic invariants of groups. The topics include:
constructing finitely presented groups with "transcendental" properties
(infinite torsion and with Kazhdan property (T) ), residual properties and
linearity of hyperbolic groups, groups with irregular or small Dehn functions
and other filling functions of groups, asymptotic cones of finitely presented
groups, and asymptotic invariants of embeddings into Hilbert spaces (Hilbert
space compressions of groups). These topics are intimately related. For example,
Higman embeddings and S-machines are used to construct finitely presented
torsion groups, in the study of Dehn functions, and in the study of residual
properties of hyperbolic groups. The investigators propose to organize several
group theory conferences and attract students to their area of mathematics. They
are also going to give several courses on the topic of the proposal. It is a
well known point of view after Klein, Hilbert, Einstein and Weil that
fundamental laws describe symmetries occuring in the nature. The symmetry of an
object can be measured by the group corresponding to the object. Groups can be
difined either as groups of symmetries or abstractly by an algorithmic
description (generators and relations). In the second approach, the
investigators choose some basic symmetries (generators) so that all other
symmetries are compositions (words) of the basic ones, and describe certain
relations between the basic symmetries such that all other relations follow from
the chosen ones. The geometry of groups given by such presentations is described
in terms of certain asymptotic invariants. The invariants have been known since
the pioneering works of M.Dehn at the beginning of the 20th century, but the
investigators discovered deep relationship between these invariants and
algorithmic problems. The investigators are developing their geometric method
solving old mathematical problems of algorithmic nature and corresponding
algebraic problems about groups.
