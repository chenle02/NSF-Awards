0443281&lt;br/&gt;Willows&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Washington's
Friday Harbor Laboratories provides instrumentation to improve the oceanographic
and fisheries research capabilities of the research vessel Centennial, operated
by UW-FHL in support of its research and education missions. The specific items
supported with this award include a split-beam echosounder for fisheries
assessment, mid-water trawl net and doors, a net monitoring system for benthic
and mid-water trawls, upgrades to the existing remotely-operated vehicle
including additional thrusters, a forward-looking sonar system and a manipulator
arm, and a hydraulic dock crane for loading and off-loading the vessel. These
improvements will be of substantial advantage to scientists using the vessel in
their research during 2005 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
