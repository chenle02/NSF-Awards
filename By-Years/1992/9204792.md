This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire an electron
microprobe for installation and operation in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this acquisition. The
new electron microprobe is essential for the research programs of several of the
faculty in the Department of Geological Sciences in the areas of petrology,
geochemistry, and mineralogy. The instrument will also be made available campus-
wide and will be used by researchers in the fields of materials science and
anthropology, as well as research students in science.
