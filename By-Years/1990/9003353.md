This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Department
of Statistics and Actuarial Science of the University of Iowa: estimation of
multivariate variance components by maximum likelihood and minimum distance
criteria, the investigators are James Calvin and Richard Dykstra; analysis of
telemetry data - finding the location of a signal, the investigators are
Johannes Ledolter, Russell Lenth and Anderson- Sprecher; robust scale estimation
in quality -improvement problems, the investigators are Robert Hogg, Marianthi
Markatou, and Lenth; some topics in spatial statistics, the investigator is Dale
Zimmerman; predictive regression estimators for finite population values using
functions of the probability of selection, the investigator is Louis Rizzo.
