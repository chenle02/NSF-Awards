The condensed matter and materials research sciences constitute a broad and
diverse area in which research typically is carried out by small research
groups. While the research of these groups is, for the most part, conducted
independently, many of these groups interact through contractor meetings, at
national laboratories and in Energy Frontier Research Centers, and some rely on
national user facilities in conducting their research programs. The National
Academy of Sciences' Condensed Matter and Materials Research Ccommittee 9CMMRC)
has accepted responsibility for monitoring developments in and assessing the
health of the fields that make up this area, and provides a unique and essential
resource for these science communities. Its membership is drawn from
universities, industry, and national laboratories, and its members' areas of
expertise include condensed-matter physics and solid state chemistry, and
materials research aspects of ceramics, electronic materials, metallurgy,
polymers, and biophysics. The experts involved are broadly representative of the
community and they provide their informed perspectives on issues that affect the
progress and vitality of research in these areas. Participation by members in
committee meetings and deliberations can lead to fresh insights and new
perspectives on key questions that drive the forefronts of scientific research
in these fields and support for that research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
