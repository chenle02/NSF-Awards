A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and an ultraviolet-visible
spectrophotometer is used in a series of interdisciplinary laboratory
experiments involving undergraduate science and non-science majors in an on-
going study of atmospheric terpenes, ozone, and ethylene in the forested areas
of the Blue Ridge Mountains surrounding Mount Saint Mary's College. The liberal
arts education of the students is enhanced as they learn more about the
environment indigenous to the college through the implementation of this
approach to instruction. The grantee provides funds for this project that are
more than an equal match for the NSF award.
