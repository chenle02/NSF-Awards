This project is funded as part of the United States-Israel Collaboration in
Computer Science (USICCS) program. Through this program, NSF and the United
States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) jointly support
collaborations among US-based researchers and Israel-based researchers. Until
recently, processors became faster every year, because basic circuit elements
like transistors and wires became both smaller and faster. Around 2005, things
changed. Every year, circuits elements continue to become smaller, but they no
longer become faster, because they overheat. In response, processor
manufacturers now put multiple processors on each chip. Instead of doing one
task faster, these multicore architectures do many tasks in parallel. This
revolution in computer architecture presents enormous challenges to software
designers, who must now structure software to exploit increasing parallelism,
not speed.

Recently, Intel and IBM announced new multicore architectures with direct
hardware support for transactions, a programming abstraction that promises to
make parallel software much easier to design. The move to hardware transactions
can bring about a fundamental positive change in the way we program multicore
machines, and now is the time to understand the implications of such a shift.
The proposed research will center around rethinking and redesigning basic
synchronization structures such as locks, memory management, and a range of
concurrent data structures such as heaps, hash tables, and skip lists, and on
how progress guarantees for these data structures interact with issues such as
memory management.
