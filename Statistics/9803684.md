Crossover Designs and Orthogonal Arrays Abstract: This research furthers the
understanding of two of the most useful types of statistical designs: crossover
designs and orthogonal arrays. In a crossover design each of several subjects
receives multiple treatments, one at each of several time periods. The design
problem consists of selecting the sequences of treatments to be used, and of
deciding how often to use each of these sequences. While practical
considerations play a major role, answers based on statistical considerations
differ depending on the assumptions about the statistical model for the
measurements. This research involves finding efficient practical designs under
various realistic model assumptions. We use these results to identify designs
with good properties for most models. Concerning orthogonal arrays, this
research provides new methods for the construction of mixed orthogonal arrays,
as well as an extensive library of such arrays. In addition, compound orthogonal
arrays are studied for their properties when used in a factorial experiment to
detect location and dispersion effects simultaneously. Designed experiments are
an integral part of scientific research and of product development and
improvement in industry. Crossover designs and orthogonal arrays play a
particularly prominent role. Crossover designs are best known for their role in
medical research and in clinical trials, where they are used in studies to
compare two or more treatments, possibly including a placebo. Orthogonal arrays
play a crucial role in quality improvement and assessment studies in all of
manufacturing. They are, among others, used in studies to determine the possible
effect that changes in a manufacturing process have on the quality of the final
product. This research helps to improve the efficiency of such trials and
studies by identifying better designs and by making such designs widely
available.
