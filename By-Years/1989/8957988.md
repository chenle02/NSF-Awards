The primary interest for this Presidential Young Investigator award will be in
the study of dynamic processes in solids, and optical techniques. Studies in
materials and phenomena which have potential applications will also be
performed. As an example, this would include electron dynamics in new
semiconductor materials and structures. Interest is also in problems of more
fundamental nature if they are well-suited to study by optical methods. Time-
resolved spectroscopy of atoms and molecules would fall in this category. The
development of new optical sources and measurements goes naturally with an
interest in transient optical phenomena. The extension of recently-developed
time-resolved spectroscopic techniques to new regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum is also planned.
