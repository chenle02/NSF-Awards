The technical focus of this project is to develop a unified approach for the
design of low-cost batch fabricated adaptive radio frequency (RF) transceiver
frontends with a goal of achieving robust, high speed and low power wireless
communications. These adaptive RF frontends are suitable for either high
mobility radio channels or environments with variable fading conditions, such as
microwave and millimeter-wave local area networks where movements of personnel
and objects can vary a channels' attenuation and fading characteristics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is an interdisciplinary effort in
material science and electrical engineering that encompasses the development and
characterization of adaptive RF frontends, consisting of frequency and
polarization agile antenna arrays, electronically tunable delay lines, matching
circuits and filters all incorporating thin film barium strontium titanate
(BST). BST technology provides many advantages over conventional devices because
of its miniaturization and integration features. This research investigates the
development and characterization of a broad range of RF devices and components
for the design of low cost smart transceivers, which entails physical and RF
design, layout, simulation, fabrication and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
