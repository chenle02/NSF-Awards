Drs. Anthony and Alice Echelle of Oklahoma State University will use
biochemical data to study the evolutionary relationships of the freshwater
pupfishes of North America. The group includes the pupfishes of the genus
Cyprinodon (35 species) and five small genera (1-2 species each) of related
fishes. The work emphasizes the use of protein variation analyzed by
electrophoresis to describe genealogical relatedness among the genera and among
the 22 "inland" species of pupfish, followed by the use of mitochondrial DNA
variation to describe relationships within a small subset of species, the Death
Valley pupfishes and their nearest relatives. Pupfishes constitute the most
diverse group of fishes in the three major warm deserts of North America:
Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan. The numerous desert-dwelling pupfish species
and the deserts they inhabit have developed in relatively recent geological
time. Thus, knowledge of phylogenetic relationships among pupfishes should
provide considerable insight into the biogeography of southwestern United States
and northern Mexico. The pupfishes also provide an unusual opportunity to test
different modes of speciation. A number of pupfishes and the one species of the
related genus Megupsilon are threatened with probable extinction in the near
future. One outcome of the proposed work is to produce frozen collections of
tissues for future biochemical work.
