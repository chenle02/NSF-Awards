This SBIR Phase I project will develop a plan to use a protein normally produced
in plants, to control phytopathogenic fungi. They have cloned a gene that
encodes for this protein, expressed it in bacterial vectors, demonstrated
activity against three phytopathogenic fungi, demonstrated activity on a grass,
and they have done RNA interference to show that this gene is responsible to
confer protection in plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact
of the project will be the targeted use for organic farms. The properties of
this compound seem appropriate for that use. The results of these studies will
demonstrate that protein-based biofungicides are possible and they will have
implications for understanding the importance of preformed plant defenses in the
disruption of pathogen infection strategies.&lt;br/&gt;
