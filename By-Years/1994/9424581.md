This three-year award supports research on the non-perturbative modeling of the
quantum gravitational back-reaction on inflation between Richard P. Woodard of
the University of Florida, and Nicholas C. Tsamis of the Foundation for Research
and Technology - Hellas (FORTH) in Greece. The objective of their research is to
develop a non-perturbative technique by modeling the infrared sector of quantum
gravity numerically and then evolving the universe through the extinction of
inflation. The investigators have used the symbolic manipulation program
Mathematica, which is supported at both FORTH and the University of Florida, in
their analysis of the perturbative problem. This jointly supported facility will
also enable their current research. If the investigators' analysis is
successful, it may be possible eventually to predict the reheating temperature,
the spectrum and magnitude of density fluctuations, for the universe's response
to the electroweak and chiral symmetry breaking phase transitions, and for
whatever residual inflationary effect is currently being experienced.
