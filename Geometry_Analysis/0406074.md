Geodesic flows are standard models of conservative (as opposed to dissipative)
dynamics. Large classes of mechanical systems can be considered as geodesic
flows. This point of view is most fruitful when the underlying riemannian metric
has enough local symmetries or when it has negative sectional curvature. The
latter case belongs to the realm of chaotic dynamics.

We study geodesic flows of Weyl connections (generalizations of Levi-Civita
connections of the riemannian case). A linear symmetric connection on the
tangent bundle is called Weyl if the parallel transport preserves angles between
vectors. These flows are models of systems out of equilibrium. They were
originally considered in physics literature under the name of gaussian
thermostats. The systems have a forcing term accompanied by the thermostatting
term based on the Gauss' Least Constraint Principle for nonholonomic
constraints. We revealed the geometric nature of the systems with gausssian
thermostats. We showed that also in this generality if the sectional curvatures
are negative the system has some hyperbolic properties. However we do not know
if it is enough to force the uniform hyperbolicity (Anosov property). To settle
such questions we propose to study Weyl connections with (local) symmetries.
This project has the potential of delivering new classes of systems with
hyperbolic dynamics, and/or classifying homogeneous Weyl connections with
nonpositive sectional curvatures.
