The PI will contribute to quantitative understanding of ionospheric stimulated
electromagnetic emission (SEE) through theoretical and numerical simulation
models. SEE is a powerful diagnostic tool for nonlinear processes produced
during ionospheric modification experiments, and may also be used for general
nonlinear processes in plasmas. This investigation utilizes magnetized, kinetic
numerical models not used in past investigations, but essential for further
progress in studying SEE. Specifically, the PI will: (1) provide a more
comprehensive study of three-wave parametric decay processes proposed to produce
downshifted sidebands in the SEE spectrum; (2) study four-wave decay processes
proposed to produce prominent upshifted sideband features in the SEE spectrum;
and (3) study the broadband continuum feature in the SEE spectrum, proposed to
result from strongly turbulent interactions in the background plasmas.
