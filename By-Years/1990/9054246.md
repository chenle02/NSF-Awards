The Ohio State University is offering a two-week intensive workshop for
undergraduate mathematics faculty, concentrating on the use of new technology in
mathematics instruction. The workshop addresses the use of graphing calculators
and software in precalculus instruction, the use of symbolic computer algebra
systems in calculus instruction, and the use of numerical linear algebra
software in basic matrix theory courses. The workshop introduces the tools to
participants, provides opportunities for extensive hands-on experience in a
laboratory setting, and encourages each participant to develop an extensive
project which blends technological tools with relevant mathematics and
curriculum development issues. The workshop is being offered twice during the
summer of 1991 and twice during the summer of 1992 to 25 participants each
session (50 each summer). Follow-up meetings will be held at the O.S.U.
Technology Conferences scheduled for November 1991 and November 1992, as well as
brief weekend meetings in spring 1991 and 1992. An extensive effort is being
made to recruit participants from underrepresented groups and participants from
colleges whose student population includes a large proportion of members of
underrepresented groups.//
