Dune fields cover more than 2.3 million square miles on Earth. Blowing sand and
migrating dunes disrupt agriculture and transport, causing economic and
logistical problems for local populations. The behavior of individual dunes is
well-studied, but understanding and predicting how whole dune-fields migrate
remains a complex and unsolved problem. In this work, the research team will
study the large-scale patterns that arise in dune fields, and then use those
patterns to develop a numerical model of dune migration. Measurements from three
dune fields in the southwestern United States and dune fields created
experimentally in a wind tunnel will inform the development of the numerical
model. This strategy has been successfully applied in other systems, and will
improve scientistsâ€™ ability to predict and mitigate dune encroachment near
populated areas. As part of this work, the team will also develop a library of
virtual field trips that can be experienced using commercial virtual reality
headsets. These publicly available virtual field trips will leverage
improvements in virtual technology to enhance the quality and accessibility of
geoscience education. This project is co-funded by the Geomorphology and Land-
use Dynamics and the EAR Education and Human Resources
Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study dune field migration through the lens of
dune patterns, this research will take advantage of the strengths of field,
modeling, experimental, and remote sensing methods. The three dune fields will
be monitored using high-frequency measurements collected by meteorological
stations and precise spatial measurements of dune position. Wind tunnel
experiments will also be conducted to test how dune patterns can be influenced
in controlled experimental settings. Measurements from both dunes in nature and
wind tunnel experiments will be integrated into an open-source model of dune-
field development to set the timescales and length scales in the simulation. The
virtual field trips developed to improve geoscience education will be captured
using 360 degree stereo video cameras. Overall this work will answer fundamental
questions about dunes and improve geoscience
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
