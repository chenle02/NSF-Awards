Proposal Number P0811284&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: CPA-SEL: Testing Systems with Large
and Complex Test Spaces: Techniques, Tools and Empirical Studies&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Adam Porter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's software systems are often implicitly
organized around enormous and complexly-structured design, construction, and
usage spaces. This research focuses on defining, creating, and analyzing
explicit models that link development spaces to the resulting test spaces
underlying software development projects. The research will create and evaluate
a new framework for testing systems with large and complex test spaces that (1)
explicitly models a system's test space(s), (2) creates sophisticated algorithms
that aggressively sample points in the test space, (3) coordinates the test
process to test those points in parallel across a powerful virtual grid of
computing resources, and (4) merges and analyzes incremental results to steer
test processes in ways that improve its effectiveness and efficiency. This
research has the potential to transform software development by enabling
developers to formulate and apply powerful testing algorithms and by generating
rich sources of data that could be analyzed and fed back to projects to drive
ongoing development decisions.&lt;br/&gt;
