Experimental investigations of one- and two-dimensional disordered conductors.
Phenomena to be studied include superconductivity in one dimension, the effect
of a microwave field on electron phase coherence, conductance fluctuations
arising from the motion of single impurities, and the effects of disorder on
electron scattering processes. Fabrication techniques will also be pursued, with
the goal of making metallic strips less then 100 A wide to use in the proposed
experiments.
