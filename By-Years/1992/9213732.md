This project pursues an interdisciplinary approach to understanding various
aspects of structural dynamics and incorporates the concepts of signal
processing, structural mechanics, control theory and system identification. The
objectives of this research are to develop new results, generate scholarly
publications, and interaction with other researchers under a Career Advancement
Award. These are accomplished via participation in technical conferences here
and abroad, collaborative research with other faculty members located at US Air
Force Academy, SUNY/Buffalo, and VPI &amp; State University at Blacksburg, VA.
Experimental investigations include the development of smart structures
consisting of composite structural members embedded with piezoceramic or similar
other active materials, and their use in identification and control research.***
