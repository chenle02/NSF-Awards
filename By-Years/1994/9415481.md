Arctic ecosystems are sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, however, fluxes are
extremely variable over small spatial scales. Therefore, large-scale
measurements which integrate patch-scale variability are needed to determine the
magnitude of CH4 efflux. Recent advances in laser technology have resulted in
the development of sensitive, rapid response CH4 sensors for landscape-scale
flux measurements. However, many of these instruments require elaborate support
systems and large amounts of power during operation, which inhibit their use in
remote field studies. A fast response open path CH4 sensor was recently
developed that does not require a large amount of extraneous supplies for
operation. Although this sensor appears to be practical for use in remote flux
studies, it is unknown whether it is sensitive enough to resolve the small CH4
fluxes characteristic of arctic ecosystems, or robustenough to withstand the
harsh arctic environment. Therefore, the sensor will be tested on a portable
eddy correlation tower in a variety of arctic ecosystems for two weeks during
the 1994 field season. If the field test is successful, the sensor may then be
implemented for future tower and/or aircraft-based eddy correlation flux studies
in remote arctic ecosystems. This award is made under the SGER (Small Grants for
Exploratory Research) initiative. The project is part of the Arctic System
Science,Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions Flux project.
