With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois in
Chicago will acquire an ultrafast Ti:Sapphire laser system and a high power
Nd:YAG laser. This equipment will enhance research in coherent control of
chemical reactions, analytical probing of organic thin films, and
nanolithography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A femtosecond laser provides
ultrafast pulses of coherent visible or infrared light, which enables
researchers to obtain important information about fast occurring chemical
reactions. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.
