The mechanical power output of a striated muscle will be determined by measuring
muscle tension as the muscle is subjected to periodic length change and to
stimuli which occur at selected phases of the length cycle. The plot of muscle
tension against length over a cycle forms a loop whose area is the work done by
or on the muscle for that cycle. The goals of this project are: 1) To combine
mechanical power measurements from insect wing muscles with simultaneous
measurement of oxygen consumption in order to measure the efficiency of the
muscle in converting metabolic to mechanical power, and to determine if the
operating conditions which maximize power output are also those which maximize
efficiency. 2) To extend power measurements to muscles other than insect wing
muscles in order to determine how similar or dissimilar are muscles from
different sources in their capacity for mechanical power output. 3) To
characterize force- velocity curves for both shortening and lengthening muscles
at different times after stimulation, and to use this information to create a
model which will allow estimation of the power output from a muscle subjected to
periodic length change and phasic stimulation. 4) To characterize release
inactivation in muscle, and to determine the extent to which release
inactivation affects power output during repetitive contraction.
