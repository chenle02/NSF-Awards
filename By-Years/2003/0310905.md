Archaeology (81) This project outfits archeological laboratories at Sweet Briar
College to enhance an interdisciplinary archaeology program and improve existing
archaeology course offerings. Based on successful models from past CCLI- A&amp;I
(DUE 0088017) and EMD (DUE 0088692) projects, a total station is acquired to
support field archaeology, and computers and software to support archaeological
applications of GIS. The project implements new instructional modules in six
different archaeology courses at Sweet Briar College, and provides students at
this small women's college with training in the skills, techniques, and
scientific approaches of modern archaeology, as well as opportunities at
faculty-mentored research experiences, both locally and internationally. The
intellectual merit of the project lies in expanding instruction in archaeology
at Sweet Briar College, in particular in using the institution's historical site
as an instructional resource. The broader impacts of the work come primarily
through the educational opportunities this project affords to Sweet Briar
College students.
