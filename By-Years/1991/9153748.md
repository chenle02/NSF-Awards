To focus attention on early education during National Science and Technology
Week, ASTC will hold an event on Capitol Hill featuring the Hands-on exhibit
"What Makes Music?" on the physics of music and sound. The ASTC Honor Roll
Teachers, selected by science Museums across the country for their exemplary use
of science museum resources to improve science education in their schools, will
be honored. Thirty teachers are expected to attend and take part in a one day
workshop on inquiry based, hands-on science activities and experiments.
