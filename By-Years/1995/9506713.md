9506713 Shirey This proposal requests support to continue application of the Re-
Os isotopic system to a wide range of problems concerning crust-mantle-core
differentiation on the Earth. With the funding requested in this proposal we
hope to address the following topics: 1) the mechanisms of formation of
continental lithospheric mantle, focusing especially on across-craton
variability, addition of lithospheric material at craton margins and the
implications for Archean and Proterozoic tectonics; 2) secular changes in the Os
isotopic composition of the convecting mantle that may reveal if the mantle
records the effects of a) changing ratios of oceanic to continental crust
production through time, b) decline in extraterrestrial input of PGE's to the
mantle during early Earth history and c) mass exchange between core and mantle,
and 3) Os isotopic characterization o lower crustal xenoliths to determine their
initial mantle extraction ages in order to evaluate the significance of magmatic
underplating as opposed to continental collision in thickening continental
crust. These studies all make use of the unique characteristics of the Re-Os
isotopic system that when used in conjunction with Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic data
offers the potential of new insights into the chronological, tectonic, and
chemical evolution of the solid earth.
