Thermoacoustic instability can disrupt the operation of gas turbine combustors.
The study of these instabilities is a long-standing problem in combustion
science, that is still widely investigated towards a better understanding of
power generation systems, and their design and operations. This
interdisciplinary project addresses the prediction of thermoacoustic instability
by using mathematical tools developed for the analysis of dynamic systems with
multiple time delays. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will attack the
important problem of predicting thermoacoustic instability using tools for the
analysis of neutral time delayed systems. This approach provides exact and
exhaustive descriptions of stability maps for the particular class of systems
under study in the parametric space of the dynamics. This project will
specialize this tool to the equations of thermoacoustics in order to create new
design tools for the prediction of instability in combustors. A simple benchmark
combustor, called the Rijke's tube, will be taken as the test platform during
this research, in order to demonstrate the validity of the project's
mathematical paradigm.
