Influences of earthworms on soil processes in agricultural and pastoral systems
are well recognized but there is considerably less information about their
importance in wildland ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and savannas.
Furthermore, very little is known about the ecology of native earthworm species
in North America, even though they are prevalent in a number of areas unaffected
by Pleistocene glaciations. The few existing studies indicate that where they
are abundant, these organisms can have significant effects on soil structural
properties and on nutrient transformations. However. the relative importance of
native versus invasive exotic earthworm species remain virtually unknown. This
proposal requests funding for a cross-site investigation of native and exotic
earthworms, to determine if native species are more efficient than exotic
species in nutrient processing in undisturbed ecosystems. They also will
determine if disturbance sets the stage for invasion by exotic earthworms, which
may be more competitive than natives but less effective in nutrient cycling. Th
ese ideas will be tested in two phases over a three year period at three LTER
sites (Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Konza prairie Research Natural Area and
Luquillo Experimental Forest) and one non-LTER site (Apalachicola National
Forest). They will undertake field surveys and collections in a variety of
habitats, and will initiate field enclosure experiments using 13C- and 14N-
enriched substrates. Together, these two phases of work optimize the use of
stable isotopes in field studies--first, as survey tools to characterize and
identify important species and patterns of resource utilization across sites;
and then as biogeochemical tracers to elaborate earthworm-microbial interactions
and to quantify influences of various earthworm species on C and N dynamics.
Results from this study will greatly expand their understanding of earthworm
ecology, interactions between native and exotic species, and influences of both
groups on soil nutrient processes across a broad range of ecosystems.
