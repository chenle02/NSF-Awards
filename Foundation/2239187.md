This project brings together two scientific fields: distributed computing and
descriptive set theory. Distributed computing is the area of computer science
that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that
communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is
especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet,
where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive
set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other
well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets
defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their
complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related,
and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this
relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood.
This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a
unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of
this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to
enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of
graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture
notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and
scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior
exposure to descriptive set theory.

Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing
take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where
the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to
some "local" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following
general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of
regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an
efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation?
Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project
aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to
develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the
perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove
that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study
specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect
matchings.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
