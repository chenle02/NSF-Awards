This project provides the equipment and software to complete the Engineering
Technology Senior Teaching Laboratory. The equipment acquired establishes a
local-area-network of 386-based personal computers with fabrication and testing
hardware necessary for senior-level capstone projects in Computer and
Electronics Engineering Technology. The software features Unix operating systems
(with DOS partitions), C development system, and a C-to- microprocessor cross-
translator in support of a microprocessor development environment for robotics
and other digital control system applications. An advanced communications
facility for undergraduate research has also been established. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
