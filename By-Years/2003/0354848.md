This proposal from the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) requests funding to
study neutrino oscillations using the MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation
Search) and Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detectors. Past results from Super-K have
used neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere to
show that muon neutrinos of energies from a few hundred MeV to hundreds of TeV
oscillate to tau neutrinos as they travel the tens to thousands of kilometers
through the earth to the detector. This implies that neutrinos have mass, a
finding of fundamental importance to both particle physics and astrophysics. The
MINOS experiment aims to both unambiguously confirm this result and precisely
measure the oscillation parameters using an intense, well-calibrated beam of
neutrinos generated at Fermilab and aimed toward the Soudan Underground Physics
Laboratory in northeastern Minnesota. The neutrinos will be observed by a
detector near their origin at Fermilab and by a similar detector after traveling
735 km to Soudan. The researchers also wish to continue their participation in
the operation of the Super-K detector, gathering more data to improve its
statistical significance while improving analysis techniques in order to better
understand it.

The students contributing to this development will have the opportunity to gain
valuable hardware experience and will gain the software skills needed to develop
the systems to control and monitor the experiment. Undergraduate participation
in both experiments has been strong, greatly enhancing these future engineers'
and physicists' experiences in learning science. The Soudan Underground Lab
regularly hosts tours for both K-12 science class field trips and the general
public. UMD will continue to be heavily involved in such outreach programs,
which last year saw approximately 6000 people visit the MINOS experiment to
learn about neutrinos.
