Non-technical Abstract The proposed experimental research will have impact in
two major science and technology arenas: how to make a tougher material and how
to adapt ideas of liquid crystal display technology to new water-based liquid
crystal systems. Broadly, the program develops new ability to formulate and
manipulate micro- and nano-particles and macromolecules in solution. Thus the
research enhances the science and technology enterprise that underpins
applications efforts for US industries involved with sensing/actuation,
microfluidics, drug delivery, photonics, printing, coatings, cosmetics and
agriculture. The program will train a new generation of scientists and engineers
in soft materials, formulation, advanced optical microscopy, electro-optics,
microfluidics, rheology & computation. After finishing, PhD students & post-docs
enter the work force and strengthen US technological and economic
infrastructure; furthermore, a diverse group of undergraduate and high school
participants are typically stimulated every summer in our laboratory to pursue
STEM education/career choices.

Technical Abstract The proposed program aims to advance knowledge about complex
fluids and soft materials, but many findings will also interest the hard
condensed matter, chemical engineering and materials science communities. The
proposed experiments are unified by their focus on micro-mechanics, broadly
defined. One set will measure structural and dynamical properties of colloidal
glasses and crystals with goals to identify regions within these materials that
are "soft" and exhibit increased propensity to deform or rearrange. A second set
will investigate lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals. These liquid crystals are
unusual in that they twist very easily which leads to formation of chiral
structures from achiral mesogens, they exhibit two levels of assembly hierarchy
from molecules to rod-mesogens to LC phases, and they are water soluble. The
consequences of these properties will be probed by diffusion experiments which
track motions of particles dressed by local LC director fields, by study of the
competition between elastic energy and molecular assembly hierarchy in "extreme"
confined geometries, and in novel "drying" of multi-phase droplets.
Collectively, the experiments use advanced optical microscopies, light
scattering and rheometry for sample observation, and they require formulation of
novel soft materials via controlled suspension chemistry and physics,
microfluidics, etc. For example, colloidal particles with different shapes,
interactions and potential for in-situ manipulation are/will-be developed.
