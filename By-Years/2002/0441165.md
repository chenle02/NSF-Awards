INTELLECTUAL MERIT This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
addresses development of a terahertz imaging focal plane array. The detectors
are thin cantilevered strips whose physical properties change with temperature.
The research objectives include modeling and design of the cantilevers,
assessment of optical vs. electronic irradiance readout, means for maximizing
irradiance absorption, and techniques for image array readout. These objectives
will be pursued within the framework of Phase II production of functioning
arrays. From earlier work in the thermal infrared, the detector array is
projected to be very sensitive compared to existing bolometers, with a response
time permitting high frame rates, high pixel count, and development of imaging
arrays of high resolution (pixel count). BROADER IMPACT Terahertz radiation
imaging offers many of the benefits of X-rays, without ionizing radiation. THz
imaging spectroscopy offers a new and very powerful tool for selectively imaging
and identifying complex chemical species. Availability of a producible and cost-
effective THz-imaging focal plane array with high pixel count, high sensitivity
and high frame rate will enable production of new classes of systems for
security (imaging through clothing and packaging materials, metal detection),
identification and recognition (using subcutaneous blood vessel patterns),
taggants (with THz-based coding buried in plastic cards or chips), diagnostic
medicine (non-invasive exploration of subcutaneous tissue, interior thermal
mapping), and rapid identification and characterization of organic and
pharmaceutical materials.
