The proposed center seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC) addressing the research of advanced storage systems.
Specifically the center will focus on scaling of big data, security,
reliability, metadata, provenance and searchable file systems, archival and new
storage technologies. The newly proposed center intends to address difficult
challenges in storage scalability, indexing, security, and longevity, both for
existing technologies and for new technologies. The goal of the center is to
elevate the knowledge base of the storage industry through cooperative industry-
university research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secure, ubiquitous data storage and
access has emerged as a significant societal challenge. Modern society depends
heavily on vast quantities of secure, reliable storage for everything from
medical data to our cultural heritage (photos, video and other documents). The
I/UCRC for Research in Storage Systems seeks to define and execute cooperative
research resulting in safer, more secure data storage that meets the growing
needs of a society that produces data at an ever-increasing rate. Working with
its Industrial Advisory Board, the center plans to have a significant impact on
the storage system industry, both by developing new techniques and tools and by
providing a source of talented graduates to industry. The Center plans to
develop new courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels and emphasize the
diversity of its student population.&lt;br/&gt;
