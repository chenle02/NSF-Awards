This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, a U.S. Global
Change Program. This research will use climatological and sounding data, as well
as a radiative transfer model to examine the energy transfer from the atmosphere
to the snow surface, which in turn will lead to better parameterization of the
process of spring snow line retreat. The project will utilize two approaches;
the first involves expanding the study of roughly 40 years of historical weather
data, including snow depths, precipitations, surface temperatures, and
atmospheric soundings, at four Alaska stations. The second involves using a
state-of-the-art radiative transfer model to examine the theoretical effects of
changing cloud cover, and relative humidity on the actual transfer of energy
from the atmosphere to melt snow. These results will be used together to
simulate snow melt in atmospheric models.
