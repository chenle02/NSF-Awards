The majority of the photosynthesis in the ocean is carried out by microscopic
marine organisms, the phytoplankton. A major question facing today's biological
oceanographers is to assess the primary production potential of individual
phytoplankton cells in mixed species assemblages in the ocean. Dr. Perry has
chosen the molecular biological approach to this problem. She will quantify the
concentration of key components in the enzymatic and light harvesting
photosynthetic apparatus by intracellular labelling of these components with
fluorescent antibodies and by subsequent analysis of the cells with flow
cytometry, a technique which allows each individual cell to be scanned. This
will allow for the characterization of an individual's contribution to the
productivity of a population.
