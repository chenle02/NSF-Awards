A relatively new area of research in information theory concerns coding and
information capacity concepts for storage systems. As new high.density recording
media are developed ; e.g., optical and magneto.optical techniques, there is
need for mathematical models for a variety of storage systems in order that
maximum efficiency and reliability can be attained. This project is concerned
with the development of these models as well as the development of good codes
for efficient storage. The implementation and complexity aspects of the codes
are examined and the information storage capacities of the various models are
determined. The models include "Write.once memories" (WOM),
"Write.unidirectional memories" (WUM), and their unification and generalization,
"Write.efficient memories" (WEM).
