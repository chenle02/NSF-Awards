ABSTRACT: Rothschild and Baouendi

A basic geometric and analytic problem in several complex variables is to
determine when two real manifolds in multidimensional complex space are
equivalent under an analytic transformation. The principal investigators will
continue their research on several aspects of this fundamental problem. In
particular, they will focus on determining when it is possible to reduce the
equivalence problem to the much simpler one of solving systems of polynomial
equations. They will also study which mappings between such manifolds are
determined by finitely many derivatives at a given point. They expect that this
study will lead to the discovery of new geometric, analytic, and algebraic
properties of these important geometric objects. The study of the geometry of
real manifolds in complex spaces is central to the field of several complex
variables and to other areas of science, including geometry, mathematical
physics and engineering. Progress on the problems proposed will likely have
impact on these areas as well.
