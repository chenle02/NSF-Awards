This is a proposal to support student and young researcher travel to the AGU
Chapman Conference on Low-Frequency (ULF, ELF and VLF) Waves in Space Plasmas.
Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical
Union that are designed to provide opportunities for detailed scientific
discussion that is not possible at large meetings such as the Fall AGU meeting.
Approximately 130 scientists are expected to attend the conference.
Approximately 20% of the attendees will be students and young researchers just
beginning their careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the conference
will be to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics of low-
frequency waves, including the generation and propagation mechanisms and the
interaction of the waves with magnetospheric thermal plasma and energetic
particles. The latter is important for space weather studies.
