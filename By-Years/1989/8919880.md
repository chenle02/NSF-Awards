ABSTRACT This project is a comparative study of the ways in which the syntax of
subjects and objects interacts with semantic roles and discourse functions in
several Bantu languages. The objective is to test and further develop the theory
that asymmetries in the syntactic behavior of verbal arguments universally arise
from underlying semantic and pragmatic hierarchies which are formally associated
with underspecified syntactic functions, following a line of research initiated
in Bresnan and Kanerva (1989). This theory combines aspects of both the
functionalist and the formalist linguistic traditions in explaining argument
asymmetries in Bantu and other languages. If it is correct, the theory has
significant consequences for understanding the relations of discourse, syntax,
and morphology and implies that the sharp division of labor that current
linguistic practice continues to impose between "sentence grammar" and
"discourse grammar" has led to uninsightful or incomplete accounts of important
linguistic phenomena. In research over three years the project team will
systematically analyze subject and object properties in eight Bantu languages
that vary in the extent of asymmetry among verbal arguments. The phenomena
analyzed will include locative inversion, unaccusativity, and presentational
focus; interactions of argument-adding and argument-suppressing processes;
agreement, word order, and extractions; and topic and focus marking, including
phonological marking.
