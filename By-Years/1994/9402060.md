9402060 Cande A DeepTow survey of magnetic anomalies 5 and 20 at two sites in
the northeast Pacific will be conducted. The objective is to estimate the
contribution of deeper sources to magnetic anomalies by measuring changes in the
spectral character of the magnetic field and the width of transition zones over
crust of varying age at both deep-two and mid-tow depths. The data will be used
to evaluate models predicting long period temporal variations in the
magnetization of the upper oceanic crust due to progressive low temperature
oxidation and the possible emergence of a significant paleofield signal from
deeper within the crust. ***
