9634703 Sharpe This research is to support an effort that provides a solid
foundation for the design of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) by providing
mechanical properties for very small specimens. This type data can be used to
help optimize the designs of the small devices. Prior NSF supported efforts have
led to an experimental technique for performing tests on silicon speaimens
having a thickness between 3 and 300 micrometers. The efforts in this new
program will be to determine Poison's ration for, and in conducting detailed and
comprehensive microstructural studies of, thin specimens of the MEMS materials.
Recent MEMS applications have involved slightly thicker specimens of materials
other than silicon. Such specimens will also be investigated. ***
