This award provides support to The Pennsylvania State University to continue
their Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. Eight undergraduate
psychology majors with an interest in the biological aspects of experimental
psychology will be recruited to participate in this program at the completion of
their sophomore or junior year. An effort will be made to attract a majority of
minority students using the techniques and contacts which have enabled staff to
train over 40 minority Ph.D.s since 1969 and five minority students in the
1989-90 NSF REU Sites program. The students selected will work as apprentices
with one of seven members of the faculty, all nationally known for their
research and all highly experienced at preparing undergraduates who have gone on
to graduate school. This faculty recently received a major equipment grant form
the U.S. Department of Education that has provided facilities for research and
training. The program is designed to have students work full-time for eight
weeks in the summer, gradually exposing them to all aspects of
psychophysiological research and to selected aspects of physiological
psychology. Students will design an independent research project during the
latter part of the summer and complete it with the help of their Penn State
mentor during the following academic year. At the end of the spring semester,
they will present their research results at a department colloquium. In some
cases, the research will be submitted for publication or presentation at
professional meetings. Every effort will be made to encourage and assist
students to gain admission to graduate programs, either at Penn State or
elsewhere.
