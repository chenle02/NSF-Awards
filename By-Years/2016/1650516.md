The NSF INCLUDES program supports models, networks, partnerships and research to
ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of racial and
ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons of low
socio-economic&lt;br/&gt;status, and people with
disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Georgia Department of Education will
convene the "CS in the ATL" conference on inclusion in the computer science
discipline during the February/March 2017 timeframe in Atlanta, Georgia. The
conference includes several workshops on backbone organization design in support
of the National Science Foundation's Inclusion across the Nation of Communities
of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF
INCLUDES) initiative.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Approximately 150 individuals
serving a broad cross-section of Georgia's K-12, higher education, public,
private and non-profit constituencies as well as representatives of the
inaugural NSF Design and Development Launch Pilot projects will participate in 2
days of conference workshops - the results of which will be disseminated via a
dedicated website and conference report.
