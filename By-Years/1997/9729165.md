Balsley/Abstract The purpose of this activity is to obtain vertical
distributions of both temperature and moisture near the coast of Peru (at 4
degrees South) using radiosondes equipped with Vaisala sensors. The larger
meteorological purpose is to caputrue the thermodynamic structure of the
atmosphere during the initial stages of an El Nino especially in a region where
such measurements have never been made.
