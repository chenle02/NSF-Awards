Harnessing effectively the power of cloud computing and the benefits of
ubiquitous data collection requires parallel advances in parallel algorithms,
also known as multi-agent optimization. Unfortunately, these methods are
vulnerable to cyber-attacks: if one or more of the platforms used is compromised
and spreads incorrect values to other servers, the answers produced will be
incorrect. It is not always possible to prevent this kind of attacks from
occurring by relying on authentication alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
studies the vulnerabilities that exist in parallel algorithms, with the intent
of understanding how to detect dysfunctional agents, isolate those that are
compromised and restore the system functionality. The study of vulnerabilities
in decentralized computation has important ramifications that go beyond the
engineering discipline. In social science multi-agent optimization is used as a
model for social learning. The study of malicious behavior will capture the
effect of zealots in social settings that inject false information, steering the
outcome of collective decisions towards specific actions that favors their
interests.
