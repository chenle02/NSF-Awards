The purpose of this grant is to provide direct funding, for a period of three
years, of a three years, of a National Science Foundation (NSF) Center Evaluator
at two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers. One is the Center for
Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) which is located at the University of
Washington (UW). The other is the Center for Analog/Digital Applications
Research (CADAR), a joint center which is located on the campuses of Washington
State University and University of Washington. The evaluator will be responsible
for implementation of the NSF Center Assessment Program at each of the centers.
This is a series of three related studies designed to identify the factors that
may contribute to and/or inhibit attainment of each center's goals and outcomes.
Included among the three basic studies are: a) developing comparative
descriptions and conducting analyses of each center's developmental history in
the form of annual historical profile updates; b) conducting intermediate as
well as long-term studies of each center's organizational effectiveness using
faculty and sponsor outcome assessment survey instruments, and; c) conducting
exit interviews of any industrial sponsor that terminates their affiliation with
either center. The principal investigator is a recognized evaluator and
eminently qualified to study the Industry/University Interaction at the above
two center.
