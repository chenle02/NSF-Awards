One area of computer science that is not adequately addressed in most curricula
is the area of data communications and computer networks. In most cases, there
are no laboratories to support this type of course. The purpose of this project
is to establish an undergraduate course in data communications and computer
networks, and to develop an undergraduate data communications laboratory to
support instruction in this area. The intent is to provide a laboratory devoted
exclusively to providing computer science and computer engineering students with
exposure to the hardware and software components of data communications and
computer networks. The laboratory equipment would consist of ten IBM compatible
microcomputers specifically equipped so as to provide the capability to rapidly
reconfigure the computers into a variety of telecommunications topologies. A
series of experiments would be developed with the goal of giving the student
hands-on experience with data communications. In these experiments, the students
would develop an understanding of data communications hardware, and write data
communications software.
