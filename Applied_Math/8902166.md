8902166 Renardy This proposal will study the stability and bifurcation in two-
layer flows involving two immiscible fluids. Such flows have many applications
in industry, such as the formation of bicomponent fibers, the transport of oil
in pipelines, ink-jet printing and lubrication. It is well known that such flows
can also exhibit phenomena which are totally unexpected based on our knowledge
of one-fluid flows. Theoretically, many possibilities exist for the shape of the
boundary separating the two fluids. Yet experiments show that some shapes are
preferred over others, although the underlying selection mechanisms are not well
understood. A chief objective of this proposal is to study, analytically and
computationally, the stability of the various steady arrangements of two-layer
flows, and the evolution of new arrangements from unstable ones.
