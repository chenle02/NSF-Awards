This award provides 70% of the funds required to purchase equipment for the
upgrade of the experimental petrology and geochemistry laboratory in the
Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. The institution is committed to providing the remaining 30% of the
funding required. The equipment consists of high-pressure vessels, high-
temperature furnaces and a cathodoluminescence microscope system. The RPI
laboratory is engaged in research projects investigating the rates of geologic
processes such as diffusion in minerals, melting and the transport of melts in
the Earth's lower crust, all of which require the equipment upgrade in this
award.
