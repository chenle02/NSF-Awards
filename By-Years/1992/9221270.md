This award will support a collaborative research project between Dr. Gerald P.
Hammond, of the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth and Dr. Abraham J.
Vaisberg, of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Alexander von Humboldt,
Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Peru. The research involves the isolation
and structure elucidation of bioactive compounds from Peruvian wound-healing
plants. Plants extracts will be bioassayed for wound healing activity and
screened for other pharmacological effects. Samples will be assayed for cell
migration and cell proliferation, and will be fractioned until pure bioactive
compounds are obtained. The bioactive compounds thus obtained will be evaluated
for their biological properties. This collaborative research fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by combining the
complementary expertise of researchers from both countries in an area of strong
mutual interest. Proving the medicinal or scientific value of these plants will
contribute to the preservation of folk medicine practices and to the
conservation of biological diversity.
