The widespread availability of user-friendly computational chemistry programs
has made molecular modeling and computational calculations routine chemical
techniques. To expose students to this powerful technology, the project is
integrating computational chemistry into a discovery-based curriculum. In the
first year, students use computational chemistry to begin to get a molecular
view of the world as they learn how energy relates to molecular structure and
motion. In organic chemistry, students use molecular modeling in lecture class
to understand which interactions influence chemical reactions and in laboratory
as a routine method of analysis. In physical chemistry, students use ab initio
methods to investigate molecular orbitals, potential energy surfaces, and
transition states. In the 1997-98 school year, a new upper-division integrated
laboratory sequence will commence that will allow students to use computational
chemistry to correlate the electronic structure with the behavior of compounds
that they will synthesize and/or study. The project includes eight Macintosh
computers networked to an IBM RISC/6000 workstation and an LCD panel and
overhead projector for use by the instructor. The project uses graphically
oriented molecular modeling software, as well as additional software, and two
printers for presenting students' results.
