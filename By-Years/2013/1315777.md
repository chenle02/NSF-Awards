This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a
nanopackaging process that can assemble high efficiency solar cells onto
flexible panels. This modular, scalable approach leverages disparate, state-of-
the-art photovoltaic technologies and integrates them into a single system at
low temperature. This can include silicon, gallium arsenide and other III-V
technologies. An advantage of the proposed approach is that it facilitates the
use of silicon cells with III-V cells, increasing the availability of
photovoltaic materials with different bandgaps. The assembled device will be
evaluated for both concentrator applications and also portable electronic
devices.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes reducing
dependence on fossil fuels, as well as limiting environmental impact compared to
other sources of energy. Solar power is a renewable and nearly limitless energy
source. Commercially, the project reduces manufacturing costs of flexible solar
panels and introduces a more robust solar energy system into the market. The
market for flexible solar panel substrates is estimated to be $536 million by
2017. Higher efficiency is critical for applications that utilize solar energy
to extend the operational duration of mobile devices. However, the efficiency of
commercially available flexible solar panels is limited to 8-14%. The challenge
is that high temperature deposition processes are typically required to deposit
higher efficiency materials, but the deposition temperature must be kept low for
compatibility with flexible organic substrates. Key applications include
concentrators and portable electronic devices.
