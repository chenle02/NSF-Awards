Despite the ubiquitous adoption of distributed systems, designing and deploying
distributed systems remain challenging because of the ever-increasing scale,
complexity, and unpredictability of system executions. In occurrences of
unanticipated faults, system operators often find themselves needing to diagnose
the systems to discover software bugs, misconfiguration or malicious intrusions.
Emerging provenance techniques can construct an explanation of an observed
system state, in the form of a directed dependency graph. However, the use of
provenance is limited; they lack query interfaces that allow users to easily
extract information from provenance data, as well as, techniques to fully
leverage provenance data. System operators have to further analyze provenance
data, and manually perform management actions such as system recovery and
reconfiguration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces a framework that
efficiently maintains and queries provenance data, and leverages the exposed
dependency information for system diagnosis. The research will i) develop
layered privacy-aware provenance maintenance that provides availability and
security guarantees in untrusted environments, ii) introduce a SQL-like
declarative query language for users to annotate and abridge provenance data,
and iii) investigate various methods of leveraging provenance data in order to
identify and control suspicious misbehavior. The work provides a holistic view
of provenance support for practical applications that impact performance,
privacy, availability and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, this
project will provide a novel approach towards enhancing the reliability and
security of distributed systems in an automated manner. Tools developed in the
project will be freely distributed, and research findings will be incorporated
into networking and databases courses.
