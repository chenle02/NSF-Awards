931485194 Balachandran This research planning grant will allow the PI to plan
and begin a research program directed at better understanding the role of
rotation in the evolution of stars. There is a body of evidence which strongly
suggests that the rotational history of a star plays a significant role in
determining its structure and surface composition. The goal of this project is
to quantify the effects of rotation by observing young, embedded pre-main
sequence stars, by measuring the abundance of lithium and rotational velocities
for stars in clusters of various ages and by measuring the CNO abundances of
stars in globular clusters. ***
