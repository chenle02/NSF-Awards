9315986 Hart This project is to carry out osmium isotope studies of laurites
from a number of well-characterized chromitites in an attempt to constrain the
arguments regarding the source and accumulation processes of PGMs in the
Bushveld Complex. The PI will look for systematic changes in 187/186 Os with
stratigraphic level of the chromitites, he will evaluate along-strike changes in
both the Merensky and UG-2 chromitites, and will investigate the variations in
187/186 Os in both the UG-2 and LG-6 chromitites in relation to defined
hydrothermal alteration features. Currently more than 60 samples are in hand,
with identified and marked laurites; these are derived from the active, on-going
research projects of several South African collaborators.
