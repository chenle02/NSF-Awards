The Council on Undergraduate Research, a national organization of almost 4,000
members that provides support and networking for faculty at over 850 primarily
undergraduate institutions, will provide the leadership for organizing RESEARCH-
LlNK--a national center for the development and exchange of research-based labs
for introductory biology. RESEARCH-LINK will establish a formal network of
undergraduate students and faculty that will permit collaboration in designing
experiments, sharing data, and interpreting results via a WWW HomePage.
Currently, a major obstacle preventing the introduction of research-based labs
is the lack of a national clearinghouse continuously accessible to faculty, that
provides models of experimental systems and field-tested laboratories that can
be easily incorporated into a general biology laboratory that will allow
students, during 3-4 lab sessions, to think and act like scientists. RESEARCH-
LINK will permit faculty to communicate directly with authors of field-tested
labs to work out problems and answer inquiries. The network will include faculty
peers on the campuses of primarily undergraduate institutions across the country
and selected mentor/consultants from the cadre of those now taking the lead in
building and sustaining curricula with a strong research-based component. A
series of workshops will select, develop, and disseminate a group of field-
tested RESEARCH CORES that will consist of a collection of research-based labs
in genetics, cell biology, plant and animal physiology, ecology/behavior, and
evolution that faculty can select for integration into an introductory biology
course. The project will be guided by the overriding principle that 3-4 weeks of
any standard general biology laboratory should be devoted to teaching the nature
of science and introducing students to the thought processes and methods of
science such as formulating and testing hypotheses, designing and conducting
experiments, analyzing and interpreting data, and communicating results.
