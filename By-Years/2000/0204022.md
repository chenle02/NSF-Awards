Performance Modeling of Applications Executing in the Internet2
Domain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The objective of this research project is to
advance the state-of-the-art in modeling and simulation to the point that the
Internet2 network infrastructure and protocols, the high-performance
applications that are and will be developed within this environment, and the
interactions between these individual components can be studied, Analyzed, and
predicted. This project will provide significant support to both systems
engineers, and application developers and users. From a systems point of view,
it will provide and environment in which new and existing networking hardware
and software can be tested and studied as a function of expected (and observed)
application types and loads on the system. From the point of view of an
application, this research will support its performance and scalability analysis
as a function of its execution environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
