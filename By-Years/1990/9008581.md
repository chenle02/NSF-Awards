This research establishes a formal methodology for designing and implementing
highly interactive systems that is based on knowledge of both application
programs and interface software. To demonstrate feasibility, it the methodology
is applied to systematically resolve design and implementation trade-offs
between the conflicting goals of supporting highly interactive graphic
interfaces and achieving maximum separation between user interface software and
application programs. The methodology replaces traditional partitioning of the
development task with partitioning of the interactive system. Mechanisms
progressively transform design information from an initial description of
interaction requirements to components of the software interface between the
user interface and application. These mechanisms capture the knowledge required
to build this interface. A design information representation describes the
information required to resolve separation trade-offs. These results are
implemented as a tool that demonstrates the methodology.
