Genome studies have shown that many genes but few processes are universally
conserved. In contrast, gene networks and the principles that govern their
states are emerging as possible foci of universality. To address this issue, the
investigator will exploit two unicellular organisms whose relatively low level
of complexity should make discerning formal network patterns of gene activity
much easier. The investigator will construct strains of the ciliate Paramecium
tetraurelia and the amoebo-flagellate Naegleria gruberi having various pair-wise
combinations of gene knockdowns, and then use these strains to test the effects
of such manipulations on the cells' behaviors and on genomic patterns of gene
expression. Through their analysis, the PI will search for common network
patterns that may represent a cell's repertoire of fundamental states.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conservation of such network states is likely to be a
critical factor in evolution and may be the fundamental requirement for life. A
repertoire adequate for such networks to assemble, function, and respond to
novel conditions may well be the key factor that permitted the origin and
survival of living cells. As such, success in this study would also have major
implications for evolutionary theory and for the plausibility of synthesizing
living things. The successful synthesis of new life forms, in turn, has the
potential to lead to major technological advances to protect and improve the
health of the environment, as well as wide-ranging implications for applications
such as designing artificial networks for computing and communications.
Educational and training aspects of the project will consist of careful
mentoring of postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students in both the
conduct of research and the underlying scientific questions. Public outreach
will consist of lectures on the relationship between genes and behavior and the
role of gene networks.
