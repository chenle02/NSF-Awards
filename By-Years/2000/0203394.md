DMS-0203394&lt;br/&gt;Ying-Qing Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI of this proposal
intends to study the topology of 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds via Dehn
surgery, essential surfaces and essential&lt;br/&gt;laminations. It is a common
method to use 2-dimensional surfaces as a&lt;br/&gt;tool in studying
3-manifolds. The most useful surfaces in studying&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds are
essential surface, essential laminations, and Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. The
purpose of this project is to study the properties of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds
using these surfaces and Dehn surgery. There have been&lt;br/&gt;great progress
in this area in the last few years, for example we now&lt;br/&gt;know that an
essential surface will remain essential after most Dehn&lt;br/&gt;surgeries, and
the exact upper bounds on distances between all ten&lt;br/&gt;pairs of nonsimple
surgery types have been determined. However there&lt;br/&gt;are still some very
important problems remaining to be solved in this&lt;br/&gt;area. An objective
of this project is to determine how many surgeries&lt;br/&gt;are ``exceptional''
in certain sense, for example, how many will&lt;br/&gt;produce so called Seifert
manifolds, and how many will kill an&lt;br/&gt;essential surface. The PI will
also study the problem of how an&lt;br/&gt;immersed surface intersects a
Heegaard surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds are objects that are locally
like ordinary 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces, but whose global structure may be
quite complicated. Such&lt;br/&gt;objects appear naturally from different areas
of mathematics as well&lt;br/&gt;as physics and other sciences. The ultimate
goal in the study of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold topology is to have a thorough
understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of 3-manifolds. This has not been
achieved yet, but there&lt;br/&gt;has been a great progress towards the proof of
a conjectural picture&lt;br/&gt;described by Thurston more than 20 years ago.
The PI proposes to&lt;br/&gt;continue studying 3-manifolds via Dehn surgery,
which is a method of&lt;br/&gt;constructing new 3-dimensional spaces from an
existing 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space, by removing a neighborhood of a circle
and then gluing back in&lt;br/&gt;a different way. The achievement of this
project will be an important&lt;br/&gt;step towards the goal of having a clear
understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;topological and geometric structures of
3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;
