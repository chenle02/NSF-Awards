for the next generation of wireless protocols. For wireless devices to become an
essential part of our infrastructure, they must be resilient to changing
environmental conditions and function under extreme cases. However, current
wireless protocols have limited adaptability. This project explores a new class
of wireless protocols called “wireless sub-protocols”. Wireless sub-protocols
are new protocols built on existing wireless protocols but increase their
capabilities and adaptability. Wireless sub-protocols are implemented only in
software and require no changes to a device’s hardware. Wireless sub-protocols
add extra adaptability paving the way for future resilient wireless protocols
with only a software update.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More flexibility in wireless
protocols is necessary to accommodate the ever-expanding use cases that new
wireless devices demand and bring about ultra-resilient wireless systems. To
address the need for adaptability and resiliency, this project explores the
novel idea of building a wireless protocol layering approach where additional
functionality is added to a wireless protocol using “wireless sub-protocols”. A
wireless sub-protocol is a protocol built on top of another wireless protocol. A
wireless sub-protocol provides a way for a base protocol to increase its
abilities beyond what the original protocol designers intended. A communication
scheme can be built on top of an existing protocol by measuring and controlling
the physical layer properties in user space software. This innovative technique
allows a device to gain new capabilities and thus adaptability, with only a
software update. Sub-protocols coexist with the base protocol, allowing the
application developer to decide when to use one or the other. This project will
build a framework for prototyping, building, and testing different types of
wireless sub-protocols. The project will use wireless testbeds to prototype new
wireless sub-protocols rapidly. This project will enable a new research area of
wireless sub-protocols, impacting future designs of wireless devices. The
technology the project develops will be available to technical standardization
committees to formalize approaches to wireless sub-protocols. Since the
innovation technique is implemented in software, it lowers the barrier of entry
and is much more approachable to new students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
