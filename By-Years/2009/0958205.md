This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Major Research and Instrumentation (MRI) program,
Professor David G. Lynn and his colleagues Joel M. Bowman, James T. Kindt, Keiji
Morokuma and Djamaladdin G. Musaev will acquire two computer systems to upgrade
the facilities in the Emerson Center for Scientific Computation at Emory
University. This will support theoretical and computational work in a number of
areas including the exploration of potential energy surfaces in high
dimensionality and of excited electronic states, probing interactions in small
metal clusters and nano-particles, understanding the biological mechanisms
behind various diseases and disorders, studying radical-mediated catalysis in
B12 enzymes, developing experimental and theoretical approaches to understand
the mechanisms of selective (nonradical) reductant-free oxidation of organic
substrates catalyzed by various synthetic catalysts, and modeling of mixed-lipid
bilayers.

Chemists employ sophisticated computer systems and clusters of computers to
investigate problems using computational methods based on theoretical models and
programs. Such calculations, often used in conjunction with experimental data,
allow chemists to better understand many types of complex chemical and
biological phenomena. This resource will be used in research by students and
faculty from the chemistry and physics departments and other units with training
and assistance from the computer staff at Emory University's Center for
Scientific Computation.
