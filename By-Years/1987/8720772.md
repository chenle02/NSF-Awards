This award will provide one-third of the funding necessary to purchase an
electron probe microanalyzer to be installed in the College of Oceanography at
the Oregon State University. The remaining two-thirds are coming from a
combination of University (state) and private (Murdock Foundation) funds
earmarked for this purpose. The University is further committed to the
installation and maintenance of the instrument. The electron probe microanalyzer
is a versatile instrument capable of quantitative elemental analysis of
geological and synthetic materials down to the 0.01% concentration level and
with spatial resolution in the 0.001 millimeter range. As such it is a standard
analytical tool in all research dealing with the chemical composition of natural
and synthetic materials. The new instrument will be the first and only such
instrument at Oregon State University.
