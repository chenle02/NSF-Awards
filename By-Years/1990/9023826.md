The Southern Technology Council is taking a necessary first step toward
implementing the recommendations set forth in its report Turning to Technology,
a long-range strategic plan for strengthe- ning the S&T capabilities of the
South. The necessary first step is to bring the plan to the attention of state
legislators and representatives of relevant organizations throughout the South.
The Council proposes to do this through one day symposia that will be highly
publicized. The symposia will relate the strategic plan to state-specific needs
and conditions, stimulate consideration and discussions of priorities, and will
prompt the formation of permanent planning mechanisms and legislative structures
for state S&T policy.
