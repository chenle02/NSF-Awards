9511252 Eichengreen Recent turbulence in foreign exchange markets, especially
within the European Monetary System (ERM), has raised new questions about the
causes of speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates. It is surprising in this
light that we do not possess a body of evidence that establishes stylized facts
about the behavior of macroeconomic variables around the time of attacks. The
goal of this project is to develop stylized empirical facts about the behavior
of critical economic and political variables around the time of speculative
attacks on pegged currencies. It will do so by developing a data set suitable
for studying the causes and consequences of speculative crises and subjecting it
to univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. The project plans to
address questions such as the following: Are there differences in the behavior
of key macroeconomic variable sin periods prior to speculative attacks on pegged
exchange rates compared to other periods? Are there "early warning signals" of
pending currency crises? Does the behavior of these key variables change in the
aftermath of speculative attacks? Are political outcomes affected by speculative
attacks? Do answers to these questions different in the different times and
places in which exchange rates are pegged? Do they differ for ERM and non- ERM
currencies, in particular? Or are speculative attacks all alike?
