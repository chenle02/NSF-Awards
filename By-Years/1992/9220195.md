This research project will investigate complex metamorphic textures through a
combination of techniques that model reaction mechanisms which produce
metamorphic textures with techniques that provide information about whole rock
modes and mineral compositions along a specified P-T path. Techniques to be
utilized are based upon differential thermodynamics and irreversible
thermodynamics. The resultant models will be tested and refined using pelitic
samples from western Maine, and will ultimately be used in placing constraints
on the thermal and tectonic processes responsible for development of the
metamorphic terrane.
