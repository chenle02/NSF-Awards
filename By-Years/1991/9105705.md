The principal investigator, in collaboration with Michael McCurry (Idaho State
University), will study the Organ Mountain Batholith (south central New Mexico)
using isotopic and petrologic techniques, with emphasis on establishing the
vertical chemical and isotopic zonations of this igneous body. The study is made
special by the ability to study the top of the magma chamber, a section that is
commonly not accessible in other such bodies. Through this work geologists will
gain important information about the processes of magmatic differentiation that
result in large-volume silicic igneous rock bodies.
