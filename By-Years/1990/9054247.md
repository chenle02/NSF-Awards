The workshop familiarizes engineering undergraduate faculty with recent
developments in the design of new products for manufacture (DFM). Several tools
and methods, including customer-driven engineering, product rating for assembly
based on part geometry or assembly motions, and the use of the manufacturing
process capability for setting the tolerance limits for new parts are presented
and discussed with classroom and laboratory exercises.
