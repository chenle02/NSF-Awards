The Principal Investigator of this award will collaborate with colleagues of the
European Incoherent Scatter Association (EISCAT) in the development of an
advanced radar system called EISCAT-3D. EISCAT 3D will be located in Scandinavia
and will be the first all-digital radar system, capable of three dimensional
volumetric imaging of the geospace environment. The PI will be the chair of the
EISCAT 3D Technical Advisory Committee and will contribute to the system
architecture and design. The advanced radar technology to be developed will
enable new research in space plasma physics, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling,
long-term climate trends, and space weather. The EISCAT 3D design builds from
the successful development of the Advance Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar
(AMISR) originally funded by NSF. AMISR systems in Alaska and Arctic Canada have
demonstrated the merits of solid-state, phased array incoherent scatter radars
in terms of measurement capabilities, versatility of operations, and ease of
deployment. The PI will serve as Chair of EISCAT 3D Technical Advisory
Committee. His involvement in the development of EISCAT 3D will provide many
opportunities for technological and intellectual exchange between the U. S. and
Europe. This effort will advance the state of the art in geospace radar systems,
enable a host of transformative scientific research, and will help reduce cost
and risk. The technology to be developed will be state of the art and pave the
way for future instrumentation for space and astronomical research.
