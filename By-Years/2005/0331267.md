This objective of this collaborative research project will be to design test
apparatus to examine yarn slippage during thermostamping, to formulate material
constitutive and interface models to capture macroscale behavior while
considering the microscopic constituents; to propose failure criteria linking to
the formability of this material (woven architecture and matrix constituents).
The overall objective is to create design rules to best utilize the material
potential. These challenging and fundamental issues will be addressed in
collaboration between Northwestern, U Mass-Lowell, industry, and international
researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are
numerous. The environmental concern for reduced emissions and fuel consumption
has created enormous opportunities for introducing woven-fabric reinforced
composites into high-volume consumer products as they possess outstanding
structural (car bodies, floor pans, truck beds) and energy-management (for crash
situations) properties. Thermostamping has demonstrated its potential as the
means to reduce manufacturing costs for mass-production applications. The PI
will coordinate an international benchmarking program on material tests,
thermostamping tests and modeling methods among researchers in the U.S., Europe
and Asia. &lt;br/&gt;
