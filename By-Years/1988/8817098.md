Vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous in nature and have
been shown experimentally to reduce plant stress, to enable interplant transfer
of nutrients, and to increase soil stability, plant phytohormone levels, and
plant absorption of elements in soil. Because of these attributes, there has
been considerable world-wide interest in these fungi among the scientific
community and an increased demand for reliable cultures of VA mycorrhizal fungi
has resulted. Since they are obligate symbiotic fungi which cannot be maintained
on culture media, cultures can not be obtained from existing microbial
collections. In October of 1985, NSF awarded a grant to the Institute of Food
and Agriculture Sciences to establish a culture collection of these fungi. This
collection presently consists of 548 isolates of 56 species among the six genera
of VA mycorrhizal fungi. In the first two years of its operation, over 300
cultures were sent to 92 researchers. This project provides partial operational
funding for the collection for the next 15 months.
