9500589 Campbell A differential algebraic equation (DAE) is an implicit ordinary
differential equation. DAEs arise, for example, in a variety of control problems
in flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and contact or
constrained problems in mechanics. In addition, differential algebraic equations
occur in the solution of partial differential equations by the method of lines
and in many circuit models. DAEs are sometimes also called singular or
descriptor systems. The last decade has seen considerable progress both in the
analytical understanding of DAEs and in the development of numerical methods for
DAEs. Most of this work has been in numerical analysis and has frequently
involved complex nonlinear systems. Independently there has been considerable
advancement in the development of theoretical results and methods for the
control of nonlinear systems. With the exception of classical work based on time
invariant linearizations most of this work in nonlinear control has dealt with
comparatively smaller nonlinear systems. Many of this control development has
been independent of the work on DAEs. As noted, many computer generated models
are most naturally modeled in the form of DAEs. The move to the consideration of
increasingly complex systems not only leads to DAE models but systems for which
the more traditional nonlinear control methodologies are sometimes difficult to
implement. This project will study implicity modeled control systems. The goal
will not only be to extend existing techniques to the implicit setting but also
to use the DAE technology from other areas such as numerical analysis to develop
new and more efficient algorithms for computing control theoretic information
from complex systems. ***
