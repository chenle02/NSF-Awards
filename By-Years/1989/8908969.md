The interactions between predators and prey are an important part of all
ecological systems. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the
dynamics of predator-prey systems are strongly influenced by the behaviors of
foraging animals. Many sensory and decision-making processes are involved in the
behavior of both predators and prey. Dr. Kamil will experimentally investigate
these processes in an omnivorous, highly skilled predator and forager, the blue
jay. Experiments will determine the effects of variation in the spatial and/or
temporal distribution of prey on where the birds hunt, and for how long; the
effects of temporal constraints on the breadth of the birds' diet; the ability
of the jays to collect and utilize information about changing, dynamic prey
populations; and the effects of variation in the appearance of prey on the
birds' ability to detect the prey. The results of these experiments will be
important in three related ways. (1) Because many of the decision-making
abilities of animals evolved in the context of foraging behavior, these
experiments will help to reveal the nature of these abilities and their
biological significance. (2) Dr. Kamil's experiments also will provide basic
information about the dynamics of predator- prey interactions, which will
contribute to our understanding of ecological systems. (3) A better
understanding of predator-prey interactions in ecological systems should prove
valuable in estimating the effects of alterations in natural systems.
