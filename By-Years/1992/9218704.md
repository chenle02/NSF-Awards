This research will map the 3-D P- and S-wave velocity structures in the crust
of southern California by tomographically inverting over 1.5 million P- and
S-wave first-arrival times from over 80,000 local events recorded by the
Caltech/USGS network since 1981. The massive data size and the demand for a full
3-D raytracing due to known large lateral inhomogeneities in the crust have
imposed a major computational challenge to conventional methods. By an
innovative Master Station Method of incorporating 3-D ray tracing, however, the
P and S structures will be imaged simultaneously in this project with relocation
of summarized events. The primary objectives are to construct P and S crustal
velocity models for southern California at one order higher resolution than the
latest P velocity model, to relocate earthquakes and re-examine first- motion
focal mechanisms in areas of large bias by routine processing, and to gain
insight into the crustal seismo-tectonic processes through integrated analysis
of all known geophysical and geological information. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
