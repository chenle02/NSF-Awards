University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CADRE: A Tool for Transforming WordNet into a
Core Knowledge Base&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project extends a popular
database of English words to make it more useful in such tasks as question
answering, information retrieval, and summarization. Wordnet is a lexical
database for English that has been widely adopted in artificial intelligence and
computational linguistics for a variety of practical applications. The basic
elements of WordNet are sets of words that are linked according to semantic
relations: synonomy, antonymy, superordination, and so forth. WordNet is
publicly available, widely used, and is currently being into a multilingual
database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a set of tools that can
be applied to current and future versions of WordNet to extend it for knowledge
processing applications. The extensions are enhancements of the glosses that
currently contain definitions, comments, and examples of sets of words that are
linked in WordNet. Enhanced glosses will be syntactically parsed, will have each
word tagged with its part of speech, and will themselves be linked with other
glosses that describe related concepts.&lt;br/&gt;
