This proposed program of ground-based optical analyses and modeling of upper
atmospheric regions addresses important CEDAR objectives. The areas of
investigation are: 1) upper atmosphere dynamics and coupling to the F-region
plasma; 2) 630 nm airglow depletions and ionospheric plumes; 3) mesosphere and
lower thermosphere dynamics; 4) geocoronal hydrogen dynamics; and 5) enhanced-
sensitivity Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) development. The Arequipa, peru FPI
will be used in simultaneous measurements with the Jicamarca incoherent scatter
radar (ISR) for detailed determinations of the height variation of the
equatorial thermosphere - F-region plasma coupling. The 1983- 1990 FPI data base
will be analyzed to find the response of the upper thermosphere wind and
temperatures to changes in solar flux (sa index) and geomagnetic activity (Kp,
Ap, AE indicies). A mapping photometer will determine the morphology of 630 nm
airglow depletions and their association with ionospheric plumes (measured by
the Jicamarca ISR). AT Laurel Ridge, PA, the 150 and 100 nm aperture FPI's
(improved by CCD detectors) will determine, respectively, geocoronal hydrogen
dynamics (trapped thermal, ballistic and escape components cia the Ha line) and
mesopause-lower thermosphere dynamics (via OH and 557.7 nm lines). At Millstone
Hill, MA, under the direction of D. P. Sipler, the coordinator FPI and ISR
studies of midlatitude thermosphere -ionosphere momentum and energy coupling
will continue.
