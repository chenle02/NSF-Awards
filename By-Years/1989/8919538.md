One region of the brain that appears to be involved in storage of visual
information is the inferior temporal ("IT") cortex. Area IT has been implicated
by behavioral studies to be a major site for visual perception or visual memory,
and physiological studies on single nerve cell activity in area IT have shown
particular sensitivity to spatial visual patterns. This project will combine
physiology and behavior to look at the activity of single cells during either a
visual task or a task requiring memory of of a visual image. Tests will be run
to see if an IT neuron that responds to a visual stimulus in a serial sequence
also will respond similarly during a task requiring mental recall of that
sequence, without the visual stimulus itself being present. Results of this
novel exploratory approach will be very important to our understanding of
formation and maintenance of mental images, and will have impact on cognitive
neuroscience and perceptual psychology, in additon to visual and sensory
neuroscience.
