Physics teaching is being improved by focusing laboratory activities on
exploring and applying fundamental concepts rather than verifying known results,
and by improving the quality and increasing the quantity and variety of data
collected. High quality graphical representations of data are being used; more
powerful analytical and computational tools are being employed; and appropriate
topics in the curriculum are being covered through experiments, numerical
analysis and simulation. Students are being involved in the solution of more
realistic problems and being provided with resources to do so.To achieve these
goals, the physics department is acquiring 80386 based computers, VGA monitors,
general purpose and motion sensing interfaces and sensors, and a file server,
and is equipping and networking a number of data acquisition stations. Faculty
are computerizing a number of current experiments and exploring others for
possible computerization. The project is impacting initially all the freshmen
and sophomore courses for both physical and life science majors, and will expand
subsequently to all the students served by the department.NSF grant funds are
being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
