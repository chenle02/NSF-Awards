Lithium silicate ceramics are a critical component of solid state batteries and
fusion reactors in the energy sector. Lithium silicate ceramics contain a number
of defects in their crystal structure, which can affect how the system interacts
with water, though the precise nature of the relationship is unknown. Evaluation
of the mechanism by which the defects in the lithium silicate ceramics interact
with water will allow for the development of longer lasting materials in
batteries and fusion reactors. Based on the complex structure of the lithium
silicate ceramic computational methods will be employed to provide extensive
atomic level information of the structures and how they evolve with time. The
proposed research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Xiaotao Zu at the
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in Chengdu. Dr. Zu is
an expert in the computational methods which will be employed to study the
defect-water interactions in lithium silicate ceramics.

First principles simulation methods will be applied to the simulation of lithium
silicates to provide extensive atomistic and electronic information about the
crystalline structures, including the effects of point and electronic defects on
both bulk and electronic properties and in the presence of water. The
identification of the mechanisms responsible for the changes in water diffusion
in the region of the defects will provide insight into the role of water on any
structural changes which occur in lithium silicate ceramics. The proposed work
will provide a base of knowledge on lithium silicate ceramics that can then be
extended to the investigation of defect structures in more complex crystalline
multicomponent silicates, including the primary materials used in lithium
batteries. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student
and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and
Technology.
