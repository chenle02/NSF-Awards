National Wildlife productions is developing a large format film, "Predators and
Prey," and related educational resources. The film will introduce audiences to
cutting-edge scientific research through a topic that already captures their
imagination and will use visually exciting scenes to present the science behind
predator/prey relations. A preliminary conceptual structure, general approach
and potential storyline have already been developed.

The planning phase will include the following activities:

-Further define the conceptual structure of the film -Conduct
preproduction/front-end audience research -Refine the approaches to the film
based on feedback from front-end research -Plan educational resources -Conduct a
front-end survey of large-format film theaters to evaluate the title, approach
and relevance of proposed educational resources. -Draft a film treatment

The principals for the project bring a background of filmmaking and science.
Christopher Palmer, President and CEO, National Wildlife Productions (NWP), will
serve as Executive Producer for the film. Educational resources will be designed
by Jim Stofan, Vice President, Education, NWP; and the Chief Science Consultant
will be Sterling Miller, Senior Wildlife Biologist, NWP. Treatments and scripts
will be written by Mose Richards and evaluation will be conducted by Robert
Russell. A committee of scientists and science educators will help guide the
project during the planning phase.
