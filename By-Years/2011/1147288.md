Although it is known that androgenic hormones naturally impact multiple
neuromuscular processes as well as motor-disease states in humans, these effects
can be difficult to study because there are few "athletic" animal models. The
Schlinger laboratory studies hormonal control of neuromuscular dynamics in a
bird that has an extraordinarily complex physical courtship display. These birds
express androgen receptors in brain and musculature in high amounts giving us
the opportunity to understand how hormones enable complex physical behavior by
actions on the brain and peripheral muscles. The specific goals of this project
include use of electromyography to determine how hormones act on skeletal
muscles to stimulate appropriate muscle contractions, the use of molecular
techniques to address how hormones control expression of genes in skeletal
muscles that adapt the muscles for contraction and lastly neuroanatomical
tracing techniques to assess how the brain connects with androgen sensitive
muscles. These studies will directly expand the understanding of hormone action
on body-tissues and they stand to impact thinking about potential advantages and
disadvantages to hormone therapies and/or hormone abuse. This research also
serves as a unique training opportunity for young scientists, particularly those
poorly represented in the physiological sciences.
