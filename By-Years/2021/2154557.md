This award provides funding for U.S.-based participants, including members of
underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences, to participate in the
conference "Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras (YMC*A)", held August 8-12, 2022
at the University of Oslo, Norway. This meeting is organized for and by graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers in operator algebras and related areas,
with the goal of fostering scientific and social interaction between early-
career researchers. In each of its previous six editions, YMC*A has provided an
excellent opportunity for over one hundred early-career operator algebraists
from around the world to attend mini-courses on current research topics in
operator algebras. Networking opportunities at the 2022 edition of the
conference are supported by a panel discussion, open to all participants, which
covers career advice and issues of equity and by informal mathematical
discussions throughout the duration of the meeting.

The conference focuses on recent developments in operator algebras,
noncommutative geometry, and related areas of mathematical analysis, with a
particular emphasis on the interplay between operator algebras and the fields of
K-theory, harmonic analysis, and quantization. The conference features three
mini-courses by established researchers alongside many contributed talks by
participants, and mentoring activities designed to increase retention of
underrepresented groups in operator algebras. More information about the
conference is available at: https://ymcstara.org.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
