This Smart Health (SCH) award will contribute to the advancement of the national
health and welfare by developing technology to help the millions of people who
have suffered an amputation or who have a congenital deficiency of an upper
limb. These problems create a devastating impact on the quality of the victimsâ€™
lives and pose a significant financial burden to people in the U.S.A.
Unfortunately, the state of the art in prosthetic hand replacements is not
comparable to their popular portrayal in sci-fi movies, leaving upper limb-
absent people with rudimentary control of basic grasp functions. This work will
explore methods to help upper limb-absent people learn advanced control of
sophisticated prosthetic hands with an automated training regimen that can be
used at home. Automating this aspect of healthcare with remote learning
functionality can help disabled people access treatment more quickly and at a
lower cost. Furthermore, research from this grant will be used to create
learning experiences for high school students from low-income households to help
educate the next generation of engineers and scientists. Thus, this research can
benefit the society and economy of the USA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently,
there are numerous options for dexterous wearable co-robot assistants, such as
prosthetic hands, with future devices becoming even more sophisticated. In fact,
the dexterity of these devices is rapidly outpacing the ability for people to
intuitively control them. One main source of this problem stems from the
inability to reliably interpret the intentions of the human operator over the
course of months and years. Another problem is that the science behind
customizable training programs to empower disabled people to harness the full
potential of dexterous assistive robots such as prosthetic hands has not been
deeply explored. This project will address these deficiencies through three main
endeavors: (1) exploration of a novel bimodal skin sensor to overcome
limitations with current sensors, (2) investigation of the utility of machine
learning algorithms to classify the intention of human operators, and (3)
creation of a new reinforcement learning paradigm to sequentially introduce
customized, subject-specific muscle training exercises over time to maximize
biocontrol signal classification accuracy and the number of independent
biocontrol channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
