Protista is a complex assemblage of organisms, many of which are only distantly
related. Euglenophyta is clearly phylogenetically distinct from the remaining
protists; however, the ingroup phylogeny of the division is only poorly
understood. Previous studies have focussed on cellular detail determined by
electron microscopic investigation of aspects of the flagellar apparatus and
cell division. The PI intends to combine details of ultrastructural (from the
literture and this study) with molecular sequence data from the 18s-like rRNA.
The PI will use parsimony analysis to infer the phylogeny of this group, and
based on that phylogeny, to revise the classification system of the division.
Findings may have relevance to our understanding of higher organisms.
