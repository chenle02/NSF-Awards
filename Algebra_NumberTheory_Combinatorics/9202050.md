This awards supports the research of Professor Z. Ran to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on deformation theory of varieties, study moduli spaces
of polarized varieties as well as questions about properties of projective
varieties. He will also study Hodge theory for holomorphic maps. The research is
in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10
years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated
figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.
Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and
topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it
has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer
science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
