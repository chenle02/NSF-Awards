The research in matrix balancing and its application to data adjustment in
economics will investigate (1) diagonal scaling problems, (2) preconditioning
methods for nonlinear network optimization, and (3) second-order scaling
algorithms. Balancing problems arise in many diverse fields, including
economics, urban planning, image processing, and stochastic modelling. The PI's
propose to implement scaling algorithms and specialize a truncated Newton
algorithm for solving problems arising in the application area of their
expertise-- namely, general equilibrium modelling-- in the belief that it will
have application beyond that specific area. To address modeling issues and
applications of this theoretical and algorithmic research they propose as future
work the integration of their algorithms within high-level algebraic modelling
languages. This will allow them to conduct experiments with real problems and
will facilitate the dissemination of their work to a wide audience. Support for
this future research is currently being sought from funding agencies other than
NSF.
