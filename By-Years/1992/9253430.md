This project builds on a developed prototype learning environment, a computer-
based design tool that enables girls to create machines by starting from their
own imaginative vantage points. "Imagine" is a graphics program that supports
students in designing objects, animating them, and adding sound and visual
effects. The principal investigator proposes to refine and complete the
development of the existing prototype and create a set of curriculum activities
that can be used in conjunction with the ongoing math and science curricula.
This proposal expect to attract girls, particularly urban minority girls, to
engineering and related professions.
