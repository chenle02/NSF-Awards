This award supports two projects to use GPS geodesy to determine the vertical
and horizontal positions of survey markers spaced at crucial locations across
the active Himalayan deformation that marks the collision zone between the
Indo/Australian Plate and the Euro/Asian Plate. The first of these projects is
to conduct measurements in Nepal, the second to undertake measurements in
Pakistan. The PIs will remeasure the GPS control points after a period of
several years to monitor their relative motions, and thereby determine the
strain field along the two traverses. The projects are being established as
long-term collaboration between v.s. scientists and counterparts in Nepal and
Pakistan.
