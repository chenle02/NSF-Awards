Phototransduction is the process whereby light energy is converted into an
electrical signal in the photoreceptor membrane. The goal of this research
project is to gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie phototransduction
in the photoreceptor cells of the eye. Photoreceptor cells, isolated from the
eye of the fruitfly, Drosophila, will be used as a model system, since the
phototransduction process in the fly retina is similar to that in the vertebrate
retina, including those of mammals. When light strikes the eye, a cascade of
biochemical events occur within the photoreceptor cells. At the endpoint of the
cascade, an unknown intracellular messenger molecule causes "light-sensitive"
ion channels in the photoreceptor membrane to open. The opening of the ion
channels causes the cell membrane to undergo a change in its electrical
potential which is responsible for the transmission of visual information to the
brain. The study will focus on the role of ion channels in the phototransduction
process and identify the intracellular messenger molecule which activates and
modulates the activity of light sensitive channels. Experiments utilizing the
electrophysiological technique of patching clamping will be used to examine the
role of ion channels in this process. This technique will permit the Principal
investigator to examine the function of all channels in the membrane acting in
unison or examine single channels isolated in small membrane patches. Results
gained from these studies will aid in understanding the function and regulation
of ion channels involved in the visual system.
