Technical Merit: The technical merit of this proposal is to facilitate enhanced
participation of young polymer scientists in a Gordon Conference that addresses
several key areas at the frontiers of polymer science and engineering. The
invited speakers are internationally known, world class experts in their
respective areas of polymer physics, chemistry and engineering, as well as
emerging young stars. Another criterion that is viewed as an important measure
of the success of a GRC is attendance and active participation of young
researchers who are diverse. For many of us, including the Chair and Co-Chair of
this conference, early career attendance at GRCs provided scientific
stimulation, development of professional relationships, and collaborations with
other scientists that have been important in our professional
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The broader impact lies in the
cultivation and development of tomorrow?s leaders in the polymer field and
related interdisciplinary fields and to further diversity in the scientific
force performing this interdisciplinary research. In keeping with the past
tradition of what was previously named the Polymers (West) GRC, the Programmatic
Themes of this year?s conference cover a range of important and timely topics
spanning the range from polymer synthesis to polymer physics and engineering,
including industrial trends in polymer science. These programmatic themes
include polymer thinfFilm mechanical properties and patterning, polyelectrolytes
for DNA complexation and cellular delivery, charged polymers for biomaterials,
complex micelle assembly, polymer nanoparticles and nanotechnology, and the
theory of charged polymer assembly.
