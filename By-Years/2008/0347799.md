Broad coverage dictionaries and ontologies for natural language processing (NLP)
are difficult and costly to create and maintain by hand. It is therefore
desirable to learn them from distributional information, such as can be obtained
from unlabeled or sparsely labeled text corpora. Many linguistic and
psycholinguistic theories are distributional, but emphasize local neighborhood
structure more than do previous NLP approaches. Successful visualization
techniques such as keyword-in-context also rely on the preservation of
neighborhood structure. A similar emphasis is present in emerging techniques for
data reduction, such as LLE and min-cut algorithms, whose application to
language data the project is investigating.

While the immediate goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of
lexical tuning and acquisition, the resulting dictionaries, ontologies and
mapping techniques have the potential to help information professionals (such as
librarians, translators, patent examiners and paralegal researchers) to navigate
through corpora, to understand the significance of the data that they see, and
to incorporate insights derived from the data into their working practice.

The PI and his students are also integrating computational linguistics into the
undergraduate curriculum of the Department of Linguistics and creating new
courses designed primarily to appeal to students majoring in the humanities in
order to offer such students fresh options in meeting the scientific,
mathematical, and quantitative components of the university's breadth
requirement.
