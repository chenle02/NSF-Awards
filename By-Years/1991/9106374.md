The recent development of the atomic force microscope toward obtaining images
from insulator surfaces opens the possibility of insulator cluster studies.
Clusters from fundamentally and technologically important elements like silicon
and carbon need to be studied for an understanding of many properties and
processes concerning these materials in their various bulk crystalline
configurations and surface structures. Clusters will be deposited on various
crystalline substrates and the atomic arrangements will be imaged by atomic
force microscopy (AFM). The AFM results should provide new information on the
static and dynamic behavior of the clusters in addition to cluster-substrate
interactions. Size- selected clusters will be deposited on single crystal
supports in ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) using an ion-sputter generation source and a
quadrupole mass separator. The substrates will be prepared by standard UHV
surface preparation methods, namely ion sputtering, annealing, low-energy
electron diffraction, and Auger analysis. Electronic velocity filtering
deposition of the ionized cluster beam will ensure gentle deposition of the
particles. Deposition on different types of substrates will show eventual
changes in the cluster geometries and the substrate lattice upon adsorption.
Advances in this field have implications for currently used industrial processes
and fields like microelectronics, sensors, catalysis, coating technology,
materials science, engineering of semiconductor materials, and heterostructures.
