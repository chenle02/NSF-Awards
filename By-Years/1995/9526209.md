# ATM-9526209 Yung A one-year feasibility study is proposed which is aimed at
improving the knowledge and understanding of HOx in the stratosphere and
mesosphere and ozone in the troposphere. The program consists of two elements:
retrieval of the integrated vertical column of OH and tropospheric ozone
measured by ground-based high resolution UV-visible spectroscopy, and modeling
of the temporal variations in the observed quantities. The (independently
funded) spectroscopic measurements will be performed at JPL's Table Mountain
Observatory using direct solar absorption for OH and zenith solar scattering for
O3. The model calculations will be performed using the Caltech-JPL one-
dimensional photochemical model. The observed diurnal and seasonal variability
of the OH column density will be compared with model calculations to test our
understanding of HOx kinetics and photochemistry and the spatial and temporal
distributions of other stratospheric species that affect the HOx budget.
