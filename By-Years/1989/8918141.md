The research described in this proposal is concerned with modelling and
correcting the deleterious effects of instrumental polarization in imaging
systems. It is motivated by applications in biomedical microscopy, and uses
microscopy as a theoretical and experimental model system, but the problems,
methods, and results of this research are of broad significance in optical
engineering. Models for image formation, degradation and restoration will be
based on the polarization aberration expansion, decomposing polarization
variations in the pupil in a manner analogous to classical wave aberration
theory. Models for two and three-dimensional imaging in tow specific systems,
the polarization and differential interference contrast microscopes, will be
developed and tested by experimental observations. Image quality will be
evaluated by point-spread and modulation transfer functions. Methods for
measuring polarization aberrations will be sought. Understanding image
formation, degradation, and restoration in polarization-sensitive systems will
provide guidance for future instrument designs, and will support a unified
approach to system design through understanding the respective contributions and
tradeoffs of the optics, image sensor, and post- processor.
