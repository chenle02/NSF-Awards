The research is directed onto the influence of electrical and magnetic fields on
fresh concrete. The first focus of the research is on the performance of
concrete which has been exposed to an electric field while still in the plastic
state. The second part of the research is directed to the magnetic properties of
concrete in its fluid state. This project is one supported under the Creativity
Awards for Engineering Students.
