The goal of this project is to develop techniques for creating a knowledge base
containing the design history of software intensive systems and to develop
prototype tools for using this knowledge to reduce life cycle costs for these
systems. A formalism using concepts from object oriented programming will be
used in automating or aiding in some aspects of many of the stages in the
software life cycle, including design, implementation, and maintenance. The
phase I effort will include completion of the formalism and the development and
documentation of prototype tools for the creation and application of the
knowledge base. These tools will be applied to some simple systems and the
results will be evaluated to determine their utility in large systems. It is
expected that these techniques will result in significant improvements in
current applications and facilitate the use and integration of future
developments in Computer Aided Software Engineering.
