A person's sense of control over his or her life is central to psychological
well-being. What shapes a person's sense of control? This research examines the
ways in which employment status and job characteristics; marital status, family,
and characteristics of the home, and the intersection of work and family shape
the sense of control among men and women. More and more women are entering the
work force. Many are both full-time employees and homemakers and mothers. This
may cause role overload and conflict. Compared to men, many women work in jobs
in which earnings are low relative to their level of education, and in which
they have little autonomy or ability to make decisions. With the employment of
wives, some husbands are taking on more responsibilities at home, especially
child care responsibilities. These changing conditions at work and at home may
shape people's sense of control. The sense of control over one's life, as
opposed to helplessness and powerlessness, may decrease depression, anxiety, and
distress, because it increases the will and ability to cope with life's
problems. It is a crucial link between social conditions and psychological well-
being. This study will survey a representative sample of 2,000 American adults
throughout the U.S., measuring conditions of work and home, sociodemographic
characteristics such as employment and marital status, socioeconomic status and
age; the sense of control; and depression, anxiety, anger, and other
psychological outcomes. It will assess how job conditions as well as conditions
at home, affect a person's sense of control. The investigator will also examine
ways in which work and family interact to shape the sense of control, and
develop models of the ways in which the sense of control affects levels of
depression, anxiety, malaise anger, and self esteem of women and men.
