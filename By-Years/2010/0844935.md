This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traditional separation between the
"structure-only" Database world and the "text-only" Information Retrieval world
is fading. Databases now routinely include text components while documents are
being augmented with structural information. The goal of this project is to
design novel techniques and develop tools to efficiently query and retrieve
relevant information in a heterogeneous data environment where flexibility in
conditions on both the content, the structure of the data, and the response to a
query is desirable. The first main contribution of the project is the design of
quality scoring mechanisms that unify content and structure score in an
integrated fashion. The scoring techniques take into account the similarity
between the query and the answer to assign scores. The second main contribution
of the project is the development of heterogeneous data index structures and
query processing algorithms to efficiently identify exact and approximate query
answers and provide the answers in the order of relevance to a query. The work
resulting from this project will be evaluated through an in-depth study of the
impact of the scoring strategies on answer quality and performance experiments
on the query processing techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
project are expected to enable users to identify the data that best fits their
needs, in a variety of heterogeneous data environments, without requiring some
preexisting knowledge of the underlying data schema or content. This project
integrates research and education through curriculum development, student
advising, and outreach to women in Computer Science. Results of this project,
including publications, data sets and software will be made available on the
project website (http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~amelie/RelaxedQ/).
