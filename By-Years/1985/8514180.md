This research is concerned with the establishment of an engineering base for the
synthesis and processing of refractory powders in thermal plasmas. The emphasis
of the work is on the development, analysis, and diagnostics of a radio-
frequency of plasma reactor, suitable for the synthesis of refractory powders,
in particular of simple and complex metal oxides. Diagnostic methods include
emission spectroscopy, laser-Doppler anemometry, laser-induced fluorescence
spectroscopy, and high speed photography. The refractory powders are analyzed
using primarily electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, BET and Auger
Spectroscopy. Modeling work is to include the plasma reactor itself, the
particle motion, heating, melting, and evaporation in the plasma, and the
ensuing chemical reactions and product formation.
