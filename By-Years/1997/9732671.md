This project will investigate numerical algorithms for solving moderate to large
scale eigenvalue and generalized eigenvalue problems. A variant QR algorithm is
being developed for solving the algebraic eigenvalue problem. The new algorithm
avoids the phenomenon of shift blurring that dramatically slows the rate of
convergence of the conventional multi-shift QR algorithm. The new approach shows
promise of being able to use nearly any number of simultaneous shifts without
substantial adverse affect on the converge rate. It should achieve "BLAS-3 71
speeds on computers with advanced architectures including hierarchical cache
storage and instruction pipelining. In addition, the variant algorithm will use
an early deflation procedure that promises to substantially reduce the number of
Hessenberg QR steps needed. A generalized algebra of relations is being used to
analyze and modify algorithms for moderately large scale eigenvalue problems.
These include the inverse free spectral divide and conquer algorithm and other
generalizations of the matrix sign function. The location/verification problem
for the large scale eigenvalue problem will also be attacked. The initial
approach will use a rational function approximation to the trace of a spectral
projection in order to count eigenvalues inside a target region. The
computational work required by this approach is expected not to be closely
related to the number of eigenvalues in the region. This may make it attractive
for locating eigenvalue clusters. In the verification setting, many eigenvalues
in the target region have already been located by some other numerical method,
e.g., a Krylov subspace method. In this case, the approximate trace of the
spectral projector determines whether there are unlocated eigenvalues in the
target region.
