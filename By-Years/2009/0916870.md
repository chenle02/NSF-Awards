Cooperative coevolution is a potent approach to doing large-scale stochastic
optimization. The unsolved game-theoretic challenges inherent in this
computational method are complex and of significant interest to the evolutionary
computation community. This project is advancing the state of the art in
coevolution and is applying it to significantly larger problems than commonly
found in the literature. These challenges, and their solution, have potentially
transformative impact on other co-adaptive environments such as multiagent
reinforcement learning, estimation of distribution algorithms, agent modeling,
and swarm robotics. Coevolution has strong applicability to fields that use
multiagent system models, including multirobotics, biology, economics, land use,
and political science. Better models in these fields can positively affect
society, policy, homeland security, and the environment.
