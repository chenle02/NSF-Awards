Sociolinguistic Variation in American Sign Language, Phase II The project is a
continuation of NSF Grant #93110116. Sociolinguistic variation in American Sign
Language (ASL) will be analyzed based on videotapes of conversational ASL
produced by deaf ASL signers from seven sites in the U.S. (Staunton, Va.,
Frederick,MD., Boston, New Orleans, Kansas City,Mo., Fremont, Ca., and
Bellingham, Wash.), in three different age groups, and of middle-class and
working-class socio-economic status. African American and Caucasian signers are
represented equally. Sociolinguistic variation is variation that shows a
correlation between linguistic items (sounds, handshapes, words, grammatical
constructions) and social factors such as age, ethnicity, gender, region, and
socioeconomic class. Studies of sociolinguistic variation are important because
they inform our understanding of the fundamental nature of language and of how
languages change. This project will focus on variation in a signed language and
hence will allow us to begin to see what kinds of variation characterize all
kinds of human languages and what kinds of variation are modality-specific, i.e.
characteristic exclusively of spoken languages or signed languages. The focus
will be on target variables including 1-handshape signs, signs produced on the
side of the forehead, and variable pronouns. All of these variables occur in
large enough numbers to allow for the same kind of statistical analyses that
have been used for spoken language variation. Lexical variation in the data will
also be analyzed. The result will be a comprehensive description of
sociolinguistic variation in ASL, along with a quantitative analysis of specific
variables. A corollary goal of the project is the preparation of a videotape and
manual about sociolinguistic variation for use by the deaf community at large:
for children, teachers, parents, and community members.
