The study is funded for the development of Th-230 profiling in deep-sea
sediments as a paleoceanographic tool. The first bjective of the research is to
complete a survey of Th-flux in the deep sea based on sediment-trap samples.
Results will be used to determine the extent to which Th-flux varies with
particle flux on an ocean-wide scale. The second objective is to measure
detailed detailed profiles of excess Th-230 in deep-sea sediment cores. The
profiles will be interpreted with a model that assumes a known rain rate of
thorium-230 to the seafloor, to construct records of biogenic calcium carbonate
production and dissolution rates. The focus will be on variations that
accompained the last deglaciation, and the records will be used to test models
which seek to explain the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that occurred
at that time.
