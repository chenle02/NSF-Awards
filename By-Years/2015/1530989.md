Conventional computer network management has serious limitations on granularity,
responsiveness and predictability, which can lead to network failures costing
millions of dollars in critical domains, e.g., public safety and health care.
Today's networks are currently managed under various enterprise policies and
with state-of-the-art tools such as software defined networking (SDN)
controllers. However, the faults and problems in the networks still arise
because there are always cases to which predefined rules and algorithms do not
respond well, causing traffic flooding, congestions, or vulnerability to
attacks. Understanding in-depth of the network behavior patterns and applying
the knowledge in network management and planning are fundamental to providing
new solutions and best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team has developed a
suite of protocols and analytics methods to understand network dynamics by using
software-defined networking (SDN) and machine learning technologies. With this
information the team is able to report abnormal network behavior and alert
potential faults. This allows for much more of the network to be managed
algorithmically, automatically, and intelligently. Specifically, this team's
technology is able to track network flows to a much higher granularity (i.e.
resolution) using SDN technology. However, while current SDN approaches are
better than traditional networks in defining and enforcing rules around network
flows, they do not have a capability to analyze in-depth usage behavior and
dynamically apply such information to improve network management and planning.
By using machine learning techniques (i.e. Deep Learning), the team will develop
the SDNatics software platform that will allow for more advance uses of SDN.
Such improvements should improve security, predictability, speed, and data
volume in network systems.
