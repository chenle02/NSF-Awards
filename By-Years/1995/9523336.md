9523336 Menzel At present there is no quantitative test that will predict the
remaining life of a power cable or assess the extent of damage an insulator has
sustained. We have developed a technique using laser induced fluorescence which
does predict quantitatively the remaining life of power cable artificially aged
in a laboratory. Tests on a few pieces of cable removed from service indicate
that this should also work on field aged cables. The laser fluorescence
technique will be applied to cables removed from service for which the power
company can specify cable type and length of service. The goal is to produce a
reliable and quantitative method for predicting remaining cable life. We already
have qualitative results that show this may be feasible. Success in this work
will result in a method by which sensors can be applied to power cables to
determine the remaining service life. Cables could, therefore, be scheduled for
replacement before failure. ***
