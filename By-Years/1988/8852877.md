This laboratory improvement program involves the development of experimentation
using personal computers for data acquisition and process control. The
experiments will involve temperature, pressure drop and concentration
measurements. Temperature and pressure drop measurements will be used with a
personal computer for both level and temperature control of a third order
system. Enhancement of existing equipment will result. This enhancement will
give chemical engineering students familiarity with the methods by which data
are acquired, transmitted and recorded electronically. Also students will become
familiar with using electronically-acquired data as inputs for computer process
control.
