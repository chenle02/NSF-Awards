This grant supports research that seeks to answer a fundamental question about
matter. What is the nature of any new physics not described by the Standard
Model of electroweak physics? This question will be addressed by the Qweak
experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF). It
will measure the proton's neutral weak charge via parity-violating electron
scattering at very low momentum transfer. The proton's weak charge has a well-
defined prediction in the Standard Model; a precise measurement of it is
sensitive to many popular scenarios for extending the Standard Model. Our group
has built and installed three hardware systems for the experiment - a set of
horizontal drift chambers, a set of luminosity monitors, and halo and low beam
current monitoring detectors. During the period of this grant, we will maintain
our hardware systems during data taking, analyze data, and extract physics
results. We will also begin work on a newly approved TJNAF experiment to test
the Standard Model - the MOLLER experiment - a precision measurement of the
parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on
unpolarized electrons. The projects we are working on involve a wide range of
hardware and software tasks that will contribute to the education of graduate
and undergraduate students working on the project.
