This project concerns quantum gravity---the unification of quantum theory and
general relativity. The Principal Investigator's approach to this problem is
based on the causal set hypothesis, which asserts that the deep structure of
spacetime is granular or ``atomic'' with the atoms (``causal set elements'')
organized into an extended ``family tree'', known technically as a locally
finite partial order. The project will develop this approach further by
advancing the underlying theory, while at the same time applying it to questions
like that of the cosmological constant, which recently has been shown to
contribute roughly two thirds of the effective energy density of the universe. A
primary focus of the project will be on the development of a generalization of
the classical sequential growth dynamics, found previously, to the case of a
quantum causal set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solution of this problem is generally
expected to tell us about the structure of spacetime on the smallest length
scales and, at the same time, to help answer questions about why the cosmos is
as it is on the largest scales. The project also leads to a new way of
understanding time as the continual birth of new elements of the causal set. The
algorithms to be developed and the codes to implement them are not only useful
in connection with discrete spacetime processes but also have a more general
applicability for combinatorial purposes including uses in information
technology. Knowledge obtained in fundamental physics such as that studied in
this project also appeals to members of the public at large and contributes
towards an educated and technically skilled labor force.
