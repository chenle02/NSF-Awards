The DLESE Evaluation Serv ices group will further the DLESE mission through
interaction and collaboration with the other core service entities (DPC,
Community, Collections, and Data Centers) and through its own evaluative and
community-building activities. There are two central goals: building capacity
for sustained evaluation efforts in all parts of DLESE and providing
understanding of the degree to which DLESE is achieving its goals. In order to
meet these goals, the Evaluation service center will serve four important
functions or roles. They are to: 1) develop an overarching DLESE evaluation
plan, 2) serve as central evaluation consultant to the core service centers and
build capacity for evaluation, 3) conduct and coordinate evaluation work needed
to address major DLESE evaluation questions (user characteristics, Broad
Collection quality, classroom impact of DLESE implementation), and 4) collect,
synthesize and report upon the body of findings from all sources. This effort
will address the use and development of digital libraries in general and within
geoscience education in particular. The development of evaluation capacity
within the DLESE community will continue to provide DLESE evaluation data,
promote work that is goal-oriented and reflective, and contribute to the body of
evaluation knowledge specific to geoscience education. The evaluative work
directed at DLESE overarching goals will provide data to guide the further
development of the library.
