MiraCosta College has instituted a new vocational education certificate program
in biotechnology as a result of student and industry demand. The certificate
program is designed around the existing curricula at MiraCosta College with the
addition of two courses specifically focused on biotechnology. One of these
courses, Methods in Biotechnology will require students to conduct laboratory
experiments that teach the underlying molecular biology concepts and techniques
essential to biotechnology.
