The transfer of genetic material between cells outside of reproduction is
horizontal gene transfer and is common within bacterial populations. Gene
exchange changes the activity and functional capabilities of microbes. Control
of gene exchange will enable new experimental methods to understand the function
of microbial communities and will aid in the development of advanced
biotechnologies. Three traditional mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer are
transduction, transformation, and conjugation, although extracellular vesicles
made by most bacterial species also facilitate gene exchange. This research will
analyze the parameters that impact the production and exchange of extracellular
vesicles within bacterial populations to better understand how cells utilize
extracellular vesicles for gene exchange. The broader impacts will be achieved
through work with local STEM organizations to develop hands-on activities to
teach middle and high school students the biophysics of the genome as well as
developing a quantitative modeling of biological processes course for
undergraduates studying biophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vesicle-mediated gene
transfer may be a universal route of gene exchange within microbial populations,
although parameters that modulate the efficiency of gene exchange through
vesicles remain unclear. The project examines how the formation and uptake of
DNA containing extracellular vesicles are influenced by characteristics of the
exchanged genetic material and the donor and recipient bacterial species,
including properties of the outer membrane. Transposon mutagenesis screens will
reveal additional factors that regulate the dynamics of vesicle-mediated gene
transfer. Gene transfer into wild isolates will be experimentally measured and
theoretically modeled to assess the contribution of vesicles to gene exchange in
wild populations. A quantitative understanding of the processes that shape the
dynamics of gene transfer in vesicles will help formulate strategies to control
the transfer of specific genetic components within microbial
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
