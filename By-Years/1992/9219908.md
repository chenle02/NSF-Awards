The experimental methods in the proposed research involve the cloning and
sequencing of gap junction genes from the tobacco budworm and the fruitfly. Gap
junction gene fragments will be isolated from cDNA libraries by polymerase chain
reaction amplification using PCR primers synthesized from candidate insect gap
junction protein sequence already in hand. PCR products will be cloned,
sequenced, and used to screen insect cDNA libraries for full length gap junction
genes. Candidate genes will be molecular characterized and confirmed to code for
authentic gap junction protein in functional Xenopus oocyte expression assays
and by immunocytochemistry. Nucleic acid and antibody probes will be developed
against gap junction genes and their proteins for use in future studies which
will utilize Drosophila as a model for investigations on the role of gap
junctions in tissue growth and patterning in multicellular animals. %%% The goal
of the proposed research is to characterize at a molecular level the gap
junctions in insects. Gap junctions consist of plasma membrane-associated
protein channels through which ions and small molecules pass directly between
cells. Gap junctions are thought to be involved in the cellular exchange of
signalling molecules which regulate tissue growth and patterning. Drosophila
provides a powerful experimental model to investigate the involvement of gap
junction-mediated intercellular communication in development.
