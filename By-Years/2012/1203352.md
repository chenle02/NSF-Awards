An award was made to the University of California, Los Angeles to purchase much
needed replacement cabinets for the Donald R. Dickey Collection of Birds and
Mammals. For the past several decades, the collection has resided in
deteriorating 70 year-old wooden cases that can no longer protect specimens from
possible insect and water damage. Funds from this award are being used to
purchase new specimen cabinets that will be housed in a new space-saver system
purchased on a prior grant.

Natural history collections serve as vital records of past ecosystems. The UCLA
Dickey Bird and Mammal Collection houses over 64,000 specimens, a large number
of which were collected prior to the widespread industrialization and population
expansion that occurred after World War II. As a result, it includes specimens
that can provide baseline data on genetic diversity, disease distribution, and
industrial contaminant levels (e.g. mercury) for comparison with post WWII
individuals. In addition, the collection is used to expose thousands of students
to tangible evidence of variation in nature, the relationship of animal form to
function, and evolutionary relationships. Moreover, UCLA faculty, graduate and
undergraduate students, high school interns, and visiting scientists use the
collections for research.
