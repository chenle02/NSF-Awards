9401895 Weiss In this project, the PI will carry out measurements of anthropo-
genic Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC0, F-11 and F-12, along the latitude 20 degrees
South, the IO WHP section denoted as I-3. The PI will also provide CFC
analytical equipment for use by other measurement groups for other IO sections.
Specific objectives of this work in- clude studies of propagation rates of
Antarctic Bottom Water into the deep Indian Ocean and studies of mixing and
transport processes in the thermocline and Antarctic Intermediate Water of this
region. Results will be applied to improving models of mixing processes and
determining their role in global climate change, and, particularly, on the
oceanic modulation of carbon dioxide and other important atmospheric
constituents. ***
