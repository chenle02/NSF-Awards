This award is for support of a three year collaborative program between the
University of Colorado, Boulder and the University of Wyoming, Laramie to
improve and validate glacier dynamic models. An isothermal, active glacier will
be selected and the surface, englacial, and basal velocity field will be
determined on a 3-D array of points over the glacier. These results will be used
to test an improved top-down model, to compare top-down and bottom- up models,
and to define further the constitutive law and sliding relations.
