This research program will develop mathematical techniques to automatically
prove the robustness of computer programs operating under uncertainty. The aim
is to bridge the gap between control-theoretic studies of robustness, on the one
hand, and program semantics and analysis on the other. In cyberphysical systems,
where sensor-derived data from the physical world is intertwined with
computations, uncertainty arises from volatile or erroneous sensor data. Such
systems demand predictable responses to perturbations of the system's initial
conditions, otherwise they will be unreliable. The project has three themes: (1)
Theory: It will create comprehensive semantics of robustness properties such as
continuity and stability in the setting of imperative programs over complex data
types. (2) Algorithms: Analysis algorithms are needed to prove robustness of
programs, or alternately find violations of robustness. Scalable, lightweight
analyses will be developed along with precise but heavyweight methods. (3)
Tools: These analyses will be implemented in tools applicable to software for
real-world cyber-physical systems.
