This proposal aims to improve the quality of undergraduate teaching in
Mechanical Engineering by enhancing the contents and available laboratory
equipment of the senior level course of Mechanical Engineering Laboratory II.
The approach used in teaching this course is by "hands-on" procedures. This
proposal seeks funding towards the improvement of current weaknesses by: (1)
Modernizing the current instrumentation of a rotatory compressor by interfacing
it to a computer data acquisition system such that students get involved, at
least once, in the use of such kind of systems thus retrieving on line
information that can be used to monitor the performance of the entire unit and
perform mass and energy balances; (2) Acquiring a laboratory unit for the study
of noise control, and (3) Acquiring a laboratory unit for the study of
combustion parameters and emissions control. It is expected that this course
will also assist on providing supplementing material other than classroom for
the courses of Thermal Sciences.
