This ocean sciences technology development project will develop and construct
three new broadband autonomous seismic instruments to be used for 1) compliance
measurements on the seafloor, 2) the development and testing of new sensors for
broadband seismology and other geophysical applications and 3) studies of the
variations in ocean floor seismic noise in preparation for the installation of
permanent seafloor seismic observatories. The instruments will be based on STS-2
three component seismometers. The primary work required involves fitting the
sensors into motor driven gimbals within the glass pressure housings after
installing a clamp/unclamp system onto the sensors. Broadband seismometers such
as the STS-2 are very fragile and must be clamped when not on the seafloor. The
compliance technique can map regions of melt within the oceanic crust and is
therefore a valuable scientific tool for understanding the formation of the
oceanic crust. Better instruments are required to continue the development of
this technique and to extend the use of this technique to new geophysical
features such as hydrates and hydrothermal areas. Once developed and
constructed, the instruments will be placed is a pool of shared-use equipment
accessible by the whole research community.
