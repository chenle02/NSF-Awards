This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the
subfield of surface science. Professor Zaera will study metastable adsorbates
chemiabsorbed on single crystal surfaces using a host of spectroscopic methods.
This research will focus on detecting highly hydrogenated carbonaceous fragments
on clean metal surfaces using reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy during
catalytic reactions. The results from this project will be useful in
understanding catalytic hydrocarbon conversion reactions and in designing new
catalytic processes.
