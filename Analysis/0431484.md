Title: New Mexico Analysis Seminars

PI: Maria C Pereyra et al

ABSTRACT

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New Mexico
will continue the New Mexico Analysis Seminar, an annual conference in Analysis.
This proposal will cover the program from 2004 through 2006. Six successful New
Mexico Analysis Seminars have been held in Albuquerque and Las Cruces over the
last six years. After successful conferences funded by local sources, the last
three conferences have been sponsored by NSF. We have reached a stage where
outside funding is necessary to sustain the growth and quality of the seminars.

The first conference will be held simultaneously with an AMS meeting in
Albuquerque in October 2004. The main speakers are P. Bauman and L. Capogna. The
second conference will be joint with a CBMS-NSF conference to be held Las Cruces
in May 2005, and have as centerpiece the lectures of T. Tao. In Spring 2006 we
will return to our regular schedule.

A large portion of the funds will be used to pay for the travel expenses of the
participants attending the conferences, and for the lecturers.

The seminar has provided an invigorating but not intimidating atmosphere for
young researchers. It has helped foster interactions among mathematicians in the
area and beyond. Participating graduate students have been encouraged to pursue
studies in areas related to analysis. The network of Southwestern analysts has
grown as a result of these annual meetings. One of the main objectives is, and
has been, to provide graduate students with exposure to the forefronts of
research in analysis, and to make the seminar a vehicle for them to present
their work. The organizers are deeply committed to encourage graduate students,
female, and minority participation in the mathematical sciences in future
seminars. The list of past and future main speakers as well as the topics of the
short talks demonstrate the vitality of Analysis taken in a broad sense and the
determination of the organizers to make this conference a forum for the
presentation of the latest significant results in the area.
