The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate applications of a new high-
performance mechanical gearbox. Electric motors account for approximately 23
percent of electricity consumed in the United States and roughly 63 percent of
manufacturing sector electricity. An improvement in geared motor technology can
help realize energy savings. A magnetic gear creates speed change without any
physical contact, requires no gear lubrication, has inherent overload
protection, has low acoustic emissions and low starting torque. Due to its
contact-free torque production, a magnetic gear has the potential for a long
lifetime while operating at high efficiency. This project will advance the
development of a magnetic gearbox, with many potential
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project explores the trade space of magnetic gearboxes with
regard to efficiency, thermal stability, and torque density and the potential
trade-offs with respect to cost. Multiphysics-based numerical and analytic
modeling co-design techniques will be utilized to explore the thermal and
mechanical sizing trade-offs impacting the efficiency of the magnetic gears
while mitigating magnet demagnetization. The proposed designs will utilize a
unique laminated magnet array combined with the laminated slotted modulator. The
project will explore the design trade-offs with respect to stack length and
mechanical deflection in the context of the magnetic and thermal design. The
project will demonstrate the efficiency and performance capabilities of a
magnetic gearbox compared with an equivalently sized mechanically geared
motor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
