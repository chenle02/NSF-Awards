The major objective of this project is the further development and elaboration
of a multisectoral, intertemporal, nonlinear programming model to analyze the
effects on the Indian economy of restrictions on the emission of greenhouse
gases. This project will also advance a secondary objective of constructing
prototype models for other developing counties. This study is motivated by the
presumption that the developing countries may become important emitters of
greenhouse gases and by the conviction that policy formation with respect to
greenhouse gas emissions requires country level analyses. Unique features of
this model include: the tracking of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide,
the formulation of the greenhouse gas restrictions in terms of their total
radiative forcing effect rather than in terms of current emissions rates, the
identification of emissions that create ground-level air pollution, and
allowance for retrofitting of capital equipment. This research is important
because it will provide a much needed framework for being able to begin
analyzing the economic and social consequences of greenhouse-gas abatement on an
international scale.
