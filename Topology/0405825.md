Davis and Januszkiewicz plan to continue their research on geometric group
theory, nonpositively curved spaces and L^2-cohomology. The major portion of
their work will focus on the new theory of the ''weighted L^2-cohomology'' of
the complex associated to a Coxeter group. The "weighting" depends on word
length in the Coxeter group and a positive real parameter q. When q is integral,
the theory is intimately tied to the ordinary L^2-cohomology of buildings. As q
varies from 0 to infinity the theory interpolates between ordinary cohomology
and cohomology with compact supports. Davis and Januszkiewicz are trying to
calculate these weighted cohomology spaces when q lies in a certain intermediate
range. They are also trying to extend this theory to other classes of groups
besides Coxeter groups.

The theory of groups generated by reflections plays an important role in many
different areas of mathematics, for example, in Lie theory and in the theory of
algebraic groups. Around 1960 J. Tits introduced the notion of a "Coxeter
group." Synonymous terminology might be an "abstract reflection group." Coxeter
groups form a much wider class of groups than do the classical examples of
geometric reflection groups. Recently, they have become important in geometric
group theory both as a source of new examples and as a paradigm for predicting
new results. The new research on weighted L^2-cohomology has revealed some
unexpected connections between several different topics in the theory of Coxeter
groups. Much more remains to be discovered.
