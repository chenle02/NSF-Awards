Despite their importance as recyclers, symbionts, and pathogens, fungi are among
the least known terrestrial organisms. This project focuses on the mushrooms and
other fungi collected by George F. Atkinson, now stored in the Cornell Plant
Pathology Herbarium. Atkinson described over 300 new fungi from the Northeastern
US in the late 1800s and early 1900s, while amassing a collection of about
109,000 preserved specimens. The project will result in digital access to
specimen information, linked with Atkinson?s own notes and images of living
fungi, and will stabilize the specimens themselves for long-term preservation.
An important impact of the project will be to improve understanding of the
diversity and distribution of fungi, a critical group in that about 95% of
fungal species have not yet been described by science.

The project will introduce many undergraduate students and citizens to the
value and uses of biological collections, including them in all aspects of
collection management. It will promote public appreciation of fungi and their
ecological impacts through identification workshops, forays, and exhibits.
Project outreach will also be provided through the collection's website, and
through a series of articles about Atkinson and his fungi on the Cornell
Mushroom Blog.
