The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. George Stefano of the State University of New York/College at Old Westbury
and Dr. Janos Salanki of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences/Balaton Limnological
Research Institute is to study basic neurobiological phenomena of opiate peptide
and opiate receptor in simple organisms. Joint efforts will use well
characterized invertebrate nervous systems of mollusks as models for elucidation
of opioid mechanisms in general. The research should yield more information
concerning opioid systems in evolutionary primitive and structurally simple
organisms and provide a basis for comparison with vertibrate characteristics.
Results will test the hypothesis that the structure of the subject neuropeptides
has been conserved over time, with minor modifications. This project in
neurobiology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
