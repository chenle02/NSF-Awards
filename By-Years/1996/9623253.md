959623253 GUO A plasma is a collection of fast-moving, charged particles.
Although most matters in the universe are of forms of plasmas, the main goal of
the plasma study is to control fusion. When collisions among particles are
ignored, there are many interesting steady states in a collisionless plasma. The
proposer studies their dynamical stability which has potential applications in
the plasma control problem. %%% A plasma is a collection of fast-moving, charged
