This award supports the partnership between the National Society of Hispanic
Physicists (NSHP) and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native
Americans in Science (SACNAS). The aim of the partnership is to increase the
presence of physics, broadly defined, at the SACNAS National Conference. This
annual conference is an opportunity for a talented group of predominantly
Hispanic and Native-American students to interact with students and
professionals in their disciplines, to present their research results, to learn
about cutting-edge research, and to attend a variety of professional development
sessions. This award will support the travel of a total of approximately forty
students over three years to the conference. The award will also support the
attendance of four professionals per year; these will be NSHP members who
participate in the NSHP sessions and judge the physics and physics-related
presentations. The award is supported by the Division of Physics, the Division
of Materials Research, and the Division of Astronomical Sciences.
