0112641&lt;br/&gt;Schiffman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support of the costs of acquiring a new electron microprobe for the Department
of Geology at the University of California, Davis. The Principal Investigators
are all teaching and research faculty members in the Department of Geology. The
P.I.'s, their students, and collaborators will utilize this instrument to
further their research on (1) Mafic clay minerals, palagonitization, and
biomineralization, (2) Metamorphic geology and tectonics of convergent plate
margins, (3) Regional metamorphism and the tectonics of mountain belts, (4)
Field and experimental studies in igneous processes, and (5) Thermodynamic
studies of minerals and ceramics. In addition, the new electron microprobe will
be used extensively by many other investigators in the Department of Geology, as
well as the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Chemical Engineering and Material
Science, Agricultural Engineering, Land Air and Water Sciences, and the School
of Veterinary Medicine. Although the new electron microprobe will be housed and
administered within the Department of Geology, it will be part of a recognized
campus-wide analytical facility that is available to researchers across the UC
Davis campus as well as from other colleges, universities, and research
organizations across Northern California.
