There are two major closely related themes to this project. The first is the
study of rigidity theorems (i.e. metric uniqueness) on compact manifolds with
and without boundary. The second is the study of sharp isoperimetric
inequalities. Here "isoperimetric inequality" should be interpreted as an
inequality between global geometric quantities (such as volume, volume of the
boundary, eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, lengths of closed
geodesics etc.) while sharp means that the inequalities are the best possible.
They are related in that the case of equality in appropriate sharp isoperimetric
inequalities can lead to interesting rigidity results.We consider for example
isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same spectra (e.g.
eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or Lengths of closed geodesics) be
isometric. This also includes questions about metric rigidity induced by
conjugacy of geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems. Another
theme of the proposal is the study of infinite groups G acting cocompactly on
nonpositively curved spaces H (in the sense of Alexandrov). The project is to
study the relationship between the geometry of H and the induced action of G on
the ideal boundary of H. This is an aspect of geometric group theory.

The rigidity theme of the project concerns the question of whether a space can
be determined by a certain set of data. One part of this relates to questions of
remote sensing. For example: can you determine the density of an object (say a
person's body or the moon) from measurements taken "from the outside"? The CAT
scan is a practical example where one determines the mass density (or more
accurately the absorption coefficient) of an object from measurements of the
total mass along straight lines. An alternative set of measurements is the set
of times it takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary
(this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in the
proposal). A related set of measurements is to record the exit times and
directions of geodesics given their entry directions (this is the "geodesic
lens" or "scattering" data). The thrust of the proposed study is to determine
under which circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of
closed geodesics, distances between boundary points, lens data) are sufficient
to completely determine the geometry of the spaces in question. In some cases it
is non-uniqueness that is interesting. For example, in cloaking the goal is to
make it the space in question (the object to be cloaked) appear from the outside
like a different space (empty space).
