It is proposed the "continuous particle ablation process" with the following
goals: (1) Ultrafine particles to be produced with exceptional purity (fiber
optics grade); (2) Both single component and stoichiometrically correct compound
particles, including coated or capped particles, can be produced; (3) Particle
shape should be spherical and agglomerates are not acceptable; (4) The process
should be amenable (both technically and economically) to scale up to kg/h
production rates. Essentially, micrometer or supermicrometer aerosol particles,
produced upstream by conventional methods of aerosol technology are continuously
flow in a carrier gas in a supersonic jet through the focus of a pulsed laser
beam, where they are continuously ablated/vaporized to vapor and seed clusters.
These seed clusters can grow subsequently by condensation to produce nearly
monodisperse nanometer clusters. Downstream, the clusters can be processed and
modified chemically, if desired, and used in any specific application. The
ablation and growth processes in the supersonic jet will be modeled numerically
to obtain a fundamental understanding of this complex process and as an aid in
subsequent scale up of the process. The proposed process will provide a
significant advancement in production of ultrafine, ultrapure particles at high
rates.
