Biometrics, such as fingerprints, provide a great tool for personalized
authentication. While people are usually willing to submit their biometric
information to government agencies, they are less likely to do so for commercial
companies without a guarantee of privacy protection. This project will have
significant societal impact by triggering wide acceptability of large-scale
biometrics enabled applications. The primary technological hurdle faced by large
scale biometric systems today is the ability to address two competing
objectives: (1) provide fast matching of a biometric against a large database of
stored biometric readings and (2) provide privacy of the biometrics in the
database such that it can withstand malicious attacks. Existing solutions tackle
either of the two problem but not both simultaneously. Tackling the two problems
in an integrated fashion is non-trivial as any solution to conceal the biometric
data to ensure privacy involves breaking down the structure inherent in the
biometric template, thus making it extremely challenging to index the records
efficiently. This project presents a unified approach by developing
"cryptographically hidden" biometric templates which will lend themselves to
fast searches. This effort will draw upon new research in the fields of
biometrics, databases, and coding theory.
