The "Plant Genomes: From Sequence to Phenome Conference" will be held December
9-12, 2004, at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, as the fifth conference in the
winter series focused on the theme of plant genomes. The meeting will focus on
functional and evolutionary genomics in a diverse range of plants, and will
serve to explore themes and technologies from other genomes including animals
and fungi. There will be six sessions, focusing on regulatory networks and gene
expression, proteomics, phenomics, genome organization and evolution, new
genomes and annotation, and chemical genomics/metabolomics. A central theme of
the entire conference will be the integration of information across large and
varied data sets, and how this may be best achieved, presented and distributed.
It is hoped that this meeting will provide a mechanism for the establishment of
new collaborations, and a forum for discussing new experimental and conceptual
approaches.
