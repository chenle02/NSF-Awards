The objective of the project is to reveal new and fundamental insights into the
error-scaling problem for ultra-precision applications in design and
manufacturing and answer long-standing questions about quantitative design of
geometric tolerances in roundness. This error-scaling problem arises when the
uncertainty of precision becomes unacceptably large as the size of the critical
features approaches in magnitude the size of the repeatability achieved during
manufacturing. A collaboration is formed to develop a quantitative technology
for designing and achieving quality assurance for manufacturing precision round
components and assemblies, such as fuel injectors and spindles. Although
engineers are now better trained in assigning proper size tolerance, at present
there does not exist a quantitative methodology for assigning geometric
tolerances such as roundness.

Furthermore, the error-scaling problem that is critical to the manufacture of
small scale (meso, micro, and nano) devices. As a result, fundamental
definitions of quality assurance indices will be revisited via a new probability
analysis considering truncated and skewed distributions in the region of
significant error-scaling problems. These improved indices can then be
incorporated into successful quality assurance approaches such as TQM and Six-
Sigma. Roundness issues have great economic and social impacts. The development
of low-emission diesel engines requires clean diesel fuel, electronically
controlled fuel injection, and high injection pressure. Achieving a high
injection pressure (over 30 ksi) requires a very precise control of fit
conditions between the nozzle and the injector plunger, which in turn depends
critically on the roundness of the plunger and nozzle bore. The proposed
roundness technology is also critical for miniaturization techniques in imaging,
in telecommunication, in lithography, and in many other fields.
