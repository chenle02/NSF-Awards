9303764 Collins Based on the low leakage, room temperature detector performance
demonstrated in a successful Phase I program, AstroPower is proposing further
development of gallium phosphide detectors for nuclear particle detection under
operating conditions of room temperature or above. The Phase II program will
focus on developing and integrating the Phase I findings into high performance
detectors. The detectors designs that will be developed can be used in three
different room temperature device configuration: (i) a single junction low
energy spectrometer or high energy encounter, (ii) a single junction, thin
{SYMBOL 68 \f "Symbol"}{SYMBOL 69 \f "Symbol"} detectors, and (iii) a multiple
junction medium to high energy spectrometer. These devices require the
development of epitaxial growth techniques that yield high resistivity, thick
layers with high crystalline perfection, and the development of processing
techniques that yield high diode breakdown voltages. An important objective of
this is to determine the specific energy range capabilities of GaP. It is
expected that gallium phosphide will be a superior replacement for silicon and
germanium for a wide energy range of protons, alpha particles and photons in
harsh environments.
