9614924 Klavans A major obstacle to the further development of digital
libraries, and the national information infrastructure as a whole, is the lack
of adequate means of providing digital objects on any basis other than free,
unrestricted access. Publishers wish to specify terms of use and ensure those
terms are enforced (optionally collecting payment), before providing valuable
materials on the net. While the latter topics are the subject of much commercial
activity, the former seems to have been largely neglected. This workshop will
attempt to begin a process of defining a common machine-readable language for
expressing the terms and conditions of use of electronic objects, and more
generally assess alternative frameworks and means for the technologies of terms
and conditions in a distributed network-based environment.
