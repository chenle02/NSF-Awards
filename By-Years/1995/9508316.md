The northern Appalachians contain a number of exotic terranes, accreted during
the closure of the Iapetus ocean that involved elements of North America and
Laurentia as well as Gondwana. However, the timing, geometry and terrane
positions are still incompletely known. This project will focus on the western
margin of Avalon, one of the more important terranes, in Maine, and the Maritime
provinces of eastern Canada and will involve paleomagnetic, geochronologic and
tectonic investigations. Results will be useful in testing the large number of
contrasting tectonic scenarios that have been proposed for the Appalachian
Caledonian belt, in particular the tectonic setting and locations of major
arc/back arc systems in the southern portion of Iapetus.
