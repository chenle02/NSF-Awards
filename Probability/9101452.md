Professor Talagrand's research will be in three main areas. He will study lower
bounds for Bernoulli processes with a view to proving a conjecture involving a
norm incorporating the geometry of two Banach spaces. He will continue his
research in isoperimetric inequalities. He will study the notion of type and
cotype in Banach spaces. This research is at the interface of two fields:
probability theory and the geometry of infinite dimensional spaces (Banach
spaces). Probabilistic ideas are useful in understanding Banach spaces and
conversely the quest to understand these spaces leads to new and interesting
questions in pure probability.
