This project explores the role of balanced information diets in information
filtering. Information filtering is an increasingly important response to the
problem of information overload. Community-based information filters are
particularly beneficial because they can they can strengthen communities and
recognize community tastes. The goal of this project is to investigate the
benefits that can be realized by having the information filter balance the
information presented to the user across the available topics. The project will
explore how people forage in information abundance, what interfaces best support
balanced information diets, and how much users like balanced information
filters. The results will be interfaces to information through which users will
receive the right amount of information on each topic, according to their
interest in that topic. The information filter will learn which of the disparate
sources of information are best for which topics, and present articles from the
best sources. The research will also explore the effect of balanced information
filtering on communities. The result will be balanced information filters that
strengthen communities by ensuring sufficient overlap in information diets among
community members.
