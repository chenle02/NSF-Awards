AST 95-29120 PI: J. Richard Gott, III Topology of Large Scale Structure in the
Universe The topology of large scale structure (LSS) of the universe will be
studied through quantitative analysis of a number of important observational
samples (in particular the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Shectman et al. deep
redshift slices, and the COBE DMR Sky Maps) and by comparison with new, very
large N-body and hydrodynamic simulations. This enables investigation of whether
the complex large scale structure seen today with its large voids and great
walls could have arisen from random quantum fluctuations in the early universe
and affords an important new opportunity for cosmological model testing.
