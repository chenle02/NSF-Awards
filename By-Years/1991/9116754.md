This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Parallel Symbolic Computing: Languages, Systems, and
Applications, to be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts October 13-16, 1992. The
co-organizers are Professor Anant Agarwal of the MIT Laboratory for Computer
Science and Robert Halstead of Digital Equipment Corporation, and Professor
Takayasu Ito, Department of Information Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai,
Japan. The objectives of the seminar are to bring U.S. and Japanese researchers
together to discuss important common theoretical and implementation problems,
application areas for parallel symbolic computing, how to move parallelism into
wider use for symbolic computing, and opportunities for research collaboration.
Parallel and distributed computing are becoming increasingly important as cost-
effective ways to achieve high computational performance. Symbolic computing is
widespread in applications and hence parallel symbolic computing is important,
but symbolic computations are notable for their use of irregular data structures
(such as trees, lists, and graphs) and irregular, data-driven operations on
them. As a result, parallel symbolic computing has its own distinctive set of
technical challenges. The seminar will be valuable in making researchers in the
United States and Japan more aware of progress in the other country as well as
helping them learn more about research in their own countries.
