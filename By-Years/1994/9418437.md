9418437 Giletti A principal goal of this research is to understand the
mechanisms and controlling parameters that govern diffusion in minerals,
particularly by cations. The focus will continue to be the feldspars, in order
to develop a systematic and sufficiently comprehensive body of data. These data
will form the basis for a predictive model for cations, including those not
studied. The proposed research will include determining the diffusion mechanisms
and their controlling factors for cations in feldspars, developing a theoretical
basis for predicting diffusion kinetics behavior, continuing to measure the Pb
diffusion in monazite and extend it to other minerals such as titanite and
rutile, and extending determination of Sr diffusion kinetics to mica, apatite
and titanite. The two latter studies are especially important in defining
precisely the diffusion behavior of geochronologically important systems so that
realistic interpretations of th edata can be made. Most of the analytical data
will be determined by ion microprobe.
