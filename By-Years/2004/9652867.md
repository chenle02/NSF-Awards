Faculty from three departments (Mathematics, Biology, Physical Science) prepared
this group proposal. Its goal is to enhance understanding of mathematics,
science, and their interactions and relevance to students. Objectives are to
increase scientific literacy, student awareness of connections between
mathematics and science, critical thinking and problem solving skills, and
ability of future teachers to incorporate math into their classrooms. This
proposal will develop a multidisciplinary, general education level quantitative
reasoning course that will use basic algebra to answer science questions.
Students completing this course should have better problem solving skills and
exhibit a greater level of scientific literacy. Assessment will include
comparison of students in newly developed and preexisting courses through value-
added testing, performance on standardized tests, and tracking student success
in subsequent courses. Dissemination may include presentations, publications,
and a Web page. This project will encourage minority participation in math and
science. Approximately 30% of the students at SOSU are Native American and less
than 20% major in mathematics or science.
