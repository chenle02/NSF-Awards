9724044 Gruissem The goal of this work is to develop a tractable protocol for
gene targeting in higher plants through homologous DNA recombination. Although
homologous recombination transgenes has been reported in the past, the frequency
has been low. The work will use a novel procedure that has been developed by
this laboratory, targeting one the RbcS gene family in Arabidopsis. A
recombinant form of RbcS is first introduced randomly into the genome and this
substrate is then used for recombination events during early development. The
result of recombination between the introduced gene and a resident gene of the
RbcS gene family can be detected by the activation of a transgenic reporter.
Recombination events will be screened for, via reporter gene expression, at the
seedling stage. Once this system has been developed, it will provide a tool for
reverse genetics that has been extremely successful in micro-organisms in the
past, while it has been missing in higher plants.
