Sequestered Proton Domains in Chloroplast Energetics: Resuspending chloroplasts
in sucrose or potassium chloride affects their subsequent response to single
turnover flash excitation and to ATP formation. This breakthrough observation
will be used to determine how and when proton gradients formed as a result of
photosynthetic electron transport in chloropasts are used to synthesize ATP and
the factors effecting these reactions. Since the chemosmotic theory of ATP
synthesis driven by a proton gradient originally postulated by Dr. Peter
Mitchell was generally accepted about 15 years ago there has been a controversy
between those who claim that under in vivo conditions localized proton domains
are involved in the transduction and those who claim that only protons moving
between bulk phases are involved both in vivo and in vitro. The results of this
research have the potential of settling the the controversy and defining the
conditions under which each mechanism holds. Most of the biological energy used
by all organisms is based on this reaction. It, therefore, becomes a keytstone
of our bioenergetic knowledge.
