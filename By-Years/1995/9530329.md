9530329 Osterberg We propose an experimental investigation to connect optical
and electrical properties of glasses with defects on an atomic and molecular
scale. We will measure the electrical transport properties of both pure and
doped fused silica. We will correlate the optical properties of defects in
germanium doped silica with well-known electron spin resonance data, using
optical detection magnetic resonance and light-induced electron spin resonance.
The purpose of this work is to establish a complete picture of photoinduced
optical properties of amorphous silica glass. This work will provide
underpinnings for the fabrication of periodic refractive index changes and space
charge fields in glasses that affect the technological areas ferroelectric
glasses, electronic insulation, optical waveguides and active electro-optic
fibers. Direct applications can be made to photoinduced absorption in the
1.3-1.6 micrometer region in telecommunication fibers, fiber-optic Bragg
gratings, self-organizing optical nonlinearities in glasses and in-fiber all-
optical signal processing. This work is a collaborative effort between Thayer
School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, the Fiber and Electro optics Research
Center, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the Naval
Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.. ***
