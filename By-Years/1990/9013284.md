The Bermuda Biological Station for Research provides resident and visiting
investigators with laboratory facilities and access to unique marine
environments. The Station has an excellent reputation for supporting graduate
training as well as research. Unfortunately, Bermuda's appeal among vacationers
has made it prohibitively expensive for visiting researchers to live off-site,
and the Station's ability to house visitors has been limited. As a response to
this problem, Dr. Knap, Director of the Station, proposes construction of
housing for 20 visiting scientists. The proposed visitor housing will improve
the Station's research impact directly and immediately. The recent growth in
research activity will continue to increase, and a greater variety of research
projects will be attracted to the Station. Increased visitor housing is integral
to the Station's long-range plans for continued leadership in marine studies.
