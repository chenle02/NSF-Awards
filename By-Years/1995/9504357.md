9504357 Ammar The experimental High Energy Physics Group at the University of
Kansas plans to continue its studies of e+e annihilations in the energy region
the upsilon resonances using the CLEO II detector and the CESR storage ring at
Cornell. The topics to be studied include exclusive B decays to charm, exclusive
b-&gt;u transitions, charm meson and baryon decays. The group will take a lead
role in providing the monitor and control system for the upgraded CLEO III
detector to be completed in 1997. ***
