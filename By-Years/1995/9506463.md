9506463 Bado The objective of this research is to develop a high-sensitivity
analytical instrument for determining the chemical composition of various
organic, inorganic, and biological samples. The instrument will employ the time-
of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging technique with
femtosecond laser post-ionization to map with spatial resolution better than 100
nanometers in two- and three-dimensions. TOF-SIMS is a variant of surface mass
spectroscopy and has been proven through prior research to have the capability
for imaging at the predicted sensitivity. In this research phase, the
sensitivity of the analyzer and its imaging capabilities will be increased, and
its design and operation will be simplified. An instrument such as this has many
potential commercial applications. It would be useful in fields including
surface phenomena analysis, environmental sciences, clinical analysis,
catalysis, semiconductor testing, and drug screening.
