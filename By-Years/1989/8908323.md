This award, part of the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative,
will support the collaborative research of Dr. F. Wudl and Dr. P. Pincus at the
Univeristy of California at Santa Barbara. The research will focus on the
preparation, characterization and theoretical studies of rigid carbon-heteroatom
clusters (heterospherophanes). The grant is a joint action of the Divisions of
Materials Research (Solid-State Chemistry) and Chemistry (Organic Synthesis).
Heterospherophanes will be hollow molecular spheres consisting of alternating
benzene rings and heteroatoms such as chalcogen or nitrogen. The heteroatoms
within each cluster will be located, relative to each other, in a cubic closest
packed lattice. The diameter of the sphere's cavity will depend on the nature of
the heteroatom. Due to the high symmetry, electronic character and structural
design of these clusters, they will exhibit unusual condensed matter properties
depending on whether they are neutral or charged. The neutral heterospherophanes
are likely to be hard, high-melting solids. The charged heterospherophanes will
be capable of encapsulating a countercation, producing an atom of macromolecular
dimensions. The encapsulated counterion should also allow the formation of three
dimensional organic metals.
