The University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the University of Pittsburgh are
jointly planning to establish an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center (I/UCRC) for e-Design and Realization of Engineered Products and Systems.
The Center's mission is to serve as a center of excellence in IT enabled design
and realization of discrete manufactured products by envisioning where
information is the lifeblood of an enterprise and collaboration is the hallmark
that seamlessly integrates design, development, testing, manufacturing and
servicing of products around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
Center, a fusion of expertise and resources from the already successful Center
for e-Product Design &amp; Realization at the University of Pittsburgh and the
Center for Manufacturing Productivity at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, is a joint effort to achieve synergy in the development of the enabling
technologies to support the new project development paradigm. The proposed
I/UCRC would leverage the existing talent faculty from complementary engineering
disciplines, infrastructure and experience of each university.&lt;br/&gt;
