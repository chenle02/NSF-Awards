This project addresses issues in machine science. The key thesis is that
optimization of specific classes of industrial machines can have a major impact
on U.S. industrial productivity. More specifically, this project investigates
lever-type roll feed mechanisms. Such mechanisms have wide applications and are
used primarily in the production of sheet metal stampings. Performance is
acceptable for a range speed and feed conditions. Beyond this range, erratic
behavior occurs. This project generates a comprehensive model and entails a
combined theoretical and experimental program to explain the instability.
