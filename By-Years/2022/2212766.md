The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to facilitate effective use of tooth
remineralization treatments by introducing a new tool that is both highly
sensitive to demineralization and robust to confounding factors. If patients are
compliant with the generally recommended dental visit schedule of twice a year,
it is conceivable that the patient may never need to have a primary filling
again. This change in practice has significant patient, dentist and broader
economic benefits. The remineralization treatment may increase the number of
patients who visit their dentist on a regular basis as they can avoid dreaded
fillings. The savings from reducing the time spent on primary filings will
provide dentists with the opportunity to take on new patients and procedures,
while reducing more mundane drilling activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build on the technology
developed for early dental caries detection and will develop the technology for
clinical use and evaluation by dentists. This technology will enable dentists
and hygienists to diagnose caries earlier than previously possible, enabling
early treatment, and significantly reducing the amount of drilling in dentistry.
This Phase II project will develop a probe designed for use in dental offices, a
miniaturized and a ruggedized Brillouin spectrometer. The project will also
conduct lab and user testing, develop software, and develop a scientific version
of the spectrometer. At the end of this Phase II effort, a validated prototype
that will be ready for a clinical trial is expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
