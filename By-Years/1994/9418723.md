This award is for support for a two year collaborative program for the
development of data cumu-lation, as a technique to further exploit the favorable
characteristics (in particular its high radio-metric sensitivity) of the
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor data for mapping surface
features on the polar ice sheets. The work will focus on the quantification of
local surface relief and on the refinement of existing topographic data over the
two focus areas of Green-land and Antarctica. Although no field work is proposed
here, this work is potentially important to anticipated field activity in
northeast Greenland, the Siple Coast ice streams and the ice divide area in West
Antarctica. Characterization of the morphology and ice dynamics of the interior
of large ice sheets is an important component of site selection for deep ice-
core drilling.
