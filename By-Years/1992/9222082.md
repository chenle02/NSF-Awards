This award will support a three day workshop on surgical applications of
robotics, and also will cover advanced sensors, real-time computing, and related
technologies. The workshop will be held in Washington, DC in 1993. The goals of
the workshop are: 1) to identify the progress made in the field in recent years;
2) to identify the major obstacles to progress and determine the research
required to overcome the obstacles; and 3) to identify new research
opportunities created by emerging technologies. This workshop is important since
the area that will be covered is an emerging one that requires interdisciplinary
research to advance technology. The participants will include researchers, end
users, and representatives from surgical device manufacturers, hospitals, and
regulatory agencies. A report will be written that will summarize the results of
the workshop.
