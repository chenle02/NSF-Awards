The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes the commercialization of synthetic
materials that reproduce the structures and functions of mucus gels. Nature
deploys mucus to address a wide range of soft material needs, including as
lubricants, adhesives, and barriers, and natural mucus is currently being
investigated for filling many of these same roles in consumer products. The
synthetic mucins can impact various markets including skincare, dermatology,
healthcare, and materials industries. Furthermore, synthetic analogs of mucins
can advance the scientific frontiers through a better understanding of the role
of mucus in digestive, respiratory, and immune systems. The societal impacts of
this project include the national economic benefits resulting from being the
first to bring to market an entirely new class of biomimetic materials.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address technical hurdles related to the
sustainable scalability, biocompatibility, and tailorability of synthetic mucus
biomaterials. The current commercial manufacturers of natural mucus directly
harvest the mucin biomaterials from animal mucus. Such a practice poses
challenges related to purity, scalability, and reproducibility, which preclude
its incorporation into many of the envisioned applications. To overcome the
challenges, this project designed a synthetic mucin prototype and seeks to
achieve the following goals: i) reconfigure the chemical process to reduce
costs, production time, and environmental impact; ii) understand the tolerance
of epithelial cells to these synthetic mucins; and iii) demonstrate a
relationship between the chemical structure and material properties of synthetic
mucins so they can be tailored to meet particular customer demands. Taken
together, these efforts will remove many of the major barriers to the commercial
viability of synthetic mucins.
