This award provides for half the funds needed to acquire a so- called Total
Station, which is a theodolite for measuring angles, a ranging device for
measuring distances,and a minicomputer to compute the data in the field. Using a
Total Station it is possible to construct very accurate topographic maps,and
other kinds of maps of surficial features on the earth's surface. The PIs intend
to use this Total Station as a critically important part of their active
neotectonic research program; they also plan to use it in the teaching of
undergraduate and graduate courses. This device is now considered to be
necessary for neotectonics studies where it is important to gather efficiently
and accurately data recording positions and elevations on the earth's surface.
MIT is committed to providing the additional funds required for this
acquisition.
