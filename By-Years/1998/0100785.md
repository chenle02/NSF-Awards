AST-0100785&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CORF plays an essential role in defending
the radio frequency interests of the U.S. scientific community before national
and international organizations that deal with the allocation and efficient use
of the radio spectrum. A major CORF activity centers on participation in public
pleadings before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding
allocation and assignment of radio frequencies and other regulatory matters.
During the past 3-years, covering the previous grant period, CORF filed comments
before the FCC in matters related to unwanted emissions of satellite systems,
sharing various radio astronomy bands with the medical telemetry service,
preparations for WRC-00, and other matters. During the coming 3-year period,
CORF is expected to comment on the U.S. implementation of the results of
WWRC-00, U.S. proposals to WRC-03 and possibly WRC-06, and the impact on radio
astronomy of spurious emissions from transmitters on board of satellites, among
others. CORF is also expected to continue working with the FCC on issues related
to millimeter wave spectrum use. &lt;br/&gt;
