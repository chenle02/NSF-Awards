Award Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complexity of problems in computational
neuroscience requires research from multiple groups across many disciplines to
be combined. In order to combine research from multiple groups, there must be an
infrastructure for exchanging model specifications; however, the current use of
multiple formats for encoding model information has hampered model exchange.
NeuroML is a model description language developed in XML (extensible Markup
Language) that was created to facilitate data archiving, data and model
exchange, database creation, and model publication in computational
neuroscience. One of the goals of the NeuroML project is to develop standards
for model specifications that will allow for greater simulator interoperability
and model exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international workshop will be held
in March of 2009 to bring together members of the computational neuroscience
community for further development of the NeuroML specifications. The workshop
participants will include modelers, software developers and experimentalists
with the goal of refining the NeuroML standards for single cell modeling
including the modeling of channels and the biophysical description of cells.
Workshop outcomes will include a list of updates to the standards for the
ChannelML and Biophysics specifications, an agreement from simulator developers
for future support of cell and channel descriptions including optimization of
simulators for large-scale simulations, and a publicly available summary of the
meeting proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
