CTS-9731927 D.T. Shaw SUNY Buffalo SUMMARY This research explores the potential
use of carbon nanotubes as a medium form porous heat pipes. Carbon nanotubes,
20-100 microns in length and 30-400 angstroms in diameter will be synthesized by
thermally dissociating ethylene over an iron catalyst. The carbon nanotubes need
to be unblocked for effective and unobstructed fluid flow. This one year project
consists of two parts(a) the construction of porous nano heat pipes charged with
methanol, and (b) measurement of the heat transfer characteristics of these heat
pipes. The exploratory study will provide valuable information regarding the
feasibility of using carbon nanotubes to form porous heat pipes, which
eventually can be used in the cooling of integrated circuits.
