Working with talented undergraduates, Dr. Donald Kapraun of the University of
North Carolina at Wilmington will study several groups of marine green algae,
using modern methods of microscopy including microspectrophotometric measures of
DNA content. The work focuses on basic patterns of chromosomal change that
accompany speciation in three major groups of multinucleate green algae.
Information will be obtained concerning: basic chromosome number; symmetry of
chromosome complements; euchromatin and heterochromatin content; nuclear DNA
quantity; and guanosine- cytosine content in nuclear DNA. The objective of the
research is to determine what chromosomal modifications correlate with species
diversity in the three groups of marine green algae. In conjunction with
morphological features and other evidence, such data should prove useful in
reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among these plants. In addition, the
study will determine whether marine multinucleate forms, including cellular,
septate coenocytes and non-septate coenocytes, manifest particular and unique
types of chromosomal transformations.
