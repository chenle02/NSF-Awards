This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project carries out mathematical
and numerical studies of potential flows of viscous and viscoelastic fluids. The
Helmholtz decomposition divides the velocity into a rotational part and an
irrotational part. In general, the rotational and irrotational velocities are
both required and they are tightly coupled at the boundary, especially when the
no-slip condition is applied. The project's goal is to develop a framework for
the analysis of both components in the Helmholtz decomposition. Previous NSF
supported studies of this topic by the principal investigator's group showed
that the common opinion that potential flows are irrotational motions of
inviscid fluids in general is not correct: it is neither necessary nor useful to
put the viscosity to zero. There are essentially two irrotational theories:
viscous potential flow and the dissipation method. Viscous potential flow works
best for gas-liquid flows where the viscous normal stress is computed from the
irrotational component. The dissipation method (introduced by Stokes in 1851) is
based on the self-equilibration of viscous stresses for irrotational flow which
do not give rise to forces in the equations: they do work and give rise to
energy and dissipation. Unfortunately, predicting which of these two
irrotational theories will give the better result is not known a priori but is
one of the main goals of this study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viscous potential
flow can be used to study a variety of physical phenomena, including cavitation,
capillary breakup and rupture, Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities (drop and jet breakup), phase change problems involving heat and
mass transfer (nuclear reactors), the viscous decay of capillary-gravity waves,
waves and rupture of moving thin films, Hele-Shaw flows (oil recovery), etc. It
is important to recognize that the theory of potential flows of viscous fluids
is a viable topic with a rich physical content.
