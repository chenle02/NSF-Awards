This research is concerned with improving the efficiency and robustness of
parameter estimation schemes employed by implantable and portable devices for
cardioversion and defibrillation. The goal of the research is to replace the ad-
hoc estimation schemes used in present generation devices by robust estimators
that produce optimal minimum variance estimates for a wide range of unknown
error distributions, and which maintain close-to-optimal performance in the
presence of parameter fluctuations. These objectives are pursued through
estimation schemes that are based on the application of Order Statistic (OS)
operations to the data.
