A novel class of cell adhesion substrates has been developed and partially
characterized. These materials contain covalently attached peptide ligands for
cell-surface receptors, and the particular structure of these peptides is based
on the structure of proteins, called cell adhesion molecules, that mediate cell
adhesion. Such an approach to cell attachment substrates provides a significant
engineering advantage in enhanced control, specificity, stability, and synthetic
ease. These materials may have important applications in cell culture technology
and biomedical materials technology.
