The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is to advance energy storage technology
for the large-scale implementation of renewable energies, such as solar and
wind. Not only would it be useful in large centralized grids, butregions with
isolated micro-grids would benefit greatly from cheap, robust energy storage
that can tolerate a wide range of conditions without negative environmental
impact. The new technology would also find uses outside of energy storage, such
as electric motors, propulsion systems, public transportation, and
satellites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Research (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a practical superconductor-
based bearing for flywheel energy storage applications by overcoming some
limitations that have previously been obstacles to commercialization. We will
explore how new geometries can impact the requirements for stabilization; by
modifying the arrangement of permanent magnets with respect to each other, the
amount of external force required can be reduced. The project will include a
simulation of the electromagnetic fields of the proposed designs and analyzing
the stability, stiffness, efficiency, and other parameters. Substantially
reducing the amount of external force required will allow it to implement
superconductor-based bearings into commercial systems with low-cost, compact,
and efficient cryocoolers that have become widely available in recent years. The
project will improve the safety of flywheel energy storage systems by simulating
a laminar-type flywheel composed of partially decoupled sheets, seeking to
understand failure mechanisms and maximum rotational
speeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
