9507683 Tung Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD is the generally accepted theory of
the strong interactions. There are a variety of important parameters such as the
constituent's particles momentum distributions, etc., that need to be determined
before accurate predictions can be made about the results of high energy
experiments. This research seeks to address such questions and to propose
experimental tests for exploring scattering mechanisms in high energy collisions
at present and future accelerators. The research also will address questions in
the symmetry breaking of the electroweak interactions. ***
