This renewal of Dr. Davis' previous grant, IRI-8801529, will support further
development of his logic-based representation for commonsense spatial and
perceptual reasoning. Past efforts have developed a theory of qualitative
spatial and physical reasoning for predicting interactions of moving objects and
behaviors of kinematic chains. New work will focus on a strategic planner for
simulated and real robots, with emphasis on the use of knowledge in planning of
perceptual actions.
