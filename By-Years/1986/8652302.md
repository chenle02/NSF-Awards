WNET/Thirteen will produce a series of 10 one hour public television programs,
"CHILDHOOD" that will explore how children grow and develop,and how parents and
societies have raised children throughout history and across cultures. Extensive
use of current research and scholarships from the disciplines of developmental
and cognitive psychology, anthropology and sociology, education, history and
culture will be used to create a coherent and revealing view of childhood
development. The series will be heavily promoted on public television, will be
accompanied by a trade book and viewer's guide, and should generate audiences of
more than 10 million viewers in its first series airing, based on prior
experience with the producers prior series, "The Brain"; the accompanying trade
book sold more than 150,000 copies. The producers of this series are highly
skilled at the interpretation of complex scientific subjects on television, with
a number of award-winning series to their credit. They have assembled an
prestigious international team of advisors and consultants. WNET has a realistic
plan for raising the $7.5 million necessary to complete the project from the
PBS/CPB Superfund, corporations, and co-production agreements. An award of
$200,000 in FY 87 and continuing funding of $200,000 in FY 88 based on
satisfactory progress is recommended.
