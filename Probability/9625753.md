9625753 Adler ABSTRACT Super Brownian motion (SBM), currently one of the hottest
topics in Probability Theory, is what one gets by renormalising an infinite
number of branching Brownian motions. It is of intrinsic interest to
probabilists, and of more general interest because of ties to PDE theory, and
because it may turn out to be a very important process for modeling purposes and
as a building block from which other measure valued processes can be
constructed. This project is primarily aimed at seeing how well SBM indeed
serves as such a building block, by investigating a number of other infinite
dimensional stochastic processes that can be built either from SBM or from
simple variants of it. The first example that will be tackled is a ``super
iterated Brownian motion'' that seems to be accessible to this approach and yet
is a stochastic process which promises a lot of surprises in its structure and
behavior. As a modeling tool, the random processes that will be studied in this
project have applications to a wide diversity of different fields. They provide
good models for studying the development of genetic diversity over a large
number of generations, and, indeed, it was as models here that superprocesses
originally developed. In this and related projects, the PI and his colleagues
will also be using superprocesses to study the dispersion of mass via ocean
currents. It is hoped that the models developed will lead to a better
understanding of the statistical aspects of, for example, the spread of ocean
pollutants. Another side benefit will be the study of the spatial structure of
populations of small ocean dwelling organisms such as plankton, a topic of both
ecological and defense (radar) interest.
