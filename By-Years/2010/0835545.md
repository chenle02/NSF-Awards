Prof Philip Andrews from the University of Michigan is supported by the NSF
Chemistry Division Integrative Chemistry Activities and the National Institute
of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at NIH to organize an "NSF/NIH Joint
Workshop on Instrument Development". This meeting will examine paths to develop
innovative new instrumentation in the chemical/biological sciences and provide
increased competitive advantages for the analytical, biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries. The meeting will bring together users and instrument
developers that will focus on creative approaches to instrument design
applicable to both mature and emerging fields of research of common interest to
both NSF and NIH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of modern instrumentation is
a corner stone of research. Exploring paths to development of innovative new
instrumentation is essential for advancement of research, education and science.
The workshop is viewed as having potentially broad impact not only within
chemical and biological fields but other disciplines as well.&lt;br/&gt;
