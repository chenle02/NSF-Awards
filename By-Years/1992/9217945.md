This award will provide 77% of the cost of acquiring an X- ray fluorescence
spectrometer (XRF) system to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geosciences at Franklin and Marshall College. F&amp;M College is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. Faculty and
undergraduate students at F&amp;M engage in active research projects in the area
of igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary, and coal petrology, as well as
geochemistry. The multi-element chemical analysis of geologic samples provided
by this equipment will allow several research projects to proceed with modern
instrumentation. Instruction and use of the XRF spectrometer will also be
incorporated in several laboratory undergraduate courses.
