9600023 Simon The Mathematics Teacher Development (MTD) Project is designed to
conduct detailed study of the development or preservice and inservice
mathematics teachers as the develop form traditional conceptions of mathematics,
learning, teaching, and classroom practice towards conceptions that are
consistent with current mathematics education reform principles. the Project
endeavors to identify patterns of teacher development, obstacles that must be
overcome by developing teacher, and key issues that emerge in the development
process. The Project also seeks evidence as to the effectiveness of particular
teacher education practices in addressing particular problems of mathematics
teacher education. The analysis of data is from a cognitive and a social
perspective and focuses on both the individual and the collective development of
the teachers involved. The Project employs a research methodology that
incorporates whole-class constructivist teaching experiments and case studies of
individual participants to study the development of the prospective and
inservice teachers during and following a three-year instructional program.
Central to the MTD research effort is unique, extensive, and state-of- the-art
teacher development program designed to promote in-depth development as a
context for inquiry.
