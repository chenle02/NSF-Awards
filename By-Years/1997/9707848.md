Award Abstract Fellow: Felipe N. Soto-Adames Proposal number: DBI 9707848 This
action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1997. This
fellowship supports research and training in the area of systematic biology. The
research and training plan is entitled " Molecular markers and patterns of
speciation in soil inhabiting microarthropods." The organisms being studied
comprise the Lepidocyrtus-Pseudosinella genera complex (Hexapoda: Collembola) in
greater Puerto Rico. Collembola are the most diverse of the primitive, wingless
hexapods and important to soil biology. Diversity and patterns of speciation are
being determined with the use of molecular tools and geographical distribution
to gain insight into the factors contributing to the evolutionary success of
this important and under-studied group of organisms.
