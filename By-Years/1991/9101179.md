The objective of this research is to study scheduling problems occurring in
flow lines used in manufacturing and assembly. The basic problem involves a
system consisting of a number of stages in series with parallel machines at each
stage. The goals of the research are to develop rules and heuristics for the
basic problem and to develop efficient algorithms for more complicated and
realistic scenarios. The problems to be studied are motivated by scheduling
problems occuring in several manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United
States and will be carried out in collaboration with several industrial research
centers.
