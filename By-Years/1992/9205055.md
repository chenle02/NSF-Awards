Rock weathering is an often underestimated yet ubiquitous force, sculpting and
changing the landscape, predominantly influenced by rock composition and
environmental factors. Previous research has recognized the importance of
obtaining quantitative data on the weathering rates of rocks. While research has
shown that lichen overgrowth disrupts and erodes the substrate, little
quantitative data have been collected on this weathering phenomenon. Lichens
represent the dominant biological species on eight percent of the Earth's
surface. Their ubiquitousness may establish lichens as a greater pedogenetic
factor than previously understood. This project will investigate the
quantifiable effect of lichen overgrowth on substrate surface weathering ,
removal, and potential pedogenesis. Research will be conducted in the Petra
region of Jordan to determine lichen- induced erosion in controlled
circumstances from the late Pleistocene to the present. Regression models will
be developed and tested to determine rates of weathering under differing
conditions of time, exposure of the rock to sunlight, proximity to surface,
location of water flows, and other environmental variables. Radiocarbon dating
and timing of human carvings in sandstone will be used to establish when
weathering took place. This study should fill several missing niches in the
weathering literature by connecting the factors responsible for lichen growth,
by providing information on the process by which lichen alters rock, and by
estimating the quantity of weathered by-products. Knowledge of the quantity of
substrate weathering over time should inform archaeological research on lichen
induced alteration of petroglyphs and geoglyphs, pedological research on
substrate change into pedogenetic material, lichenology through the development
of a potential dryland lichenometric growth curve, and geography through an
assessment of spatial variability of weathering rates.
