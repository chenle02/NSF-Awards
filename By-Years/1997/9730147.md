9730147 Anderson This project will use U/Th and 14C dating in corals dredged
from intermediate depths of the Atlanti Ocean to identify changes in ventilation
rate during the last glacial and deglacial intervals. The difference between the
14C date and the U/Th date of a sample can determine the age of the water in
which the coral lived, after correction for radiocarbon porduction and reservoir
effects. Differences in water age reflect differences in source of the water,
and therefore can constrain circulation changes related to climatic states.
