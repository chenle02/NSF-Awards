This project will increase the scientific literacy of students by allowing them
to experience the excitement and power of technological advances in chemical
instrumentation and improve chemistry education on all levels by providing
instruction and increasingly consistent use of the type of chemical
instrumentation used routinely in the chemical profession. A Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer System will be purchased. At each course level
students will be introduced to infrared (IR) spectroscopy theory at a slightly
deeper level and will get experience in using the instrument. The non-majors in
the introductory course will be taught the very fundamental concepts of IR
spectroscopy and will do grouping studies of IR spectra they produce from thin
film polymers they bring. Students in the preparatory chemistry course, general
chemistry, and organic chemistry will progress through increasingly higher
levels of instrumental operation, techniques of sample preparation, including
attenuated internal reflectance and diffuse reflectance, spectral
interpretation, structural identification, data base searches, data acquisition
and manipulation, and spectral storage. They will do both qualitative and
quantitative analysis.
