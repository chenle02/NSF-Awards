The proposed research will investigate whether or not >effective stress> finite
element analyses can provide a rational basis for deciding when staged
construction can safely proceed. It will use the case history of the project
Terminal Portuario de Sergipe (TPS) in Brazil to focus on two principal
questions: 1. can two- dimensional consolidation explain large increases in
lateral deformation with time, as opposed to >undrained> creep; and 2. is a very
advanced but complex model of clay behavior required (having anisotropy, non-
linearity within yield surface, etc.), or will the very simple Modified Cam Clay
Model suffice? The research is considered >high risk> based on past experience
with using effective stress models to analyze foundation problems.
