This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test a novel
method for Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements
for process control and monitoring in semiconductor lithography applications. It
builds on the demonstrated success of employing planar grating diffraction to
achieve SE measurements in the visible wavelengths. For SE measurements in the
VUV, it is necessary to employ conical diffraction geometries which do not
require sheet-type polarizing elements in the detection system. This permits the
construction of a Conical Diffraction- Grating Division of Amplitude
Photopolarimeter (CD-GDOAP) that is the analyzer/detection system in the VUV-SE.
By intercepting four or more dispersed orders of the cone of diffraction, a CD-
GDOAP can measure the polarization state of light over the full spectrum in the
VUV with no moving parts. The VUV-SE will: (i) operate in the 140-280 nm
spectral range, (ii) have no moving parts, and (iii) provide high temporal
resolution. In Phase I, we propose to characterize the performance of a
laboratory breadboard CD-GDOAP by investigating (i) conical diffraction
geometries, (ii) robustness of polarization detection, and (iii) performance of
optical components in the VUV. If successful, it will lead to a compact, high-
speed VUV-SE for use in semiconductor processing. Potential Commercial
Applications of the Research The proposed SE based on CD-GDOAP will permit real-
time measurements for VUV lithography applications at 157, 193, and 248 nm in a
single instrument. Presently there are no commercially available instruments
(used in production facilities) that can access all of these wavelengths.
Successful completion of this project will ensure rapid entry into the
marketplace, through the business relationship that CRI is developing with major
semiconductor metrology equipment companies.
