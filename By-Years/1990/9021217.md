Electrical activity of nerve cells is determined by ion channels found within
the cell membrane. The electrical excitability of individual nerve cells depends
upon the types of ion channels expressed, the relative and absolute densities,
and the spatial distributions of ion channels in different regions of the cell.
These factors have a functional significance and any modification to these
factors could be a cause of neuronal plasticity. The molluscan nervous system
provides an important model for the study of neural circuits and neuronal
plasticity. This research project will investigate the mechanisms molluscan
neurons use to process information in the nervous system. Electrophysiological
methods of voltage and patch clamping will be utilized to study the biophysics
of membrane ion channels and to map the spatial distribution of ion channels in
different areas of the cell. Biophysical properties that are modulated by
activity, such as the inactivation gating of calcium and potassium, will be
examined to help encode the time history of neuronal activity. Video
fluorescence microscopy will be used to study the spatial patterning of
intracellular calcium signals and the nature of the cytoskeleton. Results of
this study will contribute to the understanding of neuronal information
processing and the specializations responsible for the functional individuality
of neurons.
