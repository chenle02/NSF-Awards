This Presidential Young Investigator intends to study hydrogenated amorphous
silicon. This "hydrogen glass" material presents unique advantages as a system
to probe the physics of disordered systems. The structural rearrangements which
underlie the glassy material are readily influenced by doping and alloying, and
are manifested by straight forward electronic measurements. Among the phenomena
to be explored are: 1) stretched exponential relaxation; 2) the glass transition
temperature; 3) flicker of 1/f noise; and 4) magnetoresistance in the hopping
regime. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the basic physical
properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon these studies will enable the
fabrication of amorphous semiconductor-based devices with superior qualities.
