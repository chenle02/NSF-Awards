ABSTRACT OPP-9622157 GIBLIN, ANNE MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY Investigators
from the Marine Biological Laboratory and the University of Michigan propose to
apply a new, computationally simple, modeling scheme to the problem of
understanding the hydrological controls on terrestrial arctic ecosystems. The
model will allow researchers to calculate the flux of nutrients, gases, and
water through lakes, streams, and entire watersheds so that the ecological
response of the terrestrial vegetation may be examined. The development of a
model to determine the flux of materials and water flow is urgently needed
because the cost of observing and calculating the flow throughout the Arctic is
prohibitive. The new model will be used in conjunction with global climate
models to test the effects of changing climate scenarios on the response of
vegetation in the Arctic. The Arctic is expected to feel the impact of global
change to a greater degree than other places on Earth and the new modeling
scheme will allow predictions of the ecosystem response on the landscape scale
without the necessity to run complex models requiring prohibitively long
computational times.
