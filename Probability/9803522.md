9803522 Freidlin Perturbations of the Hamiltonian systems will be studied in
this project. The long- time behavior of such perturbed systems, even if the
perturbations are purely deterministic, should be described by a stochastic
process on a graph related to the Hamilton function. A class of asymptotic
problems for PDEs, such as the small viscosity asymptotics for the Navier-Stokes
equations in the plane or small diffusion asymptotics for reaction - diffusion
in an incompressible fluid, are closely related to random perturbations of the
Hamiltonian systems. The probabilistic approach is useful in analyzing these
problems. Long time behavior of dynamical systems perturbed by a stochastic
noise is studied in this project. This type of problem arises in many
applications, for example, the long time behavior of cosmic objects or the
motion of a fluid with a small viscosity. The perturbations, even if they are
small, become essential for the long-time behavior of the system. The asymptotic
approach, which the investigator is developing in the project, is the most
promising for analyzing this type of problem.
