The objective of this project is to investigate an efficient static state
estimator for very large power systems. The proposed estimator consists of
performing a two-level calculation: in the lower (first) hierarchical level, a
conventional state estimation is performed simultaneously for all subsystems;
these local estimations are then coordinated at the upper level. The approach
exploites the physical properties of power systems and formulates the local
state estimation problem as two linear programming sub-problems which would be
sequentially solved by a proposed method. It also suggests investigating a form
of the decomposition principle of Dantzig and Wolf to reduce the size of the
problem. Standard IEEE and other existing power systems will be used for testing
and comparison purposes. The proposed research suggests innovative techniques to
solve the problem of state estimation on large scale power systems. It will
certainly increase the understanding of the properties of linear programming
state estimators and would suggest remedies to the problems which they might
have. It is also expected to result in a new approach for decomposing the state
estimation problem that is suitable for application with linear programming
state estimators.
