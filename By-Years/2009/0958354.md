This project is for the acquisition of a GPU cluster dedicated to research on
High Performance Computing. The selected infrastructure (a cluster of GPUs)
presents itself as a serious candidate for the future of High Performance
Computing. Indeed, the theoretical cost efficiency(GFlop/sec/dollar) and the
theoretical power efficiency (GFlop/sec/Watt) scores very high compared to
current other high performance computing platforms. However, two huge challenges
are whether relevant application codes can reach a reasonable fraction of the
peak of these computing platforms and how to reach this performance level. The
PIs collaborative effort answers these research questions from various angles.
The proposed infrastructure is supporting their research on these
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The codes produced by this collaborative effort are
included in well-known software packages (LAPACK, NVIDIA CUBLAS, ScaLAPACK,
WRF).
