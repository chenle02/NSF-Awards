This study is aimed at diagnosing processes responsible for low-frequency
variations in the general circulation of the atmosphere relevant to climate
dynamics. The PIs plan to identify the mechanisms that give rise to changes in
atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) on interannual and longer time scales. Newly
available data sets will be used to examine the surface torques responsible for
ENSO anomalies in AAM and the manner in which the surface sources and sinks of
momentum are linked to behavior in the upper troposphere. Stationary wave
activity fluxes will be computed to investigate further the way in which low-
frequency variations in tropical angular momentum become communicated to the
extratropics. Regions responsible for the presence of regimes in the AAM time
series and in the Hadley circulation will be determined using the 30-year
archive of zonal and meridional winds in the General Circulation Data Library.
Finally, the Pi will update and extend their analysis of the impact of doubling
CO2 on zonal winds and AAM by considering suitable experiments with current
versions of general circulation models. This research is important because it
strives to understand how variations in the earth's angular momentum affects
atmospheric processes on interannual and interdecadal time scales.
