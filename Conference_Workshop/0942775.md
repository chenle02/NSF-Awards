This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating
in the three consecutive meetings of Prairie Analysis Seminar in 2009, 2010 and
2011 at Kansas State University and University of Kansas. PIs and the co-PIs of
this collaborate proposal have received previous awards for organizing five out
of totally eight editions of the Prairie Analysis Seminar. Support will be
provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions
made for some plenary speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will
be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain
senior participants will be funded as well.

The programs of each meeting will feature invited lectures and a number of
contributed talks. The principal objective of this meeting is to introduce young
mathematicians to the field, as well as to provide a forum for presentation of
the current state of the art of the theory. The organizers intend to actively
involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from
other under-represented groups, to which much of the funding will be directed.
Graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.
