In this project, PI's will deploy an array of current meters near 26 degrees
North in the Western North Atlantic in order to directly measure volume and heat
transport components of the thermohaline circulation. Measurements are directly
related to central goals of both the NOAA Atlantic Climate Change Program (ACCP)
and the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Measurements will extend a
time series started in 1988, and will eventually lead to a seven-year time
series of volume transport and a six-year series of heat transport. Focus will
be on investigating climate-related flow transients, and an attempt to resolve
the western boundary eddy heat flux component for correction of planned ACCP and
WOCE Atlantic heat flux sections.
