The Alexander Terrane, an accreted crustal fragment in southeast Alaska,
affords a unique opportunity to determine its paleolatitudinal motion history
through paleomagnetic and detrital zircon analysis. Alternative paleopositions
for the terrane during the Paleozoic are: (1) the Sierra-klamath province of
California; (2) the paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana; or (3) an intra-oceanic
setting. This study will resolve the controversy surrounding the origins and
movement history of the Alexander Terrane, and will have major implications for
the accretionary history of the North American Cordillera. The results will have
bearing on orogenic processes in other tectonic settings.
