The principal investigator works in the area of infinite particle systems.
Interacting particle systems are stochastic models for large systems of
interacting components, and can be used to model the spread of disease through a
population or the consensus of voters in a population. One topic the
investigator will study concerns the nonlinear voter models. This class of
models contains the "voter model", and initial indications (computer
simulations) indicate that these models behave differently from the voter model.
