This research is on a timing verification and optimization framework for
designing an entire digital system (e.g. a microprocessor). The research builds
on a widely used model for synchronous timing analysis and an efficient method
for estimating gate and wire delays. The model is being extended to include
relevant functional information in order to enhance accuracy. Components of the
framework are: design decomposition to isolate critical elements; a path delay
calculator; algorithms for finding synchronizer components; clock analysis
algorithms; a symbolic sequential timing verification component; a hybrid
timing-logic simulator; and design optimizers.
