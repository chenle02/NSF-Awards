This award supports the conduct of an National Science Foundation Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) proposal writing workshop. The workshop will be held
at a site chosen and hosted by the University of Connecticut, April 4 and 5,
2011. It is expected that there will be about 150 attendees. The workshop will
have a one-and-a-half-day format including a training session on good proposal
writing practices, testimony from previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER
proposal panel review, and a review session during which the attendees will have
a chance to obtain reviews on project summaries of their own draft CAREER
proposals. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with NSF
Program Directors both one-on-one and in mock panels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will help to prepare young faculty for careers in education by giving
them tools and skills of good proposal writing and by preparing them to write
and submit better CAREER proposals. The results of the workshop include training
for young faculty, better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on
women and minority faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees, and
ultimately better research resulting from better written proposals.
