An atomic absorption spectrometer and accessories were purchased for the
Randolph-Macon Women's College Department of Chemistry. This instrument has
significantly improved the laboratory work especially in analytical chemistry,
instrumental analysis, senior research projects, and independent studies. It has
provided the department with an instrument illustrative of the state of the art
in computerized instrumentation in an area where undergraduates need exposure.
The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
