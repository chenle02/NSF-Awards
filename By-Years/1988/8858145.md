Theoretical research will be carried out on the astrophysical implications of
new ideas in particle physics. The early universe is thought to have had
enormous densities and temperatures. The conditions would provide a natural
particle accelerator orders of magnitude more powerful than any conceivable
laboratory accelerator. The research will involve looking into the effects of
new particles, if they exist, on astrophysical models. Research on the
possibility of detecting cosmic strings (trapped remnants of the early universe)
existing in our galaxy or in extragalactic environments will be undertaken. The
research will be focussed on superconducting cosmic strings, which can carry
currents of up to one million billion electron volts. Collaborative research
with several experimental groups will center on the possibility of detecting
"dark matter" that may comprise 90% of our galaxy. The effects that these
particles may have on our Sun and on other stars will be explored. This is a
Presidential Young Investigator Award.
