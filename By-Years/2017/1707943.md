This award supports the conference "Dynamics, Aging and Universality in Complex
Systems" that will be held from the 19th-23rd of June, 2017, at the Courant
Institute (NYU) in New York City. The conference has 30 confirmed speakers in
very active and fundamental areas at the intersection of probability, analysis,
and mathematical physics. The main aim in the rigorous study of complex
disordered systems is to understand how random microscopic systems display
predictable and statistically universal collective macroscopic behaviors. Many
such systems evolve to stationary states, but do so in very long time scales
(e.g., exponential in system size). Dynamics and aging in these complex systems
seeks to understand how their complicated energy landscapes governs their pre-
stationary behavior. There are many different approaches in this area that will
be represented at the conference, including spin-glasses, stochastic partial
differential equations (PDEs), large deviation theory, and random matrix theory.
This gathering will lead to cross-fertilization between these areas as well as
inspire and inform a new generation of researchers. This event will attract a
large and diverse spectrum of participants, including many earlier career
researchers, women and under-represented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many
of the complex systems which will be discussed in this conference aim to
describe real world phenomena and results proved for the mathematical models
provide predictions applicable to the real systems. At a simpler level, think,
for instance, of how the central limit theorem for sums of independent random
variables predicts the Gaussian statistics which drives a large part of
statistics in the real world. Besides physical applications, complex systems
(e.g., spin glasses, growth processes and random matrices) have found many
applications in computer science, machine learning, data science,
bioinformatics, chemistry, and even areas like ecology and earth
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The website for this conference is:
