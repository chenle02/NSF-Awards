The majority of processes that take place in the chemical industry use organic
solvents, solvents that are generally obtained from petrochemicals. Adapting
these processes to the "greenest" solvent - water - remains a challenge. This
project to be conducted by Professor Julius Rebek at The Scripps Research
Institute uses synthetic, container-shape, molecules for reactions in water. The
"containers" act as nanovessels that show robust stability and can be used and
re-used over a wide range of conditions. A broader impact of this research is
the benefit of developing sustainable chemistry. Another impact is the discovery
of new molecules for use in water-proof coatings and nanomachines. Postdoctoral
researchers benefit from learning how research projects translate from chemical
discovery to applications in new materials.

The chemistry of molecules confined to small containers - nanoscale compounds
known as cavitands - is a relatively new undertaking. This research takes
advantage of an early discovery that long-chain organic compounds assume
unusual, folded shapes within the cavitand's space. The folded shapes, induced
by hydrophobic forces, push the substrate's ends together and promote large-ring
cyclization processes. The cavitands act as templates. Folding also blocks some
sites on the chain and exposes others to reactions with agents in the aqueous
medium. The blocking action promises new chemical pathways for remote carbon-
hydrogen activation in functionalization reactions that typically lead to 5 or
6-membered ring sizes. Functional groups that are remote in extended molecules
are brought into proximity when folded in cavitands. The functions no longer act
independently and can affect each other's reactivity; showing the consequences
of this "entanglement" is one of the basic science novelties expected from this
research. The practical consequences may include synthetic methods for access to
molecules that cannot be made by conventional means.
