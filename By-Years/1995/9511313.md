This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from Stanford, California. The project is to study three socio-religious groups
of women in Cairo, Egypt to explore the variation in women's' understanding of
Islamic fundamentalism. Using ethnographic techniques of participant
observation, in-depth interviews and reading national debates in the mass media,
the student will analyze the opinions of the groups with respect to government
sponsored religious practices, will assess the importance of factors such as
socio-economic class, age and educational backgrounds for their opinions, and
profile the Islamic public debate on the proper role so religion in public life.
This research is important because Islam is a major influence in the
contemporary world. Advances in our understanding of the sources of popular
support for religious policies will help decision makers understand and deal
with the actions of Islamic governments and populations. In addition this
dissertation research will add to our store of expertise about this important
area of the world.
