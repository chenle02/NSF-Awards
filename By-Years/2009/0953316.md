CAREER: Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for High Dimensional
Systems&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in the development of
models and methods that can satisfactorily describe and analyze high dimensional
systems are extremely valuable for many different disciplines including biology,
meteorology, economics,social sciences, and engineering. These systems are
characterized by nonlinearities and are difficult to understand.Computational
methods governed by simple local rules have the potential of providing
insightful interpretations&lt;br/&gt;and of paving the way towards quantitative
and qualitative descriptions and understanding of complex systems.This project
is focused on development of such methods and in particular on the development
of a synergistic research and educational program in sequential Monte Carlo-
based signal processing for high dimensional systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research aims at laying the foundations of a sequential Monte Carlo methodology
for high dimensional systems. In the literature, there are claims stating that
particle filters cannot be used for complex systems because their random
measures degenerate to single particles. While this is true for standard
implementation of these filters, it does not hold true for alternative
approaches. A new methodology based on the principle of divide and conquer is
developed. In particular, the collapse of traditional particle filltering is
avoided by setting an interconnected network of filters, each of them working on
lower dimensional spaces. Research tasks include development of the theoretical
grounds of the methods, establishment of guidelines for its use by
practitioners,analysis of its accuracy, stability and scalability, and
validation on a wide range of complex systems. The proposed methods are original
and provide solutions to arguably the biggest open problem of particle
filtering.
