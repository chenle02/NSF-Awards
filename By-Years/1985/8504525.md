There is considerable interest in the integration of voice and data in an
integrated services digital network which achieves efficient utilization of
transmission and switching facilities. The models for these networks are usually
analytically intractable or computationally infeasible and simulation studies
for these systems are expensive. The objective of this project is to provide
tools of practical value that can be used in the evaluation, design, and control
of integrated communication networks. A state-dependent decomposition technique
to model the congested states of these systems and a hybrid simulation will be
used in the investigation.
