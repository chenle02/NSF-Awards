This project, a summer `pilot` workshop for professors and graduate students in
various fields of science and engineering, seeks to help science and engineering
teachers at universities and colleges in the Rocky Mountain region develop
strategies for teaching research ethics to undergraduate and graduate students.
The workshop, led by people actively teaching ethics in science, will allow
participants to learn more about ethical issues in research and to develop ways
of incorporating ethics into the science curriculum through designing new
courses, modifying existing courses, and by mainstreaming ethics into various
aspects of formal instruction and informal training. To assess the effectiveness
of the workshop after participants return to their home institutions, an
electronic network (listserver) will be set up for participants and workshop
leaders. This will allow participants to report back on what they have learned
in the workshop, how it can be improved, and what plans they have developed to
implement strategies learned.
