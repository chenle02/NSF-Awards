This grant supports the measurement of angular correlation coefficients
describing neutron beta decay using the ‚ÄúNab‚Äù spectrometer at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. In this experiment the "a" and "b" coefficients describe the proton
and electron resulting from the decay of the neutron. The main purpose of the
measurements is to test the Standard Model of Nuclear and Particle Physics,
which has been extremely successful in describing most of the properties and
behavior of the elementary particles to date but leaves open critical questions
such as the reason for the dominance of matter over anti-matter in the universe.
A discovery of Beyond the Standard Model physics would thus have important
implications for Physics and Cosmology. Installation of the Nab spectrometer at
the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge will be finished by the end of
summer 2021, and commissioning and data taking will commence and continue for
the duration of the proposal period. The PI is the project manager for the Nab
collaboration. This grant will fund the PI‚Äôs group, and they will participate in
data taking, detector simulation, data analysis, and characterization of the
proton detection efficiency. The PI is strongly committed to attracting members
of underrepresented groups. The University of Virginia physics department
recently became a new site for the APS bridge program, and the PI is serving as
a mentor. Furthermore, the project has a valuable impact on higher education:
most of the work is done by students at undergraduate and graduate level, and
these students will earn valuable skills and experiences for their future
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The redundancy inherent in the Standard Model
description of the neutron beta decay process allows for sensitive checks of the
model‚Äôs validity. One of the expected observables (the neutrino-electron-
correlation coefficient ‚Äúa‚Äù) will allow an extraction of ùëâùë¢ùëë, the upper left
element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, in order to test the
unitarity of the matrix. A recent re-evaluation of the world‚Äôs data suggests
that CKM matrix unitarity is violated and so the results of the Nab experiment
are eagerly anticipated. The other observable (The Fierz term ‚Äúb‚Äù) allows us to
test for scalar or tensor interactions at low energies, in a complementary way,
and with sensitivity competitive to what is expected from the LHC. The current
Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science devotes a paragraph to this effort (see LRP,
page 75).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
