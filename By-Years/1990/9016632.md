The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses
on molten salt chemistry. The work promises to lead to the discovery of new
clusters (collections of metal atoms or metal and chlorine atoms) and new
chemistry for known clusters, as well as a greater insight into the nature and
strength of solute ion-solvent ion interactions in molten salts. Tantalum,
tungsten and molybdenum chlorine clusters containing up to six metal atoms will
be examined building on the results of previous work together with new studies
on homopolyatomic metal clusters. Studies will be conducted in both acidic
(molten salts with an excess of aluminum chloride) and basic (molten salts with
an excess of an organic salt) media. Basic media will be used for the metal-
chlorine clusters and acidic media will be used for studies of cationic clusters
of cadmium, mercury and bismuth with as many as nine metal atoms. The studies
will be extended to other types of metal atom clusters in acidic media. These
molten salt studies will include studies of the electrochemical behavior of
these clusters.
