This award supports participant travel for the eighth meeting in the series of
Mississippi State - UAB Conferences on Differential Equations and Computational
Simulations, held at Mississippi State University, 7-9 May 2009. The
multidisciplinary conferences provide a forum where mathematicians, scientists,
and engineers from academia and industry exchange research and education ideas
involving theoretical, applied, and computational developments in differential
equations and associated simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-day
meeting emphasizes research on differential equations and computational
simulations with applications in engineering and biology. The conference
provides graduate students and young researchers with opportunities to present
their work, meet other researchers, educators, and practitioners, learn of
recent developments in interdisciplinary fields, and develop a new generation of
mathematical models and challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web
