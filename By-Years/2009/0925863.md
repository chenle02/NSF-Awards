The NSF and other Federal agencies will require further understanding of
concepts, methods, and means for Exascale computing systems before formulation
of future programs in enabling technologies, architectures, and methodologies.
NSF supports a targeted two-year program of investigation, The Exascale Point-
design Study, to provide sufficient depth and detail of understanding of the
interrelationships among possible enabling technologies, implementation
architectures and operating system software, and programming interfaces and
methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working in consultation with LSU, USC, UIUC,
and Sandia National Laboratory (under DOE sponsorship), UD team devises an
Exascale compilation technology and strategy derived from prior research
conducted under NSF, DOE, and DARPA sponsorship, reflecting some of the best-
known principles and practices envisioned for hardware and software at the
Exaflops scale. This collaborative research will be performed in collaboration
with our partners who will contribute architecture (LSU), application drivers
and programming models (UIUC), enabling technology and hardware system design
(USC), and systems integration and deployment (SNL). The team plans to provide a
final report of its evaluations and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
