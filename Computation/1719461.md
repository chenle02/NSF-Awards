This project concerns development and analysis of new numerical algorithms for
large-scale algebraic eigenproblems with nonlinearity in eigenvalues,
eigenvectors, and parameters. These eigenproblems arise in electronic structure
calculation, design of accelerator cavities, delay differential equations,
vibration analysis of complex structures, and many more. Structure-preserving
linearization techniques that have been developed recently are competitive for
small or medium polynomial and rational eigenproblems, but they entail high
computational costs for large-scale simulations due to the significantly
enlarged dimension of linearized problems. In addition, linearization introduces
considerable complications for the development of preconditioners, and it is not
applicable to eigenproblems with full nonlinearity.

The PI shall develop novel iterative projection methods that are accurate,
robust and efficient, for the solution of large-scale truly nonlinear
eigenproblems. This goal can be achieved in part by exploration of special
properties of different types of nonlinear eigenproblems that enable solution
strategies similar to those for linear eigenproblems. This investigation is
focused on ( 1) new preconditioned eigensolvers, including conjugate-gradient-
like and minimal-residual-like methods, for efficient solution of a large number
of extreme and interior eigenvalues of problems with nonlinearity in
eigenvalues, with and without the variational principle; (2) fast inexact
Newton-like methods to solve parameter-dependent degenerate eigenproblem for the
study of (in)stabilities of dynamical systems; (3) efficient algorithms for
solving eigenproblems with nonlinearity in eigenvectors arising from condensed
matter physics and electronic structure calculation. The research will develop a
systematic and unified treatment of mathematical theory and development of
numerical software.
