A supermini computer located in the University of Iowa's Institute of Hydraulic
Research (IIHR), will be used in the development of software, testing on work
stations and final analysis on off-campus supercomputers for research being
conducted in hydrometeorology, e.g., deterministic chaos in rainfall, estimation
of errors from radar-rainfall data. Results of this research will have
significant impact on the prediction of extreme rainfall, and on the use of
radar-rainfall data by national real- time hydrologic forecasting systems. Other
areas of research which will use the facility are in ship hydrodynamics.
