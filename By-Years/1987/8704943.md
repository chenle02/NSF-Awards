This research project is an experimental study of the solubility behavior of
materials in solvents at what is known as "supercritical regions" of pressure
and temperature. There is sufficient ground for the hypothesis that the changes
in the solubilities of dissolved matter under such conditions can be exploited
successfully to separate multicomponent mixtures (selectively) from each other.
This experimental program will study the behavior of the solutes under
supercritical conditions in a systematic manner.
