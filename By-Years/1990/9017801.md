The DNAs encapsidated by parvoviruses show distinctly different patterns with
respect to the ratio of plus to minus strands and the preponderance of the flip
as opposed to the flop conformation at the termini. We have developed a kinetic
model for parvoviral DNA replication, based on differential rates of hairpin
transfer at the 3' termini that initiate replication, that accounts for the
characteristics of the progeny virion DNA of the parvoviruses. We propose to
test specific predictions of the model, thereby validating it or showing where
it might need re-adjustment. The flip-flop ratio at the left end of the plus
strand of Lulll will be determined to distinguish between the kinetic hairpin
transfer model and the modified rolling circle model, which requires a unique
flip conformation at this location. The polarity and flip- flop ratios of
progeny DNA of dimeric BPV genomes with duplicate or inverted ends will be
investigated and compared with computer predictions based on the relative rate
constants for hairpin transfer associated with each terminus. Site-directed
mutagenesis will eliminate "bubbles" associated with flip and flop conformations
and the effect of these changes on replication and progeny DNA characteristics
seen. Conclusions from the projected work will result from the collaborative
efforts of a biologist and a mathematician. Neither scientist could effectively
undertake this project without the input of the other scientist.*** //
