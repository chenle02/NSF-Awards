The funding will be used to completely modernize the core molecular
biology/cytogenetics research facilities, upgrade central autoclave and water
purification capabilities, provide reasonable amounts of personal laboratory
space for the two newest faculty members, and significantly increase individual
bench space, which is crucial for student research. These renovations will
provide for research projects in cytogenetics, molecular evolution and
systematics, plant growth and development, and studies or morphegenesis. These
renovations will serve as a foundation for further development of a research-
active Department. The improved working environment, modernization, will
increase the opportunities for faculty members to obtain extramural funding and,
thus, have an additional positive impact on opportunities for student research.
Hofstra University is committed to providing opportunities for the less
physically able student and for attracting members of underrepresented groups
into scholarly research. The University has an excellent record of providing
opportunities to minority students through special programs.
