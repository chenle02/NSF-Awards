Rutgers U. Initial studies of reforestation have emphasized ecological not human
dimensions. The current research project aims to explore the human aspects of
reforestation in an old colonization zone in Ecuador's Amazon region which
colonists first deforested thirty years ago. Four factors are related to
reforestation: urban development and the growth of part-time farming, declines
in soil fertility, declines in economic returns from agriculture, and
institutional policies which disadvantage smallholders and encourage land
abandonment. Current and former farmers in a four village region will be
interviewed. In addition studies of soil and vegetation will also be carried
out. Land use changes precipitated by political reform, pest infestation, aging
among settlers and the lure of urban jobs will be emphasized. The research will
offer a detailed explanation for the turnaround in forest cover trends in the
Upano-Palora region and also will suggest policy directions that might expedite
reforestation in other deforested regions of the world.
