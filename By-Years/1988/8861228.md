Hydronetics proposes research on its recently patented Laminated Object
Manufacturing System. The system uses computer generated database consisting of
thinly sliced cross-sections of a three-dimensional object to recreate the
object using metal or plastic powder as a raw material. The object is created by
successive deposition of thin layers of powder and their selective melting or
sintering with a scanning laser beam. The research aims at optimizing scanning
parameters of the process. It will also search for solutions for problems
affecting the process. Methods for reducing shrinkage, warpage, excessive heat,
and surface granularity in the object produced by the system will be evaluated.
