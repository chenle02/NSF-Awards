9523389 Tubbesing This project is to conduct a workshop to assess the earthquake
testing facilities. Section 2 of PL 103-374 reauthorizing the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), calls for such an assessment of
the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) will draw upon its
committee structure and membership to survey existing testing facilities. EERI
will commission a set of papers and convene a workshop to identify specific
needs, the potential for cooperative efforts, both internationally and between
federal and state agencies, and address potential costs and funding options. The
invited papers and recommendations from the Workshop will be compiled into a
final report to be submitted by NSF and fellow NEHRP agencies to Congress at the
conclusion of the project. This project is financially supported by NSF and
NIST, in a 2 to l ratio. ***
