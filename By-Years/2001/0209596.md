This award supports partially the participation by 15 American researchers in
the 7th International Conference on Inorganic Membranes to be held in Dalien,
China, 23-26 June, 2002. This conference provides a unique forum for dialog
among international researchers in the field. It will bring together about 300
researchers from 35 countries. Both academic and industrial researchers will
participate in sessions on synthesis and characterization of membranes and
applications relating to separation processes, membrane reactors, and
environmental protection.

Inorganic membranes offer unique advantages in separation processes and reactors
because of their stability and durability, and the current research activity is
dynamic, stimulated by new developments in materials synthesis, molecular
modeling, and specific applications. Much of the important new work is being
done abroad, so it is vital that U.S. researchers maintain contact and
collaboration with their foreign counterparts. This conference provides an
opportunity to promote such contact.
