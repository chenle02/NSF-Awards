This award provides partial funding for the 2003 FASEB Summer Research
Conference on Chromatin and Transcription to be held July 7 - 12 in Snowmass,
Colorado. The conference's goals are to 1) introduce lesser known research areas
to the established fields of chromatin and transcription and, in this way,
promote cross-fertilization of research efforts, 2) promote the careers of young
investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and students, and 3) strengthen the voice
of underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. The
overarching theme of the meeting concerns the interplay between chromatin
structure and gene expression, both at the level of the single gene and at the
level of the whole genome, including studies of chromatin modification and
remodeling, insulators, and imprinting. Total attendance will be ~200, of which
~60 will be invited to speak.
