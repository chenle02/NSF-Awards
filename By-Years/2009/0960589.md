This award supports U.S. participants in a Madrid-based semester-long sequence
of technical research workshops, courses, collaborative visits, and an
international conference in a subject area at the boundary of traditional
control theory and combinatorial algebra. The three-month sequence of events is
motivated by recent innovations in combinatorial algebra, particularly
combinatorial Hopf algebras, and their powerful application in numerical
integration and control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program consists
of:&lt;br/&gt;* A week-long technical workshop in early April in Madrid. The
goal is to bring together experts and young innovators from different areas,
survey the state of the art in each, and forge consensus on research topics in
which swift progress is feasible.&lt;br/&gt;* A mid-April week-long school in
Zaragoza, Spain aimed at graduate students and postdocs in mathematics, physics,
and related areas who are planning to do research in the field of control and
modern combinatorics. Four established researchers in these fields will lead the
school, which is to include lectures and problem sets. &lt;br/&gt;* A month-long
advanced course on combinatorics relevant to control, offered in Madrid in May.
&lt;br/&gt;* Focused research collaborations. Small teams of two to four
researchers will collaborate in Madrid for periods from two to four weeks during
mid-April to mid-June on the research themes identified in the workshop. It is
intended that these collaborations will connect creative young talents with
experienced leaders in the fields. &lt;br/&gt;* A week-long International
Conference held in Madrid in June. Participants of the preceding events will
present their results, redefine objectives for future research, and lay the
foundation for future collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity
promises to build new long-term international research collaborations and to
catalyze research in this promising interdisciplinary
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://dftuz.unizar.es/coco2010/
