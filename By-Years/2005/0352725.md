This proposal requests $97,000 to develop a 1/5th-scale model laboratory to
educate and train users of the NEES MUST-SIM facility. This laboratory is an
essential component of a two-step procedure to qualify experiments before being
scheduled for the MUST-SIM facility. This qualification procedure can form a
model for the other NEES equipment sites. If the equipment for the scale model
facility is purchased now, while the manufacturer is still geared up for
production of the various components for the MUST-SIM facility, nearly a 50%
cost savings can be achieved, as compared to creating the facility at a later
date.
