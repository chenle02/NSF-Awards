A new concept of the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) capacitor effect is emerging
for interactions between the Indian and Pacific basins: El Nino teleconnection
causes the TIO to warm, and the TIO warming persists and like a discharging
capacitor, exerts climatic influences after El Nino decays. Studies of the
capacitor effect so far tend to be diagnostic, and targeted model experiments
are necessary to make further progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
study ocean-atmospheric processes and mechanisms for the TIO response to El
Nino/the Southern Oscillation (ENSO), especially the long persistence and
climatic effects of this response during and after the decay of an ENSO event;
and to explore interdecadal changes in TIO mean state and variability and
determine their cause. A state-of-the-art coupled general circulation model will
be used to conduct experiments and test hypotheses regarding the role of ocean
Rossby waves in sustaining the TIO warming and moist teleconnection from the TIO
to the Northwest Pacific via atmospheric Kelvin wave. Among teleconnective
effects of the TIO warming are reduced precipitation over the subtropical
Northwest Pacific (including the U.S. affiliated Northern Mariana Islands and
Guam), and an anomalously active Meiyu-Baiu rainy season from eastern China to
Japan. The proposed research represents a systematic investigation into the
TIO's role in climate and will yield new insights into the mechanisms for TIO
variability and changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this
project has the potential in improving understanding and prediction of climate
variability and change, which benefits countries/communities within and rimming
the TIO and Northwest Pacific. Graduate students and postdoctoral will be
trained and supported.
