With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Professor Frank
McDonald from Emory University and colleagues Lanny Liebeskind, Craig Hill, Huw
Davies and Christopher Scarborough have acquired a high intensity single crystal
X-ray diffractometer. X-ray diffraction is a powerful tool to investigate the
arrangement of the atoms, the microscopic structure, of solid materials. An
X-ray beam aimed at a small crystal will produce a diffraction pattern which is
analyzed to determine this underlying atomic structure. This knowledge is
fundamental to understanding their properties and developing improvements.
Advances in the intensity and ability to focus the X-rays have made modern
diffractometers, such as a high intensity diffractometer, essential for
research. The applications of X-ray structural data ranges across fields from
chemistry to biology, materials and medicine, to applications such as developing
better pharmaceuticals, electronic devices, catalysts for bioremediation
processes and understanding the mechanisms of enzymes. The diffractometer is
used in student research activities as well as instruction. It is a general tool
to prepare the next generation of scientists.

This award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels,
especially in areas such as (a) developing catalysts and characterizing
catalytic intermediates; (b) developing oxidation catalysts based on first-row
transition metals with redox-active ligands; (c) exploring fundamental
properties of polyoxometallates (POMs) widely used in applications such as
corrosion prevention; (d) preparing catalysts for dehydration reactions; (e)
structurally characterizing synthetic materials; (f) determining the
stereochemical configuration of biologically active materials; (g) determining
conformation and molecular orientation of molecular catalysts on electrode
surfaces; (g) studying peptide nanotube orientation and (h) studying charge
density of biologically active coordination compounds.
