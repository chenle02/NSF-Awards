Intellectual merit

Experimental and theoretical studies of protein aggregation lag considerably
behind protein folding studies, because of their much greater complexity.
Several researchers have developed molecular dynamics simulations of protein
misfolding and aggregation, but the predictions from these simulations have not
been experimentally tested. In this project, 'length libraries' of polyglutamine
(polyQ) peptides and proteins will be synthesized and characterized for their
conformational properties and aggregation propensities.

Broader impacts Aggregation of peptides and proteins pose significant challenges
in both biotechnology and biomedicine. For example, over 4.5 million Americans
suffer from aggregation-linked neurodegenerative diseases. As another example,
aggregates in therapeutic recombinant protein preparations reduce
pharmacological efficiency, and can threaten patients' health by causing serious
immunological responses. Deciphering the causes of aggregation is the first step
towards developing rational strategies for controlling aggregation. Graduate
students on this project are broadly educated in modern experimental and
computational approaches in protein and peptide folding and misfolding, and
prepared to take leading roles in academia or in the biotechnology industry.
Through active participation in a summer research program, underrepresented
minority undergraduates will gain valuable experience and enjoy a sense of
accomplishment that will contribute to their continued enthusiasm for research
careers.
