This institution is purchasing Silicon Graphics workstations and accessories to
set up an interdisciplinary computer-aided design and World Wide Web-based
classroom/laboratory for educational instruction and student projects. Professor
Schneider, of the Mathematics and Computer Science Department, and Professor
Gillison, of the Art Department, are initiating a new undergraduate course of
study in computer imaging, graphics, and the World Wide Web that have courses
based in the classroom. Professor Schneider is collaborating with several high
schools from the Bronx to train teachers and students in these fields. Professor
Linda Keen and students in the Mathematics and Computer Science Department use
the workstations to visualize dynamical systems.
