This research proposal uses geometry and statistics to build meaningful
confidence regions for tree structured parameters. Binary trees appear as
parameters in: (1) Hierarchical clustering problems, for instance for micro-
array data from contemporary genetics; (2) Methods that use decision trees such
as the Classification and Regression trees (CART); (3) Estimation of
phylogenetic trees built from DNA data for the taxonomy of species, but also for
building `gene trees'. The embedding of tree estimation in a statistical
framework allows one to see trees as a special type of parameter to be
estimated. However the estimation procedures have been developed without the
ability to construct confidence regions for these paramters or ways of comparing
various estimators of these parameters. Currently biologists validate the tree
estimated by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the DNA sequences
and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to
the branches of a consensus tree. This reduces the problem to a collection of
binomial simulations, losing much of the multivariate information of which
groups appear simultaneously. This new constructive geometrical approach uses
the tools available from topology and algebraic combinatorics. Collaboration
with a combinatorialist, Louis Billera, and a topologist, Karen Vogtmann, on a
more mathematical understanding of tree space allows a more natural definition
of distances between points in the `tree polytope'. This topological study of
tree space is crucial in the definition of a notion of neighborhood that then
allows a definition of continuity of the estimation function. The space of trees
is a space with negative curvature. It is also possible to define geodesics on
this space and convex hulls. The notion of confidence region can be defined, and
it is possible to combine trees from built from different datasets or to combine
trees obtained from different genes or even compare trees with other data
(biogeographic, for instance).

Understanding the geometry of "tree space" helps understand how to combine and
compare trees. Whether they are hierarchical clustering trees built for micro-
array DNA data or family trees built from DNA sequences, binary tree data are
abundant in today's genome era. The current proposal aims to consider trees as a
whole, instead of breaking them down into just sibling relationships as is done
currently. This problem uses recent results from topology and the geometry of
spaces with negative curvature, like the surface of a hyperboloid. In these
spaces notions of average and distance have to be redefined, the hardest being
ways of representing what is not naturally representable in our usual euclidean
space. The challenges are both computational and geometric.
