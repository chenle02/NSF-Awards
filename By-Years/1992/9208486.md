Visualization-based visual languages, a new class of visual languages are based
upon visual models derived from common and useful program visualizations. In
this project, visualization models which may also be useful as programming
models shall be collected in a number of problem domains. A visual language for
the specification of communications protocols based on message-flow diagrams
will be implemented.
