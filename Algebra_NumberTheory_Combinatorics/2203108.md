This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the workshop
WINART3, Women in Noncommutative Algebra and Representation Theory, held at the
Banff International Research Station, Banff, Canada on April 3-8, 2022. The goal
of the workshop is to bring together experts and junior participants working in
these fields to collaborate on research projects, and its primary focus is to
facilitate research activities. There will be eight research groups consisting
of four to six participants, each led by two research leaders. Each group will
come to the workshop with a prepared plan and project and spend most of the
workshop working on their respective projects. The workshop will also feature
several introductory, as well as more advanced, talks, and professional
development activities. This structure was very successful in previous workshops
in the series: WINART1 in 2016 and WINART2 in 2019.

The fields of noncommutative algebra and representation theory have long been
closely intertwined, but even more so since the emergence of quantum groups in
the 1980s. The results in these fields have been significant in their own right
and also have had a strong influence in shaping other fields such as conformal
field theory, the study of operator algebras, string theory, topological field
theory, and the various forms of noncommutative geometry. There will be a
variety of research topics present at the WINART3 workshop: cluster theory, Hopf
algebras and their representation theory, weak Hopf algebras and their actions
on algebras, infinite-dimensional Lie theory, and Hochschild cohomology. The

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
