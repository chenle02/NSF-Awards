Drying processes are used in almost all major industries from agriculture to
plastics, yet are only 40-45% efficient. An advanced model for a drying system,
presented in a user-friendly software format, could aid in both overall system
efficiency and in the design and maintenance of the drier drums in the case of
the pulp and paper industry. Although much work is available discussing heat and
mass transfer through porous media, very few models have been developed for
fibrous media and water removal systems. In general, existing models either
incorporate too many assumptions or else fail to correlate with experimental
data. %%% The intent of this research is to develop a suitable model which, once
reduced by acceptable assumptions and approximations, can be solved numerically.
A software package will then be developed to simulate entire drying systems.
