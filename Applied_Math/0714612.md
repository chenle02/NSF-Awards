Stiff oscillatory ordinary differential equations are common mathematical models
in many important scientific fields, ranging from classical celestial mechanics
to atomistic dynamics in modern physics and chemistry. These models are gaining
ever more importance as the computer capability increases. Numerous simulations
based on such systems are being performed in order to predict the nature, for
example, of propagation of cracks and dislocations in metals and under what
condition certain proteins change shape and take on specific functions that can
be used in drug design. Many fundamental phenomena are generated through
delicate interactions between rapid oscillations.

The challenge is to simulate these highly oscillatory interactions over
physically relevant time without having the quality of the output being damaged
by numerical errors. The research of this proposal aims at developing a new
multi-scale computational approach such that the interesting phenomena resulting
from interaction between oscillations can be computed accurately and efficiently
over long time. The corresponding mathematical analysis of the algorithms will
also be performed.
