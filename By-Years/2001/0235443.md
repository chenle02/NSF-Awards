The purpose of this SGER project is to support collaborative research to be
carried out utilizing the Clemson University relocatable optical observatory and
the radar and optical instrumentation at Millstone Hill Observatory. The Clemson
optical observatory is equipped with two optical instruments: a triple etalon
Fabry-Perot interferometer (designated as SOFDI) and an all sky imaging
photometer. The plan is to locate the optical observatory at a location near
Newport, Vermont for four months of remote operations from March to July of
2003. The objectives of the proposed collaboration are listed as follows: 1) to
obtain and compare simultaneous optical and radar measurements of meridional
winds and temperatures during the daytime, 2) to obtain and compare simultaneous
optical and radar observations of ion temperatures and ion drifts during
twilight periods, 3) to carry out simultaneous bistatic observations of
mesospheric and thermospheric winds and temperatures during the night to examine
possible correlation between mesosphere and thermosphere gravity wave activity,
4) to search for possible evidence of the hot oxygen corona through the
detection of an anomalous broadening of the 732 nm spectral profile and to
compare these results with Millstone Hill results, 5) to search for possible
evidence of the daytime formation of auroral discrete arcs, 6) to obtain and
compare mesospheric wind measurements obtained with the U. of New Hampshire
meteor wind radar with the results from the FPI measurements of mesospheric
winds. This collaborative series of observations would serve as an excellent
field test of the new design represented by the SOFDI FPI instrument before the
planned deployment of the Clemson relocatable optical observatory to the
location of Huancayo, Peru. Only an SGER award can support such a window of
opportunity of fielding the SOFDI close to an ISR, namely that at Millstone
Hill.
