This research and development project explores the mechanisms that initiate and
support innovation in early childhood education, especially in combining
informal learning via public media and technology with teacher and family
interactions to maximize children's math learning. Deliverables include 27
episodes of Peg+Cat, an animated math adventure series on PBS, 8 related online
games and apps, summer math institutes and school-year training for
preschool/Head Start teachers, and complementary activities and resources to
support parent's knowledge and practice and student's engagement, interest, and
learning of foundational math concepts. The research agenda will test several
hypotheses regarding the strategies to extend teacher's math content knowledge
and pedagogy and parent/ caregiver's understanding and valuing of math. A key
question will focus on how coupled learning opportunities (professional
development for teachers, transmedia, and support for families) enable and
sustain children's engagement and learning in math.

Formative evaluation of the media components will use focus groups of 3-5 year
olds to assure develerables are engaging and accessible. The summative
evaluation by Rockman et al will focus on how well the project met its overall
goals including the project implementation, and impacts on Head Start teachers,
parents/caregivers, and preschoolers.

The project's transmedia deliverables will reach millions of preschoolers
through daily PBS broadcasts and online games and apps. Fifty Head Start
teachers will participate in the two-year professional development program and
will be using new content knowledge and pedagogy to teach 550 Head Start
children in southwest Pennsylvania and engage their parents/caregivers. The Head
Start infrastructure will provide further dissemination of the project's
findings and resources.
