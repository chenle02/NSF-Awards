9528411 Cole This award supports the participation of U.S. scientists in an
international science and implementation workshop for the new Annual Records of
Tropical Systems (ARTS) initiative. ARTS is a task of Past Global Changes
(PAGES), a core project of the IGBP. The goal of ARTS is to expand our knowledge
of the behavior of the tropical ocean-atmosphere, with seasonal-annual
resolution, over periods of years to centuries. This research will enhance our
understanding of the global climate variability and should ultimately lead to
greater predictability of the climate system. The proposed workshop will help to
set scientific priorities, coordinate ongoing research, define new avenues of
research, and catalyze international collaboration in the pursuit of ARTS
objectives. Participants will include experts in several paleoclimatology
disciplines as well as climatologists versed in tropical ocean-atmosphere
interactions. Products of the workshop will include a written science and
implementation plan for publication by PAGES as well as a series of prospectuses
for specific science projects to be carried out as part of ARTS. Scientists from
the U.S., Indonesia, France, Australia, Canada, China, and Japan are expected to
participate.
