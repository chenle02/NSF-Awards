This proposal seeks to continue the PI's research program on the antecedents
and prediction of divorce. The PI's previous work investigated the causes and
prevention of marital distress. In this earlier work, the PI found that males'
withdrawal from conflict was the best predictor of divorce. The present work
will follow the PI's earlier research respondents into their child rearing
stage, to see how marital distress affects children. The research will assess
the relation between affect regulation in marriage and in the parent child
relationship (how is withdrawal in the marriage related to withdrawal from the
child?). The effects of children on marital satisfaction and interaction also
will be examined. In addition, divorced spouses will also be studied in their
new relationships, to determine if dysfunctional patterns are repeated in second
marriages. This research is focused on a critically important issue for American
society. It is theory based, rigorous, and beautifully designed. Markman has
proved himself in this arena, and deserves further funding.
