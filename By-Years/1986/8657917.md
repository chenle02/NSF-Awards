The field of design optimization has evolved over approximately two decades.
One fruitful area of design optimization research is design sensitivity analysis
which enables approximation analysis, analytical model improvement, and
assessment of design trends. Thus, design sensitivity analysis has become more
than a utility for optimization, and is a versatile design tool in its own
right. However, in the past, most research in this area tended to focus on
theoretical studies. The research interests of this Presidential Young
Investigator are to develop reliable sensitivity analysis techniques that
consider modelling uncertainty, system nonlinearity, and large-scale and
interdisciplinary problems that are encountered frequently in industrial
environments. The results of this research should prompt the application of
sensitivity analysis to practical design processes. This grant also provides for
one undergraduate to assist Professor Hou in his research. This supplement is
made under the program for Research Experiences for Undergraduates.
