9422135 Moon This award is to purchase equipment for characterizing major
disturbances and designing effective equalization schemes for high density data
storage channels. Advanced signal processing and communications techniques are
playing an increasingly important role in improving reliability and storage
capacity of magnetic data storage systems. Although similar to most
communication channels in many respects, magnetic storage channels suffer from
channel disturbances that are considerably different from those observed in
other communication channels. Presently, a communication channel model
describing the read and write processes in the high density magnetic channel
corrupted by nonadditive media noise and nonlinear distortion is being
developed. The effective equalization and channel estimation schemes suitable
for magnetic recording under such severe channel conditions are also being
investigated. Experimental disk spindle systems are under development to pursue
the channel characterization and signal processing research. The equipment will
be used to develop these experimental test spindle systems to support several
research projects, including in particular: characterization of nonlinearity,
design of nonlinear equalizers, adaptive channel identification/equalization,
characterization of transition noise, and design of a read transducer for narrow
track recording. ***
