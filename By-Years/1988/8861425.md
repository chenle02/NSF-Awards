Computer simulation will be used to develop a code which can address
simultaneously all of the seven major areas in modern lubrication problems:
thermal effects in the fluid, mixed inlet flows, cavitation, two phase flow,
time-varying conditions, turbulence, and elastohydrodynamics. The end goal is to
produce user-friendly design codes which will eliminate the current empiricism
and strongly reduce the experimental test work in the design and development of
lubricated tribosystems.
