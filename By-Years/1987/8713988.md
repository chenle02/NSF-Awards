The Great South Channel region contains unusually abundant populations of three
endangered whale species: right, humpback and fin whales. The South Channel
Ocean Productivity Experiment (SCOPEX) will look at the physical oceanographic
and biological/ecological mechanisms responsible for these aggregations. Using
both aerial and ship-based surveys, the distribution and abundance of right
whales in the region will be determined. Detailed distributional and behavioral
observations of these animals, including data from intensive sonar and radio-
tagging studies will provide tests of hypotheses on how the aggregations form
and are maintained. The proposed research in the circulation in the Great South
Channel region will provide information necessary to interpreting the mechanism
of aggregation in the consumers and primary producers in this important area.
