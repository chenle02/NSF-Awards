The PI's will work with 9 undergraduates/year using the latest digital survey
instruments to develop a series of high-resolution analytical base maps of
crustal deformation processes visible in outcrops of coastal Maine. This two-
year summer research program of precision mapping and strain analysis will
document the complex structural history of two key outcrop areas in relation to
regional strain accommodation due to strike-slip shearing on the Norumbega fault
zone as depicted in the geometry of deformed veins and intrusions. Both selected
sites offer extensive exposure and complex strain histories associated with two
newly recognized areas of shear wihin the southeast flank of the main Norumbega
fault zone. Detailed geometries of deformed structural features will be mapped
into a geographic information system (GIS) using global positioning systems
(GPS) and electronic total stations for data collection. The project will
include a six-week summer research session, and a fall semester independent
study culminating with collaborative work on abstracts and posters for
presentation of results at a professional meeting.
