A standard approach to analyzing periodic signal associated with the response
of mechanical and electromechanical systems is the Fourier Transform. However,
there is no conventional method for detection and analysis of transients of such
systems. This project proposes the use of the wavelet transform as a solution to
this problem. It has recently been used for this purpose in non mechanical
fields. Phase I research will focus on fundamental issues related to
repeatability of wavelet coefficients in the presence of arbitrary time shifts,
and the ability to individually identify transients.
