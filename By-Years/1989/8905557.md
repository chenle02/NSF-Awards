It is well documented that rhizobial purine auxotrophs are incapable of
eliciting complete nodule development and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Recent
work in Dr. Noel's laboratory suggests that the underlying cause of the
symbiotic defect is inability to produce ribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
(AICAR), an intermediate in the pathway. The outlined project is to substantiate
further the original observations, to test the hypothesis that AICAR is an
infection-thread determinant, and to define this role more clearly. The
experiments probe the uptake and fate of AICAR in the bacteria and the
possibility that AICAR affects the plant directly. They will document the AICAR
stimulated enhancement of nodule development by microscopic analysis of anatomy
and electrophoretic analysis of proteins. The effect of host roots and root
exudate on bacterial purine and AICAR metabolism will be analyzed, mainly by
tracer experiments in which labelled compounds are separated by a versatile
thin- layer chromatography technique of great resolving power. Metabolic changes
in the infectible region of the root will be analyzed after challenging the
plant with the most likely bacterial mediator of the AICAR effect. %%% The
establishment of the symbiotic association between nitrogen fixing bacteria and
the roots of legumes is extremely important to agriculture. It is also of
interest for an understanding of how signals are passed from one organism to
another.
