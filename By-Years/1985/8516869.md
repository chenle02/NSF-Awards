Support is provided for several U.S. earthquake engineering researchers to
travel to Turkey during the summer of 1985 to attend a U.S.-Turkey Symposium on
Earthquake Engineering and Seismological Network. The symposium is intended as a
means to stimulate active future research cooperation in selected subject areas
of mutual concern. Turkey, being one of the most active regions of seismicity in
Eurasia, is experienced in earthquake problems and resourceful in research. The
Symposium will provide an adequate forum for scientists/engineers from both
sides to explore opportunities and challenges in the problem areas of seismic
network, ground motion study, risk and hazard analysis, and structural
engineering. The discussion will be focused on the methods and technical
approaches to characterize earthquake ground motions and to design and maintain
facilities to minimize loss of lives and property due to earthquakes.
