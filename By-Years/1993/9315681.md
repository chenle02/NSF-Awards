9315681 Akay A workshop will be held to assess the research needs in the
interdisciplinary area of friction interactions with the dynamic behavior of
systems. The generic problems in the behavior of dynamic systems caused by
friction forces, such as noise, chatter and vibrations, will be identified and
research venues to affect their eventual control will be proposed. In addition,
assessments will be made of the potential for greater use of vibrational inputs
to control and minimize friction. A survey of industrial needs will be
undertaken prior to the workshop. *** in the interdisciplinary area of friction
