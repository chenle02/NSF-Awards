This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the
requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled,
Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CyberIdentity Infrastructure for National
Science project will have a broad impact due to its addressing of identity
management is a fundamental requirement across a wide range of disciplines and
projects. Today, any cyberinfrastructure project of any size was establish its
own identity management system. The results of this proposal would be broadly
applicable across these and other projects by standardizing this approach and
reducing the effort required by the projects. The intellectual merit of the
project are found in the effort needed to the key trust relationships between
the NSF communities and the InCommon universities. Building this trust requires
meeting technical, social and policy challenges in the areas of authorization,
privacy and incident response for federated identity.
