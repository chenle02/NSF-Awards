This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University to acquire
two state-of-the-art NMR consoles to upgrade existing 300 MHz NMR Spectrometers
and retrofit the AC consoles to upgrade the IBM WP-270 MHz NMR. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1)
metallobiochemistry of co-enzyme B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase, (2)
development of methodology for synthesis of modified oligonucleotides, (3)
synthesis of unnatural nucleoside analogs based on cyclobutenone chemistry, (4)
formamidines and other chiral carbanions, (5) synthesis and application of
highly fluorinated weakly coordinating anions, (6) quinocarcin mechanism of DNA
cleavage and (7) bioorganic and bioinorganic chemistry of vanadium and
phosphorous. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
