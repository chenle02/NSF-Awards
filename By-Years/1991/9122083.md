This project is designed to study the socio-religious history of the Yup'ik
Eskimos of Sivuqaq (St. Lawrence Island, Alaska). The goal is to study present
religious systems and the socio-religious changes which took place following the
introduction of Christianity in the 1900s. Ethnographical, ethnohistorical,
oralhistorical and contemporary oral data will be used to construct an
ethnographic narrative based on native perspectives, the so-called emic
perspective. The study draws theoretically and methodologically on the
relationship of the anthropologist to human subjects, and the participation of
Native people in the research process.
