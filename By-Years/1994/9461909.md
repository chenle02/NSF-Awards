This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes research
necessary to create an interactive, exploratory software environment for
detecting and modeling change points. The problem of detecting and modeling
change points is faced in many contexts in which more than one model is needed
to describe the data. For example, health variables describing a patient may
change drastically after heart surgery. The challenge is to detect change
points, and to characterize the nature of the change. Phase I research will
focus on (1) algorithms for robust methods, (2) interactive, dynamic graphics,
(3) the state space approach to modeling seasonal data which contains change
points, and (4) investigating the MTD model in which it is not necessary to
specify in advance the presence of change points. Phase II will expand upon
Phase I work, investigate methods for a broader set of problems, and develop a
prototype implementation. Phase III will develop a final commercial product,
implemented in the modern statistical package S-PLUS. This important set of
modern statistical tools will enable applied statisticians, scientists,
engineers, and other data analysts to fit more realistic models, and thereby
realize the greatest return on their investment of collecting data. Such tools
will help speed technological innovation, and make scientific research more
efficient.
