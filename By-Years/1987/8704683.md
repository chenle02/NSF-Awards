The PI will update and analyze paleomagnetic data for the last five million
years to carry out robust statistical analyses on the polarity asymmetry problem
and to determine the origin of the latitudinal variation of paleosecular
variation. Preliminary analyses indicate that there is some discernible polarity
asymmetry for the mean field ata (and only mean field data). The possibility
that this asymmetry is due to thermal electric effects in the seismic D" region
will be examined. Analyses of the present field using procedures analogous to
those used by paleomagnetists in paleosecular variation studies of lava flows
indicate a method by which for the first time the dipole and quadrupole families
of dynamo theory can be distinquished by analyzing paleomagnetic data. Detailed
analyses will be carried out using an updated data set for rocks with ages less
than five million years. If successful for this period of time, the methods will
be applied to updated data going back in time to the Cretaceous.
