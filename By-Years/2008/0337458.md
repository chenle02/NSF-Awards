The development of fabric and anisotropy in mantle peridotites in natural shear
zones of the New Caledonia ophiolite is being studied using a combination of
electron backscatter diffraction and high-field anisotropy of magnetic
susceptibility techniques to determine lattice preferred orientation. Electron
backscatter diffraction provides an accurate measurement of lattice preferred
orientation and yields information on slip systems and deformation temperatures.
High-field anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility is a new method that provides
the orientation of the fabric main axes and the degree of anisotropy by
isolating the magnetic contribution of silicates. The high-field anisotropy of
magnetic susceptibility method is considerably faster than electron backscatter
diffraction and, therefore, allows mapping of deformation gradients at a higher
resolution. The project is quantitatively establishing the degree of correlation
between high-field magnetic anisotropy and mineral fabric anisotropy determined
using electron backscatter diffraction and other well-established methods such
as the universal stage technique. If successful, the new method will permit more
rapid study of mantle fabrics over a large area, thus aiding interpretation of
seismic anisotropy data from the mantle.
