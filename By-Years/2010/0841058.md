Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this effort is to investigate the feasibility of a highly sensitive microsystem
for chemical sensing based on an indium phosphide
substrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal
explores the possibility of optical detection of chemicals using an integrated
system on an indium phosphide substrate. It will include a laser source,
integrated directly with a microcantilever and photodetectors, that will permit
the precise tracking of the resonant frequency of the cantilever. Functionalized
coatings on the cantilever will be used to absorb chemicals from the environment
and this interaction will change the mass, and consequently, the resonant
frequency, of the cantilever. The system implementation will include a servo-
control circuit. The integration of a micromechanical and photonic system is
expected to yield very high sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
&lt;br/&gt;This project has substantial interdisciplinary scope, encompassing
photonics, micromechanics, and chemical sensing. In addition to its research
outcome, it promises to be a good vehicle for teaching students at both
undergraduate and graduate levels. The research results will be disseminated
through classroom instruction and
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
