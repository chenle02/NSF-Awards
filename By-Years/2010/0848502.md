The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry at NSF
supports the research program of Prof. Kummel of the University of California,
San Diego (UCSD). Prof. Kummel and his students investigate how explosive
molecules absorb onto organic films and change their electrical properties; the
change in electrical properties is used to detect the presence of the explosive
molecules thereby creating a sensor. The sensors are similar to the transistors
which power computers but are made of organic materials instead of silicon
because organic materials absorb gases from ambient air. The films developed at
UCSD can identify peroxides; peroxide sensing is critical for the detection of
improvised explosive devices (IEDs) as well as sterilization of surgical
equipment, pharmaceutical supplies, and bio-decontamination. Using an array of
organic sensor films, more exotic compounds can be detected including nerve
agents and volatile organic compounds which are important in mold sensing. The
project provides excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate
students in a scientific area of great significance to US national security.
