Partial support is provided to the American Phytopathological Society in order
for plant pathologists and scientists in related fields from the United States
to travel to Kyoto, Japan in order to participate in the Fifth International
Congress of Plant Pathology to be held on August 20-27, 1988. This international
meeting has been scheduled at five year intervals and this Congress will be the
fifth one that is devoted exclusively to this area of science. The amount of
travel support, $20,000, is based on the number of American plant pathologists
involved in planning the program and invited to participate, the number who have
indicated that they are planning to participate if funding is available and an
estimate of the financial support required to enable this country to be
represented properly at this important Congress. The Society will assume
responsibility for meeting at which it is critical to have appropriate
participation by U.S. scientists as many other countries also have strong
research interests in these aspects of plant biology. The principal
investigator, Dr. Kelman, is a highly regarded plant biologist and the Society
has a proven track record in managing an international travel award effort.
