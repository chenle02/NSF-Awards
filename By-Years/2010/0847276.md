The purpose of this workshop is to initiate a dialogue between the higher
education CIO community and the GENI Project Office. EDUCAUSE, an association of
over 2,000 institutions of higher education and their corporate partners, will
convene the meeting at the end of August 2008. EDUCAUSE provides leadership on
how to build and deploy advanced broadband networks in this country.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dialogue is central to linking US networked
university research facilities to a suite of novel network experimental
infrastructure, which is currently in the planning stages. Providing the means
to link new experimental infrastructure to university campuses will allow
network science and engineering researchers to pose interesting research
questions and carry out experiments that could never be done before. The
particular technologies, operational logistics, policies, management, and
financial issues will be hammered out and negotiated at this workshop of
approximately twenty to thirty university CIOs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular
emphasis will be put on exploring how GENI may extend into and through their
campuses. EDUCAUSE plans to work with the attendees to identify what is
achievable and what the remaining challenges are in terms of national campus
deployment. The GENI Project Office will learn what is important to campus IT
departments and how to minimize any impacts on them. The longer-term impacts are
that students and faculty across the country will benefit from using and
experimenting on a suite of advanced experimental network infrastructure that is
currently in the planning stages.&lt;br/&gt;
