The 24th international conference on parallel architectures and compilation
techniques (PACT) will be held in San Francisco, CA in October 2015. PACT is a
multi-disciplinary conference that brings together researchers from hardware and
software areas to present ground-breaking research in parallel systems ranging
across instruction-level parallelism, thread-level parallelism, multiprocessor
parallelism and large scale systems. This award is to make travel scholarships
available to students and universities not typically represented at PACT in
order to improve the conference?s impact and outreach.
