This project asks for support to collect large-diameter, long (&gt;20- 30 m)
piston cores at selected Blake and Bahama Outer Ridge intermediate water depth
sediment drift sites, and conduct a 3.5 Khz survey to tie into existing multi-
and single-channel seismic reflection data. This work will provide significant
new data on the paleoceanography of this mid-latitude region in late Quaternary
time, and thus is of timely relevance to Ocean Drilling Program objectives.
Characterization and reconnaissance sampling of drift deposits will allow the
recovery of high deposition rate sediments (likely 8-14 cm/kiloyear) that hold
the key to analysis and interpretation of sub-orbital scale global change
events.
