Fourier analysis is a flourishing and vibrant mathematical field. It is a core
subject in mathematics because its central purpose is to understand analysis on
a geometric manifold and the oscillatory behavior of phenomena characterizing
the manifold. The direction and emphasis of much research over the past few
years has been placed on applications of ideas from Fourier analysis to other
areas of analysis, including applied mathematics, differential geometry,
dynamical systems, mathematical physics, partial differential equations,
probability and several complex variables. New advances continue to be made in
research aimed toward understanding basic problems related to maximal functions,
multiplier operators and singular integrals which are at the heart of Fourier
analysis. This grant will support a conference in Fourier Analysis to be held
May 13 -17, 1991 at Princeton University. This conference will draw leading
analysts from all over the world, many who were associated with developing the
field. Many young researchers will also attend, and the conference should have a
strong influence on the research developments of the next generation of
mathematicians.
