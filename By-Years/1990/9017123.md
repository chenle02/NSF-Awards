The objective of this research is to investigate the statistical properties of
various process capability indices. These indices are used in many industrial
settings to determine the quality of product received from suppliers as well as
the effectiveness of competing vendors. The development of new methodologies for
assessing process capability without making any distributional assumptions is
also part of this research effort. Research will address both significant
scientific and practical issues in the area of statistical quality control.
Results should produce an impact on academia and industrial communities.
