9728624 Spilhaus This meeting will explore current multidisciplinary
methodologies for assessing the impact of non-point source (NPS) pollutants upon
soil and groundwater resources. The meeting will encourage interaction between
the disciplines of spatial statistics/geostatistics, remote sensing, geographic
information systems (GIS) and solute transport modeling to enhance the
development of techniques for the measurement, assessment, and modeling of NPS
pollutants in the Vaduz zone and in subsurface waters.
