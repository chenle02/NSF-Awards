This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project in chemistry is between Dr. R.
Stephen Berry of the University of Chicago and Dr. Zdenek Herman of the J.
Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Prague. The
research here is primarily experimental and interpretive, to study collisions of
excited atoms and molecules (energy donors) with atomic and molecular negative
ions, in particular the detachment of the extra electron of the negative ion by
transfer of the excitation energy of the donors to the negative ions.
Schematically, the process of principal interest is: A* + B- -&gt; A + B + e.
This is closely analogous to the much-studied Penning ionization phenomenon: A*
+ B-&gt;A + B + e. By analogy with the second, the researchers refer to the
first as "Penning detachment." The investigation will include the study of
related processes such as simple collisional detachment, associative detachment,
and chemi-detachment. This project in chemistry fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
