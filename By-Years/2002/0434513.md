This proposal requests support for a workshop on interdisciplinary research and
educational needs, with participation by key academic and industrial researchers
in nanotechnology from United States and India. The workshop dialog will focus
on

o Key research ideas o Underlying interdisciplinary aspects of the research o
Key issues of the interdisciplinary research and effective mechanisms for the
pursuit of research o Undergraduate and graduate teaching that addresses
interdisciplinary research needs.

The workshop will take place in Bangalore, India Aug. 11-13, 2004 at Indian
Institute of Science. This workshop follows the first US-India Workshop on
Nanotechnology that took place at University of California, Santa Barbara in
2001 with support from Indo-US Science and Technology Forum.
