The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by renovating their Mechanical
Engineering Laboratory will collocate select research activities in the
departments of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, Chemical Engineering,
Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering,
Nuclear Engineering, and Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Such collocation
will allow cross-disciplinary research to flourish in areas such as supersonic
flow research, particle combustion, co-firing of natural gas and coal, and three
dimensional turbulence and thermal transport mechanisms. The project will
renovate approximately 6,900 assignable square feet and will benefit strategic
research areas for the Nation.
