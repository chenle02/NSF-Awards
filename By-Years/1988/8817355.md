The long-term goal of this research is to understand how ATP drives ion
transport via the Na,K-Atpase. A great deal of evidence supports a mechanism in
which ATP hydrolysis is linked to the transport steps through conformational
transitions induced by substrate and ions. Despite the fact that the enzymatic
properties are known in considerable detail, little is known about the
structures of the major E1 and E2 states of the Na,K-ATPase, and even less about
proposed subconformations. This project consists of experiments designed to
delineate further the conformational states of the enzyme, in particular the
interconversions and the structural and functional relationships among them.
Current studies are continued and extended in five major areas of structural and
kinetic investigations. (1) Determination of structural relationships among
enzyme states formed by conformationally selective treatments using distances
measured by Forster energy transfer. (2) Measurement of rates of the
conformational steps in the reaction cycle with fluorescence stopped-flow. (3)
Labeling of the putative ion binding domain with fluorescent carbodiimides. (4)
Determination of the function of the IAF binding region using antibodies raised
to a purified peptide. (5) Investigation of species differences in fluorescent
labeling of Na,K-ATPase by protein sequencing techniques. Ion transport across
membranes is precisely regulated by specific transport systems. There is a
"pump" protein which exchanges sodium ions and potassium ions across membranes.
This plays an important role in regulating cell volume and acidity and ion
composition. It is known that the pump protein changes shape during ion
transport. It is important to the cell to conserve energy during this process.
This project will provide new information on the structure of the pump and its
involvement in energy metabolism.*** //
