This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of institutional change and cultural production in the
New York art world of the 1980s. It will be carried out through interviews and
examination of existing documents at examples of three categories of
establishments. Results will be analyzed in terms of theories of the modernizing
thrust in the evolution of cultural institutions. This research will contribute
to the rapidly-growing field of cultural sociology, providing data on a world
center of culture- production during a time of rapid social and economic change.
In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
