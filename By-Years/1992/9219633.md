Brittlely deforming material is commonly modeled as a homogeneous continuum. In
fact, however, the material has a substructure, characterized by rigid blocks
bounded by shear planes, and the effect of this substructure are not accounted
for by classical continuum theory. This project will test and apply a new
hypothesis that takes into account rigid block rotations on slickenline
orientations and on seismic focal mechanism solutions. The work will compare the
micropolar interpretation of seismic focal mechanism data from California
against existing paleomagnetic and geodetic data and will also study slickenline
patterns in other areas such as in sheared serpentines on the fault system in
the northern California coast ranges. Results should permit a significant test
of the theory, which has the potential of improving current understanding of
brittle deformation.
