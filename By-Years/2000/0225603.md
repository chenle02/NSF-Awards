Global climate change has the potential to produce serious impacts on natural
and human systems in permafrost regions. The Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring
(CALM) program is concerned with observing the response of the active layer and
near-surface permafrost to climate change at multi-decade timescales, and is one
of two major international observation networks devoted to permafrost.
Now&lt;br/&gt;at the end of its first decade, the CALM network incorporates more
than 100 sites involving field scientists from 15 investigating countries in
both hemispheres. This project will conduct a workshop designed to analyze the
rich database obtained from the observational network, evaluate active-layer
models for&lt;br/&gt;application under climate-change scenarios, review existing
CALM analytical methodologies and protocols, discuss future data formatting,
submission, and archive protocols, review the relation of CALM to other
international programs, discuss the role of CALM at the International Permafrost
Conference in July 2003, and the future of the CALM program. Because widespread,
systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound
effects on the flux of greenhouse gases and on the human infrastructure in cold
regions, it is critical that observation and analysis procedures be optimized.
The proposed workshop will bring together permafrost scientists with workers in
closely related areas, many of whom have divergent but complementary skills. A
thorough examination of data from the major CALM sites will permit assessment of
the overall performance of the network and its components.
The&lt;br/&gt;workshop will also facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness of
observation strategies and&lt;br/&gt;sampling designs.&lt;br/&gt;
