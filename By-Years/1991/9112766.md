This is an award to support research with goals to understand the origins of
colloidal stability and to evaluate its significance in the transport, fate and
effects that colloids have on aquatic environmental quality and on processes for
treatment of water and wastewater. Research involves development of a model
describing the interfacial region surrounding particles in aqueous systems and
the conduct of experiments to study the behavior of colloidal particles in
aqueous media with compositions representative of fresh, estuarine and marine
waters. The research includes applications of knowledge gained to environmental
problems that are associated with surface and ground waters, and in treatment
processes for water and wastewater. The presence of colloidal particles in water
negatively impacts its environmental quality and potential usefulness. These
particles also present a problem in conduct of processes to remove them from
water and wastewater. Results of this research are expected to improve the
engineering design of processes and systems to remove colloidal particles from
aqueous systems.
