The objective of this project is to investigate the mechanism by which antibody
production is regulated in cultured hybridoma cells. The specific project
objectives are to: (1) determine whether the increase in antibody production in
response to osmotic stress is regulated by transcription, translation or post-
translational processes, (2) evaluate activities of the stress-activated and
mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in response to osmotic stress, (3)
establish the role of stress response proteins and chaperones in the osmotic
stress response, (4) determine the role of cell cycle in osmotic stress
response, and (5) use existing mathematical models of antibody synthesis to
determine rate limiting steps in antibody synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;
