9603198 Falke This international conference will focus on the molecular
mechanisms of sensing and movement in simple bacterial systems. The format of
the meeting is designed to foster extensive discussions of recent developments
and ideas among researchers from the U.S. and abroad. Approximately 60 oral
presentations and 150 posters will be included in the program, allowing all
laboratories working in this field to present their key findings. Scientific
sessions will compare and contrast the sensory and locomotor systems of a
variety of prokaryotes focusing on each step in their signal transduction
pathways: transmembrane signaling, signal transduction by intracellular
cascades, sensory control of cellular motility and gene expression, and the
mechanics of cell motility. In previous years this meeting has provided an
important forum for emerging concepts concerning bacterial sensing and motility,
and has presented the first molecular details of the structure and function of a
family of signaling proteins that are pervasive in prokaryotic organisms and are
now found in eukaryotic cells as well. ***
