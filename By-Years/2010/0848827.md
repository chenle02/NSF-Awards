George Shields of Armstrong Atlantic State University is supported by an RUI
award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the Division
of Chemistry to determine the minimum energy structures and the thermodynamics
for formation of small aerosols that will serve as neutral and ionic cloud
condensation nuclei. His methods allow him to determine the relevant abundance
of all the potentially relevant complexes, thus allowing his research group,
consisting mainly of undergraduates, to assess which ones are of atmospheric
importance.

The project is having a broad impact through its model of a deep, sustained and
productive undergraduate research experience involving the same students,
including minorities and women, throughout their undergraduate years.
