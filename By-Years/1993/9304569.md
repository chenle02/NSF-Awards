This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support travel expenses for 13 US
mathematicians to meet with Latin American counterparts and participate in a
workshop on dynamical systems, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August
2-15, 1993. The US organizer is Sheldon Newhouse of the University of North
Carolina and the Brazilian organizer is Jacob Palis of the Institute of Pure and
Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The project will enable
this group of top American mathematicians to interact, discuss research
problems, and develop collaborative research proposals with peers as well as
with promising young mathematicians from Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Mexico,
Uruguay, and Argentina. The host site will be IMPA, an international center of
excellence. All sides are likely to benefit from the exchange of cutting-edge
information, the establishment of future collaborative ties, and the
strengthening of the human resource base in Latin America.
