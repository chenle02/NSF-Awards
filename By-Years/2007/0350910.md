How does animation work? Eye-movement analyses of dynamic geovisualization
displays.

As real-time three-dimensional landscape fly-throughs and interactive map
animations of various spatial diffusion processes become ubiquitous with
dissemination through the Internet, the key question that remains is how
effective the potential increase of information density in these highly
interactive visual forms really is for learning, knowledge construction, and
knowledge dissemination and education.

The main goal of this proposed project is to empirically evaluate the
effectiveness of interactive and dynamic geographic visualization displays for
knowledge discovery and knowledge construction. Based on a research framework
from cognitive science, and utilizing the eye-movement data collection approach,
a series of controlled animation experiments are proposed. These empirical
studies adhere to experimental design standards in cognitive science, but are
additionally grounded on a dynamic design framework borrowed from cartography,
computer graphics and cinematography, to investigate how dynamic visual
variables, and various levels of interactivity affect people's knowledge
construction processes from dynamic displays as compared to static displays.

The outcome of this investigation will be a increased understanding of how
people use dynamic displays to explore dynamic geographic phenomena, and how
people make inferences from dynamic visualizations for knowledge construction in
a geographical context. A dynamic design framework will be developed informed by
the outcomes from the eye-movement studies. This framework will include design
guidelines for academics and practitioners alike, both of whom employ dynamic
graphic displays to educate, to do research, and/or to communicate research
results on dynamic spatial phenomena.
