This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
funds research in the laboratory of Professor Brice Bosnich at the University of
Chicago to study how dinuclear metal sites can release their individual
electrons to effect a two-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to peroxide.
Such reductions are essential in biology to activate oxygen to oxidize organic
substrates. This work will contribute to a fundamental understanding of how the
second metal ion can more easily release an electron to molecular oxygen
following withdrawal of the first electron from the first metal ion to which the
oxygen coordinates. Several binucleating ligands will be synthesized and
dinuclear metal complexes prepared as systems for studying the sequential
electron transfer process. Reactions with oxygen atom transfer reagents will
also be studied. Complexes that are likely to undergo oxidative addition
reactions in which the two electrons would derive from each member of the metal
ion pair will also be prepared and investigated. Dinuclear transition metal ion
complexes will be prepared in order to study electron-pair transfer to oxygen
and other substrates. Some types of biological activation of oxygen proceed by
this route to activate molecular oxygen to oxidize organic molecules. This
research should lead to a better understanding of how electrons are derived from
metal ion pairs and this understanding could assist in inventing new methods of
activating oxygen to oxidize hydrocarbons in industrial feedstock processes.
