A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of
the 39th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and
Implementation (PLDI), the premier conference in the areas of programming
languages and compilers. The conference will be held in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented
groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the
mentoring workshop in addition to the PLDI conference. The impact of the award
relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for
students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next
generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming
languages and compilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
