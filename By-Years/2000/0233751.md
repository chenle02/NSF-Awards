This project is a modeling study of processes that control the concentrations of
oxidants at northern mid and high latitudes over North America. A suite of 1-D,
regional 3-D, and global 3-D models will be used to analyze airborne
observations collected during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring
Equinox Experiment (TOPSE). Major scientific issues to be examined include: (1)
the altitude and latitude distributions of the springtime O3 maximum and factors
contributing to the variation in the spatial distributions; (2) the correlations
among O3, NOx, NOy, CO, and hydrocarbons by time and latitude and their
implications on the origin of the springtime O3 maximum and sources of HOx and
NOx; (3) the impact of halogen radicals on chemistry in the Arctic and vicinity
in spring. These studies will involve assessing the relative roles of transport
and chemistry in the tropospheric chemistry of this region. Dr. Wang is
collaborating with Yongqiang Liu, Georgia Institute of Technology, ATM-0000338.
