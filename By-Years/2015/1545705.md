Embedded network systems are transforming the planetary compute fabric, changing
the way we coordinate with peers, safeguard natural resources, and protect local
communities. Ensuring the correctness and performance of these systems has
immediate relevance to the health and welfare of the planet. The objective of
this CAREER project is to develop the theoretical and applied foundations
necessary to ensure these properties and to instill the requisite skills in the
next generation of embedded network system engineers. The project relies on a
pattern-centric approach motivated by the profound impact of design patterns on
software reliability and programmer productivity in other domains and the
observation that these benefits can be amplified through the development of
formal foundations and supporting software tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There
are four project components: First, the team is codifying expert knowledge in
the form of new patterns for embedded network system design and implementation.
Second, the team is developing a specification and reasoning formalism to
capture pattern requirements precisely and to validate the correctness of
pattern implementations. Third, the team is developing static analysis
techniques and supporting software tools to automate the detection of pattern
implementation errors. Finally, the team is applying these techniques and tools
to reverse-engineering and code generation tasks, extending the benefits of
model-based software engineering to this new domain. The dissemination and
outreach program includes publication, undergraduate and graduate curriculum
integration, undergraduate research involvement, high-school outreach and
engagement, academic and dissemination to industry, and mini-workshops for
evaluation and promulgation of findings, methods and tools.&lt;br/&gt;
