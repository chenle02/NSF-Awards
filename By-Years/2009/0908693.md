This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Wandelt will develop several
methods for using the properties of cosmic voids to learn about dark energy, the
most fundamental problem in modern cosmology. The equation of state of dark
energy will be constrained using the number, size, and ellipticity distribution
of voids and their variations with redshift. Preliminary results indicate that
this work will be competitive with other future dark energy probes. Voids as a
cosmological probe have independent systematic effects allowing important cross-
checks between this and other methods for investigating dark
energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this program include student
training in research, and development of the online demonstration room, a "Dark
Energy Laboratory," which will leverage the existing virtual community of over
8000 participants in CosmologyAtHome.org.
