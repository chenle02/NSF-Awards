In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Arthur Utz of Tufts University will conduct research
on the dynamics of rovibrational-state-selected molecules on reactive metal
surfaces. The studies will be carried out by combining infrared laser excitation
methods with ultra-high vacuum techniques. The ultimate goal of this work is to
develop a better understanding of the important variables that influence gas-
surface reactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will provide
theorists with much in the way of useful data to test the latest theories. The
results will also have an impact on providing important guidance in designing
practical catalytic reaction schemes, important to industry. The research also
provides exceptional training to the student researchers working with Prof.
Utz.&lt;br/&gt;
