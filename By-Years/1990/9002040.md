Funds are requested to construct a high sensitivity, high time resolution flash
spectrophotometer capable of measurements at UV, visible and near IR
wavelengths. A flash lamp is used for interrogation of absorption signals,
resulting in extremely high optical resolution coupled with nanosecond time
resolution. The use of fiber optic guides to direct light into and away from
experimental samples allows the instrument to be easily reconfigured to measure
fluorescence and luminescence, all of which make use of essentially the same
sensitive electronic components. This type of instrument is used often for
biophysical studies of photosynthetic material. Accordingly, four of the major
and one of the minor users will concentrate on photosynthetic parameters to
evaluate models of protein translocation across biological membranes, responses
of photosynthetic material to changing light conditions, organization of the
photosynthetic electron transport chain, and intracellular communication between
chloroplasts and cell surfaces. Proposed uses for instrument not directly
related to photosynthesis include determination of the viscosity of model
membranes around reconstituted membrane proteins, investigation of the effects
of mutations in the phytochrome apoprotein on phytochrome function, and
development of sensitive assays for the function of electrogenic ATPases.
