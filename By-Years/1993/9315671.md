ABSTRACT CTS-9315671 University of Maine P. I.: Albert Co Experimental work
will be undertaken to obtain steady-state features of the multilayer film
casting process as functions of films configurations, fluid rheological
properties and operating variables. Instabilities in multilayer flows will also
be studied experimentally, examining the onset of draw resonance and the
characteristics of finite-amplitude disturbances in terms of film
configurations, fluid rheological properties and operating variables.
