This award provides support for students to participate in the Seventh Summer
School on Exotic Beam Physics at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, August
3-8, 2009. The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate
students who are actively involved in research, and postdocs (within 2 years of
their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on
activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present
their research. The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so
that the community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use Facility for
Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online.

In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a
broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the
elements to the enhancement of national security. An important element in this
progress will be to extend the study of nuclei into new domains of isospin. This
will require new radioactive ion beam facilities, together with advanced multi-
detector arrays and mass spectrometers.
