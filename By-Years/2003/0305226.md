Proposal ID DMS-0305226&lt;br/&gt;PI Luke-jon Tierney&lt;br/&gt;Title Computing
environments for
statistics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator
explores and develops new principles for the design of statistical software to
take advantage of modern computing power. Particular emphasis is placed on
exploring the effective use of compilation, name space management, and exception
handling for statistical languages, and on developing effective tools and
frameworks for parallel computing in statistics. Pilot implementations are
incorporated in open source statistical software
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective statistical methodology made available
through statistical software is critical to the ability of researchers to make
maximal use of experimental and observational data, and for the ability of
instructors to teach good research practices. The design principles developed by
this research lead to software that improves the ability of researchers,
instructors, and other users of statistical methodology to apply this
methodology more effectively in scientific research and teaching. These
principles also lead to software frameworks that can be used to more rapidly
deliver new statistical methodology to end users.&lt;br/&gt;
