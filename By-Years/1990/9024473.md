The use of sacrificial layers is a integral part of surface micromachining
technology. Currently, silicon dioxide is the most widely used sacrificial layer
material. However, since hydrofluoric acid is needed to remove oxide sacrificial
layers, many acid-sensitive metals such as aluminum and chromium are not
compatible with surface micromachining schemes. Phase I studies demonstrated
that a new family of sacrificial layers materials termed alkali-soluble
polyimides, or ASI's can be used to fabricate metal microdevices without the
usual problems of metal attack. ASI's were originally developed as improved
lift-off coatings for integrated circuit manufacturing processes. They exhibit
excellent high temperature stability an chemical resistance and, most
importantly, they can be removed by mild, noncorrosive enchants. Removal occurs
rapidly without attendant swelling that can jeopardize the integrity of
overlying structures. Phase II will investigate the basic relationships between
polymer structure, etch bath chemistry, and a host of processing variables to
understand how they control the behavior of ASI materials. The knowledge base
will be invaluable for developing successful ASI-based sacrificial layer
products during Phase III. These new products are expected to become an
important part of the polyimides business which is currently serving the
microelectronics and optoelectronics industries.
