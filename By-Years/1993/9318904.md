9318904 Lafferty Piedmont Community College requests support from NSF for
connection of its campus network to VERnet. VERnet is the midlevel network
located in the state of Virginia. VERnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Piedmont Community College connection to
the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to
access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able
to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
