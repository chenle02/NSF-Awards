This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the
feasibility of an innovative new process for the production of hot rolled
titanium alloy sheet. Hot rolled titanium alloy is currently manufactured using
facilities designed to produce other materials, such as stainless steels. As a
consequence, it is common for the production of hot rolled titanium alloy sheet
to require several months of processing, with a material yield of less than one-
half. In the proposed research, equipment specifically designed for the
production of titanium sheet will be developed and implemented to streamline
production. In conjunction with equipment improvements, cutting-edge processing
technology and innovative ideas will be incorporated to yield the following
benefits over traditional titanium alloy sheet production processes: 1)
significant reduction in the number of manufacturing steps required; 2)
improvement in the quality and mechanical properties; and 3) substantial
reduction in the yield loss, production time, and final cost.

The commercial benefits of this new process will make hot rolled titanium alloy
sheet more competitive with other metals on a cost basis. Ultimately, it is
believed that the proposed process will lead to an increase in the market share
and number of products that can economically incorporate titanium alloy sheet.
