The era of gravitational wave astronomy began a few years ago with the first
direct detections by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. These detections and the
accompanying understanding result from detailed knowledge of expected
gravitational waveforms, and numerical evolutions are a critical ingredient in
this regard. This project studies a primary source of gravitational waves for
the recently upgraded LIGO detectors, namely the merger and inspiral of neutron
stars. The merger of binary neutron stars is also responsible for concurrent
electromagnetic signals to which conventional telescopes are sensitive, so
called multi-messenger astronomy. Simulations will be carried out to study both
expectations for gravitational and electromagnetic
signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various aspects of such mergers will be studied in
detail. For example, phase transitions within the neutron stars may affect
expected signals during the merger. Using a piecewise-polytrope to model the
equation of state with and without a phase transition, evolutions will reveal
possible differences. Other effects to be studied include multiscale
approximations of magnetic instabilities and axion clouds. These studies will
prove helpful not only to the gravitational wave data analysis community but to
the astronomical community as well. The activities described here will help
further undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research and STEM training,
including a number of underrepresented individuals (continuing an existing
record of such mentoring). Also, this work builds on open-source infrastructure
and other open-source tools, and thus it helps support broadly useful, publicly
released, software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
