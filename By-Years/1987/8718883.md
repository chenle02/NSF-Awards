Drs. Antoinette and Lennox Cowie at the University of Hawaii will use
observations of interstellar spectral lines to determine the distances to high
velocity clouds of neutral atomic hydrogen gas. Approximately 10 percent of the
Galactic sky is covered by high velocity clouds of neutral atomic hydrogen, but
their origin and location has remained elusive for twenty years. No matter what
their origin, they are potentially an extremely interesting phenomenon which may
be important to our understanding of galaxy evolution and the energy and mass
balance of the interstellar medium. The missing key to the high velocity clouds
is a knowledge of their distances. The Cowies' project is aimed at determining
those distances.
