Abstract CTS-0118705 Jackie Ying, MIT

It is proposed to investigate the design feasibility of an intelligent drug
delivery system. Its design would be based on nanometer components organized
into mass, surface and chemistry distributions which will optimize the delivery,
while adapting to the nature of its body environment. Such would be the delivery
of insulin with a synthetic carrier nanodevice, which would typically protect
the insulin load from gastrointestinal acidity, and also have an adaptive
chemical distribution which will release the contained insulin when the carrier
would reach a part of the flow showing predetermined ambient chemical
properties.
