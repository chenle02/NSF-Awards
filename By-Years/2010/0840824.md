The Ohio State University College of Education (OSU), the National Middle School
Association (NMSA), and Education Development Center (EDC) are providing a
stewardship role for middle level educators of mathematics and science by
creating the Math and Science Middle School Pathways Portal, or MSP2. While
continuing to create and offer contextualized, high-quality resources, MSP2 is
also capitalizing on Web 2.0 tools to promote interactivity, collaboration, and
knowledge sharing among its users. Additionally, MSP2 is expanding its scope of
influence through a new section designed for middle school aged youth and new
resources related to career development, 21st century skills, and STEM careers.
The portal also provides a virtual professional learning community of middle
level math and science teachers. Project partners are integrating resources,
tools, and services across projects, and supporting multiple methods of resource
discovery to meets the needs of this audience. Collaboration among these and
other organizations is providing the longer-term sustainability and stewardship
of MSP2. The project evaluation is determining the impact of the project on its
target audiences and the educational uses of Web 2.0 tools and
services.&lt;br/&gt;MSP2 enhances the infrastructure for research and education
by continuing to develop a contextualized, high-quality resource collection,
building and supporting networks of middle grades math and science teachers
through a virtual professional learning community, and supporting the
educational use of Web 2.0 tools and services. Dissemination of knowledge,
experience, and research results is a significant aspect of the project. The
project partners are reaching diverse audiences through conferences, meetings,
online events, print publications, and Web communications.
