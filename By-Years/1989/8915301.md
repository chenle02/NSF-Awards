DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a multi-subunit enzyme critical to the
existence of most organisms and of ancient origin. These properties make it an
ideal candidate for a molecular chronometer, both to corroborate 16S rRNA data,
and to extend the analysis of evolutionary diversification. n this fellowship
research, Dr. Palenik will use antibodies to and oligonucleotide primers
developed from Anabaena and E. coli polymerases to study the polymerase subunit
structure and sequence of "older" eubacteria (16S rRNA estimate) such as
Chloroflexus, and various cyanobacteria, prochlorophytes, and chloroplasts.
Analysis of the sequence data obtained will provide new insights into the
evolutionary development of photosynthetic organisms. The work will also likely
result in the use of RNA polymerase sequences to analyze phytoplankton species
diversity in aquatic environments.
