Howard University is hosting IARD 2002, the third biennial conference of the
International Association of Relativistic Dynamics. The overall goal of the
conference is to facilitate the understanding of problems and the acquisition
and dissemination of knowledge about relativistic dynamics at all levels. This
award will enable increased participation of students and postdoctoral
researchers in the conference activities. Their participation in this conference
provides them with unique and extensive access to the leaders in their field,
exposes them to new research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them
for leadership roles in the future.
