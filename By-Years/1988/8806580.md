This Equipment Grant is provided to build a facility for the synthesis of thin
films of new oxide superconductors. Two major problems in the synthesis of thin
films are: the ability to control the stoichiometry of the film, and the ability
to incorporate enough oxygen. So far thin films have been synthesized by using a
large oxygen background pressure in conventional e-beam and sputtering chambers.
All these films require a high temperature oxygen anneal, hence, making them
less practical for applications requiring compatibility with other thin film
devices. This thin film facility is designed to provide a large rate of oxygen
arrival at the substrate, preferably in an atomic state, while maintaining the
metal sources and their rate monitors at low pressures. This makes the
deposition rates more stable and reproducible, and extends the lifetime of the
sources. This facility will be used to produce high quality films at the lowest
process temperatures, and the films will be used for tunneling, transport
measurements and devices.
