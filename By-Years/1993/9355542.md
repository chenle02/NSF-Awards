ABSTRACT ESI 93-55542 William Fitzgerald Michigan State University East
Lansing, MI Connecting Teaching, Learning, and Assessment (CTLA) This is a
4-year project to prepare 360 middle school teachers at 10 sites around the
country to implement the Michigan State University Connected Mathematics Program
(CMP). The project begins in Summer 1 with teams from 10 previously established
CMP Centers attending a 2-week residential leadership workshop at MSU. Each team
of 4 is made up of well-prepared teachers, supervisors, and/or teacher educators
with prior CMP (or CMP-like) experience. To prepare these teams to assume
leadership roles in implementing CMP in its respective Center's region, this
workshop introduces the leaders to: (1) the new CMP units (including the
underlying mathematics and the built-in technological software components); (2)
the uses of oral and written discourse in mathematics; (3) ways of establishing
a problem-solving environment in the classroom; and (4) authentic assessment in
mathematics. Over the next 2 years, each leadership team, in turn, prepares and
supports 12 6th grade teachers to implement the new materials and teaching
practices in their classrooms. This support includes 2 intensive, sequential
2-week summer workshops, as well on- going support for 2 school years. Similar
2-year implementation cycles for the 7th and 8th grade materials begin with new
groups of teachers in Years 2 and 3, respectively. Cost-sharing is 31% of the
NSF contribution.
