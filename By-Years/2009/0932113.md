The objective of this research is considering security and timing as primary
concerns, re-envisioning computer architecture and network algorithms to provide
a robust foundation for CPS. The approach is rethinking the hardware and
software divide, providing true process concurrency and isolation. Extending
these benefits to the communication network so integral to CPS, multicast and
security innovations that consider CPS constraints will be proposed.

This project will provide computational and communication foundations for CPS
through the following tasks. (1) An open source hardware design will be created.
Abandoning the error-prone paradigm of shared memory communication, Precision
Timed (PRET) processors for dataflow computations will be extended. (2) The
hardware/software interface will be investigated specifically for PRET
architectures. (3) A routing algorithm considering the CPS constraints will be
investigated. The constraints include efficiency, adaptability, scalability,
simplicity, and security. (4) Distributed Source Coding for CPS applications
will be studied with focus on challenges from small packet sizes in these
applications.

This project will engage the community and students in multiple grades and
institutions, through the following undertakings. (1) A package for education
and research in CPS will be assembled. This package and the material from this
project in the form of tutorials, publications, and curriculum will be available
to other institutions. (2) New courses will be created integrating research
results into education. (3) A diverse group of students including women and
minorities will be recruited. (4) Two applications will be implemented in the
fields of medical devices and emergency response.
