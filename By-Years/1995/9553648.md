9553648 Hall This 36 month project will identify the knowledge and abilities
that are needed in real life problem solving situations in which mathematics is
useful. Special attention will be given to organization of mathematical
practices in school and work settings where design is a leading activity. The
project will use case methods to compare the activities of students working on
design projects with those of adult practitioners working in related areas, as
well as examining teachers' experiences in the preceding work settings and in
related classroom activities. The project will focus on qualitative reasoning
and modeling in three types of design-oriented work: architecture, population
ecology, and cryptology. ***
