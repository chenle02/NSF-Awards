Abstract

Award: DMS-9971927 Principal Investigator: Ailana Fraser

This research proposal deals with applications of analytic methods of minimal
surface theory to geometric and topological problems. More precisely, in the
first part of the proposal, motivated by the prominent role of the second
variation theory for geodesics in classical Riemannian geometry together with
modern minimal surface techniques, the investigator proposes methods for
understanding the second variation theory for the free boundary problem for
minimal disks together with its geometric implications. In the second part, the
investigator proposes projects applying minimal surface theory to study the
topological structure of manifolds with positive isotropic curvature.

This proposal deals with certain two dimensional variational problems which
arise from a geometric setting. For example, the first part deals with the
problem of extremizing the area for mappings from the disk into a manifold
subject to a boundary constraint. In case the manifold is the three dimensional
Euclidean space, we are constructing mathematical ``soap films'' meeting a
constraint surface orthogonally. Free boundary problems arise naturally in
material science, for example in fluid interface problems, and in elasticity
problems. Objects which are critical points for a geometric variational problem
can frequently be shown to satisfy very special properties. The basic goal is to
use such information to derive properties of the general geometric class under
consideration. The results of this project are aimed at advancing our
understanding of fundamental relationships between the curvature and topology of
manifolds
