The silver halides will be studied by the techniques of angle integrated and
angle resolved photoemission using continuously variable photon energy in the
range 10 to 500 electron volts. Three types of experiments will be carried out:
(1) The first is angle integrated valence band photoemission with photon energy
variable through the Cooper minimum for the silver 4d levels. Thin
polycrystalline samples will be employed, and an attempt will be made to
separate d from p-derived valence bands by the known variation of photoemission
cross section. The angular anisotropy factor will also be measured on these
randomly oriented polycrystalline samples. (2) Angle resolved photoemission will
be carried out on single sheet crystals in order to map the valence bands and
observe calculated spin orbit splittings. (3) High resolution core level
photoemission will be carried out in order to observe surface/volume core level
shifts on well characterized silver bromide surfaces. High resolution thin film
adsorption coefficients will be measured in the range 50 to 1500 electron volts
on selected materials. These studies take on a new significance because of the
current interest in the development of tunable solid state lasers.
