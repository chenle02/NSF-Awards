Professor Knobler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his studies of Langmuir monolayers of amphiphiles.
He is examining long range order in self organizing monlayers, and the phase
transitions which occur in these two dimensional assemblies. Fluorescence
microscopy and Brewster angle microscopy are used to distinguish the optical
textures corresponding to different molecular orientations. The experimental
results are compared with a mean-field theory of these textures which has been
developed. These methods will also be employed to examine the structures and
kinetics of growth of mosaic textures that are characteristic of certain
condensed monolayer phases. Langmuir monolayers are films of a single molecular
layer that can be formed at the interface between air and water. They are
composed of amphiphilic moleucles such as long chain fatty acids, esters and
alcohols. Such films provide an opportunity to study two-dimensional systems,
and they provide structural insights into biochemical systems such as lipid
bilayers. These monolayers can be transferred as Langmuir-Blodgett films to
solid supports, and may be employed as sensors, and as electronic devices.
