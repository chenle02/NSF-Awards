The American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) is organizing the first Pan
American Congress on Plants and BioEnergy to be held June 22 -25, 2008 in
Merida, Mexico. This ASPB satellite meeting will be held jointly with the Plant
Biochemistry Section of the Biochemical Society of Mexico (SMB/BBMP). The goal
of this meeting is to bring together governmental policy makers and science
administrators along with plant biologists, agronomists, microbiologists,
economists and ecologists to discuss issues related to bioenergy security
including sustainability, environment and economy. This congress is designed to
initiate Pan-American collaborations and to learn first hand from those who have
already made great progress towards energy independence. The Congress on Plants
and Bioernergy provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students and
young investigators to meet and interact with experts representing the different
domains of bioenergy, from biological research to policy and economics. The
funding provided by NSF helps defray the costs of participation of students and
young investigators from the U.S. scientific community.
