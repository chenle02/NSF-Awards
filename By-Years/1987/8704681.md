This project involves detailed studies of the processes of dehydroxylation of
the major rock-forming micas using thermal analysis and high temperature single
crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The studies will investigate the effects of
interlayer composition and octahedral site chemistry on the mechanism of
dehydroxylation. Unlike most earlier work, this research will follow a process-
oriented approach that takes into account both the dynamic and kinetic aspects
of dehydroxylation. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding
of the thermal stability of these important rock-forming minerals and of the
processes involved in the progressive metamorphism of mica-bearing rocks.
