9300134 Turner The objectives of this research are to develop a sound base of
science and technology for the variational analysis of designs using solid
assembly models, and to contribute to the technology transfer of these ideas
into industrial practice. The major research goals are: exploitation of solid
assembly models so that designer interaction is minimized; accurate
computational mathematization of the geometric tolerances described in the ANSI
tolerancing standard; development of explicit statistical (process) models as a
formal way ofd capturing and utilizing process information; technology transfer
into industrial practice through CAD integration. This research addresses
nonlinear statistical tolerance analysis, tolerance synthesis, and tolerance
representation. Advances in design automation technologies for variational
analysis can make a major contribution to the competitiveness of American
manufacturing industries. These research efforts will establish a sound modern
basis for the development of software technologies that can make an important
contribution to the competitiveness of American manufacturing industries.
Product models based on solid modeling technology are rapidly achieving
acceptance, and geometric tolerances are now a national standard. Improved
software technologies which incorporate variational analysis capabilities into
the product design process, will provide American industry with the ability to
develop higher quality products, at lower costs, and with reduced product
development time. ***
