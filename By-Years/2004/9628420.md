9628420 Spanos The next generation of integrated electronics call for the stable
manufacture of 0.2 micron linewidth circuits. It is widely recognized that
photolithography will play a vital role in realizing this objective, both
through new process technologies and through modeling, metrology, and integrated
control. This research proposal is motivated by the recognition that intelligent
process control will play an enabling role in the development of reliable high-
performance pattern transfer technology. The broad objectives of our proposed
research are to develop, implement, and test integrated process control methods
for various lithographic processes. To accomplish our research objectives, we
anticipate using existing sensors, designing some new metrology schemes,
developing control-oriented process and equipment models, and developing control
and diagnostics strategies that integrate across the various processing steps
involved. ***
