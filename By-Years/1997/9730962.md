Weitao Yang of Duke University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for studies of the electronic structure
of large-scale systems. He will continue development of methodological aspects
of density-functional theory, including linear scaling algorithms based on
parallel implementations and improved-accuracy density functionals based on
localized orbitals. One application of this improved methodology is an
investigation into the structure and reactivity of cytidine deaminase. These
studies employ Professor Yang's divide-and-conquer approach, which divides the
electronic structure of a large system into many smaller systems and then
determines the electron density of each system separately. This technique
provides a powerful new way to apply density-functional theory to the accurate
prediction of energies and properties of large systems, such as condensed matter
and biological molecules.
