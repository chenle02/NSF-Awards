Objectives of the Project&lt;br/&gt;We propose a workshop for brainstorming and
planning for the Computational Thinking Olympiad (CTO). The goal of this
olympiad is to increase the awareness of Computational Thinking at the high
school level.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will be focused on deciding on the
desired content of the Olympiad. We have generated (though an NSF-sponsored REU
supplemental grant) a private Wiki that contains lists of example problems from
related programs, such as COMAP, ACM Programming Contest, ICPC and IOI. The Wiki
contains over 40 example problems. In this proposed workshop, we
will&lt;br/&gt;discuss these related programs, determine the niche into which
the CTO would t, and determine what sorts of problems t best
therein.&lt;br/&gt;At the conclusion of the workshop, our aim is to have de ned
the sort of problem to be solved at the CTO, decided the roll of programming
projects in the CTO, and placed ourselves within the context of other, related,
Olympiads.
