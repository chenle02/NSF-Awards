This research pertains to the participation of the mist chamber method for
measuring tropospheric sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in the 1994 NSF-sponsored
intercomparison (GASIE). The intercomparison will be coordinated by the
University of Delaware, and is tentatively planned for September and October of
1994 in Lewes, Delaware. Two researcher from the University of New Hampshire
will operate the mist chamber method during the GASIE intercomparison. The mist
chamber method appears desirable for field deployment in atmospheric chemistry
measurement programs in remote regions because it is quite sensitive a detection
limit of approximately 20 pptr (v) , appears to be free from matrix
interferences is relatively small in size and weight, plus offers modest
implementation costs. The reliability of the mist chamber method for measuring
SO2 will be further tested by participation in the rigorous double-blind GASIE
intercomparison. This participation is an essential next step in the validation
of the method prior to its future use in large field measurement programs.
