The investigator quantifies the variability induced in the high-latitude
mesospheric airglow and temperature by planetary-scale waves, and determines the
nature of wave signatures by quantifying their relationship to variations of
gravity-wave flux and tidal amplitudes. In conjunction with observations at
Stockholm University, he is continuing a measurement program of high latitude
dynamics and chemistry, extending the existing data base of hydroxyl radiance
and temperature where normal mode periodicities and their transience is
observed. In addition, he is analyzing measurements to identify the time history
of long-period temperature and composition variations in the mesosphere.
