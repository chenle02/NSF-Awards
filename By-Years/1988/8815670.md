A curved mixing layer between high and low velocity streams is to beinvestigated
experimentally. The objective is the generation ofcomprehensive time-average
turbulence data, together with flow visualization, to explore the mechanisms for
either enhanced or reduced mixing induced de-stabilizing or stabilizing
curvature. Two facilities will be used; a relatively low Reynolds number water
tunnel, and a higher reynolds number air facility.
