Humans and other animals use odors to guide a variety of behaviors critical for
survival. However, the neural mechanisms by which odor molecules in the
environment are processed within the brain to yield perception are not resolved.
Surprisingly, even a basic description of what types of odors are represented by
one major olfactory structure, the olfactory tubercle (OT), is not available.
Elucidating the role of the OT in olfaction will help clarify the process of
olfactory perception. Therefore, the present proposal describes an experimental
strategy aimed to elucidate the contributions of the OT to olfactory processing
by combining neurophysiological, behavioral and computational methods in mice.
It is predicted that OT neurons will display a unique representation and
responsivity to odors in comparison to another primary olfactory cortex (the
piriform cortex). Further, it is predicted that OT neuronal activity in response
to odors will dramatically differ based upon behavioral state, including
anticipation and reward-conditioning, thus positioning the OT as a link between
perception and behaviorally-relevant processes. Together, these findings will
enhance our understanding of information processing and, more specifically, how
olfactory perception is formed within the brain. Broader impacts resulting from
the proposed activity include the training of high school, undergraduate, and
graduate students in core aspects of neurophysiology and behavioral
neuroscience. The project will extend special effort to involve women and under-
represented minorities. Furthermore, it will provide a mechanism to bridge ties
between local (Cuyahoga county) high schools and colleges (Cleveland State U.
and John Carroll U.) and the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) by allowing
students exposure to scientific training through aspects of this proposal.
