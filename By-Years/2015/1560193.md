This REU site project to be hosted at University of Maryland College Park
emphasizes combining theory with practice. The students will benefit from a
strong faculty team. Building on the past experience, the project is expected to
result in strong undergraduate research leading to successful research/industry
careers for the students in the future. Outreach activities with high schools
will attract high school students to this research. The site plans to recruit
under-represented groups and also students from non-research universities and
HBCUs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The projects proposed not only form cutting-edge
theory research but are also relevant to practice and have high impact
applications. The projects considered are in applied area of Big Data Analytics,
Information Extraction in Natural Language Processing, Fair Division, Pricing
over Social Networks, Secure Communication and Public Health. The approach of
getting students interested in theory, starting from applied implementation has
an added side benefit that it would train students in sharp algorithmic
implementation and experimentation skills, which are deemed in high regard by
leading Computer Science companies.
