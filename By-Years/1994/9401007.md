This award supports the participation of scientists and undergraduate students
at Rhodes College in the development of an advanced solar coronal observing
system. The goals of the program are twofold: (a) to develop a set of observing
systems that will permit the most thorough and incisive experimental
investigation to date of the solar corona and chromospheric linkages, and
through this development, (b) to provide for the education of undergraduate
students in both the experimental techniques and observational applications of
state-of-the-art imaging systems. The advanced coronal observing system will be
designed and built at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Rhode's
College and will be deployed at NCAR's solar observing site on Mauna Loa in
Hawaii.
