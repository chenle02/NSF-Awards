This project provides scholarship support to academically talented students who
demonstrate financial need and major in computer science or a related field. It
increases the number of students successfully completing degree programs in
computer science, computer science technology, information technology and
mathematics (with a minor in computer science). The program attracts, mentors,
retains, develops, and increases the graduation rate of students in computer
science and related fields, especially minority, women, and students with
disabilities.

The intellectual merit of the program is reflected in the increased number of
computer science and technology students who successfully complete the computer
science program. The broader impact of the program is to broaden the
participation of underrepresented minorities and to present the program at
professional conferences, further expanding the reach of the program.
