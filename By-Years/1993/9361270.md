9361270 Jewell The principal investigator proposes to develop ruggedized optical
array connectors for interconnection of electronic processing modules through
parallel fiber ribbon optical backplanes. Computer manufacturers consider
optical backplanes an inevitable next step in interconnections and optical
connector arrays to be the most needed component. Arrays of vertical cavity
surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are ideally suited for the transmitters and PRI
will utilize its world leadership in this field to optimize VCSELs for optical
backplanes. In Phase I we will: 1) specify the performance requirements for the
optical backplane components: microlaser arrays, fibers, connectors, detectors;
2) survey the mechanical and micro optic "tools" available for optical connector
arrays; 3) design VCSELs for multimode fiber backplanes 4) design connector
arrays for the optical backplanes; and 5) develop the Phase II plan for
demonstration and commercialization. Assembly of the technical team for
commercialization of optical backplane interconnects has begun at PRI and will
continue throughout Phases I and II. Optical backplanes are most immediately
needed in the avionics industry, hence our program targets an initial high
performance avionic computers. The work will also directly impact the
development of fiber optical networks for aircraft sensor communication and for
local area networks. ***
