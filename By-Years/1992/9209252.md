Human database designers apply their accumulated experience and commonsense
reasoning abilities to each new design task. Recently, a number of expert
systems have been developed that attempt to automate the database design
process. Although these systems may have a high degree of expertise in database
design, they typically know very little about anything else. As a result, they
often have to ask questions that appear unnecessary or trivial, thus detracting
from their credibility as experts and increasing the effort required of the
user. The objective of this research is to add commonsense reasoning
capabilities to a proven database design expert system. The commonsense reasoner
will employ a simple, generic model of the business environment that it can
extend semi- automatically with facts "learned" during each design session. The
project involves conceptual work on the nature and representation of commonsense
knowledge as the basis for a later implementation. The implemented system will
be tested to assess the value of the commonsense facility. This research is
expected to aid in designing computer systems that combine a high degree of
expertise in a particular subject with general knowledge about the world at
large and have the ability to apply both to solving problems.
