The goal of this program is the development of a theoretical foundation for
research in parallel computation and computational geometry. Specifically the
following areas will be studied. (1) Geometric constructions in parallel (2)
Parallel data structuring techniques (3) Geometric problems from graphics and
solid modeling In addition, many of the algorithms will be implemented on
existing hardware to experimentally benchmark the overhead inherent in these
algorithms.
