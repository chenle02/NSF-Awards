The Advanced Technological Education Television (ATETV.org) project produces 48
short multi-disciplinary web-based television episodes that are intended to
increase the relevance of technician education to modern practices and assure an
increased number of students entering the high performance workplace with
enhanced competencies. Combining the power of video and the Internet to link
education, government and industry, ATETV extends student learning beyond the
classroom walls and provides a window into careers and workplace skills.

The project expands on the successes of current ATE Centers and projects by
featuring weekly episodes that broadcast via the web. Each episode is designed
to engage and impact prospective and current technicians with the real worlds of
technology and industry. This student-centered video series is produced under
the guidance of a National Educational and Professional Advisory Board and a
National Student Advisory Board with resources from the AACC, ATE National
Centers, successful ATE projects and industry.
