9408934 Judith Kidd An important new area of anthropological genetics involves
the analysis of genetic distributions in native North American populations.
Analyses of new data on 35 nuclear DNA markers at 23 independent loci tyhped on
five Amerindian populations and seven Old World populations show a North- South
pattern of gene frequency variation for Amerindian populations with decreased
heterozygosity in South America and increasing genetic distance from Asian and
other Old World populations in a cline fromNorth America to South America. This
patternis most simply explained by an advancing wave of population expansion
from north to south in the colonization of the Americas. The objective of this
research is to test this hypothesis of the expanding wave in two ways: by
studying more Amerindian poulations, a Siberian population, and two western
Pacific populations for the same markers and ty typing a minimum of 15
additional nuclear DNA markers, with an emphasis on haplotype markers on all
populations. The resulting data will add signifiantly to the u derstanding of
how the colonizing populations expanded to "fill" the Americas. ***
