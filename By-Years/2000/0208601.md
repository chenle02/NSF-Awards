The proposed research focuses on the design and implementation of
new&lt;br/&gt;technologies for building high-confidence component software
systems. The new&lt;br/&gt;technology is directly relevant to improving security
of commercial&lt;br/&gt;virtual machines such as the Java virtual machine (JVM)
and&lt;br/&gt;Microsoft's .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). The work
concentrates&lt;br/&gt;on three areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. High-level
specifications for low-level software. General and&lt;br/&gt;flexible logic-
based type systems (LTS) are being designed. The type&lt;br/&gt;systems are
derived from the Certified Binaries technology developed&lt;br/&gt;by the
authors and extend the scope, expressiveness and precision
of&lt;br/&gt;verification techniques used in current JVM and CLR
implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. A high-assurance virtual machine. Using
the authors Foundational&lt;br/&gt;Proof-Carrying Code technology, higher-
assurance, validated&lt;br/&gt;implementations of the JVM or CLR infrastructure
are being built. The&lt;br/&gt;authors are engaged in technology transfer of
their ideas to a virtual&lt;br/&gt;machine being built at
Intel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Resource certification. New technologies for
specifying,&lt;br/&gt;composing, and verifying advanced properties such as
resource bounds&lt;br/&gt;on memory and network bandwidth are being developed.
These&lt;br/&gt;properties are crucial for safe and secure interoperation
between&lt;br/&gt;untrusted components in large-scale systems.
