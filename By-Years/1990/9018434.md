This award provides 50% funding of the costs associated with the machining and
assembly of a multi-anvil high-pressure apparatus that will be used in research
projects in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT is committed to providing the
remaining funds needed. The apparatus will employ an "octahedron-within-a- cube"
design for the nested pressure chambers of the multi-anvil system and will be
capable of high-temperature experiments in the pressure range up to 20 GPa (200
kilobars). The apparatus will be employed primarily in high-pressure experiments
on melting phenomena relevant to the chemical differentiation of the Earth's
mantle.
