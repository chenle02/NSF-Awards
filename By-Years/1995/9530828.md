The transition between hunter-gatherer lifestyle and subsequent sedentary
Neolithic was a major stage in human history, a stage that remains poorly
understood. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that sedentism in Europe
began at the onset of postglacial conditions, and provide further insights into
the preconditions of the European transition as well as a more complete
understanding of skeletal adaptation to activity patterns. The consequences of
environmental changes for human subsistence at the European Late
Pleistocene/Holocene transition are poorly understood. Specifically, how did
mobility change? This project will test the hypothesis that a significant
decrease in mobility occurred at the European Upper Paleolithic/Mesolithic
transition by examining changes through time in human postcranial skeletal
structure, using cross-sectional tibial and femoral properties that are directly
related to activity levels (locomotion). Data will be obtained from radiographs
of the femur and tibia of osteological specimens in museum collections. Molds
will be taken at three locations along the the femur and the tibia. Cross-
sections at each location will be reconstructed, using the radiographs and molds
as guides to endosteal and periosteal contours. Each reconstructed cross-section
will be digitized and cross-sectional geometric properties calculated. Previous
studies have shown that variation in lower limb bone cross-sectional shape
corresponds to differences in mobility levels and patterns, reflecting
subsistence differences. Correlations between various environmental, biological,
and cultural factors and observed levels of mobility will be examined.
