ABSTRACT CTS-9523968 The role of interparticle interactions in shear thickening
of colloidal suspensions will be investigated. Modeling work assumes that
particle clustering is the main cause of the experimentally observed phenomenon.
Other assumptions will be tested. Laboratory verification will be performed with
three model colloidal suspensions: a model hard-sphere silica suspension, a
charge-stabilized latex and polydispersivity on shear thickening transition will
be analyzed. Microscopic probing of the flow microstructure and rheological
measurements will be performed. The numerical simulations will include relevant
colloidal and hydrodynamic inter-particle interactions. The results are expected
to be used to design suspensions fro specific rheological performance criteria
required systems with concentrated suspensions, such as in films, coatings, ink
and ceramics. ***
