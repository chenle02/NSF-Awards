This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the
manufacturing process used for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell membrane
electrode assemblies (MEA). Current manufacturing techniques for production MEAs
use large quantities of platinum (up to 4 mg/cm2) and require intensive labor to
assemble. The various processes yield consistent performance among different
manufacturers, but all are extremely costly due to high material and labor
costs. This effort will explore the methodology and develop techniques to
deposit low platinum loadings directly on the polymer membrane surface using a
process similar to that used in laser printers. Objectives include demonstrating
the feasibility of electrostatic deposition of catalyst on a polymer membrane;
identifying the optimum conditions (size of particles, particle carrier,
electrical charge, and pressure/temperature relations) for electrostatic
deposition; and developing a continuing R&D plan for Phase II. The Phase I
program will use a modified laser printer to evaluate platinum deposition
techniques. Various platinum particle sizes and platinum/carrier particle mixes
will be tested for transfer rates, coverage, electrical conductivity, and
chemical reactivity. Light and transmission electron microscopes will be used to
evaluate membrane coverage and conditions following platinum deposition.
