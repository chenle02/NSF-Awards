In the last twenty years, few areas of mathematics have developed as
extensively as the theory of algebraic groups. Recent developments in the theory
of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, in noncommutative algebraic geometric
analogues of algebraic groups such as quantum groups, and in representation
theory, suggest that an overall assessment of recent progress might be in order.
This grant will support the 1991 Summer Research Institute on Algebraic Groups
and their Generalizations, to be held at Pennsylvania State University, July
8-28, 1991. The three week institute is the thirty-ninth in a series sponsored
by the American Mathematical Society which brings together groups of
mathematicians interested in a particular field of mathematical research.
Emphasis is placed on instruction at a very high level with seminars and
lectures by distinguished mathematicians in related fields, to promote
interaction between participants while broadening their mathematical
perspectives.
