This project will involve experimental research on the electronic, magnetic, and
superconducting properties of correlated electron materials, particularly high
temperature superconducting copper oxide compounds. Extensive synthesis and
characterization studies will be complemented by electronic, thermal, magnetic,
and transport investigations, including work at high pressures and high magnetic
fields. Emphasis will be on materials research and the study of composition-
dependent changes in the magnetic properties and electronic structure.
