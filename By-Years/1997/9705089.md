Brattkus 9705089 The goal of the proposed research is to develop and analyze
asymptotic models which describe the spreading of thin solid films on solid
substrates. Models are based upon a slender-body approximation that is valid for
rapidly spreading films which nearly wet the underlying substrate. The
asymptotic technique has been tested on a simple model of liquid phase epitaxy
where the dominant mechanism of film growth is solidification. Approximate
solutions representing steady planar spreading have been compared to numerical
solutions of the exact problem. We find that the boundary conditions at a
contact line may be applied directly to the asymptotic equations describing the
spreading film even though the slender-body approximation is not valid there
(this is due to the presence of a weak gradient singularity). For steadily
spreading films these contact angle conditions select the spreading rate. The
asymptotic equations are used to test the linear stability of a planar film and
it is found to be stable. The technology behind thin film deposition is of
principal importance to the development of new and more compact semiconductor
devices. Moreover, this technology is unusual in that it is extremely sensitive
to frontier research in materials science. We propose to examine the conditions
that are applied at a tri-junction between a solid film, its nutrient phase, and
its substrate, and determine the role that these contact conditions play in
influencing the rate of growth and the morphology of spreading solid films. Our
preliminary results suggest that contact conditions significantly influence
both. A basic knowledge of the connection between the contact conditions and the
growth and morphology of thin solid films will aid in controlling the deposition
process.
