During the eleven years that lowa Lakes has offered CADD courses, CADD use has
matured. Early CADD courses relied on computer platforms to augment lab work
performed on drawing boards. Today, drafting and design is performed almost
exclusively on computers, and recently, at several locations, simultaneously.
Today's hardware must support today's sophisticated software applications for
manufacturing, architecture, civil engineering and geographic information
systems (GIS). Early CADD focused on two-dimensional techniques and fledgling
applications; today's computer platforms must support three-dimensional
techniques, solids modeling, rendering, and animation. The sophistication of
software programming and the need to support the explosion in digital
communications are driving the demand for newer and faster computers.
Educational institutions, especially those in relatively remote areas, are
challenged to find adequate resources to update software and hardware that have
increasingly shorter shelf lives. This upgrade will provide students an improved
vehicle to initiate collaboration with other users on a global basis. Efforts
for educational collaboration among institutions are currently being formulated
to take advantage of the improved platform. Approval of this project will
provide students, employers and communities with access to emerging technology
and the potential to make more informed choices. Good decisions are rooted in
competent information, whether decisions are personal, or whether decisions are
the result of representative deliberation. Helping people synthesize informed
choices is the essence of education.
