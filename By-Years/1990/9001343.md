Recent studies have been undertaken at sites scattered throughout the world to
analyze pollen and sediments in cores from bogs, lakes, and other appropriate
settings. These analyses have shed considerable light on changing patterns of
vegetation and climate over the last 10,000 and more years. One area that has
not been intensively studied, however, is the humid, subtropical region of
southeastern China. This doctoral dissertation project will extract and analyze
cores from bogs in the Wuyi and Daiyun mountains of Fujian Province. Radiocarbon
dating will help establish the ages of pollen and sediments within the cores,
and related analyses will help reconstruct vegetational and climatic patterns in
the region. This project will provide valuable information for reconstructing
the natural environmental history of southeastern China. This reconstruction
will be especially useful because it will help assess the impacts of changing
conditions on monsoon circulation, which is such an important facet of the
region's climate. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
