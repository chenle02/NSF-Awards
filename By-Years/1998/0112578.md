This is a project in matter optics, the manipulation of matter in ways analogous
to the manipulation of light waves with optical elements. The novel focus of the
proposal is on the manipulation of electron, ion, and molecule matter waves with
intense laser light. The construction of a coherent beam splitter for electrons
is the goal of the first experiment. The realization of this goal would
constitute the first demonstration of the Kapitza-Dirac effect and would
elegantly illustrate particle-wave duality. The second goal of the project is
the demonstration of a coherent beam splitter in which the intense laser, not
locked to resonance, would be used to diffract ions and molecules. Possibilities
for using the ion interferometer to test for spin-orbit dependent Aharanov-Bohm
phase shifts and for using molecular diffraction to study decoherence will be
pursued if the demonstration is successful.
