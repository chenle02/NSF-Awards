This research is on efficient algorithms for: (i) normalization, i.e.,
simplification of expressions, using rules (called a rewrite system), and (ii)
fundamental properties of rewrite systems. Algorithms that use analysis for
normalization with static rules are being developed. Incremental algorithms for
normalization with dynamic rules are also being investigated. Extensions of
efficient tabling algorithms are being studied. Practical performance of
algorithms is being evaluated in the Laboratory for Rapid Rewriting test bed
developed at University of Houston. Efficient algorithms and lower bounds are
being studied for several fundamental properties, including uniqueness of normal
forms, confluence, and the word problem, for decidable subclasses. Tight
relationships among these problems are being studied using the concept of
resource-bounded reductions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normalization is a
fundamental operation found in virtually all symbolic computation and computer
algebra systems. Applications include functional and equational logic
programming, data type specification, formal verification, automated deduction,
code generation, and type inferencing. This research is expected to yield: (i)
enhanced efficiency and power of symbolic computing and computer algebra
systems, (ii) better understanding of inherent complexities of the involved
operations, and (iii) new results, techniques and insights into fundamental
properties of rewrite systems. Broader impacts include: training of
undergraduate and graduate students including underrepresented minorities, new
course materials based on this research, and dissemination of software developed
for extensions and use.
