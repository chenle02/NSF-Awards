This project is part of a large body of research on the theory of decision
making under uncertainty. Industry and government decision makers benefit from
the new and better methods of decision making produced by this line of research.
This project develops an alternative formulation of choice under uncertainty
based on the distinction by Frank Knight between risk and uncertainty. According
to Knight a gamble is risky if the probabilities are known and it is uncertain
if the probabilities are not known. A Knightian theory of decision making is
developed in this project and used to explain incomplete markets, bargaining,
entrepreneurship, business decisions made by routine rules of thumb, and asset
prices. The results of this project could lead to a major breakthrough in the
theory of decision making under uncertainty. The contribution of this project
comes from developing an alternative theory that is more plausible and might
receive more empirical support than the Bayesian theory. For example, one of the
paradoxes of Bayesian decision theory is that if two individuals attach
different subjective probabilities to an observable event, then they both can
gain by exchanging a bet on the event at some odds, yet we observe little such
betting in reality. The project develops a rigorous explanation based on
uncertainty aversion and inertia. This explanation is generalized to explain the
absence of some markets for insurance and forward contracts. Even if the
investigator fails to develop a completely satisfactory alternative theory of
decision making under uncertainty, the project will provide new insights into
such important questions as: Why do strikes occur? Why are wages downwardly
rigid? Why are contracts so simplified that the parties to the contract forego
mutually beneficial gains? Why are security prices so volatile? Why do
businesses use apparently inefficient routines such as keeping advertising
expenditures a constant proportion of sales?
