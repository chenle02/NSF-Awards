Chemical reactions can be made to occur using miscible polymer blends that
offer the opportunity for the design of new material systems with enhancements
in properties and/or processing. We will study miscible polymer blends
containing silanol and phosphonic acid substituents as H-bond donors with a
variety of H-bond acceptor polymers. These systems are new types of miscible
blends. The specific interaction should stabilize the silanol function and
prevent its premature reaction with itself to give siloxane. However, at
temperatures above the lower critical solution temperature, phase separation and
subsequent siloxane formation should occur, thereby giving fast-curing polymer
networks. Phosphorus-containing structures have wide use for decreasing
flammability. In some systems by enhance condensed-phase reactions at elevated
temperatures leading to "char" or residue enhancement and decreased
flammability. This will be studied in miscible blends containing phosphonic acid
function e.g., with styrene copolymers containing the hydrogen-bond donor groups
in the para position.
