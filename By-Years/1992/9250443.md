The Department of Mathematics at the University of Evansville plans to improve
its curriculum by implementing a computer- oriented approach in the calculus-
differential equations sequence and in a calculus course for majors outside
mathematics, engineering, and science. The use of a computer algebra system in a
computer laboratory classroom, for student exercises and projects, and as an
instructional aid allows a shift of emphasis from manipulative skills and
techniques to activities with the computer that promote discovery, development
of intuition, more realistic and meaningful applications, student interaction,
improved expository skills, and experience with the computer as a modern
mathematical tool. As an early phase of the project, the Department of
Mathematics is initiating an intensive effort with the major departments served
to arrive at consensus on what manipulative skills and techniques the students
should be able to perform by hand and what tasks are more appropriate for the
computer. The results will serve as a model for mathematics departments with a
heavy service load in the areas of engineering and/or the natural sciences.
