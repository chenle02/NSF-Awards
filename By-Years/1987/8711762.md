The proposed research is aimed at reducing, by a factor of ten, the current
uncertainty in the neutron electric dipole moment. This fundamentally important
measurement will provide a test for time reversal symmetry violation, and should
help differentiate among theories of CP violation. Parity non-conservation and
time reversal symmetry violation will also be studied through measurements of
neutron spin rotation in scattering from polarized targets. In addition, the
neutron-proton weak interaction coupling strength will be determined through
measurements of the scattering of spin- polarized neutrons on liquid para-
hydrogen. These experiments will be carried out using neutrons from the ILL
reactor at Grenoble, and are a continuation of work funded under previous NSF
grants.
