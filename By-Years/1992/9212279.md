The proposal is concerned with the synthesis and characterization of new gas
adsorbents to be used especially with the pressure swing adsorption process, and
with the modeling of hysteresis in the PSA process. Four kinds of adsorbents
will be studied: pillared clays, ion-exchanged zeolites, polymeric adsorbents
and modified carbon molecular sieves. With regard to the synthesis of new
pillared clays, and PI has already synthesized and studied ZrO2 and AL2O3
PILC's, and these studies indicated that the equilibrium separation of N2/CH4
and O2/N2 are feasible with AL-PILC. The PI suggests new experiments in which
pillared clays already synthesized for catalytic purposes will be modified to
improve their sorbent characteristics. The zeolites which will be studied are
ion-exchanged A and X type and clinoptilolites. The PI gives some preliminary
data which indicates that the clinoptilolites are promising sorbents for kinetic
separation of N2 and CH4. Polymeric adsorbents will focus on unfunctionalized
polystyrenic sorbents, whose preliminary data indicates that the SO2 and NOx
adsorption amounts are significant, to particularly functionalized adsorbents.
With regard to the modelling of hysterisis in the PSA process, single particle
cyclic scanning curves will be measured using a TGA, and these results will be
used in modeling the PSA process.
