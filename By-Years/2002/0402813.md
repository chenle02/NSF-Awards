The funds are being requested for US participants (junior faculty and graduate
students) at the Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics meeting which
will be held in Vancouver, Canada in June-July 2004. Many of the worlds leading
experts in this field will give lectures at this conference which will provide
participants access to a current and very active research topics in Algebraic
Combinatorics. &lt;br/&gt;
