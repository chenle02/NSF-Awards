This project is aimed at conducting a dynamic analysis of the control and
containment requirements for a high performance, axial piston, hydrostatic pump.
Over the last thirty years, a great deal of information has been added to the
literature which describes the control requirements for a standard swash-plate
pump design; however, virtually nothing has been written on the topic of swash-
plate containment. Also, within the pump industry itself, a few innovative
companies have identified certain advantages in using a non-standard swash-plate
design, which utilizes a variable primary swash-plate angle and a fixed
secondary swash-plate angle; but, again, nothing has been added to the
literature to generally describe and apply these advantages to a broad range of
pump designs. In this ascertain the control and containment requirements for
this design. Furthermore, this work will go a step beyond current-day practice
by considering the general case when both the primary and secondary swash-plate
angles vary. The outcome of this study will be to identify the mechanical and
control requirements for this novel machine and to theoretically prove the
advantages of implementing the design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the
work of this research will be used to significantly enhance the performance of
axial piston pumps that are widely used in fluid power applications today. The
improved performance will be demonstrated in increased operating efficiency and
quieter pumps. These improvements will be achieved by optimizing the internal
pressure transients of the pump for operating conditions that may vary over a
wide range during the normal duty cycle of the machine. A secondary impact will
be to reduce valve-plate erosion within the pump. The overall objectives of this
work are reduce waste and to increase the productivity of axial-piston pump
technology. The successful accomplishment of these objectives will manifest
itself in lower pump operating costs, longer product life, and a reduction in
engineering time for product maintenance and design.&lt;br/&gt;
