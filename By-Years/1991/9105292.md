Determining fault-movement chronology is of fundamental importance in several
fields, however dating of movements is normally accomplished indirectly by
cross-cutting relationships. These commonly have large ranges, and a direct
dating technique would be widely useful. This project will attempt to develop
and test a method that relies on the formation of fault products such as
submicron illite from clay gouge, pseudotachylite and ultracataclasite that can
be dated by K-Ar techniques. The Catalina detachment fault in southeastern
Arizona will be utilized in these efforts. Results if successful, will be of
widespread interest and utility.
