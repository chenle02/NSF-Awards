The Statistics Department will establish a departmental computer center for use
in all its statistics courses. The center will consist of a Prime 2255
minicomputer with software and peripherals, and 16 IBM PC microcomputers. The
PC's will be connected to the minicomputer in order to provide access for
computer-intensive calculations, and they will be used alone for calculations
for which they are more suitable. The facility will enable the Department to
tailor the system to statistics calculations and to conduct statistics
laboratories. Both activities will allow students in statistics courses more
appropriate access to computers and will allow them to use better analysis tools
and larger data sets on which to perform analyses.
