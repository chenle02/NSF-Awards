Srinivasan 9623141 This proposal supports the work of Professor H. Srinivasan to
work on problems in commutative algebra. She intends to study the multiplicity
of R/I for a homogeneous ideal I in terms of the shifts in its minimal graded
resolution. She also intends to study the finite determinations of the
presentations of an ideal. Finally, she intends to construct the minimal algebra
resolutions for R/I where I is an ideal in the linkage class of a complete
resolution. This research is on the boundary between commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. Both fields arose from the classical problem of studying
mathematical objects defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely
polynomials. Today, the fields use methods not only from algebra, but also from
analysis and topology, and conversely are extensively used in those fields.
Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
