Building on previously funded NSF research, the use of paleobiological and
paleogenetic data from mummified elephant seal carcasses found along the Dry
Valleys and Victoria Land Coast in areas that today are too cold to support seal
colonies (Mirougina leonina; southern elephant seals; SES) supports the former
existence of these seals in this region. The occurrence and then subsequent
disappearance of these SES colonies is consistent with major shifts in the
Holocene climate to much colder conditions at the last ~1000 years BCE).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further analysis of the preserved remains of three other
abundant pinnipeds ? crabeater (Lobodon carciophagus), Weddell (Leptonychotes
weddelli) and leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx) will be studied to track changes in
their population size (revealed by DNA analysis) and their diet (studied via
stable isotope analysis). Combined with known differences in life history,
preferred ice habitat and ecosystem sensitivity among these species, this
paleoclimate proxy data will be used to assess their exposure and sensitivity to
climate change in the Ross Sea region during the past ~1-2,000 years
