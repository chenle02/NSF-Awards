9307986 Yu Characterization of semiconductor structures with extremely high
spatial resolution will be crucial for continued reductions in device size and
for the development of advanced heterostructure devices. The development of
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related techniques has dramatically
enhanced our ability to study properties of materials with atomic or near-atomic
resolution. STM offers several advantages over other techniques, such as x-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescence, that
have been used to probe atomic- and near-atomic-scale properties of
semiconductors. We propose to use cross-sectional STM to investigate the
electronic and structural properties of novel semiconductor structures. STM and
related techniques offer both very high spatial resolution and sensitivity to
electronic structure, allowing us to explore, with nanometer resolution,
characteristics such as band-edge energy and carrier concentration profiles,
structure of epitaxially grown interfaces, alloy composition and structural
order, and perhaps heterojunction band-edge discontinuities. Of considerable
interest to us will be the investigation of relationships between structure and
local electronic properties in alloys and at heterojunction interfaces. ***
