This grant supports the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's
Unidata Program Center to conduct a four workshop beginning June 25 - June 28,
2018. The workshop will provide lectures and hands-on training to researchers,
faculty, and students on how to utilize Unidata's software tools. It will
incorporate information technology to address the challenges of locating,
retrieving, processing, analyzing, and managing large volumes of geoscience
data. The workshop will keep community users current on new technologies and
software to assist with data-driven science. It is expected that approximately
85 people will attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
