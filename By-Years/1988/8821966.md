Experiments will be continued on weakly bound hydrogen and helium Rydberg atoms
interacting with intense microwave electric fields. The objective is an
understanding of quantum chaos, quantal systems whose classical counterparts are
chaotic. New experiments will involve frequencies as high as 100 GH2 or nearly
sudden turn on of the microwave field. Other one-frequency and two-frequency
experiments will continue, including a study of the effects of noise.
