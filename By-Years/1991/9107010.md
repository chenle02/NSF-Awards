In this project the principal investigator will continue his work on various
problems in nonlinear continuum mechanics. In particular, he will look at the
dynamics of elastic rods in three dimensions, the formation and evolution of
"necks" in viscoelastic fibers, the equilibrium thermodynamics of periodic
phases, and the minimum energy states of nematic liquid crystals. This work has
enormous theoretical and technological implications. More and more one finds
that technological advances are driven by improvements in the theory of
nonlinear materials and the successful applications of that theory. In this
project the principal investigator will continue his important studies of the
mathematics and the physics that underlie various types of elastic, viscoelastic
and crystalline materials. This work has applications to state-of-the-art
problems in the production of high-strength polymers and liquid crystals of
different shapes.
