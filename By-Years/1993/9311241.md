9311241 Moon The project will support the purchase of a filament-winding machine
which will be dedicated to research in engineering. The equipment will be used
for a number of research projects, including in particular: Eliminating Process-
Induced Defects in Polymeric Composite Cylinders, Radiation-Initiated
Curing/Heating of Polymeric Composites, Nonlinear Material Characterization and
Failure of Composites, Viscoelastic Behavior of Thick Laminates in Compression,
and Process-Induced Fiber/Ply-Waviness in Thick- Section Composite Laminates. An
improved understanding of the behavior of polymer composites during
manufacturing may help to improve the quality and reduce the cost of these
advanced materials.
