9704833 Jaco This project involves the development and use of efficient
triangulations and normal surface theory in the study and understanding of
3-manifolds. The primary objective is to develop an algorithm to decide if two
3-manifolds are homeomorphic, thereby providing a complete classification of
3-manifolds. Efficient triangulations lead to combinatorial methods that yield
results analogous to those obtained when a 3-manifold is known to have a rich
geometry (hyperbolic structure). All 3-manifolds admit triangulations, those
which are least understood are precisely the class which admit efficient
triangulations; hence, this project provides new methods to study the least
understood cases of 3-manifolds. Low-dimensional manifolds provide the geometric
models of most physical phenomena. It is natural to ask for a description of all
possible such models. For nearly a century, the classification (precise listing
of all possible models) of 2-manifolds has been understood. Following this work
by fifty years, it was learned that it is not possible to classify all
4-dimensional models. This project attacks the problem in dimension 3, which
remains open. ***
