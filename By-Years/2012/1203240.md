The PI proposes to study the surface wind based on reanalysis data, weighing the
influence of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and local atmospheric
boundary layer destabilization on its changes. Further, a budget including all
variables in the sea ice momentum balance will be calculated using a state-of-
the-art ice?ocean model. This enables the estimation of the individual effect of
surface wind and ocean stresses, ice thickness, and ice concentration on the
recently observed acceleration of the Arctic sea ice motion. Likely changes in
the partitioning of air?sea and ice?sea stresses at the ocean surface due to the
shrinkage of the ice area will be taken into account. For this purpose the model
results will be validated with satellite data of ice concentration and ice
drift. These findings will finally be combined into an integrative picture
documenting and explaining the changes of the momentum flux into the Arctic
Ocean during the past three decades. The proposed research will also aim to
predict the future evolution of the momentum flux. Recently, it has been
hypothesized that coupled global circulation models are incapable of correctly
projecting trends in Arctic sea ice characteristics, perhaps because they lack
dynamic feedback processes involving sea ice strength. The proposed work will
aim to either disprove the hypothesis or understand the possible deficiencies of
common sea ice models to represent such dynamic feedbacks.

Increased momentum flux from the atmosphere to the Arctic Ocean can be expected
to result in more vertical mixing, possibly bringing warmer waters from depth to
near the sea surface where they may contribute to acceleration of the loss of
sea ice. This study will enhance our ability to understand and predict the
future changes in this momentum flux. Consequently, it contributes to our
understanding and management of resource extraction, shipping, and ecosystem
change in the Arctic, all of which depend on the evolution of the sea ice cover.
