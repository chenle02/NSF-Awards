This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
research on long-range electron transfer by Dr. Alvin D. Joran of the Chemistry
Department, New York University, and collaborators Drs. Joseph Malinsky and Yuri
Magarshak in biophysics at Mount Sinai Medical School. The goal of the research
is to determine whether and to what extent hydrogen bonds in peptides mediate
electron transfer. Synthetic model compounds in which electron donor and
acceptor sites are directly linked to a known inflexible alpha-helical peptide
backbone will be prepared. The distance between the ruthenium complex donor and
quinone acceptor will be systematically varied and the kinetics measured using
time-resolved emission or transient absorption spectral techniques. In the
accompanying theoretical portion of the project, graph and propagator formalism
will be applied to coupling electron transfer pathways including any number of
resides and side groups. The predictions will be tested against the experimental
results and other available data on surface-labelled redox proteins. %%%
Transfer of electrons over relatively long distances is an important process in
biological systems as well as in molecular wires or non-linear optical devices.
The contribution of hydrogen bonds to electron transfer is not well understood.
Joran et al. have devised a rigid system in which to study the process and will
use some novel calculational approaches to understand the effect.
