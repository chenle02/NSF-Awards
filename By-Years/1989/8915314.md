The genus Pheidole includes more than 500 species of ants, concentrated in the
tropics of the New World. Ant colonies of this genus can be very abundant in
certain habitats, and they are common constituents of most tropical terrestrial
settings. Species of the genus display an impressive range of ecological habits,
including termite predation, symbiosis on plants, arboreal nest-building, and
mimicry on termites and other ants. Unfortunately, ecological and behavioral
research on this diverse genus is hampered by the lack of a solid understanding
of its taxonomy and diversity. More than half of the New World species have
never been described formally and named, and there is no comprehensive guide to
their classification and identification. Dr. E. O. Wilson proposes to complete
his long-term study of the group, culminating in a taxonomic monograph,
illustrated identification key, and species-level classification. Field work in
Costa Rica, Brazil, and Peru will add valuable new collections to the study, as
will the Smithsonian's BIOLAT insect inventory project. The proposed study will
open a variety of research opportunities in tropical biology. Ecologists and
behavioral biologists will use the proposed identification keys and
classification to add precision and rigor to their studies. Future surveys of
tropical diversity will use this study as a baseline for assessing changes in
diversity. The proposed project will find a wide audience beyond the ranks of
ant systematists.
