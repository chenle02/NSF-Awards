The study of impurities in semiconductors and their relationship to device
performance continues to be an active research area. Modeling work is being
performed, experimental crystals are being grown, and experimentally produced
deep traps in these semiconductors are being measured. Recent experiments and
modeling are focusing on compound semiconductors. Finally, the modeling work on
mercury cadmium telluride defect centers is being completed.
