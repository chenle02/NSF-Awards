Over the past decade, deep learning has evolved from conquering research
benchmarks to systems that interact with humans on a daily basis, including in
machine translation, healthcare, speech recognition, semi-autonomous vehicles,
and automation. However, a large gap exists between its empirical successes and
a theoretical understanding of why / when it works. This project aims to close
this gap through foundational understanding of deep learning and designing
algorithms to improve reliability and data efficiency. More broadly, the
societal impact of this project include i) theoretical understanding and design
of algorithms relevant to machine learning, ii) education plans that develop a
new seminar series and workshops for secondary school teachers, and iii)
improving disability accommodation in academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is divided into three different thrusts. The first thrust is to
understand the algorithmic regularization effect of algorithms and
architectures. Using these insights, the team will design better loss functions
and architectures to improve accuracy. The second thrust is to theoretically
compare the accuracy of networks trained with stochastic gradient descent
against their architecture-induced kernel methods. This comparison may
theoretically demonstrate that neural networks can do feature learning, which
explains the empirical success of deep learning, and that kernel methods cannot.
Finally, the project will study representation learning, and theoretically
analyze how deep networks can transfer their representations between different
domains. Such a transfer will allow a reduction of the labeled data requirements
for deep learning, potentially allowing its application to data-starved
domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
