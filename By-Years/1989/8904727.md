The objective of this project is to study the structure-function relationships
of the enzyme adenylate kinase (AK) by a combination of genetic, biochemical,
bioorganic, and biophysical techniques. (1) Site-directed mutagenesis will be
used to identify the residues involved in the binding of substrates in the
ground state and in the transition state. The three existing models (derived
from NMR, X-ray, and theoretical studies) will be critically tested. The goal is
to obtain a revised or a new model. (2) The effects of point mutation on the
conformation of AK will be evaluated in two stages. The first stage is to use
difference protein NMR, difference circular dichroism, guanidine-HCl-induced
denaturation, thermal stability, and computer graphics to assess possible
structural perturbations in the mutant and the potential structural roles of the
residues. The second stage is to use proton NMR to evaluate conformational
perturbations in selected mutants more quantitatively. (3) The above model will
be further tested and refined by "complementary substrate mutagenesis" using
various substrate analogues. The goal is to confirm the specific interactions
between the enzymic residues and the substrates from the substrate side.
