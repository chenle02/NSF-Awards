This project seeks to provide new mechanistic understanding of atmospheric
chemistry associated with complex plant emissions that contribute to the
production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere. Complex
mixtures of plant biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions are not
currently accounted for in most regional or global aerosol models. This research
will help to characterize the chemical behavior of SOA precursors that have not
been studied previously, including the important effects of
mixtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to study critical
gaps across a range of chemical complexities in plant emissions that include:
(1) single component, low complexity laboratory experiments that focus on
acyclic terpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes that are commonly emitted by plants
but are underrepresented in the SOA literature, (2) complex volatile mixtures
made from synthetic standards (intermediate complexity), and (3) actual plant
emissions (highest complexity). Laboratory SOA will be generated via
photooxidation or ozonolysis in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). At least four
major data products will be generated for each VOC system to characterize the
SOA chemistry: SOA mass yield curves, SOA oxidant exposure curves, Kroll
diagrams, and volatility distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
