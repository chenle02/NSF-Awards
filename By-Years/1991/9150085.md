Activities that encourage middle school students to learn the concepts of
science and mathematics by motivating them with real world situations or
interest to them are to developed by technology education community. The
activities will use design under constraint - hands-on technology - (as
different from hands-on science) to motivate the learning of science and
mathematics. The results will include the increased ability of students to apply
concepts of science and mathematics to "real-world" situations, increased
communications among science, mathematics and technology teachers and research
findings on the role and effectiveness of technology-based activities. The
project uses teams of teachers to produce materials under the guidance of the
principal investigators and science and mathematics educators. Administrators
will be part of the team to help work out logistical problems. The materials
will be disseminated by a commercial publisher.
