This Presidential Young Investigator award will support the research of
Professor Wodzicki in the area of noncommutative differential geometry. The
dominant themes in this research will be a noncommutative Riemann-Roch theorem,
higher index invariants, connections with arithmetic algebraic geometry via
noncommutative differential geometry in positive characteristic, and
quantization of homological algebras in a direction parallel to quantum groups.
Differential geometry can be thought of as calculus on manifolds. These are
surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues. The algebra of differentiation
operators on the manifold can be further abstracted until there is no manifold
left but just the algebra. This is the far reaching generalization of
differential geometry called noncommutative differential geometry. The area
draws on and nourishes all the major fields of mathematics: algebra, geometry
and analysis.
