9404280 Swiatek The research entails parameter dependence in families of one
dimensional mappings including endomorphisms of the circle and unimodal
transformations of the interval. Higher dimensional generalizations are
expected. This research has a relationship with hyperbolic dynamical systems and
has potential applications to physics and biology. ***
