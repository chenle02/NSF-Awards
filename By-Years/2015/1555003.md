This CAREER project is focused on characterizing the formation and fate of brown
carbon in the atmosphere. Ambient measurements of brown carbon will be made in
Los Angeles CA over several years and laboratory studies will be conducted to
better understand the fate of brown carbon in fog and clouds. The project is
expected to add important insights into the sources, fate, and impact of brown
carbon in the urban environment. Such knowledge could help reduce uncertainty in
regards to the contribution of atmospheric aerosol to climate forcing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the research are to (1) Determine the
contribution of nitro-aromatics to ambient Los Angeles particulate brown carbon
(BrC) over hourly, daily, and yearly time scales, and (2) Determine how aerosol
aging during fog/cloud processing impacts aqueous secondary BrC optical and
chemical properties. This project also presents a unique opportunity to engage
undergraduates in timely atmospheric research with cutting-edge instrumentation.
