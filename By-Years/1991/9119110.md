Boron isotopic ratios will prove useful in clarifying the source of B and the
processes by which it is incorporated into arc magmas. This project is to
analyze basaltic lavas from a number of volcanic arcs to establish correlations
with such factors as subduction rates, thermal state, geometry, etc. For
comparison, selected lavas from within-plate settings (Ocean islands and
spreading centers) will be analyzed to better define the B isotopic composition
of mantle regions that are unaffected by subduction. Also it is planned to
analyze samples from two progressive metamorphic suites to evaluate isotopic
fractionation effects accompanying dehydration and recrystallization. The
proposed work is relevant to studies of fluid-rock interaction and mass
transport via hydrothermal brines, to tracer studies of subduction-related
processes, and to studies of the evolution of hydrothermal mineral deposits and
effects of prograde metamorphism on devolatilization of crustal rocks.
