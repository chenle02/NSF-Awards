This award is made as part of the FY 2017 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and
training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including
applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring
scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Allen R. Gehret is
"Asymptotic Differential Algebra and Model Theory of Logarithmic Transseries and
H-Fields." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of
California-Los Angeles, and the sponsoring scientist is Matthias Aschenbrenner.
