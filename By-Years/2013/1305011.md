The partnership of the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (New
Mexico AMP, Senior Alliance) represents the state's public two-year
postsecondary institutions and the state-supported four year universities. New
Mexico AMP?s continuing goal is to increase the quantity and quality of minority
students who complete B.S. degrees and who are currently underrepresented in the
STEM disciplines. Specific attention is given to ensuring these students are
well prepared to enter the STEM workforce and providing then with the
encouragement, incentive, and motivation to pursue graduate education. Program
activities attend to individual student retention and progression as well as to
understanding the aggregation of student progression to graduate school entry
and promoting the replication of best practices both within New Mexico and
nationally through dissemination efforts. The Project Goals are as follow:
-Increase the number of STEM students transferring from 2-year to 4-year
institutions. -Refine and incorporate academic, curricular, and co-curricular
enrichment activities designed to increase the quality of STEM graduates and
increase the motivation, performance, and progression of talented students in
preparation for graduate studies. -Provide direct student support for academic
year and summer enrichment activities. -Increase URM STEM graduates by 23% over
the previous five-year average of 528 to 650 per year. -Demonstrate an increase
in the progression of undergraduate students to graduate school entry. -Maintain
and continue to build meaningful partnerships with colleges and universities,
school systems, government agencies, national laboratories and centers,
industry, private foundations, and STEM professional organizations to support
student development and success.
