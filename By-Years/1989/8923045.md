Funds are provided for an ancillary heat flow program during an ONR-funded
study of crustal evolution and hydrothermal processes on the Endeavor segment of
the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The survey will concentrate on 3 sites: one just to the
west of the axis of the Endeavor Segment, and two sites farther off- axis with
20-40 m of sediment in which mounds that may be hydrothermal were recently
discovered in a setting similar to that of the Galapagos Mounds. Heat flow
measurements will be critical for defining the hydrothermal regime and its
effect on the processes of crustal evolution in the survey area.
