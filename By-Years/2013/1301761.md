The investigator proposes to continue his investigations on the topology, Hodge
and cycle theory of algebraic varieties and maps by studying fundamental aspects
of the general theory as well as important examples by working on: 1. symmetries
in the cohomology of the Hitchin fibration, 2. decomposition theorem for
birational maps and for toric maps, 3. constructible sheaves in positive
characteristic, and 4. motivic properties of cycles arising from the
decomposition theorem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator works in the field
of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is the discipline devoted to the study
of polynomial equations. It is an ancient subject rooted in the early
achievements of humanity, like the wheel, the Egyptians' elliptical flowers
arrangements and Archimedes' burning parabolic mirrors. Circles, ellipses and
parabolas arise from the polynomial equations we study in high school. They are
both beautiful and ubiquitous in nature as they describe many natural phenomena,
from the motion of planets to the shape of leaves and flowers, to the behavior
of microscopic particles. The funded project is strongly inclined towards pure
research and proposes to study the deeper properties of the solutions to more
complicated algebraic equations (called algebraic maps). As it has always been
the case, pure and applied mathematics will influence each other and new
abstract ideas will fuel the progress of applications.
