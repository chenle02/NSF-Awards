This project will provide information using interactive formats about current
industrial quality assurance practices to two- year industrial and engineering
technology faculty.It will enable them to update existing course content or
initiate instruction in quality assurance. This activity will enhance the
instruction of quality assurance at the two-year level and will also teach
students about the importance of quality in an economic environment. Western
Carolina University and the American Society for Quality Control jointly will
conduct a year long set of activities under project auspices .The initial
activity is a week long applications workshop involving quality assurance
fundamentals including total quality, team problem solving, process study,
control charts and process control versus product control. This will be
complemented with field trips and guest speakers. During the following year,
participants will visit several industries representing a broad range of
manufactured products to discuss, review and gather data about quality assurance
processes.The concluding two day session will emphasize participants'
experiences and how these experiences will impact the local curriculum and
students in specific engineering technology programs .
