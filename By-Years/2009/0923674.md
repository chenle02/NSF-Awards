This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is focused on
assessment of our novel siRNA-loaded nanofibrous polyester in a rat carotid
artery endothelial cell denudation model, which has been historically used to
evaluate the effects of blocking specific genes on arterial healing. The goal of
this Phase II proposal is to determine where these siRN-loaded nanofibrous
materials can locally release a selected siRNA directly to the implant site and
block selected cellular functions within the animal artery that are associated
with blood vessel narrowing. Our hypothesis is that selected siRNAs can be
incorporated into electrospun nanofibers using our patent-pending proprietary
technology. siRNA would then be released from the respective material in a slow,
sustained fashion, thereby directing cellular/tissue incorporation and transgene
expression. It is anticipated that siRNA-loaded polyester materials will
regulate cellular growth in and around the material as compared to untreated
nanofibrous materials, thereby preventing blood clotting.

The broader impacts of this research are development of an implantable polyester
material that can be used to locally deliver specific siRNA moieties directly at
the implant site (i.e. within the artery). There is no other implantable
material capable of directly affecting localized cellular function. Thus, this
technology when employed as a stent coating or an artificial blood vessel will
significantly improve patient outcome after implantation of these materials.
Additionally, this type of material could be employed for simple (hernia repair
mesh, catheter cuffs) or complex (total implantable heart, ventricular assist
devices) devices that would require controlling specific cellular functions.
