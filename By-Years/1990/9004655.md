The principal investigator will study index problems for first-order singular
operators which have specified form near singular strata. This class of
operators includes classical geometric operators with Dirac signatures and those
having conic type strata. The main tool to be exploited in this investigation is
the "wedge calculus" and its extension to pseudomanifolds. For most of the
twentieth century operators with various types of singular sets have been the
mainstay of theoretical physics. Earliest of these was one first studied by
Dirac. This operator had the property that while it was zero everywhere except
at a single point, its integral, or the area under its graph, was positive. At
first such operators used by physicists had no sensible mathematical
explanation. But eventually mathematicians were able to explain them by changing
the context of their original interpretation. The principal investigator will
analyze a large set of operators which includes Dirac's.
