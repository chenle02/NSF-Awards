This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on the use of a new method for probing the structure and orientation of
protein films formed on well characterized surfaces. Professor Saavedra and his
colleagues at the University of Arizona will use integrated optical waveguide-
attenuated total reflection and total internal refection fluorescence techniques
to characterize heme protein films prepared on Langmuir-Blodgett films and self-
assembled polyion films. The focus will be to develop correlations between heme
protein orientation, functional properties, and direct electron reactions. Long-
term objectives of this work involve use of these protein films in molecular
device technologies such as bioanalytical sensing, energy storage/conversion,
and bioseparations. A new method using integrated optical waveguides has been
developed for studying the structure of heme proteins on surfaces. Professor
Saavedra and his colleagues at the University of Arizona developed this very
sensitive method to characterize thin protein films formed on well characterized
surfaces. These proteins form films on these surfaces through controlled
electrostatic interactions. The properties of these thin protein films are
projected to have uses in areas such as bioanalytical sensing, energy
storage/conversion, and biospecific separations. The development of new
molecular devices for applications in several biotechnology areas is the long-
term goal of this work.
