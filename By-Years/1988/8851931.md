A computer-controlled, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer is being
incorporated into a project-based laboratory curriculum at a women's college.
This laboratory program, developed over many years, involves students early with
problem-solving and chemical instrumentation. The small classes permit
introducing freshmen to basic spectral techniques and the FT-IR, in its one-
button mode, is exposing these students to this powerful technology. Involvement
with instrumentation is expanded through organic chemistry, quantitative
analysis and an advanced lab in the junior year. The FT- IR is being used
extensively in physical chemistry for kinetics experiments and to obtain high
resolution spectra of gases. The FT-IR is greatly enhancing current experiments
and numerous experiences, not previously possible are becoming routine,
including computer data handling, spectral database searches, and reflectance
sampling methods. Exposing students to the FT-IR at progressively higher levels
is allowing them to use all of its capabilities. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
