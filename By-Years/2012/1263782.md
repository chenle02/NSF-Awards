This project aims to realize the proof of concept and then the demonstration of
product on a new design of solar cell. The technology used for this project is
based upon the use of tunable organic bi-layer photovoltaic (OPV) nanoparticles
as a low-cost means to convert photons from the sun to useable electrons. The
proposed work involves fabrication of aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods,
decoration of the nanorods with functional OPV nanoparticles, testing of solar
cell performance, and the demonstration of products. The new design will align
functional bilayer nanoparticles with vertically aligned ZnO nanorods to realize
efficient transport of carriers (electrons and holes) that are generated through
photon-electron conversion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sustainable energy supply is
an issue impacting day-to-day life, the environment and many other areas. If
successfully completed, this project may lead to sustainable and more economic
energy supply through solar power. Zinc oxide nanostructures have demonstrated
high electrical conductivity, mechanical strength and long-term stability. Both
the OPV nanoparticle and the ZnO nanorod offer low-cost scalability utilizing
low-cost materials and inexpensive widely used processing techniques.
