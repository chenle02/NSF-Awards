&lt;br/&gt;The proposal was submitted in response to the FY2002 Chemical and
Transport Systems equipment solicitation, described in NSF Announcement. NSF
01-93. The PIs propose to acquire two pieces of equipment that will establish a
significant experimental capability in micro/nanoscale transport phenomena at
the University of Texas at Austin. Research activities enabled by this equipment
include thermal property measurements of nanostructures and in low conductivity
dielectric films, investigation of heat dissipation mechanisms in carbon
nanotubes, and near-field laser manufacturing and nanoscale fluorescence
imaging. Application of these nanostructures, including carbon nanotubes and
semiconductor nanowires, in the areas o nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and
thermoelectric cooling has great technological potoential. The equipment will
also be utilized in new graduate courses at U.T.-Austin. Funding is from the
Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing of the Chemical and Transport Systems
Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
