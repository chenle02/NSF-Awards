0541530&lt;br/&gt;Karlsson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is an extension of
previous work to more clearly define intracellular and intercellular ice
formation when cells are physically in contact. New experimental techniques
including high speed video microscopy to assess IIF at unprecedented speed
(30,000 frames/second), as well as a new (untried) method for measuring water
transport using fluorescence quenching are proposed. Completion of the proposed
work would advance the knowledge and understanding of IIF initiation, growth,
and propagation and the effects of thermodynamic and non-thermodynamic variables
on these processes. While the experimental approach uses two-cell and monolayer
cultures, theoretical modeling is expected to elucidate optimal approaches for
the cryopreservation of tissues and tissue engineered constructs. The work
includes an implementation of an open-source project for cryobiology software
developed in the course of the research including software previously developed
by our group, as well as software developed by other research groups. Knowledge
gained from the completion of this work would benefit the field of cryobiology,
tissue engineering, and cryosurgery.&lt;br/&gt;
