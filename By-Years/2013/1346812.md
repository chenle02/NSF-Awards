Many important electronics applications, including medical imaging, cyber
security and digital entertainment, require processing massive amount of data
under limited time, power and price budgets. Modern many-core processor chips
offer a promising platform for computing such data-intensive workloads, however,
their utilization is hindered due to the inherent difficulty and unproductivity
of parallel software development at scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
aims to address this critical problem by developing methodologies and tools for
productive and scalable development of software that would efficiently run on
thousands of processor cores. Central to the approach is development of
"functionally-consistent structurally-malleable streaming specification," which
enables design-time exploration of a rich software implementation space, under
the constraints of hardware platform, while maintaining the application's end-
to-end functional behavior. The project results are expected to improve
performance, energy consumption, and application development cost in a large
number of data-driven disciplines, ranging from medical imaging and cyber
security to multimedia and beyond.
