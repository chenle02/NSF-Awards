Theoretical understanding and experimental creation, characterization and
utilization of fluid jets of nanoscale dimensions present significant
scientific, engineering and technological challenges. These challenges originate
from fundamental issues pertaining to the physical properties of liquids whose
dimensions approach the molecular scale, as well as problems related to the
design, creation and characterization of liquid jets with such reduced sizes.
The interdisciplinary program developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology,
that combines researchers from the schools of Physics, Electrical &amp; Computer
Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, aims at developing, implementing, and
applying theoretical and experimental tools that will allow systematic
investigations targeted at gaining deep insights into the microscopic mechanisms
underlying the formation of nanojets and governing their stability, as well as
leading to the design, fabrication and application of nanojets. Applications of
nanojets are envisaged in diverse future nanoscale technologies, including:
surface patterning, electronic circuit printing, coating, fiber spinning, and
trans - membrane needless injections. The theoretical techniques that will be
employed in this program include large-scale computer-based atomistic
simulations, as well as continuum hydrodynamic modeling modified to include
size-dependent fluctuations, with a focus on the development of reliable
methodologies of predictive capabilities. The critical materials issues and
outstanding fabrication and characterization challenges, will be addressed
through the development and adaptation of imaging techniques, including electron
microscopy and atomic-force-microscope imaging of nanojets during flow, as well
as post-deposition analysis of nano-printed features and applications of nano-
structural fabrication techniques and detection methods that are at the
frontiers of nanoscale engineering and detection capabilities. For further
