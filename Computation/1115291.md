This project will develop, extend, and apply the finite element exterior
calculus, a new approach to the design and validation of stable finite element
methods for a variety of partial differential equations. Finite element exterior
calculus brings tools from geometry, topology, and functional analysis to
provides both algorithms and supporting theory which can form the foundation on
which progress can be made on solving crucial problems in computational science.
Although developed only recently, finite element exterior calculus has already
been adopted by many researchers and has enabled the development of robust and
accurate numerical methods for important applications. A major direction of
research which will be pursued is the development of the finite element exterior
calculus of time-dependent problems. For this, the Hodge heat equation and the
Hodge wave equation will serve as the basic model problems, and Maxwell's
equations of electromagnetism and the equations of elastodynamics are two of the
numerous applications. Another important direction is the development of spaces
and complexes of finite element differential forms on cubical meshes and the
study of the approximation properties of such spaces when the elements of the
mesh are distorted. The proposer will also study the application of the finite
element exterior calculus to solving the Einstein equations, which are the
fundamental equations of general relativity.

Computer simulation of physical systems coming from solid mechanics, fluid
dynamics, electromagnetism, and other areas, are applied in countless ways every
day in problems as varied as the design of aircraft, the prediction of climate,
and the development of cardiac devices. Once a physical system has been modeled
by a system of mathematical equations, successful simulation depends not only on
powerful computer hardware but also on mathematical algorithms that can harness
the computer's high speed number-crunching to obtain accurate solutions of
model's equations. While such algorithms exist for many important equations, and
moreover have been certified by mathematical analysis so we can have confidence
in the results, there are many other problems for which accurate and certifiable
algorithms are yet to be discovered. This proposal focuses on a new approach to
the development and analysis of computational algorithsm for simulation that has
in recent years achieved great success for simulations involving the deformation
of solid materials, like auto bodies or construction beams. A primary goal of
this project is to increase the range of systems which can be simulated
accurately and confidently.
