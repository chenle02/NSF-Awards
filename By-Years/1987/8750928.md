The College of the Virgin Islands will help its science and mathematics students
better to visualize mathematical functions and relationships, and develop a
quantitative intuition for the dynamic behavior of systems and the effects of
changes to systems, cognitive skills which are difficult to impart in classroom
situations. The use of more powerful hardware with good graphics capabilities
and an icon user interface, coupled with availability of general tools for
student exploration, provides an environment where these skills can be acquired.
This project will provide student labs equipped with such facilities for use in
all science and mathematics programs, and enable the College to enrich its
science students' learning experiences and increase their exposure to new
computing techniques. The college will purchase Macintosh graphics computers,
networking hardware, and software.
