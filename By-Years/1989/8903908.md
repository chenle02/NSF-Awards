The ultimate objective of this research is to understand the molecular
mechanisms that determine orderly chromosome segregation during mitosis. Two
aspects of chromosome segregation, sister chromatid disjunction and spindle
elongation, will be studied in vitro using the fission yeast,
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We have shown that in permeabilized cells of the
mutant strain nuc2, which are arrested at metaphase, spindle elongation and
chromosome movement can be reactivated in the presence of ATP and neurotubulin,
but sister chromatid disjunction cannot. We will extend this in vitro functional
analysis to wild type and other mutant strains arrested at appropriate stages of
mitosis. We will describe the roles of microtubule sliding and polymerization
during anaphase spindle elongation in vitro, the conditions required for
reactivation of sister chromatid disjunction, and the roles of kinases in
regulating these processes. In vitro complementation using spindle proteins
prepared from functional permeabilized cell models or specific gene products
produced in E. coli will be used to describe the roles of these proteins during
mitotic events. Antibodies prepared against known spindle components or against
gene products identified by genetic analysis will be used to interfere with in
vivo mitotic function. Combined with an analysis of mutant phenotypes in vivo
and localization of proteins by immunofluorescence, this analysis will be useful
for understanding the role of specific gene products in chromosome segregation.
The development of a functional in vitro model for chromosome segregation in a
genetically manipulable organism could play a pioneering role in the field of
mitosis.
