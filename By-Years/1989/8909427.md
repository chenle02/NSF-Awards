This award is a ROW Research Planning grant which will try to take advantage of
the recent discovery that naturally occurring RNA gene products can control gene
expression by direct interaction with complementary target DNA. The investigator
will apply her experience as an enzymologist to a kinetic dynamic analysis of
RNA to determine the mechanism of the facilitation of formation of RNA complexes
during replication. The investigator brings much needed biochemical
sophistication to an important area of research, the regulation of RNA
replication.
