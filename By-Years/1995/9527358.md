The emerging new field of groundwater ecology asserts that certain biota are
characteristic residents of groundwater and that there are important couplings
between groundwater and surface-water biota. One hyopthesis is that groundwater
flow influenced benthic algal species composition in lakes. Here we propose to
critically address important short-and long-term groundwater/biotic diversity
interaction by Sparkling Lake Nevins Lake, MI and Williams Lake, MN. The
research will assess how nutrients delivered by groundwater influence the
species composition benthic diatoms at discharge and recharge sites, how
dispersal of characteristic diatoms from that discharge contributes to within-
lake diatom diversity,, and how the long-term consequences of groundwater
coupling can be followed in sediment cores. The proposed investigations would
expand and complement long-term studies at the three sites and surrounding
regional studies.
