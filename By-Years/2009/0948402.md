A Workshop titled ?Meso-scale Mechanics of Complex Materials? is proposed, to be
held in Vancouver, on 2 and 3 November 2009, jointly sponsored by Academia
Sinica (Taiwan), Air Force Office of Scientific Research (USA), and National
Science Foundation (USA). Complex materials, such as metallic alloys, ceramics,
polymers, and composites, exhibit highly nonlinear mechanical behavior. Examples
include fracture of metals under extreme conditions, coupled mass transport and
deformation in lithium-ion batteries caused by insertion reactions, large
deformation and swelling of polymers in response to diverse stimuli, and
progressive damage of composites at sites of stress concentration. Substantial
progress has been made in understanding microscopic processes underlying such
complex behavior, and in using these materials in engineering structures. A gap,
however, exists between mechanistic understandings of microscopic processes and
rational design of engineering materials and structures. Closing this gap will
require fundamental advance in meso-scale mechanics. The Workshop will have a
broad impact on knowledge dissemination of a field of research essential to
modern technologies. Effort will be made to invite participants among young, as
well as female and minority, researchers. Effort will also be made to invite
participants both from the United States and Asia. The Workshop will draw
together researchers who share common interests in the deformation and fracture
of complex materials, and in the fundamental roles of the meso-scale mechanics.
