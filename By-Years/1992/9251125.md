A two semester introductory, multidisciplinary course for non- science majors is
being developed. The course is designed with concept modules incorporating major
themes in biology, chemistry, and physics through hands-on experiments focusing
on selected major processes, principles, and paradigms of modern science.
Sensors, spectrophotometers, and personal computers are used for recording of
data and graphical display of results. Experimental protocols emphasize how data
can be collected, analyzed, and used to validate or amplify accepted theories.
Durable, basic instruments have been selected so that experimenters are taught
to use scientific instruments with ease and confidence. Throughout the course,
an emphasis is placed on showing how quantitative results are necessary to
scientific arguments, especially in terms of identifying key parameters and
components that are relevant to modern environmental and business decisions.
