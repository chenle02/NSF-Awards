NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology
intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with engineering. The
Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific workforce of the future.
This fellowship to Andrew Russell Babbin investigates the response of marine
microbes in low oxygen zones. The host institution is Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Roman Stocker and Martin
Polz.

Marine microbes carry out a variety of biochemical reactions that shape the
chemistry of the ocean in which they live. The ocean has many and variable
chemical gradients, for example, oxygen minimum zones, each with its own
community of marine microbes. The fundamental mechanism by which these
microorganisms respond to natural chemical gradients and ephemeral substrate
injections to create the observed biogeochemical structure, however, is unknown.
This research seeks an understanding of microbial/chemical interactions and
global nutrient cycling as a whole by combining laboratory and field
experiments. Bacterial metabolism of nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen is being
simulated using laboratory microfluidics experiments designed to test how marine
microorganisms respond to chemical gradients and interact with their
environment. Fieldwork in actual oxygen minimum zones complements the laboratory
experiments to develop a high-resolution spatial structure of the microbial
community within these zones.

The fellowship also offers training in the design and conduct of laboratory
experiments that make use of fluid mechanics and microscopy, development of
numerical models that replicate microscale biological and physical dynamics, and
molecular biology techniques. Educational outreach activities are being
conducted through MIT's undergraduate research program and new collaborations
with teachers and students at Boston high schools to increase interest in
microbial oceanography.
