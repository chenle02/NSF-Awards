Significant advances have been made in the utilization of high data-rate optical
fiber communication systems. Developments in processing technology have led to
the planar fabrication of various optical guided wave and opto-electronic
components. Advances in material technology combined with the convenience of
parallel signal processing in optics have sustained the interest in optical
computing. However, the fabrication of guided wave and opto-electronic devices
is a complex matter. Variations in material growth and microfabrication
processes affect their optical and electronic properties which directly affect
the performance of the devices and systems. While the material "constants" can
only be obtained from measurements, the design of the integrated system must be
done in such a fashion that system performance can be predicted. Computational
models, eventually computer aided design, are necessary. Researchers at the
University of California San Diego will investigate the modeling of components
in LiNbO3 materials. Investigation will be made of computational models for
index profile, electro-optical index change, and passive and active devices
including the effects of microwave properties and system representation of the
components. Collaboration will be established with Crystal Technology and
Westinghouse for experimental data on devices and computational techniques. The
institutional support is adequate and the PI is well qualified to carry out the
research.
