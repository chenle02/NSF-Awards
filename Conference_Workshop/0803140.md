The focus of the thematic program semester of winter 2008 at the CRM is on
dynamical systems, interpreted in a broad sense so as to include applications to
fundamental problems in differential geometry as well as in mathematical
physics. Topics that are considered include:(1) the interplay between dynamical
systems and PDE, in particular in the context of Hamiltonian systems, (2)
geometric evolution equations such as Ricci flows and extrinsic curvature flows,
(3) spectral theory and its relationship to Hamiltonian dynamics, and (4) Floer
theory and Hamiltonian flows. In the past several years there have been dramatic
achievements in these four areas, representing progress on a number of the most
basic and difficult questions in this field. These advances have had a broad
impact on recent progress in geometry and topology, and they also shed light on
basic physical processes, such as nonlinear wave phenomena, that are modeled by
ordinary and partial differential equations. The purpose of this program
semester is to bring together members of the diverse international community of
researchers who have an interest in these topics, to give a series of advanced-
level courses on relevant subject matter so as to make the topic accessible to
new researchers in the field, and to bring into discuss the perspectives and
general indications for the next advances and directions of progress in the
area.

The central focus of the theme semester of winter 2008 at CRM is dynamical
systems. The theory of dynamical systems is concerned with the description of
the evolution of systems depending on time. Such systems are fundamental, and
appear very commonly in the modeling of physical, chemical and biological
phenomena, as well as in geometry and many other areas of mathematics. In the
past several years there have been dramatic achievements in the area of
dynamical systems, including the proof of Poincar√© conjecture by G. Perelman (an
event known to the public through the drama of the Fields medal awards in 2006).
These advances have had a broad impact on recent progress in geometry and
topology. The modern theory of dynamical systems has also been fundamental in
the study of many basic physical processes, and their modeling by ordinary and
partial differential equations. The purpose of this program semester is to bring
together representatives of the diverse international community of researchers
who have an interest in these topics. Its activities will comprise (1) a series
of advanced-level courses on the subject matter, so as to make the field
available to students and new researchers, (2) to host discussions of the
perspectives and future directions for the next advances and areas of progress
in the field.
