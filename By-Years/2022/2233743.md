The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop further a predictive model for
health providers to address the life-threatening condition of preeclampsia in
pregnant and postpartum patients. Preeclampsia affects 1 in 20 births, or
150,000 women in the U.S. each year. Not only does Preeclampsia cost 70,000
lives globally each year, it is also an expensive burden for healthcare systems.
It costs nearly three times more to treat a patient with preeclampsia than one
without this complication. When deployed at scale, the technology proposed in
this SBIR grant could be a key factor to reducing maternal mortality in the
United States, improving obstetric patient outcomes, reducing the cost of
obstetric care, and helping to reduce health
disparities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will research and develop
a method to potentially detect preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a hypertensive
disorder of pregnancy. This dangerous condition also costs the U.S. healthcare
system $2.18 billion per year or one-third of the total amount spent on maternal
healthcare in our country. Research objectives include optimizing a machine
learning model, integrating patient-facing software into Electronic Health
Records systems, implementing the predictive model for preeclampsia, integrating
with peripheral wellness devices, developing reminder notification mechanisms,
determining appropriate interface enhancements, and defining commercialization
and regulatory strategies. Improving maternal health outcomes advances the
general health and welfare of American families and can improve our countryâ€™s
economic competitiveness on the world stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
