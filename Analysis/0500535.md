The PI's research is mainly in the theory of operator spaces and its
applications to operator algebras, non-commutative Lp-spaces and non-commutative
harmonic analysis. During the last few years, the PI, together with some other
mathematicians, has made some significant contributions to these areas. He has
obtained a number of important results on the local (i.e. finite dimensional)
operator space properties and related approximation properties of C*-algebras
and non-commutative Lp-spaces. He has also obtained some interesting
applications of operator spaces to non-commutative harmonic analysis. In this
proposal, he plans to continue his research in these directions and proposes the
following research projects: (1) investigate some problems on non-commutative
Lp-spaces, (2)investigate some problems on group C*-algebras and Fourier
algebras, (3)investigate the possible generalizations to Kac algebras and
locally compact quantum groups; (4)investigate some related problems in non-
commutative/free probability.

The theory of operator spaces is a natural quantization of functional analysis,
or more precisely, a natural quantization of Banach space theory. Operator
spaces were first realized by William Arveson in 1969 and were abstractly
characterized by the PI in his Ph.D thesis in 1987. Since then there have been
some remarkable developments in operator spaces and the theory has been quickly
developed into a very active research area in modern analysis. The projects
proposed here contain some important questions in operator spaces, operator
algebras, non-commutative/quantum harmonic analysis and non-commutative/free
probability. The progress on these projects will have significant impact in
these areas, as well as in some other related mathematics research areas such as
quantum group theory, non-commutative geometry and geometric group theory.
Projects in this proposal also provide the outstanding resources and research
problems for the PI's Ph.D students and post-docs. The support for the Wabash
Seminar and Miniconference is requested in this proposal. The Wabash Seminar,
together with its annual Miniconference, is devoted to the stimulation and
dissemination of significant contributions to analysis in the Midwest region.
This has already provided (and will continuously provide) a unique opportunity
for young researchers, visitors, post-docs and graduate students from the
Midwest to meet regularly and exchange ideas with leading experts in the fields.
