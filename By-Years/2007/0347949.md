This research is on separating forwarding policy from route discovery in the
Internet, allowing users to select among possibly many inter-AS paths available
to them and enabling ISPs to more effectively manage the end-to-end behavior of
their traffic. The researcher is exploring the concept of the so-called network
capability that binds together a path request, an accountable resource
principal, and an authorizing agent. Network capabilities form the basis of
Platypus, a loose source routing protocol that composes authorizations from
multiple ISPs to construct alternative inter-AS routes that can be independently
validated and accounted for on the fly. The proposed research has the potential
to significantly improve the performance, reliability, and robustness of the
Internet. Network capabilities remove many of the obstacles to deploying
sophisticated routing policies in the Internet, enabling network operators to
explicitly authorize third parties to affect the network's routing decisions in
an accountable, secure, and efficient fashion. The major result of this project
will be an implementation of Platypus and a demonstration of its effectiveness
in expressing and arbitrating amongst competing ISP routing policies. In
particular, this research will show that capabilities can express both existing
ISP routing policies and additional, more complex policies not supported by BGP.
The Platypus implementation will be made freely available and deployed on the
PlanetLab and Internet-2 test-beds.
