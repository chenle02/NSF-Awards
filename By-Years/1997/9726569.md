ABSTRACT Proposal #9726569 (Frank and Groffman) Title: THE SUSTAINABILITY OF
GRAZING ECOSYSTEMS Institution: SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY This research examines the
question of whether large herbivores actually contribute to the sustainability
of grasslands that they occupy, through their effects on soil carbon (C) and
nitrogen (N) processes. The prevalent view that herbivores decrease belowground
productivity is not supported by results from Yellowstone National Park, where
grazers appear to increase belowground production, particularly the input of
labile soil C. The hypothesis to be tested is that the promotion of labile C
input by grazers is fundamental to acceleration of nutrient cycling in
Yellowstone and may be critical in sustaining the energy and nutrient dynamics
of Yellowstone and other grazed ecosystems. This work addresses three questions
in Yellowstone: (1) How do grazers affect soil C input? (2) How do grazers
influence soil C-N linkages? (3) What effects do the plant growth and allocation
traits that are selected for in grazed grassland have on sustaining soil
processes? Answers to these questions are important because abundant large
herbivores and grasslands have coexisted for millennia, yet our current view of
the effects of these animals on grassland processes suggest inherent
instabilities of grazing ecosystems. Because 50% or more of the Earth's land
surface is grazed by large herbivores, increasing our knowledge of how
herbivores influence ecosystem C accumulation and N cycling should significantly
improve our understanding of terrestrial effects on global C and N cycles.
