Detection of Self-Propagating Malicious Code&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hayder Radha,

0430436&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel
methods for mitigating automated malicious code intrusions (e.g., computer
worms) are being investigated and developed. This includes local- and network-
level intrusion detection strategies that provide effective and timely detection
of malicious codes. A mathematically rigorous framework, which is based on
detection theory, is being applied to the intrusion detection problem. In
particular, the focus is on the general case of network-based anomaly detection
(i.e., the case where deviations from normal network traffic characteristics are
employed to raise an alarm). The development of Neyman-Pearson tests to track
anomalous user-level/network-level traffic patterns is being investigated. An
effective test necessitates development of a mathematical model for the user-
and network-level traffic that can in turn be employed to define the Neyman-
Pearson null hypotheses. To this end, the performance of stochastic modeling
techniques that have been proven to render effective characterization of network
traffic and related random processes, such as the multifractal wavelet model and
the Markov chain model, are being investigated. A contribution of this effort
will be development of portable software that can provide real-time and adaptive
intrusion detection. The application and performance of the proposed framework
in peer-to-peer and mobile ad hoc environments is also being investigated. This
work will yield effective defense and detection against automated malicious
codes, which have caused profound negative impacts on the global Internet and
users worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
