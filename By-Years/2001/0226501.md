The proposal is to establish a US-EU/DELOS working group/study panel on
"Information Extraction from Digital Libraries". The working group will meet
over the next year to discuss and evaluate fruitful joint activities and
research paths for collaborative activities in this general topical area. The EU
component of the effort is funded and managed by the DELOS Forum, a major
organizer of digital libraries research and planning activities in Europe. DELOS
receives support from the Information Societies Technologies (IST) 5th Framework
Programme of the European Commission. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort
continues the planning and assessment activities begun by an earlier NSF-EU
working groups' process. In their final report "An International Research Agenda
for Digital Libraries", delivered in Brussels in October 1998, increased levels
of collaboration and interaction was seen as critical to building multi-lingual,
multi-national digital libraries. The objective of the new working groups, of
which this is one, is to define a research agenda on a specific topic and
identify areas and activities for cooperation between EU and US researchers. The
efforts of this particular group take the next step in the planning process by
assessing future directions for research and resource development related to
information extraction from digital libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
