University of Texas at Austin doctoral student, Noman Baig, with the guidance of
Dr. Kamran Asdar Ali, will investigate how increased global financial
surveillance affects local and customary mercantile practices. The research will
be carried out in Bolton Market, the largest wholesale bazaar in Karachi,
Pakistan, where customary networks of informal money transfers were once the
cornerstone of financial autonomy and independence. In the last decade, the
Pakistani state has intensified its efforts to monitor and discipline such
mercantile practices, and to replace them with the tools and techniques of
modern finance. These efforts, and others like them, may have set off dynamics
that will transform the nature of such popular trading spaces wherever they
occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To obtain empirical data from the merchant
community, the researcher will employ a mixture of social science research
methods including semi-structured interviews, oral histories, and participant-
observation. The researcher will collect accounts of merchant adapting to and
navigating this challenging terrain at the vortex of three interrelated
dynamics: forces of globalization, rising religious extremism, and state
surveillance. Framed in the post 9/11 era, the research speaks to contemporary
issues of terrorist financing and national security as well as academic debates
on Islam and modernity. Findings from this research will contribute to
generating a greater awareness of the cultural logic of the marketplace and
inform the design of culturally sensitive financial reforms. Supporting this
research also supports the education of a graduate student.
