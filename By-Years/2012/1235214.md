The field of plant physiology has made fundamental contributions to our
understanding of plant biology, for instance, insights into the processes of
carbon assimilation and partitioning, nitrogen use efficiency, improvements in
yield, the hormonal control of plant growth and development, perception of
red/far-red light by phytochromes, and plant responses to drought and mineral
deficiencies. While many of these processes have been well studied at the whole-
plant level for decades, in some cases, mechanistic insights have been difficult
to achieve. With the advent of genomic technologies over the last 15-20 years,
new opportunities have arisen to address unresolved, long-standing questions in
plant biology. The 2012 Interdisciplinary Plant Group Symposium to be held May
23-25, 2012 at the University of Missouri-Columbia will bring together a diverse
group of international scholars studying fundamental biological processes in
plants from varying disciplinary angles. The symposium is designed in such a way
as to enhance networking opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows and will create a venue to foster collaborative and interdisciplinary
research projects for faculty and students. Funding provided by NSF will broaden
participation by defraying the costs of participation of undergraduate students,
particularly those from smaller and minority-serving institutions, as well as
postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students with specific emphasis
on women and underrepresented groups.
