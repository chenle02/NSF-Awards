This project will support a three day conference on analytic number theory to
be held in April, 1989 at the Conference Center of the University of Illinois at
Allerton Park, Monticello, Illinois. The conference will focus on analytic
number theory, including such topics as zeta functions, sieves, exponential
sums, and arithmetical functions. Talks are expected on such additional related
topics as probabilistic, computational, and elementary number theory, arithmetic
applications of modular forms, and diophantine approximation. There will be one-
hour lectures given by invited speakers and shorter contributed talks in the
area of analytic number theory. Time and facilities will also be available for
informal discussions. Participant support will be available and participation by
graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s will be especially encouraged.
