Solar plasma energetics is a subject which has applications not only to
astronomers but also to practical applications for nuclear fusion containment
(tokamaks) and the disruption of the Earth's magneto-sphere and radio
communications. In a previous award the Principal Investigator (PI) has combined
simultaneous observations from x-ray satellites and the ground observatory in
Hawaii to follow the development of solar flares at high time resolution. His
results show for the first time that momentum is conserved in flare plasma
(gas), a conclusion which puts significance constraints on models of flare
development in the solar chromo- sphere and lower corona. The new award is an
Accomplishment Based Renewal Award based on the long-term excellent record of
his group. The new work will extend his work to a number of new areas, including
new spectral lines carrying separate information and observations of active
solar-type stars. The latter group is designed to determine whether the extent
to which certain processes responsible for solar flare production are at play in
these stars, thus advancing the place of solar flare physics in the research
area known as the "solar-stellar connection."
