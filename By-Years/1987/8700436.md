The proposed research is concerned with the effects of the vibrational
excitation of molecules on the chemical reactions taking place in the
thermosphere and ionosphere of the earth. The energy retained in vibrational
excitation from previous reactions affects the subsequent chemical reaction
rates of the molecules; the spectrum of airglow and auroral emissions; and the
kinetic energy of the reaction products. Sufficient energy in reaction products
will produce hot atom coronas around the earth and enhanced rates of escape from
the top of the atmosphere. The numerical modelling of model atmospheres is to
include basic data on the vibration of molecules, together with data from ground
based instruments, rockets, satellites and spacecraft. The result of this
research will advance our understanding of physical processes in the upper
atmosphere, and our ability to use airglow and auroral measurements as a
diagnostic on them. The PI is a young woman with considerable promise who has
already demonstrated competence and productivity in this field.
