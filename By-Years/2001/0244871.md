This project focuses on the study of the coherence time of a Bose-Einstein
condensate by developing an interferometer apparatus capable of measuring
coherence times of up to five seconds or more. The interfering atom packets will
be separated and recombined using optically induced Bragg diffraction, and the
atoms will be confined at all times in a weak magnetic trap. Special attention
will be paid to the observation and investigation of phase diffusion. This
source of decoherence arises from the interactions between atoms in a packet,
when coupled to the unavoidable fluctuations in the number of atoms in the
packet. The work will explore ways in which the phase diffusion can be reduced
to obtain longer coherence times, which are of practical interest. On the
broader impact, the research has the potential for socially useful technological
innovations, in particular for inertial navigation and for oil exploration. In
addition, the project will involve research training of graduate and
undergraduate students.
