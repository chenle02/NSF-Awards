This project develops a model which can better achieve an overall integration
between real and financial phenomena than the representative agent neoclassical
growth model used in real business cycle analysis. This would be an important
contribution because the models employed in Real Business Cycle theory appear to
be unable to account for the volatility of asset prices at business cycle
frequency or the spread between the average annual returns of Treasury Bills and
the return on equities. The model developed in this project differs both in its
impulse (recurring uncertainty) and propagation mechanisms (the choice between
flexible and inflexible actions) from Real Business Cycle theory. Shocks to the
economy are only partially observable. As a result, the representative agent
draws an inference about the true shock from those which are observable. These
inferences are subject to recurring fluctuations in "confidence." By calibrating
its parameters to long-run growth facts of the U.S. economy, key statistics of
the actual economy are reproduced through the model economy. More specifically,
the model reproduces real magnitudes such as consumption, output and investment,
and observed financial statistics on the volatility of asset prices, the premium
on equities, and the term structure of interest rates.
