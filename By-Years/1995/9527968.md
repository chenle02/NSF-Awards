9527968 Newton This project will improve the pinned insect collection of the
Field Museum of Natural History by providing 182 new cabinets and 1763 new
drawers to house the specimens. Inferior, old storage trays will also be
replaced with trays made of modern, archival materials. The collection will be
moved into newly constructed space in the Field Museum, and while the move is
going on, the Lepidoptera and other non-Coleopter specimens will be reorganized.
Unidentified material will be identified by curators and visiting scientists.
Upon completion of the project, the pinned insect collection will be far more
accessible for use by the scientific and conservation communities.
