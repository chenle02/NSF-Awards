The conference, Indigenous Worldviews in Informal Science Education, is designed
to advance research on the integration of Native and Western science in relation
to informal science learning. The goals of the conference are to integrate and
synthesize research and theory, formulate a research agenda, and share the
results with the STEM education community. The conference is organized around
six strands: Collaboration, Policy, Holistic Education, Next Generation Youth,
and Evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A six-week preconference online discussion
of conference issues leads into the two-day conference, held at Imiloa Astronomy
Center in Hilo, Hawaii. The meeting brings together sixty participants including
educators, research scientists, learning researchers, policymakers, and Native
youth. The conference includes keynotes, workshops and synthesis discussion
groups, which will be synthesized and presented at a policy outcome meeting held
in Washington, DC that follows the conference. Conference results will be
further disseminated at relevant conferences, in publications, and through
online discussions. A full evaluation process will inform the detailed planning
of the conference and will evaluate the effectiveness of the conference, based
on responses from conference participants.
