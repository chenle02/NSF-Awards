This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Richard G. Finke at Colorado State University to
distinguish between true homogeneous catalysts and hidden nanocluster or other
heterogeneous catalysts. Systems to be studied span a range of catalytic
reactions where the question of whether the catalyst is homogeneous or a
hetereogeneous nanocatalyst remains unanswered. Reactions to be studied include:
arene hydrogenation, alkane activation and functionalization, nickel-based
polymer hydrogenations, sol-gel entrapped catalysts, and catalysis in ionic
liquids. This research group employs a 5-step method allowing the nature of the
true catalyst to be established more rapidly and reliably. This study endeavors
to establish the "rules" whereby polymetallic nanocluster or other heterogeneous
catalysts are formed from monometallic homogeneous precatalysts by investigating
nanoclusters as a key conceptual bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalysis.

This research will impact discovery and understanding in the science of
catalysis. Teaching, training and learning will also be impacted by involving
women and students from underrepresented groups in projects that emphasize
experiments aimed at distinguishing between alternative hypotheses. Partnerships
with 4 researchers at other universities and with an industrial company are
expected to enhance science and education infrastructure.
