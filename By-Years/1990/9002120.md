This proposal requests funds to purchase a portable Global Positioning System
(GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) workstation. The portable system
would be housed primarily at the University of South Carolina's Belle W. Baruch
Institute for Marine Biology and Coastal Research Field Laboratory, but would be
available to Baruch Institute scientists, visiting investigators, and graduate
students for work along the entire east coast. A GPS and GIS and the type
requested is required to answer many basic questions related to spatial
variability of cophysiological parameters with respect to disturbance, point and
nonpoint source pollutant impacts, and natural habitat gradients. This
technology would enable the PI's to pursue many new and exciting research
directions which have been hindered in the past by necessary reliance on
existing technology (traditional costly and time-consuming surveying methods and
two dimensional database management and analytical tools). In addition, the
purchase of this instrumentation would allow them to address many of the new
questions which have resulted from the Long-Term Ecological Research Program
field studies in North Inlet. equipment. Acquisition of this equipment would
greatly enhance current research and create many new opportunities for Baruch
Institute scientists and also increase the attraction for visiting scientists to
conduct research at our facility.
