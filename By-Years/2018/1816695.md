The project aims to investigate the landscape of provable quantum advantages in
optimization and machine learning, which is ubiquitous in our daily life, and to
build a solid theoretical foundation for applications of quantum computing,
especially with near-term quantum devices and in the establishment of quantum
supremacy. By integrating modern tools in both optimization and quantum
algorithm design, the project aims to design quantum algorithms for convex
optimization and various semidefinite program classes, by quantizing the state-
of-the-art classical optimization algorithms. The results obtained will be
disseminated through a variety of venues, including conferences, new course
materials, expository writings, and high school open days aimed at exposing
young computer scientists to the frontiers of quantum information research. This
project is jointly supported by the Algorithmic Foundations (AF) Program in the
Division of Computing and Communications Foundations in the Directorate for
Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the Quantum Information
Science (QIS) Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project
investigates provable quantum advantages in solving convex optimization, general
and positive semidefinite programs, as well as variational optimization methods
executable on near-term quantum devices. Specific targets include: (1) the
sampling-based approach and the membership-to-separation approach for convex
optimization; (2) optimal semidefinite program solvers based on the width-
dependent and width-independent approaches as well as the interior point method.
The investigator also aims to design new quantum optimization algorithms on
near-term quantum devices as well as to provide theoretical justifications of
quantum optimization algorithms based on the variational method and the quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
