Interactions involving excited atoms will be investigated. The focus is on
atoms in highly excited Rydberg states, which can accentuate usually
unobservable microscopic effects. Attention will be directed toward quasi two
electron atoms, where highly excited states can be of either pure Rydberg or
mixed Rydberg - doubly excited state character. This permits comparison of the
reactive properties of the two disparate states, which behave quite differently.
Since black body radiation rapidly alters state selected populations, an
apparatus will be used in which low absent temperatures can be maintained in the
reactive region. This will also permit studies of interactions of atoms with
black body radiation.
