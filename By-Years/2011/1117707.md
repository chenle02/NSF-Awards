Obtaining information from data is one of the most fundamental problems of
modern science and technology. The aim of machine learning is to develop
algorithms to automatically extract useful information from complex, high-
dimensional data. Making progress toward this aim requires developing an
understanding of the aspects of data, which are amenable to analysis and can be
learned using computationally efficient methods. In particular, modeling non-
linear structures in high-dimensional data has become one of the very
challenging and active lines of research, which has seen significant progress
over the last ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
develop and analyze new mathematical representations for data, based on spectral
and algebraic methods. We will explore how different structures in the data,
such as cluster, manifold or parametric model structures, are reflected in their
spectral and algebraic properties and how they can be extracted algorithmically
from data, paying particular attention to the issues of high dimensionality and
non-linearity. These insights will be used to build better and more adaptive
algorithms for inference and data analysis tasks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will
also analyze experimentally and theoretically properties of these algorithms,
when data deviates from the posited model structure. This is a key issue in
practical applications, which nearly always involve uncertainty and noise.
