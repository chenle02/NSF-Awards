9503204 Vasile The purpose of this project is the development of a mathematical
model of Focused Ion Beam (FIB) etch processes, enabling the fabrication of
unique microstructures. Three-dimensional test objects will be designed and
fabricated using the model, such as probe microscope tips and cavities with pre-
specified geometeries. The activities will provide a link between object design
FIB control, and microstructure fabrication. ***
