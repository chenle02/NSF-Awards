The objectives of this research program are to investigate and clarify
fundamental questions on compressibility behavior of natural soils and to
develop or refine methods for measurement of compressibility parameters,
interpretation of field observations, and analysis of settlement of structures.
The specific questions to be investigated include the uniqueness of the end-of-
primary void ratio-effective stress relationship, behavior of the coeffi- cient
of lateral pressure, methodology for settlement and pore pressure analyses, and
secondary compression of clean sands. The research method relies on exacting
experimental techniques and long-term laboratory and field observations as well
as mathemati- cal modeling and numerical analysis. A distinct feature of the
project is that high quality undisturbed samples of natural clays are being used
in laboratory investigations. The intention is to rely on observation as the
primary basis for developing physical and mathematical models and to assure the
generality of the concepts through the use of an extensive data base and
comparisons with soil response to full-scale construction. Previous
accomplishments confirm that a clear understanding of consolidation is: a
significant event in the geological history of natural soil deposits; an
important mechanism in soil improvement through densification; and an intended
stage or an undesirable effect in laboratory or in situ measurement of soil
properties. Settlements associated with consolidation and corresponding changes
in permeability, deformability and shear strength of soils are all important
factors of practical concern in geotechnical design, construction and
performance of structures.
