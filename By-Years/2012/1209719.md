This action funds Meredith Claire Edwards of the University of Georgia to
conduct a research project, entitled "Understanding biofuel production by heat-
loving bacteria from pectin-rich food wastes," during the summer of 2012 at
Nanjing Normal University in Nanjing in Jangsu province of China. The host
scientist is Dr. Weilan Shao.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate the possibility
of using thermophilic bacteria that can produce fuel ethanol from biomass to
produce ethanol from pectin-rich food wastes, e.g., sugar beet pulp from sugar
production and citrus waste from citrus juice production. The longterm goal is
to increase the options for production of ethanol biofuels while disposing of
large volumes of waste.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
