The principal objective of the research is the development of a technique to
accomplish the pipeline inspecton and repair in a single phase operation.
Pipeline failures are detected by closed system television camera; the
development of the new device also has the capabilities of repairing the damage.
The repair material is a type of grout that is applied from the inside of the
pipe. A second objective is directed to developing a reliable grouting material
that combines the advantages of chemical and particulate grouts. The new
material may expand the applicability of grouting for the repair and
rehabilitation of all types of hydraulic structures. Experimentally testing of
the device for injection of grout into laboratory pipeline crevices is planned.
This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for Undergraduate
Engineering Students.
