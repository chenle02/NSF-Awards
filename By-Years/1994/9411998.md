9411998 Gordon The primary goal of this research is to estimate the full cost of
business interruptions associated with the Northridge earthquake, the first
moderate to large earthquake with an epicenter inside a large metropolitan area
since the Long Beach earthquake of 1933. Little research has been conducted on
the business interruption effects of a major earthquake as opposed to damage
estimates to structures and lifelines. This is the first opportunity, then, to
undertake an ex-post analysis if business interruptions resulting from a major
urban earthquake. Since it involves the collection of perishable data, this
project is being funded under NSF's Small Grants for Exploratory Research
program. ***
