9418331 Muscatine One of the most intriguing, and enigmatic phenomena in the
field of coral reef ecology is the symbiotic relationship between the coral
polyp and the nutrient producing dinoflagellate that it hosts. This relationship
is the key feature in the stability of coral reefs and many of the organisms
which reside there. The objective of this project is to study the translocation
of carbon from symbiotic dinoflagellates to the coral host cells. This will be
achieved by a revolutionary approach to studying this relationship, by
artificially altering the biochemical carbon pathways, and evaluating the
subsequent metabolism of the coral polyp and the photosynthetic capacities of
the dinoflagellates. This shall give us new insights on the nutritional
relationship between the two. Dr. Muscatine has a string of success with prior
NSF awards and is at the forefront in this field of study. His project will help
to achieve two objectives: 1) further contribute to our understanding of the
role of coral symbioses, which could potentially have biotechnological value,
and 2) provide another opportunity for collaborative work with Russian scientist
in U.S. laboratories.
