The research and education community faces a pressing need for effective and
efficient strategies for securing its IT infrastructure. This requirement is
particularly important in large, federally sponsored research facilities that
operate very substantial, interconnected networks of diverse resources including
computers, information stores, and special instrumentation. For this reason, the
National Science Foundation and its partner agencies are hosting a forum to
bring together stakeholders to establish and maintain collaborative efforts to
advance cybersecurity among the university and government research community.
Along with leading experts in cybersecurity, the attendees will work to identify
major threats, strategies, and solutions for a class of very difficult problems
of technology, policy, and practice that increasingly threaten the successful
operations of large facilities in support of distributed scientific research.
