This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop optical
fiber sensors for the quantitative measurement of humidity and air flow for use
in &lt;br/&gt;medical diagnostics for breathing. Initial research indicates that
these physically small and mechanically robust sensors respond over a wide range
of relative humidities, with a response time of microseconds, orders of
magnitude faster than commercially available devices. In the project, a
molecular-level electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) processing method will be used
to form multilayered, interleaved metal nanocluster and polymer thin films on
the distal ends of optical fibers to form the sensors. The project will involve
work with a biomedical institute partner to develop the sensor thin film
chemistries with improved response, and to design and fabricate the optical
fiber sensor support instrumentation system. The Optical Science and Engineering
Research Center at Virginia Tech will assist in thin film materials analysis and
optical device testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, these small, rugged,
intrinsically safe, ultra-fast optical fiber-based humidity and air flow sensors
offer an attractive and low-cost approach to breathing diagnostics for both
clinical research and home health care. Additional large markets for similar
sensors exist in the industrial gas flow, automotive and transportation
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
