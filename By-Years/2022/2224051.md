Contagion processes are mathematical descriptions of the way something spreads
through a system. In a social system, in which things spread from person to
person, what spreads might be an epidemic, ideas and opinions, or radicalization
and polarization. Understanding these kinds of processes is important for many
reasons, including not only contributions to basic science but also the
development of effective public policy and the preservation of national
security. This award provides funding for the conference “Computational
Approaches for Contagion on Complex Social Systems” (CACCSS). The conference
promotes the exchange of ideas around novel computational tools for the modeling
of contagion in complex social systems. The conference features speakers who
will give talks on topics including epidemic modeling, misinformation spread,
higher-order contagion, and behavioral models. The conference is also dedicated
to training participants on these topics and the use of software that
facilitates the analysis of contagion data.

The workshop will promote the use of computational tools that will facilitate
modeling of contagion in complex systems for researchers with a wide variety of
backgrounds. The award subsidizes the travel of students, postdocs, and junior
faculty to attend the workshop, and trains young researchers to contribute to
this important area of research. It supports accessibility and inclusion of
researchers from underrepresented groups, and in so doing increases the
diversity of researchers in this field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
