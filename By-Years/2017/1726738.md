An award is made to the University of Missouri to acquire a high resolution mass
spectrometer coupled with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography
system. The instrument will be used to help further our understanding of
proteins in a variety of plants including soybean, corn, and elderberry. It will
also be used to examine fertility loss in animals at the protein level in
support of agriculture. The University is collaborating with Evans Analytical
Group (EAG) Columbia (a GLP and CGMP-compliant product development and
analytical testing services company based in Columbia, MO) in a continuing
industry internship program for undergraduates. Each spring undergraduate
interns participate in an intensive four-week training course. This in-depth
course offers a select set of high-caliber undergraduates an opportunity to
develop analytical skills, with an emphasis on separations and mass
spectrometry, in preparation for being employed by EAG Columbia as summer
interns. Biochemistry and Chemistry undergraduate students will also use the
instrument in advanced lab classes to further their understanding of modern
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry is an essential method
for determining the structure of large biomolecules such as proteins. It is also
possible to use this method to examine modifications to proteins. The
acquisition of the high resolution mass spectrometer will allow the
investigators of the project to perform quantitative protein analyses, develop
new analysis capabilities, and improve instrument access at the University of
Missouri. The major users of the instrument have active research programs
examining protein changes in a variety of plants and animals.
