Virginia State University is submitting this planning proposal to the National
&lt;br/&gt;Science Foundation Historically Black Colleges and University
Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Program (HBCU-UP) in Mathematics, Engineering, Computer
Science, and the&lt;br/&gt;Physical Sciences. The Goal of this planning proposal
is to conduct an assessment &lt;br/&gt;at VSU on the SMET offerings and develop
a plan which will be an institutional &lt;br/&gt;stepping stone toward a
National Science Foundation SMET-UP five year grant &lt;br/&gt;proposal with t
he long term intention to increase the number of well-
qualified&lt;br/&gt;minority students graduating in engineering, science and
mathematics and to &lt;br/&gt;provide these students with sufficient
preparation, guidance, and encouragement &lt;br/&gt;to attend graduate school.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key personnel for the project will be the Principal
Investigator (PI), Co-PI, Activity &lt;br/&gt;Coordinator, the director of
Institutional Planning and Assessment, the director &lt;br/&gt;of Freshmen,
Retention and General Education Programs and all SMET
department&lt;br/&gt;chairpersons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
