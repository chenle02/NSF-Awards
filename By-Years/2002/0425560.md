This proposal supports Third Annual Workshop on the Cognitive Neuroscience of
Category Learning, to be held October 10th and 11th, 2004, in New York City. The
study of category learning has been a central paradigm within cognitive
psychology for over twenty-five years. For a number of reasons, cognitive
neuroscientists have recently been drawn to this paradigm. First, there is a
large body of pre-existing empirical and theoretical analyses of category
learning. Neuropsychological studies of brain-damaged populations and
neuroimaging of healthy subjects have provided preliminary insights into the
cognitive neuroscience of category learning. Second, category learning has
aspects of both elementary associative learning as well as higher order
cognition. It is this dual nature-part elementary skill, part higher cognition-
which makes category learning a valuable paradigm for studying fundamental and
important aspects of human learning, at both the behavioral and neural levels of
analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancing research in category
learning will have many broad impacts on society including (1) enhanced
interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations, (2) increased
international contacts and dissemination of research, (3) expanded participation
in science and training for women and under-represented minorities, and (4)
broad dissemination of program content via meeting participation, meeting
website, and free distribution of conference program with all speaker's slides.
By providing funds to include more graduate students and postdoctoral fellows,
this proposal stands to enhance the workshop's intellectual merit still further
by increasing the breadth and depth of ideas that will be discussed at the
meeting.
