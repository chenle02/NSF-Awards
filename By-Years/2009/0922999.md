0922999&lt;br/&gt;Drzal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks financial
support from the NSF towards the purchase of an Environmental Scanning Electron
Microscope (ESEM) integrated with a Dual Beam FocusedIon Beam (FIB). This
instrument will serve two purposes. First, the instrument will replace an early
generation ESEM (purchased in 1994) widely used to support research of 30+
faculty members in 9 academic departments in 3 colleges, as well off-campus
collaborators and second, to bring the nanoscale materials processing
flexibility offered by a dual beam FIB to a wide range of research programs at
MSU in the areas of nanoscale electronics and devices, bioengineering, metals
and alloys, composites, ceramics, and polymers. The acquisition of this
instrument will not only greatly enhance the portfolio of users by expanding the
nanoscale research infrastructure and other government agencies and industry,
but will also be an integral part of the educational infrastructure at the
graduate, undergraduate, K-12 and lifelong learning levels.
