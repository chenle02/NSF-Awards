9316481 Bilham This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
gravity meter capable of measuring absolute gravity with a precision of 1
microgal. The instrument will be purchased by the University of Colorado and
made available in a multi-user facility for the U.S. geophysics research
community through a memorandum of understanding with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which will house, calibrate and repair it and
provide a field engineer during field deployment. The instrument will be used
primarily in studies of global sea level, mountain building, crustal
deformation, earthquakes, and the detection of underground movement of water and
magma. ***
