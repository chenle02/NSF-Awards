The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms of eucaryotic gene
regulation. The system chosen for study is the yeast transcriptional activator
ADR1 in its control of glucose repressible alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2).
Particular emphasis will be placed on defining the mechanisms by which ADR1 is
regulated, the functional regions of ADr1, the factors which mediate or
influence ADr1 functions, and the means by which these factors and ADR1 control
ADH2 transcription. A combination of biochemical, recombinant DNA, and genetic
analyses will be used. The activation/repression domains of ADR1 will be
precisely identified and their interactions will be analyzed. The mechanism by
which an ADR1 mutation enhances the function of ADR1 activation domains will be
examined by determining its effect on dimerization, ADR1 conformation, and
binding of other proteins. The proteins which co-immuneprecipitate with ADR1
will be purified and characterized. %%%% The goal of this research is to
understand how cells respond to the environment and control when and which genes
the expression will be characterized by identifying their important regions.
These regions include segments that respond to the environmental signals, that
contact other proteins, and that turn on or off the express of genes. A
combination of genetic, recombinant DNA, and biochemical techniques will be
used.
