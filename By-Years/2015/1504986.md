The project is a systematic effort to identify and address mathematics-related
learning issues in introductory physics courses. The courses include algebra-
and calculus-based general physics. The model emphasizes small-group, active
student problem-solving using research-based curricular materials, in which
students express and reflect on their thinking verbally and in writing. The
project is to establish a basis for the design and development of new strategies
for improving student engagement in introductory physics, which it is hoped will
improve student retention in physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project findings and
products contribute substantially to the body of research and of evidence-based
instructional materials available for undergraduate physics courses. These will
be a resource for other researchers and curriculum developers. The model
incorporates identification and analysis of specific student mathematical
difficulties. Use of the materials in targeted instruction will be followed by
assessment of student learning. This analysis will be used to develop tightly
focused instructional materials.
