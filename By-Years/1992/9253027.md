The proposed project involves interdisciplinary, comparative research on the
effects of public policies on the informal economic sector. A collaborative
faculty-student team will generate data on informal economic participants, their
work, and its returns in six matched neighborhoods of Juarez and El Paso.
Interviews will also be conducted with policymakers to clarify how policies are
formulated and implemented on the informal economic sector. Existing data from
censuses and other data sets will expand findings from this study. This research
will advance knowledge about state- society relations on an international border
now experiencing change associated with free trade. The research will also be
relevant for the policy implications that flow therefrom.
