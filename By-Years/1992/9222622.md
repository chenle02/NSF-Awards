This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Magnetic Properties of
Cretaceous/Tertiary Glass, Tektites and Nuclear Waste Glass" at Howard
University in support of Alfred University's Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Glass. This two-year project is reporting to the Center's
Industry Advisory Board. The project is studying the ionic, molecular and
crystalline species in certain natural and nuclear waste glasses. The Program
Manager recommends Howard University be awarded $50,000 for two years.
