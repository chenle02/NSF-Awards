Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics

Abstract of Proposed Research Bruno Nachtergaele

This project will support research on theoretical issues in equilibrium and
non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. The main focus is on quantum spin
models that arise in condensed matter physics as models for the magnetic
properties of a large variety of materials. Apart from the possible applications
in material science, the primary goal of the project is to provide new insights
in fundamental problems of quantum statistical mechanics and to find rigorous
methods for their solution. In particular, I will investigate methods to obtain
qualitative and quantitative information about the spectrum of model
Hamiltonians such as the Heisenberg model and derive implications of these
spectral properties for the dynamics of the system.

The main focus is on quantum spin models that arise in condensed matter physics
as models for the magnetic properties of a large variety of materials. Due to
the close similarity of the mathematics, however, it is expected that the
project will also provide useful results for applications in quantum information
theory and quantum computation. New directions to be explored include the
dynamics of complex quantum systems and the development of numerical techniques
to simulate such systems.
