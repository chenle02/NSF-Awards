9319892 DeSzoeke The dynamics of the oceanic surface layer in the western
Pacific warm pool region will be investigated by means of comparing observations
with various parameterization of mixed layer dynamics and a simplified ocean
circulation model. The main focus will be on the effects of rainfall on the
upper ocean response to atmospheric forcing. This study is a contribution to
TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response
Experiment).
