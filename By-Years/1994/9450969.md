9450969 Larsen This project supports new entomology laboratory courses for
majors and non-majors with an emphasis on experimental approaches. The courses
are taught by a new faculty member in the biology department with expertise in
insect behavior and ecology. The college has supported the initial development
of this program; however this project provides video microscopy, insect rearing
equipment, and other modern instrumentation. It is expected that the project
will improve the experimental approach as well as the behavioral laboratory
component in the new entomology courses. Also, this equipment will support
directed entomological research performed by undergraduate students at a small
liberal arts college. ***
