INT-9634605 Thakur Description: This project addresses three important aspects
of the neotectonics of the Himalayan foothills and adjacent plains of India-the
long-term slip rate on the plate boundary fault, the recurrence interval for
great Himalayan-front earthquakes and the amount of strain released within the
Himalaya rather than the Himalayan front. The work involves construction of
balanced sections using surface outcrops, drilling and seismic reflection
profiles, mapping of Quaternary deposits, trenching and geomorphic analysis of
river profiles. This research is in collaboration with the Wadia Institute of
Himalayan Geology and the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India. Results are
of fundamental interest and considerable utility in the assessment of potential
earthquake hazards in the Himalayan foothills of northwest India. Scope: The
project requires dollar funding for data interpretation and training of Indian
scientists in the US and Indian currency to support travel to India and to
supplement field research costs. Government of India Clearance for this
collaborative project allows US scientists to conduct field work in sensitive
border areas of the Himalayas. ***
