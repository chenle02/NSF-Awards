9316832 Schnable The composition of the cuticular wax of plants is complex and
incompletely known, and little is known regarding the biosynthesis of this
material(s). The glossy8 locus, one of the seventeen loci known to be involved
in the biosynthesis of this wax in maize, has been molecularly cloned by tagging
with a transposable element. In addition, the cer2 locus of Arabidopsis, which
is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis, has been localized to a 70-kb segment
of the genome. The cer2 locus will be identified by genetic complementation
tests. Both genes will then be used to study the biochemical and genetic
mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of these unique and biologically
significant plant lipids. The cuticular waxes of plants constitute the first
barrier to the environment and the stresses it imposes on plants. Thus, these
waxes lay an important role in plant survival. The composition of these waxes
and the biosynthetic pathways by which they are formed are incompletely
understood. This project will make use of molecularly cloned genes to examine
the gene products of the biosynthetic pathway and thus enlarge our understanding
of it. ***
