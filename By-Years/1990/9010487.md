This research is focused on the effects of social stigma on self concept. The
basic idea is that social stigma create a defensive state of interpretive
ambiguity on the part of the stigmatized person, and that this ambiguity reduces
the positive impact of success, and often undermines motivation to succeed.
Thus, programs designed to provide successful experiences for stigmatized
persons might, in fact, have paradoxical effects on their self-concepts. The
studies undertaken here will provide important information about the manner in
which stigma influences people's lives, and, perhaps more importantly, will
suggest ways in which inappropriate (mis)interpretations which stigmatized
individuals use to defend themselves psychologically can be overcome. The
implications of this research for understanding the effects of stigma are very
important. Even more important are the implications of the research for
understanding the ways in which the effects of stigma might be overcome.
