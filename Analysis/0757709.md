The aim of this proposal is to study various aspects of random matrix theory and
integrable systems. One pat of the project is to study asymptotic properties of
various distribution functions arising in random matrix theory using their
connection to integrable systems. Another part of the project concerns on the
universality questions. These are motivated by problems in statistics and
integrable differential equations. The long term goal is to understand a clear
picture of the universality property of random matrix theory.

Random matrix theory describes a wide array of objects in mathematics such as
number theory, combinatorics, probability, as well as in other disciplines of
science like statistics, physics, economics, finance and electrical engineering.
This proposal is aimed to study some intrinsic properties of random matrices
motivated from such applications to improve our understanding of the field.
