w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9631133 Law This experimental research project is
concerned with surface phenomena of adsorption and wetting, which play an
important role in many physical, chemical, and biological processes. The
research is based on a recently developed ellipsometric microscope. This
instrument, developed in the PI's laboratory, will be used to determine size and
shape of droplets under experimental conditions. The data will be compared with
appropriate theoretical models. This study will enhance our understanding of how
uniform wetting layers form via droplet growth and coalescence, how ions in the
solution influence the phenomena of wetting and adsorption, and will clarify
whether or not orientational order is important at the surfaces of critical
ionic mixtures. %%% The composition at the surface of a solution frequently
differs from that in the bulk because surface interactions create an adsorbed
layer or a wetting layer at the interface. These surface effects are important
in many processes such as lubrication, catalysis, and fluid flow, through
biological membranes and porous media. The work will use an ellipsometric
microscope to study the dynamics of coalescence and growth as wetting droplets
combine to form a uniform wetting film at the surface of a critical non-ionic
binary liquid mixture. The dynamics will be studied as the temperature is
varied. The influence of ions will also be studied. This work will enhance our
understanding of the complex interplay between bulk critical phenomena and
surface processes, in the presence and absence of ions in solution. ***
