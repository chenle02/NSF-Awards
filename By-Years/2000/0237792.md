This CAREER educational and research project seeks to study the dynamical and
stochastic theories for damage evolution in phase space and to develop
prognostic capability for machinery and structural health monitoring systems.
The main goal of the research is to develop methods capable of tracking
simultaneously occurring multiple damage processes and accurately predicting
imminent failures in variable forcing conditions. Applications to complex
systems including composite structures will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed educational activities include
the introduction of M&amp;SHM related science &amp; technology content into the
curriculum. Collaborative effort to outreach with on-going programs at the Rhode
Island University will be carried out. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
