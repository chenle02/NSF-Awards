This project concerns the development of semiclassical asymptotic techniques for
initial-value problems and initial/boundary-value problems of nonlinear wave
propagation in the situation that the equation of interest is completely
integrable, possessing a Lax pair representation and all of the corresponding
mathematical framework. Specific problems to be addressed include (i) the weakly
dispersive asymptotics of the intermediate long-wave equation and its
degeneration to the Benjamin-Ono equation, (ii) mixed initial/boundary value
problems for the semiclassical defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation on the
half-line, (iii) initial-value problems for the semiclassically scaled 3-wave
interaction equations, (iv) transsonic initial-value problems for the
semiclassical modified nonlinear Schroedinger equation, and (v) large-degree
asymptotics for rational solutions of Painleve equations. Solving these problems
will require the development of new tools of asymptotic analysis for nonlocal
and higher-dimensional Riemann-Hilbert analytic factorization
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves models for the propagation
of waves of various sorts. In particular, the models are capable of making
predictions about the behavior of physical systems ranging in diversity from
optical fibers carrying high-intensity pulses of light to the ocean, where
contaminants can become trapped at the boundary between layers of fluids of
differing density. Our aim is to provide practical methods for accurately
approximating the solutions of these models so that their predictions can be
compared with experiments and ultimately used in place of expensive or invasive
experiments themselves. In particular, we note that in the wake of environmental
disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil leak of 2010, it becomes increasingly
important to have accurate and easy-to-use methods for predicting the location
of contaminants in the fluid column of the ocean.
