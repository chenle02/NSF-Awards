Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.
Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions
and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can
be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging
Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based
observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique
capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic
and extragalactic sources. This award provides funding to continue VERITAS
operations. During this time the Observatory will complete a program designed to
address themes in Particle Physics and Fundamental Laws, Black Holes, Cosmology,
and Galactic Particle Accelerators. This award will also support the VERITAS
collaboration efforts to engage the public in science. These include
collaboration with the Whipple Observatory Visitors Center to promote VERITAS
science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and the wider
community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter
atmospheric-Cherenkov Telescopes. VERITAS seeks both to identify new sources of
high energy gamma rays, and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to
better understand their underlying fundamental processes. The primary targets of
VERITAS Galactic observations are supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems,
and sources whose classification is unknown. The extragalactic targets observed
by VERITAS include active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, starburst galaxies,
galaxy clusters, globular clusters and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, Local
Group galaxies, the Galactic Center and dwarf spheroidal galaxies and are
targets of VERITAS observations focused on the indirect detection of cold dark
matter.
