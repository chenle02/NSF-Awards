The Delta File System is a high-performance Unix file system design which
supports both operating systems and database semantics using a threaded log. The
log records only meta information changes; file blocks are handled as in
traditional Unix file systems. The log enables implementation of atomicity at
the operating system level while increasing the performance of common file
system operations, such as the creation and deletion of files. A threaded log
enables very fine granularity of locking. The research consists of constructing
a new high- performance file system for Unix, and investigating the tradeoffs in
three related areas, performance, device independence, and fault tolerance. This
entails designing and implementing new file system algorithms, measuring their
performance and the properties of file systems, and clarifying the tradeoffs
between different techniques.
