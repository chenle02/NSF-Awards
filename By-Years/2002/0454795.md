Temple University's "Sisters in Science in the Community (SISCOM)" is a
constructivist-based, inclusive youth/community project targeting
underrepresented urban middle and high school girls in grades 6-10 and their
families; it supports inclusion of girls with disabilities. It engages girls and
their parents in hands-on, inquiry-based sports science in after-school,
Saturday, and summer programs co-hosted by community-based organizations and
Temple University. Girls will also be engaged in student-centered research
projects guided by female scientists. With regard to intellectual merit, SISCOM
is based on previous research done by Temple on methods for engaging girls and
their parents in STEM activities. The infrastructure of research and practices
in education will be facilitated through the sharing of information between the
network of partners and the national community of formal and informal educators
