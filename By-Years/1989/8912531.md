The history of climate change in the southern hemisphere is largely unknown
because we do not know with certainty the nature of the changes which occurred
or the timing of the events. This proposal requests support to address these
deficiencies. The principal goals of the project are to determine: 1) the nature
of climatic conditions associated with the deflation of Patagonia and the
associated high dust content of the atmosphere during the interval 30,000 to
12,000 years ago; 2) the nature of the glacial-to-interglacial transition at
about 12,000 years ago, including the presence or absence of the Younger Dryas
cooling event in the southern hemisphere; and 3) whether century-scale climatic
changes known to have occurred in the northern hemisphere can be correlated with
events in the southern hemisphere. The PI will use a novel, geomorphologic
approach to address these problems. This research is important because it will
provide records of climate change in a region where our understanding is
severely limited.
