The University of Florida is awarded a grant for the development of BioCorder.
The primary goal of the BioCorder project is to develop an information
technology framework and infrastructure that facilitates the discovery, access,
integration, and analysis of distributed phylogenetic and biodiversity data.
BioCorder will also link these distributed data resources to locally stored
specimen-based data, which will allow biodiversity researchers to manage data in
a structured workflow environment and answer complex research questions that
were once intractable. BioCorder will allow the user to track specimens even
before they are collected via a project manager that includes target lists for
collecting purposes. As specimens are acquired, they are easily tracked through
the database as tasks are performed such as producing DNA extracts, PCR
products, DNA sequences, etc. The local and distributed information in BioCorder
can be queried from a common user interface that contains both simple search
capabilities (Google-like searches) as well as complex, multilayered searches.
The development of this toolkit will facilitate the training of undergraduates,
graduate students, and technicians, each of whom is likely to seek employment in
bioinformatics. BioCorder will also enhance the already cohesive research
programs of louse biologists. The use of web services for biological data will
demonstrate this technology to other researchers and provide an illustration
regarding its development and implementation for biological data.
