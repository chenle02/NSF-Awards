This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Michael Cusanovich, Department of Biochemistry and Vice
President for Research, University of Arizona, and Professor Hideo Akutsu,
Department of Physical Chemistry, Yokohama National University. The project is a
multidisciplinary approach to elucidating in molecular terms the properties of
cytochromes c3 in order to understand its unique electrical properties. A major
goal will be to use studies on electron transfer in solution to understand the
electrical properties of cytochrome c3 adsorbed on metal substrates and in
films. New insights into intramolecular electron transfer will be obtained. It
is anticipated that these studies will develop possible applications of
cytochrome c3 as a bioelectronic device. In this collaboration, the U.S. group,
which also includes Professor G.S. Wilson of the University of Kansas and
Professor Therese Cotton of Iowa State University, will focus on the solution
properties of cytochrome c3 (redox and ligand binding kinetics), site-directed
mutagenesis, electrochemical characterization of the c- type cytochromes on
electrode surfaces and in films and SERS studies of orientation of cytochromes
on solid surfaces. The Japanese group will measure microscopic and macroscopic
redox potentials, the properties of c-type cytochromes adsorbed on electrodes,
site-directed mutagenesis, NMR analysis and x-ray crystallography of cytochromes
c3.
