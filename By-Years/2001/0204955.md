This effort will provide more accurate measurement of our Sun's spectral output
in the range 360 to 1100 nm. This will be done by deploying a state-of-the-art
CCD-array solar spectrograph to a high altitude favorable site (either Mauna Loa
or Mauna Kea), as part of a self-contained autonomous system. Calibration will
be carried out using a monochromator and absolute photodiode "trap detectors."
Data will be reduced using Langley extrapolation (and in the stronger absorption
bands methods similar to Reagan-Brugge fitting), to yield the solar output free
of atmospheric absorption.
