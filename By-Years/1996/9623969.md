9623969 Ewel Nutrient use efficiency in simplified tropical ecosystems. The
efficiency with which plants use nutrients is a theme that unites physiological
processes at many scales - from leaves, to plants, to whole ecosystems. Can
differences in nutrient use efficiency at the leaf and plant level be scaled up
to predict nutrient use efficiency at the ecosystem level? Nutrient use
efficiency will be ilvestigated at different scales in a series of simplified
tropical ecosystems: tree monocultures, and polycultures of trees and a very
different life form - large, perennial monocots. Nutrient use efficiency will be
calculated at the leaf level, as the maximum potential photosynthetic rate per
unit nutrient content; at the plant level, as total biomass produced relative to
nutrient uptake; and at the ecosystem level, as biomass production relative to
nutrient supply. The study will provide an opportunity to compare nutrient use
efficiency across scales, and across life forms. Understanding feedbacks between
nutrient use efficiency at the leaf and plant level, and ecosystem nutrient use,
will provide insight into the functional role of biodiversity. It will also
provide a powerful tool in enabling restoration of degraded lands, and design of
land use systems that are effective at nutrient conservation.
