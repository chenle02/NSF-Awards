9321412 JACKSON One of the central concerns of urban planning is to direct and
control private investment into communities, in part through zoning and land-use
regulations. Public land planning, along with federal housing programs such as
government mortgage insurance, increased the homeownership rate and helped
create middle class American suburbs, but they did not prevent and may have
exacerbated the decline of many inner-city areas. This proposal seeks to
describe the impact of urban planning efforts on private mortgage lending
practices in inner-cities. The project will examine inner-city community
development lending by private financial institutions since the urban riots of
the 1960s. It will use six case studies to address two questions: 1) how can
financial institutions change economic and social conditions in low- and
moderate-income urban neighborhoods?, and 2) what are the implications for urban
planning, public policy, and theories about the growth and decline of cities and
neighborhoods? The PI will review both relevant public documents and financial
and and economic data on specific residential, commercial real estate and
business projects, in addition to conducting interviews with those involved in
urban planning in these areas. ***
