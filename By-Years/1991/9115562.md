Adult body size in marine zooplankton varies with season and latitude. Larger
body sizes are associated with colder seasons and higher latitudes. Since warmer
environments and seasons also tend to process less prey, the interaction of food
and temperature may have important influences on body size. Because body size
affects all aspects of an individual's ecology, explanations of body size must
consider it a possible life history adaptation to a changing environments in
ways that are not yet well understood. This project will begin the development
of a set of size-classified population models, and use them to predict optimal
body size patterns on the basis of maximization of individual fitness. The
models will incorporate size-specific growth, mortality, and fecundity rates and
the responses of those rates to temperature and food. Models will be
parameterized based on information in the literature. The resulting models will
be simulated in the context of seasonally varying temperature and food signals,
to see how the optimal life history responses affect population dynamics.
