The objectives of this work are to: 1) determine the three dimensional structure
of the 16S rRNA at the mRNA decoding site and in the tRNA binding sites in
active 30S subunits. 2) determine whether tRNA binding induces three dimensional
structural changes in the 16S rRNA. 3) determine how the native structure is
altered by mutations in 16S rRNA that produce 30S subunits that are not able to
bind tRNA as well as the wild type sequence. 4) determine the path of the mRNA
through the ribosome during translation. The structural analysis will be done
primarily with a site directed photoaffinity agent placed at a series of
specific sites in the 16S rRNA. Psoralen and UV crosslinking will also be used
to monitor the overall configuration of the 16S rRNA. These experiments will
provide new information about the three dimensional configuration of the RNA
segments close to the decoding site at greater resolution than is presently
available and will also provide a sensitive method to detect structural changes.
It is expected that this information will help clarify the mode of the action of
the 30S subunit during tRNA binding and protein synthesis.
