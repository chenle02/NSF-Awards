In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor John Fourkas of the
University of Maryland College Park and his graduate student researchers are
doing experimental and computational studies to probe the dynamics of molecular
liquids in nano-confinement and under negative pressure. Despite the importance
of liquids as solvents in important chemical processes, there is a great deal
that is still unknown about liquid behavior in confined and other unusual
environments being studied in the present work. Graduate students working on
this project receive excellent training in experimental physical chemistry. This
project benefits from the collaboration with Dr. Benoit Coasne, a computational
chemist at CNRS (France) and MIT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Fourkas and his
research group are conducting a series of experimental and modeling studies of
the behavior of molecular liquids in nano-confined environments and under
tension. The experiments to be carried out include: (1) optical Kerr effect
(OKE) spectroscopy and (2) vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG)
spectroscopy. The Fourkas group researchers will use these methods to probe the
local liquid density via the reduced spectral density. Liquids will be confined
in nanoporous silica and stretched liquids will be prepared in Berthelot tubes.
Liquids to be studied include benzene, pyridine, acetonitrile and 2-butene.
Liquids in environments like those studied here are ubiquitous, but remain
poorly understood, and work like that supported in this study will help to shed
light on the molecular behavior that governs the liquid behavior. Students
working on this project receive excellent training in chemical physics that
prepares them to become globally-engaged members of the technical workforce.
