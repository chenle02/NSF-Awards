Proposal Title: PECASE: Intersection Theory On Moduli Spaces Institution:
Stanford University Proposal ID: 0238532

Complicated geometric objects often have a great deal of subtle structure.
``Moduli spaces'' for these objects in some sense capture this structure in a
nice package. Properties of moduli spaces are ``universal facts'' about the
objects in question. Ideas behind moduli spaces are quite old, dating back to
the nineteenth century (at least). In the last thirty years, we have learned a
powerful way of studying moduli spaces, thanks to the insights of Grothendieck's
school. The last decade has opened up powerful new ways of understanding these
spaces. Surprisingly, the impetus often came from other fields, such as
theoretical physics or combinatorics. This proposal seeks to approach many
pressing problems using techniques from algebraic geometry, highly motivated by
insights from other fields. The results in turn should have strong applications
in other fields. The investigator also seeks to attract talented high school and
undergraduate students into the mathematical sciences, by exposing them to
exciting and advanced yet accessible ideas, for example through problem solving;
this will be done primarily through the Stanford University Math Camp, a problem
solving seminar at Stanford, the Berkeley Math Circle, and various writings. In
particular, the goal is to attract students from previously untapped pools of
talent. Second, at the graduate level, the investigator will build a center for
algebraic geometry at Stanford, by providing resources for graduate students and
postdoctoral students, developing new courses, inviting visitors, and sponsoring
seminars and conferences, often jointly with other institutions. Third, the
investigator will continue to bring sophisticated mathematical ideas (of all
levels) to a wider audience through expository writing. The investigator is an
algebraic geometer whose primary interest is in intersection theory on moduli
spaces. The investigator's goal is to approach many open and classical questions
in geometry and related fields using both insights from other fields and modern
machinery. The investigator proposes to broaden and deepen his research, by
undertaking two longer-term projects, dealing with two of the most important
moduli spaces in mathematics: the moduli space of curves, and the Grassmannian
and its generalizations. The first project will use modern techniques to
illuminate the conjectural and known combinatorial structure behind the
``geometrically natural'' part of the cohomology (or Chow) ring of moduli space
of curves (the ``tautological ring''). The second project will use algebro-
geometric ideas to solve classical open questions about the structure
(algebraic, arithmetic, geometric, enumerative, and more) behind Littlewood-
Richardson rules, Schubert problems, and generalizations to other groups. The
first project relates to physics, topology, combinatorics, integrable systems,
and symplectic geometry; the second involves combinatorics, representation
theory, and arithmetic geometry. Thus both will involve developing a base of
knowledge in a broad array of different fields, as well as lifelong working
relationships and collaborations with researchers in these fields.

This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a
Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in
September 2004.
