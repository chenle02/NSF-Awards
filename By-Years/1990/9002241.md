This grant will enable the National Action Council for minorities in Engineering
(NACME) to develop proposals for four major projects critical to the effort to
broaden minority participation in engineering. These four projects are: (1)
development of a set of evaluation instruments for assessing precollege program
components and their impact on student progress; (2) development of workshops
for engineering deans and faculty, focused on managing cultural diversity in the
university environment; (3) development of a research agenda to study minority
student attrition, based on an analysis of existing NACME data on dropouts; and
(4) development of a community college articulation program proposal, targeted
at minority students in high schools and two-year institutions.
