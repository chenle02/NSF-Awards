Many methods currently exist for determining the response of dynamic systems.
However, most have shortcomings and cannot be used to understand systems with
strong nonlinearities, high noise intensity, or non-gaussian inputs.
Furthermore, time integration is time-consuming, provides no global information
on response, and has other difficulties as well. This project proposes a new
concept, Spectral Describing Functions, which may provide the solution to some
of these difficulties.
