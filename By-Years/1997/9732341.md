9732341 Gramila Penn State University will establish a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics department. Undergraduate students will
be recruited from the mid-atlantic states, with a recruitment focus on
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The students will be
involved in a wide range of physics research with emphasis in materials physics
and condensed matter physics. In addition, REU participants will be offered a
machine shop course and a computer simulation and data acquisition course. %%%
The REU site, with a regional focus whereby high quality undergraduates will be
recruited from the mid-atlantic states, and with an emphasis on minority
institutions, has potential impact on underrepresented sectors of the
undergraduate student population in physics. ***
