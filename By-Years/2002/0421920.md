Gas phase hydrogen peroxide is an important species within the odd-hydrogen
family of oxidants in the atmosphere, especially with regard to controlling
important hydroxyl radical levels and initiating heterogeneous aqueous phase
oxidation of sulfur dioxide in fog or cloud. These chemical reactions have
profound effects on atmospheric composition and Earth system climate. Currently
available methods for the detection of hydrogen peroxide at trace atmospheric
levels suffer from relatively slow temporal response. Through this project the
investigators will further develop and test the Atmospheric Pressure Ionization
Mass Spectrometry technique in the laboratory to make measurements of
atmospheric gas phase hydrogen peroxide at data rates and lower limit of
detection amenable to use on aircraft. Such a new fast-response measurement
capability would bring hydrogen peroxide measurements more into line with other
available fast response measurement techniques for odd-hydrogen species in the
atmosphere and in doing so generate new insights into a variety of important
atmospheric photochemical cycles. The broader impact of this project lies in
developing a technique application addressing a compelling need within the odd-
hydrogen measurement community, with results likely to have an important impact
on future atmospheric composition and climate change research. The project also
supports the professional development of an early-career postdoctoral
researcher.
