The State University of New York College at Fredonia sponsors the "Pathways of
Mathematics and Sciences Summer Project" for minority students annually from
three target schools. This five-week commuter project provides unique learning
experiences in mathematics and science to encourage students to continue the
study of math and science, to realize the importance of these subjects in their
everyday lives and appreciate that both are interesting and enjoyable. The
summer project has three modules: I) Knowing the Coursework; II) Knowing
Yourself; and III) Knowing the School System. The mathematics content includes
science content inlcudes ecology, environmental geology and mineralogy.
Instructional activities involve hands-on, independent study, intensive lab use,
work stations, and field trips. Problem solving, communication, reasoning, and
connection provide students with stimulating conditions for learning mathematics
and science. Community and institutional support are strong.
