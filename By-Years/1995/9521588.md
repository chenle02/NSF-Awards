9521588 Newell Recent research has revealed that the fungi are particularly
well adapted mechanically and physiologically for decomposition of dead material
from vascular plants. However, data concerning the accumulation of fungal mass
and fungal secondary productivity is available for only three small snapshots in
time and only the Georgia ocean edge. Almost all of the data are for the smooth
cordgrass, Spartina alternifloria. This research will obtain new data for two
predominant western Atlantic grasses, S.alternifloria and Juncus roemerianus as
it changes over many seasons within a multi-year period. Samples from three
Atlantic and one Gulf of Mexico saltmarsh will be analyzed each year permitting
determination of the latitudinal variation in saltmarsh fugal productivity. The
methods used in measuring fungal mass and productivity will liquid-
chromatographic quantification of ergosterol for mass and incorporation of
radiolabelled acetate into erogosterol for productivity. This study will lay the
foundation for coastal mycological ecology to be brought into the modern
microbial-ecological era and allow the testing of hypotheses regarding the
impact of saltmarsh fungi on nutrient dynamics. ***
