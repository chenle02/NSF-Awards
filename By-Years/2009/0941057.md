Computer Science (31)

Computer architectures have evolved greatly in recent years but these
innovations are not widely taught in introductory computer organization courses.
Existing simulators are used by researchers but do not meet the needs of
students. The simulator developed for this project models a full x86 machine and
includes modern architectural components including multicore, superscalar, two-
level cache and speculation. Students select components such as the pipeline or
memory to visualize how data are processed. Multiple levels of abstractions
allow student to ignore components that they are not ready to study. One can
also reconfigure the architecture components using a graphical user interface.

Expected outcomes include the simulator as a standalone application, a web
applet and a collection of laboratory exercises. Materials are designed to be
used within existing computer organization and architecture courses. The applet
can be accessed by any modern browser and thus allows adoption by a wide
audience. Pilot testing is being performed at American University, a small
liberal arts school, and the University of Maryland, a large public university.
