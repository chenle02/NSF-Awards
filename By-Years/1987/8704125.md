The objectives of the proposed research are (i) to obtain an extremely accurate
value for the non-relativistic ground-state energy of Li I; (ii) to calculate
the relativistic contributions to the ground state energy of Li I; (iii) to
combine the results of (i) and (ii) to obtain the absolute ground state Lamb
shift for Li I; (iv) to calculate other members of the Li I isoelectronic series
to determine the Z-dependent behavior of the ground state Lamb shift; and (v) to
extend the study to excited states so as to determine the Lamb shift
contribution to various spectral transitions. The proposed research will involve
undergraduates in all sections of the work except one. These students will be
exposed to ideas from the four areas of chemistry, physics, computer science,
and mathematics. The skills these students pick up, such as practical computer
programming, numerical analysis, optimization theory, and the general mechanics
of attacking and solving a research problem, provide an important asset for
postgraduate studies.
