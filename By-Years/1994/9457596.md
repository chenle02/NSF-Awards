9457596 Blanchet An NYI award will support research on the formation of high
temperature carbon solid lubricants directly on bearing surfaces from the
decomposition of carbonaceous gases. Process models incorporating kinetics and
thermodynamics of the processes will be developed and validated experimentally.
The feasibility of controlling the deposition process will be assessed. ***
