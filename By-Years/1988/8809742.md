This support is for research on advanced speech recognition algorithms
architectures, and experimentation in the Laboratory for Engineering Man/Machine
Systems (LEMS) at Brown University. As a basis for the facility of research, the
researchers use Armstrong, an 80-node loosely coupled distributed multiprocessor
system, and a hardware/software testbed composed of a linear array of
microphones for speech acquisition. Problems addressed include the investigation
of computationally efficient algorithms for time-dependent modeling of speech
analysis, study on new algorithms for real-time early-decision recognition of
connected speech, and research on fine-time resolution of hidden Markov and
neural-network representations of highly time-varying phonic events.
