This award supports the research in Analytic Number Theory of Professor Boris
Datskovsky of Temple University. His project is to investigate properties of
prehomogeneous vector spaces and zeta functions associated to them. These spaces
have permitted the attainment of new results on the density of discriminants of
cubic fields, as well as the density of class numbers for imaginary quadratic
fields. The field of Analytic Number Theory applies to the discrete realm of the
whole numbers the techniques of Analysis, dependent on the notions of continuity
and limit, originating in Calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to
investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern
analytic number theorists, the field has had a new rebirth.
