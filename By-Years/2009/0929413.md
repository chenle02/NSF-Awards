IOS-0929413&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Arabidopsis 2010: The ad/abaxial
regulatory network of Arabidopsis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In plants, the ad/abaxial
regulatory network governs some of the most basic elements of plant growth and
function. In the simple experimental plant Arabidopsis, this includes the
organization of the cells in the leaf necessary for efficient light capture and
gas exchange. This system also controls the formation of new branches. To date a
small set of transcription factors - proteins that regulate the activity of
genes - have been found to control this regulatory network. This project will
identify the genes that these factors control and will discover how these genes
act together in a network to result in the highly coordinated growth that occurs
in the plant. Understanding how the plant body is formed is fundamental to our
understanding of plants that we grow for food, fiber or fuel as well as to our
more general understanding of the natural environment. This understanding can be
used to improve our approaches to managing our agricultural and wild lands.
