Not only is big data voluminous, it is varied. Individual data analysis tasks
must first collect data sets that are often in unrelated locations and
frequently in vastly disparate formats. These data sets almost always need
multiple changes prior to the analysis task, such as format normalization, data
cleansing, type checking, and outlier detection. These "data integration"
activities typically consume an inordinate amount of time and effort both on the
part of the data analyst and on the part of the computing
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to design, prototype, and evaluate
an Application-Specific Instruction Processor (ASIP) that will support the
concurrent execution of data integration workloads for multiple streams of big
data. The ASIP will not only execute an individual integration stream, but will
be capable of concurrently executing a number of distinct data integration
streams (each with its own processing requirements), enabling data from
disparate sources to be utilized for analysis. Successful ASIP deployment will
substantially increase the throughput (and therefore effectiveness) of big data
analysis across a range of fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is unique about the
ASIP design is not just that the instruction set will be customized, but the
entire data path will be optimized for the data integration problem. Both very
long instruction word (VLIW) and vector techniques will be used to expose and
exploit parallelism. Complex transformations will be supported by a combination
of customized engines as well as hardware virtualization. The optimization for
data integration not only includes the computational data path, but explicit
attention will be paid to the memory subsystem design as well. The project will
include super-optimization of memory subsystems from individual applications to
the application class comprised of data integration
workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result should lead to dramatic improvements
in the overhead of preparing data for analysis.
