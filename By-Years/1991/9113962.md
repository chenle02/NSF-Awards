This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will provide necessary physical observations for description of the
dynamical processes contributing to the creation and maintenance of the polynya
as well as its water-mass structure. This element of the program will contribute
to the biological/chemical, mooring, and modelling efforts within the program.
