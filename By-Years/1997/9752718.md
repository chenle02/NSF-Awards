The impact of Two Year Colleges (TYCs) in the teaching of college level physics
is often not appreciated. This is particularly true for students who have been
historically at risk. Nationally 47% of all minority students are enrolled at
TYCs. Most of the students who are trained to enter the technological workplace
are trained at TYCs. Historically the opportunities for TYC faculty members to
participate in professional development have been limited. This two year program
is designed to serve as a continuing model for the utilization of cooperative
relationships between university professors and outstanding TYC physics faculty
members working together to provide professional enrichment opportunities for
TYC physics faculty members from across the United States. The program focuses
on the recent developments in physics research, innovative physics teaching
methods and successful techniques for recruiting local minority students into
two year college science and engineering programs. The program includes an
annual May Institute at Texas A&amp;M University, biannual academic year follow-
up workshops, local projects and staff visits to the 18 participants from across
the United States.
