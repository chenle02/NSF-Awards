The objectives of this research are to understand the structures and properties
of muonium defect centers in semiconductors. In turn this will provide a
complementary picture of hydrogen in semiconductors, a common impurity which is
difficult to study in unreacted form. The study of muonium permits us to learn
about a variety of deep-level defect properties, such as metastability and
bistability, local and long-range tunneling, carrier trapping, and pairing
reactions. These topics are of considerable scientific and technological
interest but are poorly understood. The powerful methods of muon spectroscopy
together with the frequent occurrence of muonium centers makes this a powerful
approach to these problems. %%% The research uses a sophisticated technique
(involving a short- lived sub-atomic particle and its interactions with its
surroundings) to probe the properties of defects in semiconductors. These
defects are important determinants of the semiconductor properties and affect
performance such as solar-cell efficiency. These topics are of considerable
scientific and technological interest but are poorly understood.
