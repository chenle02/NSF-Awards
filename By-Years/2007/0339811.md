This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project introduces an
innovative gas sensor technology for the remote inspection/monitoring of gas
leaks along a gas distribution system. The micro-miniature sensor is a highly
engineered instrument based on a proprietary infrared technology using optical
and acoustic (opto-acoustic) effects. As an alternative to costly and labor-
intensive inspections, the sensor could be deployed for unattended operation in
remote gas distribution nodes, e.g. pressure regulator stations, providing
round-the-clock, high-speed measurement and notification in real time, a new
control technique between the field and utilities control centers. The sensor's
round-the-clock monitoring and real-time notification should give the ability to
locate and repair gas leaks in a timely manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this project is to develop and commercialize the gas sensor to monitor gas leaks
in gas compressor, field compressor, pressure regulator and city gate stations,
the major sources of gas leak along the distribution network. Target customers
are gas transmission and distribution companies, but also Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEM) serving the oil &amp; gas industry. The objective of this
SBIR Phase I project is to build and test a gas sensor prototype to prove the
technical and economic feasibility of the opto-acoustic concept and the new
features contributing to improved performance.
