The chromosomes of primates have been studied for several decades, but the
results of these studies have, for the most part, not been significant for
anthropologists. Marks proposes to utilize the newest techniques of chromosomal
analysis to examine patterns of morphological variation in the chromosomes of
apes and humans, to interpret their interrelationships, and to test hypotheses
concerning the rates and modes of chromosomal change in the higher primates. The
techniques to be used include blood cell culturing, synchronized lymphocyte
culturing, G- banding, C-banding, Q-banding, and in situ hybridization.
