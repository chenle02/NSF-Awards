9403891 Hempel The key to the operation of university research Centers that
interact with industry in a collaborative mechanism is the formulation and
implementation of an industrially relevant research program. There have been no
reported studies on the discussion process Center directors use in making the
selection of projects for a Center's research program. This study will: 1)
investigate and document methods used by successful directors for prioritization
of Center research projects; 2) investigate the heuristics employed by industry
members of Centers; and 3) examine the importance of timing of project inputs
and outputs to industry members in their selection process. The Principal
Investigator is well qualified to perform this study. The Program Manager
recommends the University of Connecticut be awarded $53,752 for eleven months
for this project.
