Funding is provided for a proof of concept project to determine the feasibility
of adapting LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) technique for operation
from a deep submergence vehicle in the ocean, with potential application to
hydrothermal vent systems at mid-ocean ridges. A state-of-the-art ICCD
spectrometer will be purchased and high pressure measurements of candidate
hydrothermal vent materials in liquid phase will be analyzed. A major product of
the proposed work will be characterization of LIBS at high pressure in the
laboratory, from which important instrumental parameters, in situ calibration
standards, and fundamental information about LIBS plasmas can be derived. They
proposed to test, validate, and document the suitability of the LIBS system for
operation from a deep submergence vehicle.
