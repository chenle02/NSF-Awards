This research addresses the impact of natural enemies and host plant variation
on the population dynamics and success of a leaf mining herbivore Phytomyza
ilicicola which specializes on American holly. The study is explicitly designed
to test the idea that the first (host plant) and third (natural enemies) trophic
levels interact to influence herbivore dynamics which can not be understood
without simultaneous consideration of both aspects. Preliminary work has shown
that leaf miner densities, survivorship, and oviposition preferences show
consistent differences among trees, and between suburban and forest understory
habitats. These differences provide in effect a natural experiment for testing
the impact of enemies and host nutrition on herbivore success. The research
effort will focus on four interrelated facets of the problem: 1) host plant
quality, specifically variation among trees as resources; 2) density and
survivorship responses of herbivores to resource variation among trees, and the
mutual impact of resource variation and miner demic variation on oviposition
response; 3) the direct influence of natural enemies and the interaction of
natural enemies and resources on herbivore success; 4) and the relative
influence of genetics, environment, and their interaction on host quality
variation. Together, these aspects of the study will help to resolve some
uncertainties in our standing of plant/herbivore interactions and may aid in the
development of biocontrol strategies in forestry and agriculture.
