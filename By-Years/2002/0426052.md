This award supports a symposium series in Applied Physics/Engineering, mainly
Materials Engineering, to be held at the 2004 ands 2005 meetings of the Society
for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) in
Austin and Denver, respectively. The symposium series is sponsored by the
National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP). The symposium seeks to introduce
undergraduate students attending the SACNAS meeting to the field of applied
physics/engineering and related sciences, including graduate education and
professional opportunities in the field. The symposium series encourages
underrepresented minority undergraduates to pursue further studies in
engineering and the physical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
