Landing proposes to investigate trace metal redox cycling and metal-sulfide
precipitation processes in the water column and sedimenta of the Black Sea as
part of an interdisciplinary program to study the physical, biological, and
chemical oceanography of the Black Sea. Since the last US expedition to the
Black Sea focusing on trace metals in l969 contamination control during the
collection and handling of trace metal samples has been greatly improved. Work
in other suboxic and anoxic environments has demonstrated the redox cycling of
Cr, Mn, and Fe and its effects on the distributions of other particle-reactive
trace metals and radionuclides. Class-B metals exhibit solubility and sediment
enrichment patterns due to metal sulfide precipitation processes. Landing plans
to collect water column trace metal samples for the selective analysis of
Cr(III), Cr(VI), Mn(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(I), Cu(II), Zn(II),
Cd(II), and Pb(II) and to quantify their distributions among particulate,
colloidal, organically-complexed, and "free" solution forms. Pore-waters will be
collected to relate water column depletions of class-B metals to their sediment
enrichment patterns. Particulate samples (suspended, sediment trap, and
sediment) will be analyzed using a series of selective leaching treatments to
quantify metal association with organic, osyhydroxide, sulfidic, and refractory
phases. The data will be used to develop quantitative models describing trace
metal redox cycling across the oxic/suboxic/anoxic transition zone in the water
column, incorporating physical mixing and microbiological transformation rates
in cooperation with other participants in the project.//
