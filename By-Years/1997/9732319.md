The meshfree particle methods are further developed from an algorithmic
viewpoint so that they are robust, accurate, and possess multiscale,
multiphysics capabilities. Through the multiscale techniques developed, new
models for crack formation and dynamic crack propagation are obtained that are
based on combinations of atomistic and lattice models. Since many of the
properties on the atomistic and microscale can be related to materials
processing, fracture properties are identified in terms of materials processing.
The models are studied and validated through previously published and ongoing
experiments.
