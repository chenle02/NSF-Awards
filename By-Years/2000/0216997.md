This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will study the use of MEMS
devices as distributed and embedded sensors for highway material monitoring.
MEMS sensors and telemetry systems will be put on a chip (0.5-in in diameter)
and will be embedded into concrete and act as distributed sensors. The position
of each individual smart aggregate in the concrete over time will be monitored
remotely using radio frequency (RF). Each chip will contain different sensors to
monitor concrete compaction quality, concrete stress distribution, concrete
damage, moisture, temperature, chloride and sulfate concentrations, concrete
curing and traffic history as well as telemetry and long-life powering systems.
To the Principal Investigator's (PI) knowledge, the use of MEMS devices as
wireless and as integrated sensing method for highway material monitoring has
not yet been explored. In the first phase of this research, MEMS sensors for
temperatures, chloride, stress and traffic flow monitoring will be embedded into
concrete specimens to evaluate their responses under different test conditions
and evaluate their durability during concrete curing. If successful, wireless
monitoring techniques, including telemetry and long-life powering systems will
be developed. The SGER is appropriate for this work because of its novelty, and
because this work has elements of risk in that the MEMS sensing technique may
not be well- suited for concrete materials because the MEMS sensors may not
survive during the concrete curing, or the possibility that unforseen
difficulties with such a sensing technique may arise. This resesearch will allow
the PI to quickly evaluate the concept of embedding MEMS sensors into the
concrete.
