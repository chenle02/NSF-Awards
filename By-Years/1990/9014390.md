Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes in the surface layers of the sun are of
great interest because, first, these phenomena are largely responsible for solar
activity; second, they challenge our theoretical understanding of the basic
physics underlying these processes; and third, predictions of theoretical
calculations can be subjected to direct observational test. This work focusses
on a study of overstable modes in the surface layers of the sun; including (1)
the excitation of acoustic waves in the solar convection zone and photosphere,
(2) the concentration of solar acoustic oscillation power in certain temporal
and spatial ranges, and (3) the excitation of MHD waves in thermally and
gravitationally stratified photospheric magnetic flux tubes (such as sunspots).
The work involves both analytical studies and numerical simulations. ***
