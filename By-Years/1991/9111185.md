Animals frequently respond to changes in environmental conditions by altering
their behavior. This common observation has led to the hypothesis that behavior
evolves first, prior to changes in underlying aspects of morphology, physiology,
or biochemistry. Artificial selection experiments will be used to test this
hypothesis with respect to voluntary wheel-running behavior of randombred
laboratory mice. Replicated within-family selection on amount of wheel-running
during the 5th and 6th days of exposure to activity wheels will be used to
produce two high- and two low-selected lines, while maintaining two unselected
control lines, each of 10-12 breeding pairs. As lines diverge genetically in
wheel-running behavior, they will be compared with regard to a series of
possibly correlated locomotor behaviors as well as physiological characteristics
that are hypothesized to partly determine capacities for sustained locomotor
activity. Possibly correlated behaviors to be tested include several components
of open-field activity, maximal sprint running speed, and swimming endurance.
Physiological traits to be measured include maximal (VO2max) and basal (BMR)
rates of oxygen consumption, hematocrit and blood hemoglobin content, thyroid
hormone levels, heart, gastrocnemius muscle, and liver masses, and key indicator
enzymes for both aerobic (oxidative) and anaerobic glycolytic capacities at the
cellular level. Correlated responses to selection will allow quantification of
genetic correlations between behaviors and between behavior and physiology.
Results will have significance for the understanding of animal and human
behavior, genetics, evolution, and physiology, including the interrelationships
of health and well- being, voluntary activity patterns, and innate exercise
capacities.
