This proposal would develop WHREN (Western Hemisphere Research and Education
Networks) to address the existing and future needs for improved North American
(especially U.S.)-South American connectivity. This proposal specifically
focuses on the need for connectivity through new links, LILA (Links
Interconnecting Latin America).

The goal of the WHREN project is interconnecting North America to emerging
aggregation points in South America, and evolving the connections, resources and
economies. By providing a hybrid of network resources to support high
performance computing and networking services between North America and South
America, a robust, fault-tolerant, high-capacity set of interconnections should
ensure superior networking infrastructure support for e-science across the two
continents over the next five years.
