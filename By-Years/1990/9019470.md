The objective of the proposed research is to define a theoretical framework for
logic-based geometric spatial reasoning and to develop models to support the
framework. A theoretical framework will formalize the relation and will find use
in several applications such as the integration of computer-aided design and
manufacturing, automatic interpretation of non-invasive solid scanning
technologies, and three-dimensional pattern recognition. The approach for the
proposed research will involve the consideration of extant solid modelling
paradigms and their geometric entities, the description and modelling of these
entities in logical form, the development of the theoretical framework and
supporting proofs and example models. The logic-based geometric spatial
reasoning in hardwood log processing will be used as a primary illustration,
though other applications will also be considered.
