Plant species characterized by short-distance dispersal (e.g. ant-dispersed
species) are&lt;br/&gt;hypothesized to be absent from suitable habitat due to
dispersal limitation while species characterized by long-distance dispersal
(e.g. bird-dispersed species) are often present in unsuitable (sink) habitat due
to frequent re-colonization and rescue. These two hypotheses are being tested in
a study of the demography and distribution of six forest-understory herb species
in a region extending from the lower Piedmont of Georgia to the upper elevations
of the Blue Ridge. Among the goals of the study are 1) to develop a rigorous
method of delineating suitable habitat by measuring the demographic response of
each species to environmental variation, with particular emphasis on responses
to soil moisture and light availability, and 2) to use this methodology to test
hypotheses about how habitat suitability, demography, and dispersal interact to
influence species distributions. In addition to continuing to follow the
demography of approximately 15,000 marked individuals, the proposed research
will test hypotheses specific to the biology of each of the six study species.
The proposed research will help understand and evaluate the impact of climate
and land-use change on biological diversity. A detailed knowledge of factors
controlling the distribution of the study species will help policy analysts
evaluate the potential negative impacts of global change and help resource
managers better protect threatened species in times of global change. Graduate
and undergraduate students will participate actively in all aspects of the
research, gaining experience in experimental design, demographic studies, data
management, statistical analysis, and preparation of results for presentations
and publication.&lt;br/&gt;
