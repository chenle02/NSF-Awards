This project will enable Dr Kathlyn Parker to advance her career by being a
resident scholar in the Molecular and Cell Biology Program at Brown University.
She will engage in a program of advanced study on ribosome function. The purpose
is to invent new approaches to the chemistry of molecular biology. Dr. Parker is
a recognized leader in Synthetic Organic Chemistry. Experience in molecular
biology will help focus her future research on important problems at the
interface of chemistry and biology. %%% This proposal builds a research program
in the chmistry of moleular biology by a person who is a recognized expert in
the synthesis of organic molecules. It will help to develop her career in an
area with large potential impacts on human health and metabolism.
