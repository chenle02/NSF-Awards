Increasingly, fewer people are managing more land under tighter resource
restrictions. Water and labor top the list of constrained resources, but growers
also face more demands on their time, more complex operations, and more
uncertain weather. Most generally, growers hire consultants to frequently check
fields and make decisions. Increasingly, these consultants rely on sensor data
to prioritize which fields to visit. There exists hardware for measuring weather
and soil moisture, for example to schedule irrigation, and some of this hardware
has the capability of offloading data to a cloud database for users to view.
Hardware companies are often focused on selling a single sensor - such as soil
moisture - rather than providing a complete solution to all a grower?s decision-
making needs. The proposed innovation synthesizes in-field sensor data with
satellite remote sensing and weather forecasts to provide alerts, notices, and
advice on upcoming jobs to do. Because the proposed sensor hub is flexible, the
variety of decision support options is larger than its
competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed a low-cost
cellular-enabled pod (Pulsepod) that is 10x less expensive than comparable
products on the market. Pulsepod is a small, low-power, low-cost sensor platform
designed for global applications in the environmental sciences. A variety of
self-describing sensors can be plugged into the main hub to address a variety of
questions, generally focused on the responses of plants to their environment.
Data is transmitted over cellular, wifi, or even satellite networks onto a
cloud-based software platform to allow real-time remote decision support.
Existing technologies are expensive, hard to use, and not well integrated to the
internet. By contrast, Pulsepod is economical, easy to use, and explicitly
designed to get data onto the cloud.
