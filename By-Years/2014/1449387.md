Present methods for underwater communication involve fiber optics, acoustics,
induction modems, or more recently, high-powered optical links. Although fiber
optics provides high bandwidths, they are expensive, bulky, difficult to
maneuver &amp; deploy. Furthermore, wired networks require a connection to some
central, powered entity which is only available in a boat or on-shore. This is
not ideal for deep- ocean or prolonged underwater operations. Wireless acoustics
are suitable for low-bandwidth applications, but they are not able to form large
networks as the channel capacity is relatively limited. In addition, acoustics
have been shown to be intrusive to the surrounding ecosystem. In this proposal,
the team proposes the Optical Modem Module (OMM) wireless underwater
telecommunications device that allows for high-speed, low power communication in
a distributed underwater network. The OMM can operate free of any cabling,
communicating for well over a year with a standard deep-sea
battery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OMM technology is positioned to meet a market
void in high speed serial data transfer in low cost links and dense networks
used in sub-mesoscale monitoring (&lt;1 km area) application. The OMM has
gathered significant interest from ocean science, industry, and defense. This
underwater optical network technology has gathered interest from oil &amp; gas
industries such as BP and ExxonMobil, ocean science organizations such as the
Schmidt Ocean Institute and the Ocean Observatories Initiative, oceanic system
integrators such as MacArtney and McLane, and defense contractors including BAE
Systems and L3 Communications. The demonstration product and market research
will quantify the ocean science community's need to communicate using low-power
over a secure channel at high speeds underwater, interfacing with existing
infrastructure such as sensors or moorings to other mobile or floating
platforms.
