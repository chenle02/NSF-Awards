Recent developments in geological sciences and the growing job market in
hydrogeology and geological engineering have demanded better training in
geophysical instrumentation at the undergraduate level. Two geology courses,
Field Geology and Geophysics are being improved by the addition of geophysical
field equipment, in particular a gravity meter and a proton magnetometer as well
as a portable PC. Geophysical projects are being developed for a field camp, and
about 1/3 of the lectures in Geophysics are being replaced by a field laboratory
program, which provides students with hands-on experience with geophysical
instruments and enhances their knowledge of geophysical methods. Other courses
that benefit from the equipment are plate tectonics, geological engineering,
structural geology, and independent projects. The university will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
