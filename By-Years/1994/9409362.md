Project Summary Hickman/ATM-9409362 This project will involve theoretical
calculations of the scattering of ionic and neutral atomic oxygen, one of the
most important collision processes in the upper atmosphere. The coupling between
O+ and O (a collision frequency) plays a crucial role in models of global
atmospheric wind circulation and in determining the ion density in the
ionosphere. There is a current discrepancy between calculated values of this
collision frequency and values inferred from aeronomic experiments. All previous
calculations of the frequency have ignored the fine-structure splitting of
atomic oxygen as well as spin-orbit and rotational coupling between the states
of O+2 during the collision. These effects are significant and may be large
enough to remove the discrepancy.
