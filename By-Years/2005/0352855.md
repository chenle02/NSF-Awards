AST-0352855 -- Stacey, Cornell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the
history of star formation in the Universe from about 2 billion years after the
big bang to the present by observing extinction-free tracers of star formation
in dusty distant galaxies. The redshift (Z) and Early Universe Spectrometer
(ZEUS) will be the most sensitive spectrometer for extragalactic point source
spectroscopy in the submillimeter bands. The instrument will be used to
investigate star formation in the early Universe by measuring redshifted far-
infrared spectral lines; to measure redshifts of optically obscured distant
sources; and to study the neutral interstellar medium in ultraluminous Infrared
Astronomical Satellite galaxies. Undergraduate and graduate students will be
involved in the design and development of the instrument, helping to train the
next generation of "hands-on" scientists and engineers.
