9314587 MOORE This research project will use short lived radium isotopes to
determine the ages of freshened waters as these waters move and mix from the
coastal zone into the open ocean. These techniques should enable marine
scientists to tract the movement and mixing of coastal waters on time scales of
a few days to several weeks. These studies will provide important information on
the coupling between the coastal ocean and the ocean and the ocean interior.
When combined with other studies, these techniques will enable oceanographers to
assess fluxes of materials across the density gradient separating freshened
coastal waters from the rest of the surface ocean. This work is based on a new
measurement technique for short lived Ra isotopes, 224 Ra (half life = 3.6 days)
and 223 Ra (half life = 11.4 days). Most of the effort will be devoted to
technique development and verification initially. Field Studies will then
determine (1) the rate at which the freshened river plume of the Mississippi
River intrudes into the Gulf of Mexico and (2) the rate of mixing from near
coastal waters across the inner and mid shelf region of the south Atlantic
Bight.
