9505530 Zworski The proposed research lies in the general area of spectral and
scattering theory. More specifically, the proposer wants to investigate
distribution of resonances and geometric properties of the scattering matrix.
This research deals with a class of differential equations arising in solid
state physics and scattering phenomena by convex obstacles. The investigator
seeks to lay a mathematical foundation for scattering phenomena and to consider
more sophisticated scattering problems, say scattering on finite volume
hyperbolic surfaces.
