The seismic processing software currently in use at Lamont- Doherty Geological
Observatory utilizes a mini-computer. The use of a mini-computer limits the
seismic processing capability due to memory and speed requirements. This project
will modify the software so that seismic processing can be done on a
supercomputer. LDGO will be able to do processing techniques not now available
to them and will provide the opportunity to use a supercomputer for some of the
data intensive portions of the processing.
