The US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study US JGOFS seeks to understand the processes
governing the production and fate of biogenic material in the sea well enough to
predict their influences on, and responses to global scale perturbations. This
will be done by identifying and quantifying the physical, chemical and
biological processes controlling biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, and their
interaction with the global atmosphere. The implicit assumption of this strategy
for achieving a predictive capability is that the processes and interactions
quantified today respond linearly to global scale perturbations and that
knowledge of the present biogeochemical system dynamics will, therefore, allow
us to predict response to global perturbations with accuracy. This is a
fundamental assumption and is the keystone of the JGOFS strategy for predictive
capability. The scientific justification for this assumption has never been
stated and the object of this work is to verify this assumption.
