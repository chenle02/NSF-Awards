9416014 Duda The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an
oceanographic technology project to design, construct, and test a new type of
deep ocean shearmeter drifter. The measurement of shear (the vertical gradient
of horizontal velocity) in the deep ocean is scientifically important, but has
always been difficult and expensive using existing technologies. The 10 m-long
drifters will be simple in design, will have no moving parts, and will convert
shear to a measurable signal via their dynamics. They will be able to measure
shear at a 10 meter vertical separation while deployed at depths up to 5 km. In
addition, the drifters will be able to remain deployed for up to a year. They
will consist of a rotating vertical cylinder driven by flow past vanes at either
end. The rigidly mounted vanes will provide dynamic interaction with the moving
water. The inclination of the long cylinder, as the result of shear, will be
measured by a sensitive on board tiltmeter and related to shear direction and
intensity. Prototype testing will be done in test tanks and at a test facility
in Seneca Lake, N.Y.
