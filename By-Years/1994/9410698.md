9410698 Bringi The objective of this research is the analysis and interpretation
of two (Florida) thunderstorms observed during CaPE observations of radar
reflectivity polarization, doppler winds, microphysical structure (from
aircraft) and surface electric field will be used to obtain coherent
representation of the initiation and evolution of these thunder-storms. These
interpretations will be guided by the use of a numerical cloud model to help
resolve some details of hydrometer growth, including likely options of charge
growth and separation. ***
