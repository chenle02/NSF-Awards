The principal investigator will study mineral-fluid interface geochemistry
utilizing atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopic and spectroscopic
techniques. The ability to actually "see" individual atoms at mineral interfaces
will likely to lead to a more fundamental understanding of mineral surfaces and
their reactivity, and ultimately will have a wide range of applications in the
earth and environmental sciences.
