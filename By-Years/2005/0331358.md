Proposal ID: AST-0243677&lt;br/&gt;Institution: AUI/National Radio Astronomy
Observatory&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hibbard, John&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Radio
Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) will continue their Summer Research Experience in
Astronomy for Undergraduates (REU) and Teachers (RET). Both students and
teachers will be recruited nationally. Each summer 18 undergraduate participants
will be placed at one of the four NRAO sites (Socorro, New Mexico; Green Bank,
West Virginia; Charlottesville, Virginia; and Tucson, Arizona) for a period of
10 to 12 weeks. Four teacher participants will be placed in either Socorro or
Green Bank for a period of eight weeks. During their appointment, the
participants will work with staff advisers on a project in the staff adviser's
area of expertise. Students and teachers alike will take part in a summer
lecture series introducing them to the fundamentals of radio astronomy and to
current topics in astronomical research. Teachers will also take part in teacher
workshops and participate in weekly educational sessions to develop classroom
activities which make use of their research experience at the NRAO. At the
conclusion of their appointment, participants will produce both an oral and
written report of their work, and will have the opportunity to present their
results at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society. During the
following school term, teachers will field-test their curricula and send
revisions to NRAO staff so that they can be disseminated to past and future RET
participants and teachers in other venues.&lt;br/&gt;
