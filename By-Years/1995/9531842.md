This grant supports investigations of nuclear structure and electromagnetic
moments by two Rutgers University faculty members who will carry out their
experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Yale
University, and elsewhere. They will study excitations at high spin and
excitation energy in heavy nuclei far from stability. The electromagnetic
moments of both light and heavy nuclei will be measured to determine the effect
of the neutron-proton interaction near the regions for which N/Z is near the
edges of nuclear stability.
