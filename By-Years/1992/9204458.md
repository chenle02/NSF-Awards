This project is for the continuation and extension of research on the structure
and dynamics of disordering in silicate liquids, glasses, and crystals, using
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The major objective of this work
is to better understand the fundamentals of the thermodynamic and transport
properties of disordered materials, particularly configurational entropy,
density, viscosity, and diffusivity, in order to more accurately extrapolate to
conditions of pressure, temperature, and time found in nature. NMR will be used
to study the local and intermediate range structure around geochemically
significant cations, and the anion O, in liquids at high temperature and in
their glassy equivalents. Particular attention will be paid to the effects of
temperature and pressure on coordination numbers of Si, Al, and O. Continue
studies of crystalline solids will be used to help calibrate and understand
observations in glasses and liquids.
