9321613 Tucker The Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook will establish a computational laboratory
to support research and graduate training in statistics. This proposal focuses
on the following five applied computational topics:1. Industrial Statistics:
Reliability, Speech Recognition, and Experimental Design. 2. Spatially
Stochastic Models for Geofluid Dynamics: Flow in Porous Media. 3. Normal Mixture
Problems in Biostatistics. 4. Nonparametric Models in Biostatistics:
Semiparametric Regression, Survival Statistics under Censorship, and DNA Spatial
Pattern Recognition. 5. Demography: Improved Measures of Fertility.
