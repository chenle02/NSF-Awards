Data-driven applications play an increasing role in peoples’ lives, underpinning
systems and services that collect broad personal information to provide novel
functionality and valuable insights. Machine learning techniques are
predominantly used to implement these applications, and developers have
published an array of libraries that make it easy for any programmer to benefit
from this technology. While excitement over these developments has led to
numerous positive contributions, it has also been accompanied by concerns around
the privacy of individuals’ data, and the potential for these systems to
discriminate against some individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims
to move ahead of these problems by exploring verification techniques for
uncovering instances of protected information use that lead to privacy loss and
discrimination. Inspired by recent advances that allow attribution of
predictions in machine learning models, we build on methods from software model
checking and optimization to locate components pivotal to these outcomes, and
construct data representations that aid in removing them. In parallel, we are
developing a deeper understanding of new types of software "bugs" that result in
such harms: bias amplification, which imperils fairness, and exploitable data
memorization, which introduces privacy risk. We aim to quantify the extent to
which existing techniques can prevent the occurrence of these bugs, and inform
the development of new ones that are specifically targeted at them. As this
project progresses, we are applying the results towards educating a diverse
workforce on data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and rigorous approaches to
constructing software that uses machine learning
effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
