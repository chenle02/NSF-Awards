People make rapid eye movements called saccades in order to examine the world
around them. The still periods between saccades are called fixations. It is well
known that vision is suppressed during saccades; therefore, visual information
about the world is acquired only during fixations. Recent findings have shown
that saccades also interfere with particular cognitive processes. This research
will determine why this occurs while also exploring the fundamental
characteristics and generality of the phenomenon of cognitive saccadic
suppression. Four hypotheses about the possible mechanisms underlying
suppression will be investigated in a series of experiments drawn from the areas
of working memory, mathematical cognition, stimulus novelty, and retrieval from
semantic memory. In general, the experiments will examine whether cognitive
processes that are set in motion during an eye fixation continue to operate
while the eyes are moving to a new position in space or whether these processes
pause during the eye movement. People will be presented with a simple mental
task that they will begin to perform while they are fixating one position in
space and will then make either a short or a long saccade to a different
position in space while attempting to continue performing the task. If cognitive
processing is suppressed during eye movements, then long saccades (which take
longer to execute) should disrupt performance more than short saccades (which
take less time to execute). Performance will also be measured in another
condition, in which the eyes do not move. Performance in the eye-movement
conditions should be equivalent to performance in the no-eye-movement condition
if eye movements do not interfere with cognition. The effects of cognitive
processing on saccadic behavior (e.g., saccade latency, duration, accuracy, and
peak velocity) will be examined as well to determine the reciprocity of the
interference.

The average person makes about three saccades per second (hence, about 172,800
saccades per 16-hour working day) and the average saccade lasts about 30 ms;
thus, if suppression occurs during saccades, it would mean that cognition is
disrupted for approximately 90 minutes each day. Determining why this occurs is
of fundamental importance to the understanding of human cognition, particularly
for activities such as scene perception and scene navigation that require many
eye movements. The research also has practical implications for the design of
visual displays and control panels that may require users to make saccades.
