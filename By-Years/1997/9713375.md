9713375 Parise Strategies to produce novel crystalline microporous solids will
be explored for a new class of open framework metal chalcogenide materials. The
research will focus on 1) further development of unusual and traditional
synthetic strategies for the production of open frameworks; 2) determination of
the crystal structures; 3) implementation of the small environmental cell for
real time srudies and other in situ devices to aid in understanding reactions
under hydrothermal conditions, measuring thermal stability under vacuum and
flowing gas, and structural changes accompanying ion exchange, gas loading and
intercalation; 4) development of techniques for data collection and structure
solution from microcrystals and powders at synchrotron sources; 5)
characterization of th estability, optical and ion exchange properties, and
correlation of these with structure. %%% Open structured metal-chalcogenides
represent a relatively new class of materials with potential areas of
application such as selective sorbents, ion-exchangers, ion-conductors and hosts
for inclusion chemistry. ***
