This project examines consumer's perceptions of the housing crisis in Houston,
Texas. The focus is both on the role of individual consumption patterns in
causing the crisis as well as the role of governmental policies. The project
uses a panel study to examine how consumers' perceptions, government policies
and the economic situation impacted the housing situation in Houston. The data
that will be generated will allow one to examine the impact of each of these
factors as well as to test important economic theories of consumption and to
help create a literature in political science that ties in policy regimes to
consumptive behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this panely
study centers not only on the new data that will contribute to basic research,
but to the information it provides to policy makers as part of the policy
evaluation process.
