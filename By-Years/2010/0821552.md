With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Pamela
Seaton from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington will acquire a 600
MHz NMR spectrometer for research and teaching in the Department of Chemistry
and Biochemistry. The proposed instrument will enable research on intermolecular
interactions in solution, structure of mutant peptides in lipid micelles or
vesicles, synthesis of phosphono-modified proteins for investigating bacterial
signal transduction in chemotaxis, binding of DNA methylating agents to DNA,
development of catalytic enantioselective reactions, analysis of ATP turnover
rates using 31P-NMR to monitor changes in high-energy phosphate molecules, and
structural characterization traces of complex marine natural products and their
binding with its cellular targets.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and
biochemistry.
