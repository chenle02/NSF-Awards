The feasibility of diamond ceramics has been demonstrated at Crystallume by
consolidating diamond powder with CVD diamond to near full density producing
disks of several millimeter thickness. In this study, we will develop a high
toughness diamond matrix composite in collaboration with the University of
California, Berkeley. Samples will be fabricated at Crystallume in which cubic
boron nitride powder is incorporated in a CVD diamond matrix for enhancing
toughness. Mechanical testing will be performed at the Materials Science and
Mineral Engineering Department, University of California, Berkeley, to examine
fatigue and fracture properties. The results of this study will provide the
basis for optimizing diamond composite microstructures in Phase II for wear and
cutting applications. This new material can be processed in useful shapes and
will exhibit superior hardness, exceptional toughness, and high thermal
conductivity. A high toughness diamond composite will be of considerable
interest in abrasive wear and cutting tool applications. The proposed work will
provide a new material which can be produced in useful shapes and will not
require a wear-resistant coating. Products may include tool inserts, bearing
elements, and structural components.
