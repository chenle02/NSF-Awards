The structural framework of the Brooks Range, Alaska has been the focus of
recent research, and this renewal will build on this work. A number of
fundamental problems will be addressed. The first is the formation of an
apparent out of sequence thrust in the interior of the fold and thrust belt.
Another is the timing and kinematic relationship of major extensional tectonism
with progressive north-directed thrusting. Also to be studied are late-stage
structures associated with antithetic shear and the formation of a large scale
duplex in the center of the range. These are fall features of most fold and
thrust belts, and results of this work will be applicable to other examples, as
well s to the understanding of Alaskan geology.
