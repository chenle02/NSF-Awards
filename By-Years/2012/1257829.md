This project focuses on the evolution of the adaptive immune system, which
enables animals to respond powerfully and specifically to pathogens of many
different types. A key feature of adaptive immunity is antigen recognition by
two types of antigen receptors: antibodies (immunoglobulins, produced by B
cells, and the source of humoral immunity), and T-cell receptors (TCR; involved
in cellular immunity). Because of their extraordinary diversity, these receptors
can bind to a wide range of biological molecules; receptor diversity is created
by unique genetic mechanisms (somatic gene rearrangement and hypermutation)
characteristic of the adaptive immune response. Previous work has shown that the
oldest jawed vertebrates on earth, the cartilaginous fish (including sharks),
have all of the basic molecular hardware of this system. However, some elements
of the mammalian adaptive immune system - lymph nodes, bone marrow, and
specialized lymphoid tissue such as germinal centers - are absent in sharks;
sharks thus provide a relatively simple model to understand the most fundamental
characteristics of adaptive immunity. Although T cells and B cells have been
considered quite distinct in function, this laboratory discovered in shark cells
an antigen receptor, NAR-TCR, that uses the same domain in both cellular (TCR)
and humoral (antibody) immunity; it has also now documented multiple instances
of shark T-cells with properties (e.g., immunoglobulin variable domains and
somatic hypermutation) previously ascribed only to B-cells. Building on these
findings, this project will reexamine the basic definition of vertebrate B and T
cells by exploring the boundaries of the immunogenetic mechanisms available to
each cell type. The unexpected plasticity of these boundaries offers provocative
new perspectives on the evolution of the vertebrate immune system; it also
suggests new possibilities for immune response manipulation in other
vertebrates, including humans. Student research training from high school
through graduate levels is integral to the project.
