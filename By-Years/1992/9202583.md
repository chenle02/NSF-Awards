This award is made by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Research and
Electrical and Communications Systems under the Materials Synthesis and
Processing Initiative. The research will apply ring-opening metathesis
polymerization to the synthesis of block copolymers having polyene or other
electroactive microdomains. A goal will be the synthesis of quantum dots by
morphology control of conjugated co-polymer blends. Stretch-orientation of
quantum dots is expected to form quantum lines with useful anisotropic optical
properties. These may find application as molecule-based optical gratings.
Interfaces between inorganic semiconductors and doped conjugated polymers will
also be evaluated as junctions and Schottky barrier devices. %%% Ring opening
metathesis routes to conjugated polymers will provide new materials with novel
mechanical, physical, optical and electrical properties.
