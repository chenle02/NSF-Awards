0406255 Kim Today's technologies are not adequate to control odors and new
methods are needed to improve the quality of biosolids. Complaints about noxious
odor generation and public safety concerns regarding the disinfection and land
application of biosolids is driving waste treatment professionals to seek-out
innovative solutions. A newly available chemical treatment using iron in a +6
oxidation state (Fe[VI]) known as Ferrate, can potentially solve these problems.
Ferrate's environmentally friendly chemistry is unique and it has the potential
to significantly impact the wastewater treatment industry.
