0933848&lt;br/&gt;Adrian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate the
structure of eddies in moderate Reynolds number, canonical wall turbulence for
the purpose of developing a unified physical-mathematical description including
all scales ranging from the near- wall to the very large-scale motions. It is
now clear that large- and very-large-scale motions (LSM and VLSM) occur in all
wall flows and account for more than one-half of the turbulent kinetic energy
and Reynolds shear stress in the outer layer. But, very little is known about
their form, and even less about their origins. Aside from some evidence that
they are correlated with the small, near-wall eddies, there is no understanding
of how eddies in the buffer layer, the logarithmic layer, and the wake are
related to the LSM and the VLSM. The other weakness in our ability to describe
the three-dimensional structure is that a unified mathematical methodology has
yet to be applied to the full range of scale and the full set of canonical
flows. The specific goals are therefore to adapt three-dimensional proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) to this purpose and apply it to three flows:
pipe, channel and boundary-layer using data from existing direct numerical
simulations. The structure of quasi-streamwise vortices in the near-wall and
their dynamics are becoming reasonably well understood. This work would put our
understanding of the structure of the logarithmic layer and large/very-large
scale on a comparable footing, and establish a basis for addressing the dynamics
of these motions. Incorporating the LSM/VLSM eddies into a unified picture will
answer a long-standing question concerning autonomy of the near-wall layer and
the physical processes that determine the statistical behavior. Deeper
understanding of POD modes and their relation to coherent structures on multiple
scales will materially advance our methodology for extracting information from
the richness of Direct Navier Stokes simulation databases. It would also impact
the formulation of large eddy simulations and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes
computational methods, and scaling laws for engineering systems and the
formulation of techniques to reduce drag and otherwise manage turbulent flow
over surfaces. Very broadly, such improvements have value to society in the
areas of energy, transportation, weather prediction and other geophysical
processes.
