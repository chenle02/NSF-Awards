Abstract Tartakoff

Initiated in 1977, the Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminar is a
semiannual meeting on recent developments in partial differential equations. The
seminar rotates among midwestern universities, NSF funds partially support
expenses for speakers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.The seminars
provide rapid communication of problems, methods, and results. The Midwest PDE
Seminar encourages collaboration among research mathematicians from several
institutions.
