The objectives of this project are to develop highly efficient iterative
algorithms for use in system design (especially communication systems) in the
presence of non-Gaussian disturbances, and to extend these algorithms to the
design of systems which efficiently adapt to nonstationary environments.
Analytic solutions to the design of systems with non-Gaussian inputs are
typically intractable, therefore numerical methods are frequently required.
Stochastic approximation algorithms are effective design alternatives which
require only estimates of the system error at an iterated set of system
parameters. This project merges concepts from Importance Sampling with existing
stochastic approximation algorithms to dramatically reduce the total required
computations in the design of parameterized systems and inputs. In the situation
where the inputs are non-stationary, a selfmodifying Importance Sampling
strategy is developed for use with adaptive implementations of these algorithms.
This requires the coupling of techniques in estimation theory with Importance
Sampling strategies derived from static systems. Example of particular interest
are communication systems operating in the presence of stationary and
nonstationary non-Gaussian background noise. Preliminary results demonstrate
that for the scalar design case, the computational savings are unbounded when
designing detection systems whose error rates diminish.
