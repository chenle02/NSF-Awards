9402608 Krishnamurty In this research project, a unified scheme is developed for
the design of generic mechanisms using an exact gradient approach. The
utilization of this approach enhances the efficiency of the mechanism design
process, and the accuracy of the final solution. It includes a comprehensive
design procedure for determining and eliminating branch-defects and circuit
defects during mechanism synthesis process leading to optimal solutions for
complex mechanisms. The unified approach uses matrix methods to model and
analyze mechanisms to ensure generality, and has the capabilities of
systematically determining suitable mechanism types and their optimal dimensions
without branch and circuit defects. The results of this research are extremely
useful in the mechanism identification and enumeration process, formulation of
appropriate selection and rejection criteria for mechanism evaluation, and
designing and implementing schemes for automatic mechanism sketching without
crossing links, and representing different class of mechanism such as contracted
graphs and kinematic chains. ***
