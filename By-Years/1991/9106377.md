The proposed research program deals with fundamental questions regarding
unfolding transitions in proteins and the interaction of specific ligands with
proteins. The work will focus on two proteins, nuclease A and trp aporepressor,
and certain site- directed mutants of these proteins. Dr. Eftink will study the
cold (as well as high temperature) unfolding and pressure unfolding of
relatively unstable mutants of nuclease. The goal is to evaluate and correlate
various thermodynamic parameters for the unfolding of several mutants of
nuclease in order to better understand the forces responsible for stabilizing
proteins. The "structure" and dynamic characteristics of the various unfolding
states (i.e., produced by low and high temperature, pressure, urea, low pH) will
be studied by a combination of several techniques, including i) time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy to measure local motion (of the single trp residue), ii)
resonance energy transfer between sites to obtain intramolecular distance
information, iii) size exclusion chromatography to measure the overall
hydrodynamic radius of the molecule, and iv) CD to observe any differences ins
secondary structure. In addition to comparing the various unfolded states, the
effect of the destabilizing mutations on the folded state of the proteins will
be studied by some of the above methods and by v) room temperature
phosphorescence to compare the rigidity of the environment of the trp residue,
and vi) titration microcalorimetry to measure thermodynamic parameters for the
binding of specific ligands to the protein.
