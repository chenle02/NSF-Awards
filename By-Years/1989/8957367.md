This Presidential Young Investigator Award concerns laser cooling and atom
trapping. The interaction between atoms at ultra-low temperatures will be
studied. With a sufficiently dense and cold gas one can hope to observe
collective atomic effects, in particular a Bose-Einstein condensation of weakly
interacting particles of integral spin. It is necessary to design approaches to
maximize the ratio of atomic de Broglie wavelength to interatomic separation, in
order to enhance the quantum effects. Lithium will be used in the initial
experiments. Atoms will be spin-aligned, trapped in a magnetic field minimum,
cooled in two laser cooling steps. The rates of inelastic collision processes
within the trap will be measured. The gas will then be further cooled and
compressed in the attempt to observe Bose-Einstein condensation.
