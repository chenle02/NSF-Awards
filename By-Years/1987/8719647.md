The National Academy of Sciences requests support from the National Science
Foundation to sponsor a joint US-USSR workshop December 7-11, 1987, in Santa
Barbara, California on "Condensed Matter Theory." Approximately ten Soviet
scientists and up to twenty American scientists are expected to participate. The
workshop will focus on basic research on condensed matter theory and fermi-
liquid effects. It will provide an opportunity for scientists of both countries
to exchange information on the area of strongly interacting fermions as well as
others and allow them to resume a successful collaboration that has been held in
abeyance since the early 1980s.
