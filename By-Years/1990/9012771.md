The objective of this study is to determine why a significant fraction of the
slip on oceanic transform faults occurs by aseismic creep rather than by
earthquakes. The study will test the hypothesis that this behavior is due to the
existence of serpentine along the transform faults. If serpentine exhibits
velocity hardening, then the serpentine will accommodate the movement along the
faults through aseismic creep. A series of experiments will be conducted to
determine the frictional constitutive behavior of serpentine, as well as a more
exploratory series of experiments to determine the constitutive behavior of
basalt and peridotite. Then a realistic fault instability model for oceanic
transform faults will be constructed. Together these experiments are expected to
result in an understanding of the observed combination of seismic and aseismic
slip on oceanic transform faults.
