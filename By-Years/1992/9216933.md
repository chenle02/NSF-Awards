This U.S.-Mexico award will support an exchange program in representation theory
between U.S. and Mexican mathematicians, organized by Prof. Edward Green of
Virginia Polytechnic University and Prof. Raymundo Bautista of the Mathematics
Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). About 12
researchers from the U.S., including some of the leading researchers in the area
of group and algebra representations, will participate in a series of visits and
mini-conferences with leading Mexican mathematicians in the subject. Group
representation theory is of interest, not only to algebraists but also
topologists and other mathematicians. It is an area of much current activity
where the computer is increasingly used as a tool to generate examples and test
conjectures. This U.S.- Mexico award will serve to enable further collaboration
between outstanding mathematicians of both countries.
