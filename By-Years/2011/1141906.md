Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The United
States Polar Rock Repository (USPRR) was established to curate and loan geologic
samples from polar regions to researchers and educators. OPP established the
USPRR in part to avoid redundant sample collection and thus reduce the
environmental impact of polar research. The USPRR also provides the research
community with an important resource for developing new research projects. The
USPRR acquires rock collections through donations from institutions and
scientists and makes these samples available as no-cost loans for research,
education and museum exhibits. Sample metadata is available in an on-line
database. The database also includes rock property information, such as magnetic
susceptibility and specific gravity, which are useful for geophysical studies.
Researchers may request samples for analysis using an online request form. The
USPRR fulfills several data management directives, including the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research, Antarctic Data Management directive of
providing free, full and open access to both metadata and the samples. The
intellectual merit of the USPRR lies in the global dissemination of scientific
information to researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the USPRR include lessening environmental
impacts resulting from redundant fieldwork in Polar Regions. The USPRR provides
educational information about Antarctica via the website, by visiting the
repository or borrowing a "USPRR rock box". Working at the repository provides
students with opportunities to learn about the geology of Antarctica as well as
doing research, learning new skills in digital imaging, curation and database
management.
