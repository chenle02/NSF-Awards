Long-term Research: Aerodynamic Simulation of the Effects of Hydrometers on
Urban Structures This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long
and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is
designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term
research abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide
opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign
countries. The award will support Dr. James Edson, Pennsylvania State
University, for a twelve-month research visit with Dr. Patrice Mestayer, Ecole
Nationale Superieure de Mecanique, Nantes, France. The award recommendation
provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel
abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative
allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
