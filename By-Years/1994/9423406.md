This award supplies funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V LAURENTIAN, an
80 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the University. Instrumentation
requested includes an upgrade for the CTD sensor, a new PAR sensor, upgrades to
the conductivity sensor, and a new digital data recorder. The instrumentation is
requested for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the LAURENTIAN during 1995.
