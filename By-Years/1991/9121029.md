This is an award to support conduct of a Symposium on the current status and
emerging issues in aquatic chemistry that are of significance in environmental
engineering design and practice. This symposium is planned to be conducted in
associative relationship with a national meeting of the American Chemical
Society in the spring of 1992. Major topics for the symposium, scheduled for
April 8 and 9, 1992 include surface phenomena that affect chemical reactions in
aquatic systems, aspects of earth contact, biological processes, oxidation-
reduction and photocatalyzed reactions in dilute aqueous solutions that affect
engineering approaches to management of water quality. Results of this Symposium
are expected to provide guidance to the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program
in planning and conduct of research in aquatic chemistry applicable to the
dispersion, diffusion and interactions of chemical pollutants in the
environment.
