Highly selective transformations are of great importance to the chemical
industry because these avoid costly separations and reduce waste. To demonstrate
the feasibility of molecular imprinting using inorganic systems, we propose to
prepare a selective catalyst for the photocatalytic conversion of 2,6-
diaminohexanic acid to optically pure L-pipecolic acid in high yield by
imprinting polymeric TiO2 from sol-gel with the aid of a template. A further
objective of the proposed research is to prepare highly selective adsorbents for
the separation of optical isomers using SiO2 from a sol-gel.
