This proposal is a request for funds to help support the 1987 Northeast Regional
Conference on Developmental Biology. The Conference will be held at the Marine
Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, September 24-27, 1987. The
goal of the Conference is to bring together developmental biologists from the
Northeast to present their work in formal sessions and informal discussions. A
special effort is being made to bring together investigators at all career
stages: graduate students to established investigators. The conference will
include 5-6 platform sessions, a poster session and a keynote address. The
purpose of the conference is to provide an effective opportunity for the formal
and informal exchange of information and ideas between established investigators
and graduate or postdoctoral students. This goal is achieved much more readily
at the regional conferences than at national meetings primarily because the
regional conferences are smaller, less rigidly scheduled, and allow ample time
and occasion for discussions.
