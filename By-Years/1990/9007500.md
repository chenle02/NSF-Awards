Dr. Robbins will attempt to use a novel technique to ablate single protein
species from living tissue. This method will allow the molecular analysis of
cell-cell interactions during development. The technique is based on the
observation that the dye malachite green, when irraditated with a laser beam,
destroys proteins within a very small radius of the dye molecule (on the order
of the diameter of one protein molecule). Dr. Robbins will conjugate malachite
green to ligands for the acetylcholine receptor, incubate exposed, living
neuromuscular junctions to the conjugated dye, and irradiate small areas of the
tissue with a laser. He will then use morphological techniques on the light and
electron microscopic levels to determine whether acetylcholine receptors were
specifically destroyed, leaving the neighboring molecules intact. A further aim
of the study is to determine whether nerve terminals can be selectively
destroyed using this technique in combination with ligands that bind selectively
to nerve terminal surfaces. Destruction of nerve terminals and preservation of
surrounding components of the neuromuscular junction will be assayed using
electrophysiological and morphological techniques.
