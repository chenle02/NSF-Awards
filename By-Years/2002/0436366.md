0436366 Cunningham The foundation for new and unique mathematical modeling and
reverse engineering approaches to assess the toxicity of nanomaterials will be
laid. Genomics, through the use of gene expression microarrays (GEM) will be
used to evaluate samples from human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) exposed to
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) in culture. The data will be analyzed by
statistical, similarity and predictive approaches as well as reverse engineered
to determine the genetic regulatory networks which are involved. This research
will set the stage for the ultimate goal of establishing new mathematical and
engineering modeling methods to extrapolate the risk of nanomaterials to humans.
Nanomaterials have been shown to have attributes, which far exceed the current
traditional materials for medical, energy, and communications applications.
Recently, however, several preliminary studies, but not all, have hinted that
toxicity may be associated with nanomaterials. Most of these studies were
performed on SWNT and using traditional toxicity assays. The research plan
proposed here will use genomics to survey genes for indications of toxicity and
will form the foundation for newly developed mathematical and reverse
engineering algorithms to predict risk of exposure to human health. The novel
and unique aspects of this research plan is the optimized experimental design as
well as the comprehensive analysis scheme on the resulting data files, including
reverse engineering of the genetic regulatory networks involved. This research
will set the stage for the ultimate goal of establishing new mathematical and
engineering modeling methods to extrapolate the risk of nanomaterials to humans.
