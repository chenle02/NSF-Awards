Wang 9526634 The PIs propose experiments to measure the P-V-T equation of state
of a range of upper mantle and transition zone materials at high pressures and
temperatures. These experiments will significantly improve the coverage of the
thermal elasticity dataset for lower mantle phases and should improve
mineralogical constraints on the composition of the upper mantle and transition
zone.
