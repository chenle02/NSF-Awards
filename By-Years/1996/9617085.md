ABSTRACT: CMS-9617085, Maria Todorovska, U of Southern California The Los
Angeles Vicinity Strong Motion Array consists of 80 stations (each recording
three components of ground acceleration) distributed through-out the Los Angeles
metropolitan area. During 15 years of operation, this array has recorded many
earthquakes of magnitude 3 and greater, including, the 1987 Whittier-Narrows
(M=5.9), 1990 Upland (M=5.2), 1991 Sierra Madre (M=5.8), 1992 Landers (M=7.5)
and the 1994 Northridge (M=6.7) earthquakes. The digitized data recorded by the
network is valuable for numerous earthquake engineering applications. The
processed data is made available to the public. This action is to fund the basic
maintenance of the network for the period of one year. Maintenance is essential
to ensure that the instruments are in good working condition to record future
earthquake ground shaking.
