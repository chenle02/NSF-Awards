The summer school "Graduate Summer School on the Mathematics and Physics of
Hitchin Systems" will take place on May 27th-31st, 2019 at the Simons Center for
Geometry and Physics. The goal of the summer school is to promote and facilitate
interdisciplinary research in this rapidly developing field within mathematics
and physics. The event will bring together talented junior researchers from a
diverse range of institutions and backgrounds to learn from leaders in the
field. The daily schedule of the workshop will feature a series of pedagogical
lectures as well as talks from leading researchers on open questions and current
results. There will be four mini-courses by experts on topics close to their own
research, including a mix of lectures and problem sessions. During the
afternoons, there will also be advanced research talks by experts in the field,
exposing young participants to the most current open questions in the
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitchin systems are receiving ever increasing
attention from researchers in diverse areas of mathematics and physics. This
Graduate Summer School responds to the exciting developments and interest around
Higgs bundles, their spectral data and the Hitchin moduli space, as well as
their realizations within string theory. The scientific goal is to introduce
young researchers to important fundamentals and recent developments in the
field. Topics covered will include:&lt;br/&gt;1) The moduli space of Higgs
bundles and its branes through the Hitchin fibration and equivariant characters
of coherent sheaves on the Hitchin moduli space (including links to Langlands
duality)&lt;br/&gt;2) Appearances of Hitchin systems within string theory
(including T-brane solutions within compactications of M- and
F-theory)&lt;br/&gt;3) The geometry of the Hitchin moduli space, including
limits and geometric structures within the Hitchin fibration, and the relation
of ends of the moduli space to the algebraic study of Donaldson-Thomas
invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds.&lt;br/&gt;4) Links between Hitchin and
Calabi-Yau integrable systems and their role in string theory (including string
dualities).&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is available at
