Plasma based processes such as plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical
vapor deposition are used in the fabrication of microelectronic devices. Models
of the system, used for design and control purposes, require a microscopic data
base of the ground and excited-state densities of the various species in a
"cold" plasma. Physical parameters such as the gas mixture, gas pressure, power
deposition, flow rate and reactor geometry are needed to determine the
characteristics of the plasma. Electronic collisions are the dominant processes
in the initial breakdown of the plasma. Dissociative and/or ionizing electron
collisions play a pivotal role, since they produce the species that are
responsible for the etching and deposition. Building a comprehensive data base,
including experimentally derived data on electron collision cross sections, will
help in the modelling and design of plasma processes. The P.I.'s plan to study
dissociative and ionizing electron collisions with the reactive constituents of
processing plasmas, and the stable radicals resulting from their break- up,
along three lines: (1) Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) studies of the formation
of neutral ground-state fragments using an electron beam / gas beam / laser beam
apparatus set up to determine the absolute cross sections and appearance
potentials for the formation of neutral ground-state dissociation fragments. (2)
Studies of ionization and dissociative ionization processes- absolute ionization
cross sections, appearance potentials, mass spectral cracking patterns - using a
crossed fast atomic beam / electron beam apparatus. (3) Time of flight studies
of energetic metastable formation of dissociation fragments using the above
apparatus.
