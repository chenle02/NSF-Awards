9626585 Schafrik This grant provides funding to the National Academy of Sciences
for a study that will identify those fundamental manufacturing challenges that
cut across multiple industry sectors and that, if successfully addressed, could
result in major departures from current approaches by the 2010 time frame. The
most important enabling technologies that would contribute to overcoming the
visionary challenges will be described as they differ by industrial sector. The
study will take an international perspective by obtaining input from
manufacturing companies in Europe, Asia, Canada, and Central and South America,
and it will draw on information being developed through the National Science
Foundation's Next Generation Manufacturing project. The Next Generation
Manufacturing project is establishing an industry consensus for a 10-year vision
by industrial sector. This effort will supplement other efforts on the Next
Generation Manufacturing project and leverage its results. It will provide
guidance to the Foundation and other government agencies to help direct their
funding and research efforts aimed at improving the competitiveness of the
nation's manufacturing capacity.
