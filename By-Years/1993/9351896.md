A computerized learning environment Mathematica notebooks is enabling science
students to actively learn calculus and differential equations with guided
discovery and exploration. The Mathematics Department will fully implement this
curriculum in all sections of the science calculus sequence and in the two-
semester differential equations sequence. The curricular revisions are being
coordinated with the science departments, who are also integrating active
learning and technology in their courses. This collaboration, based on common
pedagogical goals and software, brings more scientific applications into
mathematics courses and strengthens the use of mathematics in science courses.
Project participants are conducting workshops for other mathematics faculty, and
for high school teachers and students, including workshops especially for
minority high school students.
