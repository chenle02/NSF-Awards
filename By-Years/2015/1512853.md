In statistical mechanics and probability theory, systems consisting of a large
number of microscopic elements - such as molecules - individually subject to
randomness or noise, and interacting with each other, play a prominent role. It
is a fundamental problem to understand how simple, microscopic interaction rules
produce intricate random features on a macroscopic scale, features that can be
modeled by continuous stochastic structures. This general area of problems is
relevant to many important physical phenomena, such as porosity and
ferromagnetism. The project's emphasis is on the case of two-dimensional
systems, where the last fifteen years have seen spectacular and ongoing
progress, involving a wide variety of mathematical concepts and techniques,
along with a rapprochement between mathematical and theoretical physics. The PI
will continue to engage in mathematical and interdisciplinary training
activities of students and junior researchers, in particular in relation with
his research projects at the interface of Physics and Mathematics.

The program of research described in this project is mainly focused on two-
dimensional critical models in statistical physics, with special emphasis on
conformal invariance and the interplay between the field formulation and the
geometric aspects of their scaling limits. The introduction of Schramm-Loewner
evolutions (SLE) has deeply influenced the study of conformally invariant random
systems. This new class of stochastic continuous planar curves has proved
extremely effective in describing the scaling limit of interfaces of critical
models of statistical physics, such as percolation and the Ising model. The
research projects of the PI have three main focuses. The first is the study of
systems of SLE-type paths and loops, in particular in relation with the
Conformal Field Theory formalism. The second concerns the dimer model and
aspects of the free field description of its scaling limit, building on the
analysis of families of Cauchy-Riemann operators. The third focus involves the
exact relations between SLE paths and an ambient Gaussian field. The expectation
of the PI is that these studies will help provide a deeper understanding of
critical models and the interplay of the relevant concepts and tools in
combinatorics, probability, analysis, complex geometry and representation
theory.
