Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solutions. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
of the University of Chicago will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help purchase a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer along with
an appropriate computer and peripherals. Acquisition of the spectrometer by this
widely recognized department will enhance the research of a group of 16 users in
areas of chemistry that include inorganic and organic synthesis, structural
characterization, work on the examination of transient intermediates, asymmetric
homogeneous catalysis, linear prediction methods for magnetic resonance,
mechanism of control of plant cell division and differentiation, and mechanisms
of action of cephalosporin C-10 peptidyl esters.
