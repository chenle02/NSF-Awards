EIA-0203974 Chrisochoides, Nikos P. College of William and Mary Mesh Generation
and Optimistic Computation on the Grid . The goal of this proposal is to
investigate exactly these issues using an identified application as a test case.
Mesh generation and dynamic manipulation is an integral part of many important
scientific computing applications and must take place on the same platform with
the rest of the application. Mesh generation is a memory-intensive application
with major impact on the overall performance of the end-to-end field
simulations-an important class of applications that could benefit greatly from a
grid platform. Traditional approaches for generating, partitioning, and placing
very large meshes have tow weakness when used on grids: (i) I/O and data
movement due to mesh re-partitioning, for adaptive applications, is
prohibitively expensive, and (ii) there is a trade-off between the performance
of field solvers and the quality of the resulting elements and
partitions.&lt;br/&gt;
