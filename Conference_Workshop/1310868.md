Applied Inverse Problems 2013 (AIP 2013) Conference, Daejeon, Korea, July 1-5,
2013. The series of AIP Conferences aim to provide a primary international forum
for academic and industrial researchers working on all aspects of Inverse
Problems (IP). IP are problems where causes for a desired or an observed effect
are to be determined. They lie at the heart of scientific inquiry and
technological development. The enormous increase in computing power and the
development of powerful algorithms has made it possible to apply the techniques
of IP to real-world problems of growing complexity. Applications include a
number of medical as well as other imaging techniques, location of oil and
mineral deposits in the earth's substructure, creation of astrophysical images
from telescope data, finding cracks and interfaces within materials, shape
optimization, model identification in growth processes and modelling in the life
sciences. This is the first time that these series of conferences will be held
in Asia. One aim of the conference is to bring together investigators working on
different aspects of these fields and to encourage interaction between
mathematicians and practitioners of inverse problems. Another goal is to foster
international cooperation between scientists working on inverse problems
throughout the world.

The series of AIP Conferences aim to provide a primary international forum for
academic and industrial researchers working on all aspects of inverse problems
(IP), such as mathematical modelling, analytic and geometric methods,
computational approaches, numerical algorithms etc. This series of conferences
started in Montecatini, Italy in 2001 and has been held every two years since in
Europe and North America: Lake Arrowhead, California, in 2003, Cirecester, UK,
in 2005, Vancouver, Canada, in 2007, Vienna, Austria, in 2009 and College
Station, Texas, in 2011. This is the first time that the AIP conference will be
held in Asia. The series of conferences have turned to be the most recognized in
the field of IP with more than 300 participants in 2007, 2009 and 2011 and we
expect the same in 2013. Since 2007 they are organized by the Inverse Problem
International Association (IPIA). The invited speakers and the minisymposia of
AIP 2013 will cover a broad spectrum of the applications of inverse problems,
focusing on recent developments in medical imaging, determination of defects in
materials, homogeneization and inverse problems, geometric inverse problems,
remote sensing, industrial applications, numerical and regularization methods in
inverse problems, and also, invisibility and cloaking. One aim of the conference
is to bring together investigators working on different aspects of these fields
and to encourage interaction between mathematicians and practitioners of inverse
problems. Another goal is to foster international cooperation between scientists
working on inverse problems throughout the world.
