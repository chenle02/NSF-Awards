Algorithms and complexity are the theoretical foundation and backbone of machine
learning. Yet over the past few decades an uncomfortable truth has set in that
worst-case analysis is not the right framework to study it: every model that is
interesting enough to use in practice leads to computationally hard problems.
The goal of the PI's research agenda is to move beyond worst-case analysis. This
involves formalizing when and why heuristics -- such as alternating minimization
and Gibbs sampling -- work as well as designing fundamentally new algorithms for
some of the basic tasks in machine learning. This project has already had a
number of successes such as provable algorithms for nonnegative matrix
factorization, topic modeling and learning mixture models.

The PI will investigate several new directions in topics such as sparse coding,
inference in graphical models, inverse problems for tensors, and semi-random
models. These projects will leverage a wide range of modern tools to give new
provable algorithms in each of these settings, and will involve making new
connections between alternating minimization and approximate gradient descent,
analyzing Gibbs sampling through correlation decay and coupling, connecting
tensor completion and quantum complexity and rethinking the standard
distributional models used in machine learning. These projects cut across
several areas of computer science and applied mathematics and will build new
bridges between them, as well as expanding the reach of theory into a number of
domains where there is a serious gap in our current understanding. Bridging
theory and practice has significant broader impact. The PI will continue to
mentor undergraduate and graduate students.
