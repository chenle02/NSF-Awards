This award will provide a computer cluster to Millersville University who will
use it to integrate new computational techniques and apply them to scientific
questions that have relevance over a broad range of environmental and human
problems. The cluster will also provide balance to the education and training of
students in the Department of Earth Sciences at Millersville University which
has a strong observational research background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 16-blade
server and GPU node will be acquired and installed in the existing university
data center. The research team identifies multiple uses for the cluster,
including weather modeling for agriculture and road weather, using numerical
models to understand coronal magnetic ejections and the plasma environment,
linking agricultural runoff to hypoxia events in the Chesapeake Bay, and
determining the links between small-scale geologic structures and subsurface
fluid flow in sedimentary basins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
