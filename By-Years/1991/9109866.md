ABSTRACT The purpose of this project is to prepare as complete documentation as
possible of the Kiowa language, a Native American language that is not far from
extinction. This documentation will take the form of a collection of texts and a
dictionary, which will accompany the published grammar of Kiowa. The texts,
which will be translated, linguistically analyzed, and annotated for grammatical
and cultural points of interest, range from personal anecdotes to traditional
legends and native language written correspondence. Including both written and
spoken material, they provide rich exemplification of connected Kiowa discourse.
The dictionary, based on field work and published sources, will enable
researchers interested in historical work on Kiowa-Tanoan as well as those
exploring synchronic questions of phonology and lexical structure to examine
data from a little known but typologically interesting Native American language.
