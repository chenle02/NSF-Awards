Professor Georges Guiochon of the University of Tennessee is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to work on the fundamental
thermodynamics and kinetics of chemical separations and preparative
chromatography. Several separation systems are to be studied, including
monolithic columns. The experimental investigations include pressure dependence
of insulin separations and the isotherm behaviors of chiral separations. Central
to this work is the prediction and optimization of individual band profiles of
multicomponent mixtures including protein variants, through calculations
involving physical models. The work here proposes to invoke established
parameter estimation methods and determination by experiment and extend them to
situations where the response is nonlinear, for example, under slow mass
transfer conditions.

The work represents the application of mathematics to understand chromatography.
Separations science is economically important. If theory can assist in
optimizing parameters to achieve better separations, time and cost are saved as
well as potentially reducing harmful solvent use. The area is a good training
ground for students in that they are exposed to elements of chemistry, chemical
engineering, mathematics and biochemistry.
