The goals of this project are (a) to provide 60 scholarships for students with
financial need and academic talent who declare majors in Agricultural Science
programs and (b) to increase the number of students who successfully complete a
2-year course of study in agriculture and transfer as an Agricultural Science
major to a 4-year university.

Intellectual Merit: Multiple recruitment approaches are being implemented,
including print and digital media and student and parent presentations. Specific
outreach efforts are made to traditionally underrepresented students and
students pursuing a career in Agriculture Education. Scholarships are awarded
through a competitive process based on financial need, GPA, essay, interview,
and recommendation. Recipients receive support services through cohort-based
activities such as faculty mentoring, advising, leadership training, social
activities, professional development opportunities, and an intensive Agriculture
Summer Institute.

Broader Impacts: The program is preparing highly-educated future Agricultural
Science professionals such as agriculture economists, farm owners and engineers,
technicians, and future teachers. Students receive training to become mentors
for future cohorts, creating a network of peers and increasing further
collaborative opportunities. The programmatic structure of this program serves
as a model for other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
based courses of study throughout the college, as well as in other institutions.
