Algebraic geometry focuses on the study of solutions of polynomial equations.
Guiding questions in this fields are to understand the geometric objects, called
algebraic varieties, arising from polynomial equations and to classify such
shapes. This project also concerns applications to number theory, with hopes to
understand what the geometry of these shapes can tell us about the rational
number or integral solutions to these polynomial equations. These problems have
applications to other fields of math (e.g. differential geometry) as well as
physics (e.g. string theory). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moduli spaces of higher
dimensional algebraic varieties are not as well understood as their curve
counterparts. The first overarching question in this project is to the
understand compactifications of moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic
varieties. The approaches taken will be a combination of techniques arising
from, e.g. the minimal model program (MMP), as well as K-stability. In
particular, the PI plans to understand explicit compactifications in specific
cases (e.g. K3 surfaces), and to study how to interpolate between various
compactifications in a modular way. The second overarching question, is to
investigate how geometry of higher dimensional varieties and their moduli
influences arithmetic, studying the rich interplay between algebraic geometry,
hyperbolicity, and arithmetic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
