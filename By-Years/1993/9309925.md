9309925 Wright The research will build on an NSF completed research project
entitled: "Machine tool Open System Advanced Intelligent Controller (MOSAIC)."
MOSAIC is a machine tool control environment which provides the opportunity to
fully integrate advanced methods in computer aided design (CAD), computer aided
process planning (CAPP), and sensor based computer aided precision machining.
Two new courses will be organized to utilize MOSAIC: Integrated Manufacturing
for undergraduate education and Software Development for Advanced Manufacturing
for graduate education. These will be organized around open architecture design,
planning and sensor based manufacturing. The graduate course will be project
oriented. The research will transfer the MOSAIC architecture to the curriculum
to use the integrated CAD/CAPP and computer aided manufacturing environment to
design and plan out and machine complex components. The knowledge of these
technologies may be transferred to industry through the student use of the
tools.
