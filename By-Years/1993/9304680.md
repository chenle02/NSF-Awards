9304680 Hodges The Himalayan Orogen is the classic example of an active
continent-continent collision and has received considerable study. In addition
to major thrust systems, extensional features are present at high structural
levels, possibly accommodating gravitational collapse of steep topographic
gradients, thus indicating that the Himalaya is a dynamic system that has
undergone several episodes of adjustment in response to changes in the stress
field, thermal structure or other tectonic parameters. This project will test
the hypothesis that syn-compressional collapse was episodic in the orogen by
dating appropriate deformational features. The project will also develop linked
thermal and mechanical models based on the accumulated geological database for
the central Himalaya. This model, specific to this orogen, is expected to have
considerable relevance to the understanding of complex dynamics of collisional
orogens in general.
