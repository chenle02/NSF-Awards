The goal of this project is to create multicore computer
processors&lt;br/&gt;with near-mainframe reliability at commodity costs, where
the primary&lt;br/&gt;costs are additional hardware and additional power
consumption. Should&lt;br/&gt;this project achieve these goals, it would
transform computing.&lt;br/&gt;Reliable processors would no longer be a niche
product; instead, they&lt;br/&gt;would be the commodity products used in
desktops, laptops,&lt;br/&gt;smartphones, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
thrusts in this project include error detection, error&lt;br/&gt;recovery,
diagnosis of permanent faults, and self-repair for&lt;br/&gt;tolerating
permanent faults. The end result of this project will be a&lt;br/&gt;hardware
prototype of a low-cost, reliable multicore processor.&lt;br/&gt;Building an
artifact is a vital part of this project for two&lt;br/&gt;reasons. First, a
primary project goal is to keep power and area costs&lt;br/&gt;low, and these
costs cannot be accurately determined using high-level&lt;br/&gt;simulation.
Second, to transfer this technology to industry and&lt;br/&gt;transform the
industry, the chip makers must be convinced that the&lt;br/&gt;solutions are
viable. Chip makers have historically been&lt;br/&gt;hesitant to accept ideas
that have not been built, not least because&lt;br/&gt;important issues can be
hidden in a high-level simulator.
