This proposal seeks funds to develop an interdisciplinary program for
electronics manufacturing education that will provide highly-trained technicians
to U.S. industry. A wide range of activities that include all three
subcategories of "Advanced Technological Education Projects" will be necessary
to meet this goal. First, associate degree faculty expertise will be enhanced
with industry fellowships, workshops, and seminars. With better understanding of
industry needs, these faculty, along with a practicing engineer from the
Electronic Manufacturing Productivity Facility (EMPF), will develop three new
courses that are the basis for a new degree option. The laboratories which
accompany these courses will use facilities belonging to industry partners, the
EMPF, and the schools, along with equipment purchased under the Instrumentation
and Laboratory Improvement section of this grant. Additional activities,
centering around the Mobile Electronics Manufacturing Line and the EMPF, will
link secondary teachers and students with associate degree faculty, practicing
engineers, and technicians. Such activities will allow for secondary teacher
enhancement and curriculum development.
