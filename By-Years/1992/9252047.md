This Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatograph for use by
students in the organic chemistry laboratory, general chemistry laboratory, and
other courses in the chemistry curriculum. Use of the gas chromatograph, in
addition to other instruments, aids students in learning to design experiments,
in utilizing instrumental methods of analysis, and in learning to evaluate
experimental results. These skills will prepare students to do undergraduate,
graduate, or industrial research. Students use the instrument in organic
laboratory courses in which they design experimental paths and cooperate in
self-evaluation and peer evaluation of the experimental results.
