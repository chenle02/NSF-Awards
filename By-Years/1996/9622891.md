ABSTRACT Proposal: DMS-9622891 PI: Morpurgo The main goals of the proposed
research are: 1. Explicit computations of spectral invariants arising from the
zeta function of natural pseudodifferential operators, in terms of conformal
changes of metrics; 2. Analysis of such invariants on spaces such as
n-dimensional spheres, tori, balls and shells, via either known or new sharp
Sobolev or fractional integral inequalities. Morpurgo proposes to carry out this
research program for a large class of conformally covariant pseudodifferential
operators on a compact manifold (with or without boundary), and for some non-
conformally covariant operators, such as the ordinary Laplacian in dimensions
greater than 2. The computation will be effected via either variational or
direct new methods developed by the investigator. The explicit form of the
invariants on spaces like spheres, tori, balls and shells will then be related
to either known sharp inequalities, or will suggest possible new sharp
inequalities, to be derived by the investigator using symmetrization and end-
point differentiation arguments. Understanding how the spectrum of differential
operators change as the underlying geometry is varied is a fundamental problem
in mathematics and physics. The results produced in the research will provide
concrete and direct ways to control the spectrum of conformally covariant
operators in terms of the metric structure of surface, and vice versa. Such
operators arise naturally in the study of many physical phenomena, in fields
such as electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, and the theory of random
surfaces.
