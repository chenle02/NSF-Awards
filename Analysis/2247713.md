Dynamical systems model such varied examples as planetary motion, spread of
disease and the flow of electric currents in conductive material. The area of
mathematical dynamical systems consists of the study of the evolution over time
of a system under a transformation rule that governs the behavior of the system.
Methods from the study of dynamical systems, when applied to systems of
algebraic origin and admitting a lot of symmetries, shed light, perhaps
strikingly, on some of the oldest and most well-studied questions in
mathematics, namely solutions in whole numbers, or integers, of polynomial
equations, and approximations of arbitrary real numbers by fractions. In turn,
developments in number theory, driven by dynamical methods, have had interesting
and surprising applications, reaching recently as far as impacting wireless
communication technologies. This project aims to deepen these fruitful
connections between dynamics and number theory by, in particular, developing new
methods for counting the number of integer solutions to certain types of highly
symmetric polynomial equations. An important component of this project is geared
towards training graduate students in this area, at the intersection of
dynamical systems and number theory, through research and professional
mentoring.

The goal of this project is fourfold: 1) develop methods in homogeneous
dynamics to resolve outstanding questions regarding the distribution of rational
points near manifolds and self-similar sets; 2) develop techniques in the theory
of random walks and linear representations of algebraic groups aimed at studying
counting problems of integral points on affine homogeneous varieties; 3) develop
spectral tools for the study of the dynamics of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle
over the Teichmueller geodesic flow, along with applications to rigidity
problems for horocycle flows on moduli spaces of Abelian differentials; 4)
develop new methods for the study of the mixing properties of the geodesic flow
on infinite volume locally symmetric spaces of negative curvature.
