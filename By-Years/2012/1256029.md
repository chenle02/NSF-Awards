Cellulose is an essential component of every plant cell. It is also the most
abundant biopolymer on Earth and of great societal importance (food, clothing,
shelter and fuel). Therefore, identifying compounds that modulate cellulose
biosynthesis is critical to enhance biomaterials for human use. The current
project reasons that plant associated microorganisms secrete natural products
that are capable of modifying plant cellulose biosynthesis, and that this could
be systematically exploited to identify new bioactive compounds. Complexity of
natural small molecules generally limits the ability to isolate bioactive
compound(s). To overcome this hurdle, this project will couple chemical
fingerprinting with genetics and live cell imaging to identify bioactive
constituents and the mechanism(s) by which they act. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will have broad community impact through training via the Science
Readiness Program, a program tailored to provide a bridge for students between
high school and University and to enhance the pedagogy of professor, high school
teacher and student. Resources developed in this project will be deposited or
made available for others via an online database.
