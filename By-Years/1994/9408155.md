9408155 Fonstad Recent NSF-funded research at MIT has shown that InGaA1As
quantum- well, tunnel-barrier heterostructures can be produced with intersubband
energy level separations (n = 1 to n = 2) as large as 0.8 eV (1.55 um) and with
TE-, as well as TM-, optical activity. The proposed research project builds on
these results, and will focus (1) on developing structures with even larger
level separations; (2) on using femto-second pulse-probe techniques to measure
upper state lifetimes in quantum wells; (3) on studying the optical properties
(index of refraction and absorption coefficient) in the vicinity of the
intersubband absorption peaks, and on studying bias- and population-induced
changes in these properties; and (4) on incorporating quantum-well, tunnel-
barrier heterostructures in waveguide geometry optoelectronic devices
(modulators, switches, and detectors). The excited state lifetimes in quantum
wells are inherently very short (and can be shortened further using their tunnel
barriers) so it is anticipated that this research will lead to the realization
of faster, lower power devices than are presently available in the 1.5 um
spectral range. It is also anticipated that these devices will show superior
temperature stability because they are based on intersubband, rather than band-
to-band processes. ***
