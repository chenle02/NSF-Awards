This is a project engaging Ursinus College undergraduates in experimental
nuclear structure research. The project is part of an ongoing collaboration with
colleagues at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and
Florida State University (FSU). We will contribute to the understanding of the
evolution of shell structure, core polarization, and nuclear matter densities in
neutron-rich exotic nuclei via one-proton knockout and inverse-kinematics proton
scattering measurements at the NSCL.

The broader impact of the project includes maintaining an active research
program in nuclear structure on the Ursinus College campus. Ursinus College is a
national liberal arts college of about 1700 students with a long history of
strength in the sciences. This project will provide students opportunities to
apply their knowledge of physics outside the classroom, gain practical skills in
data acquisition and analysis, observe and participate in the operation of a
nuclear accelerator facility, and present their work to colleagues. The project
will span three years and support two students for 8-10 weeks per summer.
Participants will travel to the NSCL to perform experiments and analyze the data
at Ursinus. They will present their results to the Ursinus community as part of
the Ursinus College Summer Fellows Program and to the nuclear physics community
at American Physical Society/Division of Nuclear Physics meetings.
