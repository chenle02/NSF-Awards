Some aspects of photonics applications are adequately reproducible to be
advantageously designed, using computer aided design techniques. Moreover, as
the field develops, these techniques will be of increasing importance and will
become more pervasive. Such elements as switches, the "wire-like" guides for
transporting the optical signals from one-part of the circuit to another, the
devices for imparting information to the optical (modulators), coupling devices
for routing the optical signal along various selectable paths will all find
increasing benefit by numerical design procedures. The present effort involves
equipment essential for the development of this area.
