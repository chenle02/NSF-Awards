Proposal: DMS-9970363 Principal Investigator: Alexander M. Blokh

Abstract: Blokh plans to describe Milnor attractors for certain rational
functions, to determine their conformal measures, and to use the new notion of a
growing tree as a tool for studying dynamics on the Julia set (jointly with
Misiurewicz and Levin). In one-dimensional dynamics, Blokh and Misiurewicz
introduced the notion of super-persistent recurrence. The lack of such
recurrence at a point is a mild expanding property. This behavior implies recent
results by Blokh and Misiurewicz according to which wild attractors with
negative Schwarzian derivatives are super-persistently recurrent and limit sets
of critical points in a dense family of smooth interval maps are minimal. Blokh
intends to use this device to study further properties of attractors and
stability for smooth interval maps. He also hopes to extend the rotation theory
to graph maps and then study forcing among periodic orbit portraits.

Many processes in biology, the physical sciences, and economics can be modeled
by dynamical systems. Studying these models allows one to draw valid conclusions
about the processes themselves and their long-term behavior. This project is
aimed at studying a variety of such dynamical systems. Blokh intends to verify
that either the behavior of the system is on average chaotic (but almost the
same for the majority of initial conditions) or it coincides with the behavior
of systems starting at a special finite set of so-called critical initial
conditions. Also, a system is said to behave periodically if the same conditions
recur with the same frequency all the time (e.g., the motion of the planets
about the sun). Periodic dynamics are easier to study than more general motions,
which is why it is important to understand periodic systems as fully as possible
before probing the mysteries of more complicated systems. Blokh wishes to
characterize all periodic behaviors of dynamical systems using only finitely
many parameters. The results obtained will help to describe the possible
outcomes for a variety of processes and to explain the prevalence of certain
types of processes in both theoretical settings and the natural world.
