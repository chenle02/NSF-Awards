Abstract ATM-9406510 Cayan, Daniel Baumgartner, Tim University of California,San
Diego Title: Interanual, Interdecadal, and Centennial Climate Variability in the
Eastern North Pacific Over the Past 2000 Years The Santa Barbara Basin is
becoming increasingly important as a paleoclimate resource. The annual
microfaunal and isotopic record in the Santa Barbara Basin provides an
opportunity to reconstruct the late Holocene climate over one of the important
teleconnection centers of the northern hemisphere. The records appear to be
proxies for temperature and possibly other large-scale parameters of the region.
This award supports a three-part project to include: (A) develop the annual
biological records preserved in the Santa Barbara Basin as proxies for the
instrumental climate record; (B) a model will be constructed of the North
Pacific temperature and circulation over the instrumental record, approximately
1900- present; (C) using this model, the longer history preserved in the Santa
Barbara Basin fossil record will be sampled in order to reconstruct the regional
climate over the past 2000 years. This research is an interdisciplinary project
involving the Marine Life Research Group and the Climate Research Division of
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
