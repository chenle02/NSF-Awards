In this project the PIs will study fundamental physics at the subnuclear level
and its impact on our understanding of the Cosmos. A broad range of topics in
particle physics such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, neutrino physics and
grand unification are covered. Topics in cosmology cover the nature and origin
of dark matter and dark energy and their implications for large scale structure
of the universe. The unifying theme is the search for new physics that explains
various puzzles of the successful standard model of particle physics and
cosmology and their tests at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various
ongoing non-accelerator searches for new physics such as dark matter, neutrino
mixings, astrophysical anomalies and cosmic microwave background. These projects
will extend the frontiers of our understanding of quark-lepton phenomena and the
early Universe and may lead to discovery of new particles and forces. The
research program will support graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The
PIs will develop a strong program of research for high school and undergraduate
students, with an emphasis on students from historically black colleges. The
research work of this group will be disseminated through public and school
lectures, participation in science fairs, and media broadcasts. The proposal
will also enhance scientific collaboration with Johns Hopkins University as well
as partnerships with Howard University, Hampton University, and the University
of Iowa.
