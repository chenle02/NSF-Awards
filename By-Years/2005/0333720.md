This Targeted Research project pursues an enhanced vision of a collection, that
of creating and supporting an educational community that collaborates to address
a particular set of educational challenges. NSDL is being used as a
collaboration space for authors and users to work together iteratively, using
web-based tools, classroom experiences and measured learning outcomes, to create
effective materials that meet educational challenges. The well-documented
problem of educational innovations failing to achieve wide dissemination is
being addressed by using the digital library structure in combination with a set
of easy to use tools to engage the community of potential users in the
development process itself. Engaging the community of users in the development
process shortens the traditionally long feedback loop of formative assessment
based on a develop-disseminate-assess-modify cycle. The project is leveraging
the technologies of the Virtual ChemLab, CreateStudio, and the Online Learning
Initiative (OLI) at Carnegie Mellon to enable collaborative improvement of
students' educational experiences in a data-driven, scientific manner. The
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical
and Physical Sciences (MPS) is providing significant co-funding of this project
in recognition of the value of this work in advancing the larger goals of MPS.
