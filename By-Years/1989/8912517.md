The history of climate above the continental regions of the earth's surface is
less well-known than above oceanic regions. Discontinuities in sedimentation
limit our ability to acquire records of climate on the continents. Long records
of past continental climate are particularly rare. This proposal requests
support to reconstruct the history of climate for the last 5 Ma in south-central
Colorado. Using samples from a 130 meter drill core, the PIs will use
paleomagnetics and ash layers to provide chronologic control for the core and
will reconstruct past climate from palynological and paleontological proxy
indicators. The goal of the project is to correlate the climatic changes
observed in this region with the history of climate as it is recorded in the
oxygen isotopic composition of marine sediments. This research is important
because it will link the marine and terrestrial records of climate from the
Pliocene and Pleistocene intervals of earth history. This project is being
supported under the ROW/RIA program.
