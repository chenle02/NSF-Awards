This award in the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Andrew F. Montana, Dr. Carl F.
Prenzlow, and Dr. Patrick A. Wegner of the Department of Chemistry of California
State University at Fullerton to carry out a curriculum development project.
These workers will develop Macintosh II software for use in introductory
chemistry courses. Graphics and animational methods will allow "dynamical
visualization" of reaction mechanisms, gas behavior, photochemical reactions and
other processes. Development of three dimensional display of atomic, hybridized,
and molecular orbitals is also planned, along with interactive components on
basic concepts. This supplementary material will provide an alternative to
theoretical and mathematical explanations of phenomena and thus be of assistance
to beginning students. Approximately 600 students per year will use the
software, which will also be made available with supporting documentation to
other institutions.
