This award supports the Third General Assembly of Stratospheric Processes And
their Role in Climate (SPARC) to be held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
August 1-6, 2004. The SPARC community has been concerned for over a decade with
improving our current understanding of how changes in stratospheric composition
and dynamics affects global climate. The SPARC 2004 meeting will convene a
diverse group including both established researchers and early career scientists
to exchange data, results and ideas while engaging in substantive discussions on
current and emerging issues of relevance to global climate. Travel support under
this award will facilitate attendance by a number of early career scientists
from U.S. institutions. The broader impact of this award includes providing
unique and invaluable opportunities for young scientists to engage in
professional interactions in a focused and productive forum.
