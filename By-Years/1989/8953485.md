Silicon Run II is a sequel to an earlier film (Silicon Run I) about the
fabrication of integrated circuits. Silicon Run II focuses on testing and
packaging of integrated circuits, on the manufacturing of products that include
integrated circuits, and on a review of the history and economics of the
semiconductor industry. Funds for this project from other sources are
significantly greater than the NSF award.
