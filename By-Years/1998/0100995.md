Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will provide partial funding for a
USA&lt;br/&gt;delegation consisting of young Ph.D's and graduate
students&lt;br/&gt;to participate in the mathematics conference
entitled&lt;br/&gt;"Computational Methods and Function Theory '01,
which&lt;br/&gt;will take place during the period June 25-29, 2001
in&lt;br/&gt;Aveiro Portugal and will focus on the interactions
between&lt;br/&gt;certain areas of pure and applied mathematics. The grant
will&lt;br/&gt;also provide travel funding for several outstanding researchers
from&lt;br/&gt;eastern Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will provide
funding for a USA delegation of&lt;br/&gt;of young Ph.D's as well as graduate
students to participate&lt;br/&gt;in a conference that will emphasize various
aspects of the interaction&lt;br/&gt;between scientific computations and the
area of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;known as function theory. The conference will also
foster contacts&lt;br/&gt;between scientists from diverse cultures. For this
purpose,&lt;br/&gt;the funding provided will also help support some eastern
European&lt;br/&gt;participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
