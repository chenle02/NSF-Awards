The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of Alabama will enhance the research competitiveness of approximately 70
investigators working in five research clusters: (1) Coastal Marine Sciences;
(2) Land-Water Interfaces; (3) Modification of Material Surfaces; (4) Tailored
Interfaces in Composite Materials; and (5) Interactions Between Galaxies and
Their Environments. Six universities will participate: Auburn University;
Alabama A&M University; University of Alabama, Birmingham; University of
Alabama, Huntsville; and University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. The state's research
base will be strengthened by adding tenure- track positions in materials science
and biology; conducting an Agency Visitation Program will improve proposal
success rates by providing faculty travel funds for visits to federal program
officers; and implementing an Instrumentation Matching Grant fund. In addition,
The Alabama Technology Transfer Council will be established to develop improved
relationships with the private sector. Active participants in EPSCoR governance
will include key university administrators, state government officers, and
influential members of the private sector. Over the three-year award period the
State of Alabama and institutions will contribute $19 million to ensure the
success of the EPSCoR effort.
