9221697 Sih Drs. Sih and Krupa will use a blend of surveys in natural streams
and experiments in semi-natural streams to examine the effects of important
ecological factors (e.g., predation risk, food availability, population density,
and sex ratio) and individual traits (e.g., size, hunger level) on mating
behaviors that determine variation in reproductive success. Their study animal
is a semi-aquatic insect that is ideal for addressing these issues, because it
is very easy to mark, observe, census, and experimentally manipulate. This
research should yield important insights about how variation in ecological
factors influences the evolution of animal behaviors. The resulting behaviors,
in turn, have major impacts on population success. The work should thus
contribute significantly to theoretical understanding of the interface between
evolution, behavior, and ecology. This research should also have practical
importance in providing new insights into how environmental disturbances might
have unexpected effects on species' success through effects on reproductive
dynamics.
