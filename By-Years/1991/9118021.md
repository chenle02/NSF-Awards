Previous paleomagnetic studies of Ordovician-aged volcanic rocks from the
northern Appalachians indicate accretion of volcanic terranes to the margin of
Laurentia was complete by the late Silurian to early Devonian. These terranes
are thought to represent vestiges of lapetus Ocean. Their accretion was
accompanied by considerable strike-slip motion. This study will use
paleomagnetic measurements on Ordovician and Silurian rocks at the Laurentian
margin of Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Quebec and Maine to test existing models
of terrane accretion. The results will be of significance to understanding the
tectonic evolution of lapetus through the Paleozoic.
