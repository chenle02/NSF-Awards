This award supplements DMR-8617820, and provides support to conduct
international collaborative research in characterization of polymers. The PI's
have collaborated successfully before, and have an established and productive
working relationship. This cooperation between Ben Chu, SUNY Stony Brook, and
Ying Qicong, CAS Institute of Chemistry, draws on complementary expertise of the
two laboratories in polymer synthesis, chemistry, physics, and instrumentation.
Based on the results of prior cooperation and on the capabilites of the two
investigators, this proposal is recommended for support.
