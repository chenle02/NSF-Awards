DMS-9415657 Totik Totik will investigate several problems in the general areas
of approximation theory with special interest in applications of potentials and
in polynomials. The main topics include logarithmic potentials in the presence
of an external field, polynomial approximation with varying weights, fast
decreasing polynomials, asymptotic for orthogonal polynomials, zeros of
polynomials, and approximation by positive operators. Harmonic analysis combines
those elements of mathematics best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis. One
seeks to decompose complex problems into fundamental components. These
components are then analyzed for their basic characteristics. Finally, the
solution is reconstructed through a recombination of the components. The Fourier
series and Fourier transform are examples of tools used in this context; one
discrete , the other representing a continuous decomposition. Orthogonal
polynomials play an important role in certain segments of harmonic analysis
because (a) they arise naturally in the study of differential equations (b) they
can be used to represent large classes of functions and (c) they are often
easily computable.
