This action funds Carol Wang of Carnegie Mellon University to conduct a research
project, entitled "New probabilistically checkable proofs," during the summer of
2012 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The host scientists are Professors
Kazuo Iwama and Suguru Tamaki.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project includes gaining a deeper
understanding of how hard different mathematical problems are. Many problems
that arise in practice are thought to be hard to solve efficiently, and this
project, if successful, helps determine which problems remain hard even if we
allow approximate solutions.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
