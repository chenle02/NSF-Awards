The interaction of the solar wind with ionized gas confined by the earth's
magnetic field results in a long extension downwind, to a distance of hundreds
of earth diameters, of the magnetic field and gas (the magnetosphere) and the
generation of currents of millions of amperes. These currents (Birkeland, or
field aligned currents) link the solar wind - magnetosphere boundary region
(about 60,000 km above the surface), with the highly conducting ionosphere
(about 100 km above the surface), and create the striking displays of light
emission known as the aurora. They also disturb the ionosphere, and cause
interference with radio transmissions and military radar communications. This
award is for a study aimed at improving our understanding of the electric fields
associated with the generation of the current systems, using the scientific
radar at Sondestrom Greenland, and a chain of magnetometers.
