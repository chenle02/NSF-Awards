This project supports the 4th international symposia on Chemosynthetically-based
ecosystems to be held in Okinawa Japan June 29 to July 3rd, 2009. This symposia
focuses on the novel metabolism and adaptations of macro- and micro-organisms to
environments with elevated concentrations of reduced chemicals. The energy
harnessed during the biological oxidation of these chemicals (eg., S, CH4) is
ultimately stored as cellular organic carbon during CO2 fixation by prokaryotic
bacteria, which may occur as free living forms or as symbionts of macrofauna.
The symposia is being coordinated by an international team of scientists,
including members of the organizational committee from the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography and the University of Hawaii. The symposia will be attended by
researchers from numerous US institutions with diverse fields of discipline
including geochemistry, microbiology, molecular biology, ecology and
biogeography.
