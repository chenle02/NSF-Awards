A regenerable hydrogen-bromine battery is a high energy density system with
potential applications in space projects, storage systems for solar electric
power plants, and in transportation uses. The present hydrogen/bromine fuel cell
is characterized by the presence of hydrogen on one side and HBr/Br2 on the
other side of a solid Nafion and membrane. Nafion imposes certain constraints on
the system which limit it's usability. Due to the water content required for
Nafion (to maintain its ionic conductivity) as well as other engineering
considerations, a 48 percent HBr solution is used as a fully charged cathode
fluid. This requires a large amount of water which, although inert, adds
considerable battery weight and volume. Second, the cycling of this aqueous
liquid reactant concentration and therefore the Nernst potential varies
continuously. Third, bromine and bromide ions migrate to the hydrogen side
resulting in the poisoning of the electrode. The specific goal of this Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I grant is to develop a high
efficiency rechargeable hydrogen-bromine power source. A novel means to utilize
bromine and hydrogen bromide separately on opposite sides of an anion exchange
membrane as single phase reactants in the gaseous state will be explored in this
project. It is expected that this will alleviate the changing cell voltage with
the state-of-charge and reduce the water needed as well as offer the potential
for other performance improvements. A central factor is finding a suitable anion
exchange membrane which will support bromide ion transfer with high efficiency.
The membrane needs to perform in a water free environment or with reduced water
concentration and still maintain a low ohmic resistance. Based on preliminary
work, ruthenium oxide catalyzed carbon as the positive electrode and platinum or
palladium catalyzed carbon as the negative electrode will be tested. Successful
completion of this project will yield a rechargeable hydrogen/bromine battery
with relatively constant Nernst potential and a minimum water requirement. This
will lead not only to higher efficiency and light weight, but also to improved
system simplicity and reliability as well as presenting the potential for
further performance improvements.
