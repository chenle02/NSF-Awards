9313322 Das This project outlines the development of a design for quality
manufacturability (DFQM) method, to be used in the assessment of assembled
products. This method complements other methodologies which assess handling, and
processing manufacturability. The basis for DFQM is a set of common classes of
quality defects, and a set of factors which influence the occurrence of these
defects. A series of functional equations which derive the likelihood of a
defect occurring, on the basis of design data, are developed. The quality
manufacturability of a design is defined as the likelihood that defects will
occur during its manufacture in a standard plant. This project addresses the
eminent need for a methodology that enables product designers to evaluate the
quality manufacturability of a design. The availability of such a method not
only improves the quality yield of a plant, but also permits a shortening of the
product realization process. Both features are critical in improving
competitiveness.
