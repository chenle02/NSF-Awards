This award provides funds for 67% of the costs of acquiring a microscope system
with a heating/cooling stage for the study of microscopic fluid inclusions in
geological samples. The fluid inclusion system will be used by researchers in
the Department of Geological Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. The
University is to provide the remaining 33% of the costs. The Case Western
Reserve University Department of Geological Sciences has a research program in
sandstone diagenesis aimed at determining quantitatively the conditions and
timing of the different stages of sandstone formation. The study of fluid
inclusions in sandstone provides an independent and direct way to determine the
temperature and salinity of the waters trapped during formation.
