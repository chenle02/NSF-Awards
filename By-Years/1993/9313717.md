This research is supported by the NSF theoretical and computational chemisty
program. Improved computational techniques will be implemented in the General
Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System (GAMESS) program. This includes
the development and implementation of methods for performing electronic
structure computations for large molecules using massively parallel computers,
and computational methods for treating solvent effects. Electronic structure
theory is combined with dynamics to obtain a qualitative and quantitative
understanding of both thermodynamic and kinetic properties. The theory is
applied to: (a) the elucidation of single and multiple bonds between main group
and transition metals, (b) theoretical analysis of strained rings and
hypervalent bonding, and (c) the computation of potential energy surfaces for
and the prediction of reaction mechanisms of main group organometallic
reactions. Specific reactions include: (a) hydrosilation and coupling reactions,
(b) unimolecular decompositions and isomerations, and (c) reactions of multiply
bonded compounds. Electronic structure theory treats a molecule, or a molecular
assembly, as a mechanical system of strongly interacting electrons and nuclei.
In principle, all chemical behavior can be understood by solving the quantum
mechanical equations of motion of this many-particle system, but experience
shows that very heavy computations are required to achieve the accuracy required
to make reliable predictions of the chemical properties of moderately large
molecules. With the advent of modern supercomputers, particularly, of massively
parallel computers, this has become an active field of theoretical chemical
research. This project is an example of such research. It emphasizes the
application of the theory to compounds of Carbon, Silicon, and Titanium and the
bonding of these elements to organic molecules containing transition-metal atoms
such as iron. Of particular i nterest are moderately small molecules with
unusual chemical bond structures such as strained rings or double bonds such as
C=Si or Si=Si. Detailed study of the geometries and energetics of such unusual
molecules contributes to our ability to design much larger molecules which
possess these same bonding features or perhaps are formed by chemical reactions
involving transient species which possess them.
