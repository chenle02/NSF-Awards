This award will provide computational equipment (servers) which would support
research by three related groups of researchers into the frontiers of
Representation Theory, Number Theory, and Mathematical
Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Representation Theory group will
compute the Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials for all simple Lie groups up to
rank 9 and make the results of these computations readily available to
researchers worldwide. This group will also continue to explore the
combinatorial infrastructure of W-graphs and relate it to representation
theoretical invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Number Theory group
will carry out major computations of modular forms and Lfunctions, and greatly
enhance our understanding of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the
Riemann Hypothesis, two of the central problems in number
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical Physics group will
complete the first major step in the classification of off-shell representations
of Supersymmetry, a problem that has been open for three
decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
