Thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) display technology now produces matrix-
addressed self-luminous flat panels which come very close to providing the
capability for high- definition color television. The principal obstacle to
advancing this technology to full color video imaging is the need for a high
brightness, saturated-blue phosphor. The objective of Phase I was to show that
bright blue EL phosphor can be produced from chemical vapor deposited (CVD) zinc
sulfide. Ion implantation was used to introduce many different activator
elements into ZnS substrates. Blue photoluminescence was found from Tm-
implanted ZnS; however, a combination of other ion implanted elements gave much
stronger luminescence and a deep blue color. Rutherford backscattering analysis
and X-ray diffraction indicate that ion implanted CVD thin films of ZnS have
favorable stoichiometry and structure for TFEL devices, which will be fabricated
and tested in Phase II. Spire proposes for Phase II to continue investigation of
ion implanted blue electroluminescent phosphors. TFEL structures will be
fabricated from CVD-grown ZnS thin films, implanted with the new blue- emitting
dopants and co-dopants, implanted with control activators such as Mn and Tm, and
evaluated for EL brightness, chromaticity and persistence. Some optimization of
process and device fabrication parameters will be conducted. Ion implanted TFEL
devices have enormous potential for low-cost three-color displays because all
phosphor colors can be formed in the same thin film substrate.
