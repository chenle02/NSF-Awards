A program of specialized studies of classical gravitation will be carried out,
with emphasis on developing mathematical tools of interest for the formulation
of a quantum theory of gravity. This will involve 1) new formal approaches, 2)
enlargement of the symmetry group of the theory, and 3) development of new
geometrical tools to use in building up the theory. These mathematical advances
will be of interest on their own, as well as for applications to construction of
a quantum theory.
