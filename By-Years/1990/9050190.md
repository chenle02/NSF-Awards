The uniqueness of this program lies in a collaboration among a major publisher
of school science materials (D.C. Heath &amp; Co.), nationally known scientists
and science educators, federal agencies (National Aeronautics &amp; Space
Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, and the Civil Air Patrol), the University of
Colorado, and the U.S. Space Foundation. The result will be a complete basal
instructional materials program for grades 6,7, and 8. It will feature: o hands-
on, inquiry-based activities; o use of space and aviation technologies to
motivate students to study the life, earth, and physical sciences; o activities
centered on concrete representations of abstract scientific concepts; o a focus
on cooperative learning strategies; o approaches that encourage gender equity
and the participation of minorities and the disabled.
