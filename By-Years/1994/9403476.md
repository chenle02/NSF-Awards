9403476 Jannson This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
develops a prototype polymer-based optical bus (POB) for the shared memory
architecture of high speed data acquisition systemq. Key POB elements were
fabricated and tested successfully in Phase I. The optical power budget is below
20 dB, which is a low loss for greater than 50 boards. The electrical power
budget is around 5 watts. Based on an innovative optical backplane architecture,
the POB system, along with a new high speed bus protocol, is automatically
adaptable for high speed, high volume memory data acquisition systems and to
standard electrical bus architectures. Advantages of POB are: maximum data rates
great than 100 gigabits per second; a large number of boards; and one-order-of-
magnitude larger inherent backplane propagation speeds. The POB shared memory
architecture has potential for a new generation of distributed computing systems
for application in a wide range of physical measurements as well as in PCs and
work stations. It can also be applied in optical analog to electrical data buses
but at much higher speeds than presently possible.
