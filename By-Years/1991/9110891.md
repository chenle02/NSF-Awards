Multi-status insurance contracts cannot be completely modelled with traditional
actuarial techniques. Improved analysis of the stochastic nature of these
contracts will allow insurers to more aggressively price and market such
products for the benefit of both the insured and the policyholder. This project
will develop and analyze the formulas for the mean and variance of discounted
cash flows arising from multi-status insurance contracts such as long term
care(LTC) insurance. Where practical, the project will produce computer software
to evaluate these moment formulas. Where such formulas are impractical, the
project will present guidelines for the simulation of these moments. LTC
insurance will provide numerical examples of the calculation techniques. Results
will be submitted for publication in appropriate insurance and actuarial
journals.
