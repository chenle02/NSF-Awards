Harrell will work on the tunneling effect of quantum mechanics and on
intermittency in equations such as those arising in laser physics. Other
problems involve the interplay between geometry and analysis, and with attempts
to understand nonlinear phenomena. Spectral theory is central to many physical
problems; for example energy levels in quantum mechanics are determined as
eigenvalues of certain linear operators. However, singular operators or limits
lying outside the scope of well-established theories often arise in
applications, and motivate much of this project. Modern physics, quantum
mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth century. It is founded
firmly in the last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter and
to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance, electro-magnetism,
and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations for these developments,
collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of
Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles, to unified
field theory, which attempts to unite the four known forces into a single
theory.
