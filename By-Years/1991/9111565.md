A modification is proposed that should, for a very large class of processes,
guarantee asymptotic output model following for a very easily implementable
direct adaptive control algorithm that can be applied to multiple input multiple
output systems. This algorithm in order to satisfy a positive real constraint,
has had to incorporate supplementary feedforward dynamics, thus resulting in
stability but not perfect asymptotic tracking. The new modification by
incorporating part of the feedforward dynamics into the model is such that
perfect tracking of the augmented plant and model outputs implies perfect
tracking of the original outputs. The proposed research involves the stability
proof of the new modified algorithm, a study of procedures for designing robust
feedforward dynamics, and an experimental validation study.
