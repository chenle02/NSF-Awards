This grant provides continued support for a series of annual conferences on
macroeconomics. The conference series is aimed at bridging the gap between
frontier reserach in macroeconomics and policy analysis. Past conferences have
made a significant contribution to the testing of empirical implications of new
theories as well as the use of relevant theory to analyze policy issues of
current interest. The conference series will continue to encourage the writing
of empirically oriented papers by both established and promising young
economists. In addition, the series will continue to serve as a forum for
communication among economists from the different schools of macroeconomic
thought. The annual conference volume has become a widely cited and influential
research reference.
