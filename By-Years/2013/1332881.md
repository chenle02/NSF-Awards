Heterotrophic microbial communities are key players in the marine carbon cycle,
transforming and respiring organic carbon, regenerating nutrients, and acting as
the final filter in sediments through which organic matter passes before long-
term burial. Microbially-driven carbon cycling in the ocean profoundly affects
the global carbon cycle, but key factors determining rates and locations of
organic matter remineralization are unclear. In this study, researchers from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will investigate the ability of
pelagic microbial communities to initiate the remineralization of
polysaccharides and proteins, which together constitute a major pool of organic
matter in the ocean. Results from this study will be predictive on a large scale
regarding the nature of the microbial response to organic matter input, and will
provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting organic matter reactivity in
the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study will provide
scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students from
underrepresented groups. The project will also involve German colleagues, thus
strengthening international scientific collaboration.
