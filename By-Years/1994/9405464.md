9405464 Holmes This conference builds on a previous mineral bioprocessing
conference, but differs from other minerals bioprocessing conferences by
developing a dialogue between biotechnologists and practitioners. Industry
practitioners will describe the challenges and opportunities for biotechnical
applications in the minerals and fossil fuel fields. Biotechnology experts will
be brought in from the minerals, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and waste
remediation areas to share their experiences and discuss how recent advances in
these diverse areas could be applied to the minerals industry. The program will
be a combination of plenary sessions, large working group meetings, site visits,
and a variety of ad-hoc sessions. It is anticipated that the conference
proceedings will be published in a professional journal.
