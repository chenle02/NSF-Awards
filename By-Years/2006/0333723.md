This project develops a contribution to the NSDL that overcomes barriers to
mainstream use of image processing and analysis (IPA) in K-12 education. The
system (1) makes IPA accessible to mainstream educators and the public as an
easy to use tool for learning; (2) affords access by educators to extensive and
updateable archives of imaging data; and (3) provides a pedagogical structure
that helps educators use imaging data in a manner that supports attainment of
specific national education standards. The project creates a three-tiered
structure that supports student's use of IPA from basic explorations of how
imaging is used in various fields of science to original research on data
available from an archive. The first tier features tutorials that guide students
through case studies replicating research conducted by leading imaging
scientists and explains key concepts in imaging science. Tier two implements, in
an online format, updated versions of existing materials and new lessons based
on guided-discovery approaches. Tier three provides a structure for students and
teachers to conduct self-guided research using archive images as well as images
from selected Internet sources. Schools, teachers, and districts from across the
United States have been recruited to be testers for the project, representing a
cross-section of the educators and students who can be expected to use the
finalized system. Sustainability is addressed by producing CD-ROM versions of
the software and resources for sale online and via established resellers.
Additional online subscription is available through a "pay-per-license" service
for lessons and resources provided by the Web site. All of the developed
materials are available to NSDL developers at no cost. The Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences is providing significant co-funding of this project in
recognition of the importance of a digital library for the support of this
project to enhance tools and adopt and generate resources for image processing
and analysis for teachers and students.
