A collaboration will be established between the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, under the direction
of Dr. Larry Smarr, and the biological research group at the Whitehead Institute
for Biomedical Research at Cambridge, Massachusetts, under the direction of Dr.
Eric Lander. This collaboration will work toward developing a software package
for analyzing clone fingerprint data used for constructing physical maps of
genomes. Specifically, the project will involve extending the NCSA GelReader
software (already developed by NCSA) so that it will be capable of combining
information from multiple hybridization images of the same blot to obtain much
more accurate information about fragment sizes, thereby allowing NCSA GelReader
to be used for physical mapping projects.
