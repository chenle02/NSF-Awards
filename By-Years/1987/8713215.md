This proposal is for D and E region radar studies at Sondrestrom, Greenland,
using the new data acquisition hardware that is being installed at the site by
SRII and Cornell University personnel. The sensitivity of the radar for D and E
region wind studies will be significantly increased, and better height
resolution for studying thin layers of ions, and the height profiles of
ionization due to precipitating particles, will be available. The work is
scientifically important in view of the present lack of any radar studies of the
high latitude D/E region, and the need to know the dynamics and chemistry of the
region to complete global models of the coupling of that region to the
atmosphere as a whole. The high latitude mesosphere is the region through which
aurorally generated constituents such as nitric oxide apparently are transported
to the lower atmosphere. The PI has considerable prior experience of working
with this radar, and is well equipped to achieve the results anticipated.
