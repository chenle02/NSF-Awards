9318386 Lawler The determination of the transition probabilities for elements
observed in stellar spectra is basic to quantitative interpretations of the
spectra. With the availability of new instruments which produce high quality
spectra and the advent of new techniques for spectral analysis, the need for
accurate transition probabilities has increased. The PI will use a technique he
has developed, known as time-resolved, laser-induced fluorescence, to determine
the lifetimes of atomic levels. Combined with branching ratios these allow
accurate transition probabilities to be determined. With support from this grant
the PI will concentrate on comprehensive measurements for the iron group atoms
Co, Ni, Cr and Mn and measurements of light elements such as N and C. ***
