Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers the
chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the study of the physical
and chemical properties of materials. Fundamental knowledge of structure and
dynamics of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and liquid
crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques. Solid-state NMR studies
often complement those carried out using solution NMR and X-ray analysis. Access
to solid-state NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out
frontier research. This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the
Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at Princeton University to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer
suitable for carrying out solid-state NMR studies. The areas of research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1) Pulse shape
effects in solid-state NMR 2) Studies in heterocyclic chemistry 3) Solid-state
structural studies of hexaarylethanes 4) Organometallic intercalation compounds
as models for the reactions of metal complexes with inorganic surfaces 5)
Structural studies on oxide-bound metal complex catalysts 6) Structural and
dynamic studies of membrane-bound synthetic metalloporphyrins 7) Structure and
dynamics of the profilin:actin complex.
