This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposes a new network
architecture, SCAFFOLD, that directly supports the need of wide-area services.
SCAFFOLD treats service-level objects (rather than hosts) as first-class
citizens and explores a tighter coupling between object-based naming and
routing. A clean-slate, scalable version of the federated SCAFFOLD architecture
is being designed and prototyped. System components include programmable
routers/switches, resolution services for object-based lookup and forwarding,
and integrated end-hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center of people's "digital
lives" today are online services -- not the networks or computers on which they
run. The research ultimately explores what abstractions and mechanisms that will
make the future network a powerful, flexible hosting platform for wide-area
services (the so-called ``cloud''). In doing so, SCAFFOLD would lower the
barrier to deploying networked services that are scalable, reliable, secure,
energy-efficient, and easy to manage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes
a summer-camp outreach activity with schools serving under-represented groups to
build services on top of SCAFFOLD, new special course development, and
technology transfer with industry.&lt;br/&gt;
