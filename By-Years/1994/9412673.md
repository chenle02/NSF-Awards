This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This study will undertake a critical examination of co-management
processes as they are unfolding in three indigenous forest communities in the
Philippines. It seeks to understand the conditions under which co-management
arrangements lead to outcomes characterized by biological sustainability, social
equity, and self-determination for communities. Theoretical issues include how
stratification and power affect resource management practices. The principal
research methods are resource appraisal, censuses, semi-structured interviews,
participant observation, and secondary data analysis. %%% This research will
contribute to sociological understanding of community differentiation, resource
partitioning, common property management, state-locality interactions and the
conditions for cooperation or conflict. It will also improve the knowledge base
for policy decisions concerning resource management and the environment. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
