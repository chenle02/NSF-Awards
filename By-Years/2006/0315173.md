Mark Ratner of Northwestern University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to use analytic and numerical methods in
addressing non-equilibrium effects on electron transfer dynamics. Applications
include bath dynamics, geometric gating of mixing, the transition between
coherent and incoherent regimes, anharmonic domination of rates, Poisson
processes, rate constant turnovers, and control aspects of electron transfer.
Traditional models and newly developed methodologies will be utilized, in close
collaboration with experimental efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate aim
of this research is a reliable approach for understanding and controlling
dynamically dominated electron transfer in molecular and condensed phase
systems. Electron transfer is one of the most important processes in chemistry,
biochemistry, and materials science, affecting phenomena as diverse as
corrosion, weathering, and photosynthesis.
