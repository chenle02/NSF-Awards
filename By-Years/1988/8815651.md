This project provides continued support of mathematical research into problems
in partial differential equations and potential theory. Particular emphasis will
be placed on equations with coefficients which lack smoothness. Specifically, to
obtain mean-square estimates of operators arising in the solution of equations
with such coefficients. The form of the analysis is one of studying singular
integral operators defined along curves. The kernel is of Cauchy-type and the
boundedness of integral transforms reflects the smoothness of the solution of
the related differential equation. A second line of investigation will focus on
the non-linear phenomena of singularity formation. For example, three-
dimensional incompressible fluid flow with high Reynolds number exhibits
singularities in finite time even with smooth initial data which vanishes
outside bounded sets. This project is specifically concerned with what is called
Kato's conjecture. For certain differential operators a square root can be
defined. The domain of this square root is thought to be one of the basic
classes of functions used in the study of differential equations, Sobolev space.
This has been verified for one-dimensional operators by making the connection
with boundedness of Cauchy-kernel transforms on certain curves. What remains to
be done is the classification of the square roots' domain in higher dimensions.
Work on singularity formation combines numerical experimentation with general
theory. It is known that singularities in the flow can occur only through a
stretching of the vorticity, i.e. the curl of the velocity field becomes
unbounded. This makes numerical approximations of solutions which form
singularities a subtle issue. Emphasis in this research will be placed on a
simple prototype model in which the transport term will be studied closely. The
object is to see whether the transport terms delay or accelerate breakdown of
the solution.
