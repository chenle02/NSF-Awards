support a multi-disciplinary training program in biophysical aspects of cellular
processes at Rutgers University-Newark, an urban campus with significant
enrollement of minority students. The faculty group have excellent research
programs in three related areas: structure and dynamics of biological
macromolecules, analysis of cellular transport mechanisms, and biophysics of
excitable cells. The award will support training of students at the
undergraduate and graduate levels; funds awarded will provide student stipends
and tuition, purchase research instruments and supplies to be used by trainees,
seminars by outside experts and student travel. Current training activities will
be enriched by three new laboratory courses and additional required rotations in
faculty laboratories. ***
