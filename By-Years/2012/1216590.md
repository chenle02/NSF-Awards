This proposal is awarded support for the first of five years of operation under
a renewal of the current NSF Cooperative Agreement, OCE-0500180. Ship awards
will be renegotiated each year and is based on the number of days of ship time
in support of NSF funded research program. R/V Kilo Moana, a Navy-owned research
vessel, is operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet by University of Hawaii under Charter Party
N00014-08-L-0651 with Office of Naval Research and a Cooperative Agreement with
NSF. In 2012, Kilo Moana anticipates operating 238 days, of which 201 days will
be in direct support of NSF peer-reviewed sea-going programs. Intellectual and
Technical Merit Use of R/V Kilo Moana allows researchers to make cost-effective
studies of a wide array of topics in ocean research, including physical,
chemical, biological and geological oceanography and ocean engineering. A major
emphasis is the study of ocean currents, nutrients, CO2 and biota that together
control the physical, biological and chemical processes in the surface ocean,
the flux of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere, and the ecology of marine
life. In 2012, the first year of the proposed new cooperative agreement, these
studies will occur during focused investigations around Hawaii (Karl, Church,
Sachs, Alford, Sweeney). Broader Impacts Studies of ocean processes undertaken
for NSF-funded researchers on R/V Kilo Moana include projects that are part of
large international efforts to understand the global carbon cycle, coupled
ocean-atmosphere climate forcing, and ocean ecosystem dynamics and productivity
all of which are environmental and public policy issues with direct societal
impacts. In addition, this year R/V Kilo Moana will support 2 cruises (Richards)
to the western equatorial Pacific to examine mixing in the equatorial
thermocline, a process that plays an important role in ocean atmosphere
interactions including heat transfer, ultimately a key factor in climate
processes. R/V Kilo Moana is at the cutting edge of research vessel technology,
and we seek to maximize her exposure to the public as part of the Universitys
commitment to outreach and education. We provide high school teachers/students
as well as graduate and undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in
our State-and federally-funded cruises, including dedicated student/teaching
cruises. We give a high priority to requests for tours of our ships and
supporting facilities. In general, we have an open door policy for individuals
and groups that are interested in our research ships, facilities, and research
operations
