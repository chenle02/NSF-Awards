The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I
project is to enable new health diagnostics, advance personalized medicine, and
accelerate research for various diseases, including many types of cancers. Many
methods used to diagnose disease are limited by the methods used to process
patient samples. Commonly used processes can disrupt or destroy disease markers
present in samples, leading to concerns about diagnostic dependability and
accuracy. The proposed product platform can address this pain point by retaining
disease markers as well as increasing yields which results in higher-fidelity
experimental results and ultimately, enhances diagnostic
medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance the development
of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches
adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage
these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical
applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. To fulfill its
promise as a highly compelling alternative to existing methods, the following
technical hurdles will be addressed in this project: 1) determining the optimal
composition and design of the material, 2) validating the effects of the
platform on cells, 3) using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing
purposes, and 4) benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry
methods for adherent cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
