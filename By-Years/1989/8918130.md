The spatial dispersion and foraging movements of seabirds around South Georgia
will be examined as to prey dispersion and environmental heterogeneity.
Mathematical models of foraging and dispersal developed initially for insects
will be extended and modified for seabird aggregation, movement and foraging.
Both the insect and seabird systems involve mobile consumers that seek highly
aggregated resources. The application of behavioral-based modeling to seabirds
will explain patterns at the population and ecosystem levels. Such a mechanistic
approach to analyses of distributional data has not previously been attempted
with seabirds. The results should substantially improve the interpretation of
spatial data on seabirds taken at sea. To construct models, data collected on a
series of radial transects around Bird Island, South Georgia, during the nesting
season will be used. To test the models, additional transects at South Georgia
in the austral winter, concentrating on two species with different diets, the
Common Diving-Petrel and Kerguelen Petrel, will be conducted. Spatial patterns
between species using two-dimensional spectral analysis will be described and
behavioral decisions of individuals will be linked to spatial dispersion of
populations using spatially based models of partial differential equations.
