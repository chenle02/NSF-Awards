9355471 Vieux The exchange will foster expanded collaborative activities through
the visit of Dr. Kaleta to the University of Oklahoma and the visit of the PI to
the Institute of Environmental Engineering. Both investigators will benefit from
the exchange which will increase the scientific infrastructure through expertise
developed during the two week visits. Dr. Kaleta's visit will be timed to
coincide with the course taught on Air Quality Management. He will be providing
several guest lectures on air quality in Poland. This interaction with students
will provide an international theme to an important topic in the U.S. and the
world. Dr. Kaleta will participate in research activities in the Environmental
Modeling and GIS Laboratory which is under the PI's supervision. These
activities will include air quality modeling and Geographic Information System
analyses. The two week visit to Poland by Dr. Vieux will foster collaboration
with Polish colleagues at the Institute of Environmental Engineering. During
this period Dr. Vieux will help install air quality models and a Geographic
Information System on existing workstations at the Institute. ***
