The investigators will develop a model of anomalous electron heating in the E
region during geomagnetically active periods. In the presence of large electric
fields at altitudes between 100 and 130 km in the ionosphere, the electrojet
current becomes unstable to the modified two-stream or Farley-Buneman
instability, which may significantly affect the electron temperature and the
influence the chemical equilibrium of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. This
study will address the major implications of this heating, including the
enhanced production of nitric oxide. Also, the non-Maxwellian nature of the
electron distribution function affects the interpretation of incoherent scatter
radar measurements. Furthermore, the modifications in the ionospheric
conductivity due to the high electron temperatures will change the current
structure in the ionosphere. The study requires a model for the electron cooling
processes, as well as the turbulent electric fields that produce the heating.
This is an interdisciplinary project involving plasma physics, atmospheric
sciences, and computer modeling, and is important for understanding the energy
budget of the upper atmosphere.
