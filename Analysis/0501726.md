Abstract

Geometric function theory and Loewner evolutions

Rohde will continue to investigate conformal mappings generated by the Loewner
differential equation and related topics. The Loewner differential equation
describes the flow associated with the conformal mappings onto a continuously
increasing sequence of simply connected planar domains. It encodes such a
sequence of domains into a real-valued function, the driving term of the
equation. The recent discovery of the stochastic Loewner evolution SLE by Oded
Schramm (the driving term is one-dimensional Brownian motion), together with
results such as Smirnov's proof of convergence of critical percolation clusters
to a SLE(6), has opened up a new area of investigations involving conformal
mappings, probability theory and mathematical physics. The list of critical
lattice processes from statistical physics that are conjectured to converge to
SLE is constantly growing, and driving terms different from Brownian motion are
under investigation.

Self-similar sets (so called "fractals") such as the van Koch snowflake have
played an important role in mathematics because they serve both as toy models
for physical phenomena, and are ameanable to mathematical analysis (dynamics,
ergodic theory, conformal mapppings). The more recent recurrent appearance of
"random fractals" (sets that resemble fractals but are only statistically self-
similar) in various branches of mathematics, probability and statistical physics
necessitates a mathematical foundation allowing rigorous analysis. Schramm's SLE
is one of the most exciting developments in this direction and has resulted in
verifications of numerous predictions made earlier by physicists. The core of
Rohde's research is to better understand random fractals and to answer several
questions about them by means of conformal mappings.
