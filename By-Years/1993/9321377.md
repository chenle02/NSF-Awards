9321377 Buikstra With National Science Foundation support Drs. Jane Buikstra,
Jane Wheeler and collaborators will study archaeological camelid remains
recovered from a number of sites in Southern Peru. Because of the excellent
preservation characteristic in the dry desertic environment, the mummified
remains permit examination of hair and stomach contents and the extraction of
DNA. The sites span several centuries and the camelid remains were recovered in
clear cultural contexts since the animals were in fact purposely buried and not
consumed as food. The research team will conduct a number of specialist analyses
which will shed light on the degree of domestication of these animals, clarify
species identifications and illuminate the role domesticates played in
prehistoric Peruvian society. Several camelid species, including llama and
alpaca, were domesticated in the New World and played a central role for
prehistoric peoples of the region. They served as sources of transportation, of
fiber for both utilitarian clothing and highly valued woven objects and as food.
The rise of complex societies both worldwide and in the Andes is closely tied to
the development of domestic plants and animals. Howevep because the skeletons of
different camelid species look much alike and because it is difficult to
separate domestic from wild animals, archaeologists have found it hard to
determine when camelids were domesticated and how they were used. The proposed
research which examines mummified remains from a variety of scientific
perspectives will help to answer this question. Camelids play an important role
in many areas of highland South America today. An understanding of their
prehistoric use may help to devise more efficient herd management practices.
