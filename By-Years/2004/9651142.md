A Kentucky consortium composed of six colleges in the University of Kentucky
Community College System, Northern Kentucky University and Morehead State
University are joined by two colleges in Florida and Georgia to adapt ongoing
graphics calculator and computer algebra system projects for use with the new
TI-92 and CBL (Calculator Based Laboratory). The project kicks off with an
already-funded workshop at Northern Kentucky University and adapts already
existing CBL/II-82/CAS activities to the new hand-held system. The project
focuses on calculus instruction, with extensions to individual precalculus,
physics, engineering technology, and teacher training courses at various
colleges. The project can give the consortium members a `jump start` on
exploring appropriate use of the hand-held CAS capabilities in the curriculum.
