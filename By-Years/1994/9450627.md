9450627 Gosser City College requests support for a planning process leading to
the redesign and modernization of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at City
College and partner community colleges. The planning will focus on extension of
a new teaching model, Workshop Chemistry, piloted at the College with NSF
support. The model emphasizes collaborative learning and creates more active
roles for students in the teaching and learning processes, moving away from the
passive learning of the lecture mode. The preliminary design of course modules
that will form the basis of the Workshop Chemistry curriculum is a key aspect of
the planning process. The modules can include any combination of laboratory,
computer and problem solving work. The project directors will work with faculty
collaborators from the senior and community college levels to translate their
ideas into module outlines. The outcome of the planning phase will be a detailed
plan for specification of the course modules and how they will be integrated
into the curriculum. The planning process as well as the final project will
involve as partners faculty in other science disciplines, engineering, health
sciences, architecture and education, as well as individuals from industry; this
will facilitate the design of a curriculum which promotes students' ability to
apply chemistry concepts to other fields.
