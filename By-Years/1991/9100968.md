The first objective of this project is to develop a formal model for reasoning
about program executions and race conditions, allowing different types of race
conditions to be precisely defined and properties of various techniques to be
proven and compared. This model will distinguish between the program's actual
behavior, its potential behavior, and its observed behavior. The second
objective is to develop dynamic techniques for detecting race conditions as
accurately as possible given the constraint of limited run-time information.
These techniques aid the programmer in debugging by locating those races that
are direct manifestations of program bugs and not artifacts caused by other
races, imprecise run-time traces (causing false races to appear real), or
implicit synchronization (caused by shared-memory references). These techniques
analyze the observed behavior to conservatively speculate on races that either
did occur or had the potential of occurring, and that were unaffected by any
other race in the execution. The result of this research is both a theory in
which to reason about race conditions and prove properties of techniques for
race condition detection, and techniques that aid the programmer by efficiently
locating those race conditions that are of interest for debugging.
