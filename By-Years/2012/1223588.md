The vast majority of the code in most applications comes from the libraries it
imports, rather than the program itself. As a result, hackers often exploit
flaws in libraries like glibc or openssl that are used across multiple
applications instead of attacking individual flaws in code specific to the
application. This makes it easier for an attacker to compromise many
applications at once with a single exploit. This work isolates the impact of
flaws in a deployed program into the smallest area possible. This will
dramatically increase the security of applications in the cloud, on mobile
phones, and everything in between.

To achieve this goal, this research develops a new abstraction that acts as a
lightweight and extremely efficient intra-process isolation mechanism that
builds on recent advances from operating system virtualization and memory-safe
code execution (such as SFI). This abstraction, called a cage, allows different
pieces of code that execute in the same process to be isolated from each other.
This means that a flaw within a piece of code can only be used to exploit the
code within that cage. Each cage also conceptually is its own process from an
resource accounting standpoint. In addition, calls between cages are extremely
lightweight and do not require a context switch or OS intervention. The cage
abstraction provides an isolation mechanism that is high-performance and with
very low overhead while improving application security.
