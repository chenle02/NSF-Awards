AST 9619381 Collaborative Project: Galactic Stellar Populations: Chemistry,
Kinematics, &amp; Chronology. Dr. Bruce Carney, University of North Carolina,
and Dr. John Laird, Bowling Green University, will carry out a three part
observational project relevant to the study of the structure of our Galaxy. The
first part is to study the relationship between the thick and thin disks of the
Galaxy by analyzing three old- star samples, each of which has more than 1000
stars. The second part is to study the outer disk by obtaining the ages and
compositions of stars in the southern Galactic warp. The third part is to study
abundance patterns in stars with composition differences among representative
halo stars. ========================================
