The investigators will observe, model and study the spatial-temporal structure
and variability of the semidiurnal tide in the middle atmosphere. The focus will
be on the Arctic and Antarctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere horizontal wind
and temperature fields. The mesosphere and lower thermosphere, at an altitude
between 80 and 120km above the surface of the earth, is a highly dynamic region
that couples the lower atmosphere (troposphere/stratosphere) with the upper
atmosphere thermosphere/ionosphere). Of particular importance in this region are
both the upward propagating thermally forced atmospheric tides and global scale
planetary waves. Both of these phenomena transport heat and momentum from the
lower atmosphere into the upper atmosphere. Studies in recent years have
indicated that the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) mesosphere and lower
thermosphere possess a rich spectrum of planetary waves that had previously gone
undiscovered. These planetary waves can interact with the sun-synchronous
migrating semidiurnal tide modifying its spatial and temporal structure while
giving rise to the nonmigrating semidiurnal tide. Understanding the structure
and variability of the semidiurnal tide is an important step to understanding
the global heat and energy balance of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The
data used for this project will include horizontal wind measurements from a
global network of 30 ground-based meteor and medium frequency radars.
Additionally, wind and temperature measurements from the NASA TIMED satellite
will be combined with the radar data. It is expected, from previous
observations, that planetary waves will play a significant role in the
variability of the semidiurnal tide. For this reason the structure of the
semidiurnal tide and the structure of the planetary waves will be estimated
simultaneously. These estimates will be analyzed in conjunction with both linear
mechanistic and global circulation models to aid in the interpretation of the
observations and increase knowledge about the semidiurnal tide. As part of this
effort a web based tool to ingest the radar data from the global network will be
employed. Data submitted to the database will be processed and then disseminated
via a website, the TIMED database and the CEDAR database. Such a database is
required for this and future efforts that propose to make use of the global
network of mesosphere and lower-thermosphere radar wind measurements.
