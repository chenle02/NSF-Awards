This proposal is funded to determine whether the Ge/Si record observed in
siliceous sediments from Antarctica is a global record by measuring samples from
three cores throughout the Pacific basin at low resolution and one at high
resolution. Capturing detailed Ge:Si variations has implications for
understanding the Si cycle, global variations in weathering, seafloor volcanisms
and the Antarctica biological pump.
