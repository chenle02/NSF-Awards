With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Arnold Rheingold from University of California San Diego will upgrade an X-ray
diffractometer with a high-flux, high-energy microfocus source and a new
detector. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels,
especially in areas such as (a) carbon dioxide-fixation chemistry, (b) designed
protein synthesis, and (c) studies of post-synthetic metal-organic framework
modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The high-
flux, high-energy source will generate a high flux of X-ray that will allow
studies of very small crystals or poorly diffracting crystalline materials. The
studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and
inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will
be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at UC San Diego but
many other neighboring universities and colleges.
