This award supports the International REU site for Gravitational Physics hosted
by the Physics Department at the University of Florida, Gainesville. The Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and NSF supported Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatories (LIGO) projects take advantage of a growing
number of research-able faculty at small and minority colleges in support of
their research efforts. At this REU site, undergraduate students will have an
opportunity to establish contact with, experience the research environment of,
and work beside, international collaborators involved in all aspects of
gravitational wave detection. They will be encouraged to develop, on their own
accord, ongoing projects with their international partners. Exposure to research
will help cultivate students' independence, while the experience in an
international setting will furnish them with contacts within a global network,
as they pursue their future research. In addition, interaction with large,
focused collaborations such as LIGO/Virgo and eLISA can catalyze exposure of
these students to the realm and scope of
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detection of gravitational waves requires
extremely sophisticated techniques in experiment and analysis; it also involves
large facilities, significant manpower and international collaborations.
Research projects will take place at a variety of locations, including the
Albert Einstein Institute, Hannover; APC, Paris; the National Astronomical
Observatory, Tokyo; University of Glasgow; University of Birmingham; Cardiff
University; University of Adelaide; Australian National University, Canberra;
the University of Western Australia, Perth; Seoul National University, Seoul;
Laboratoire de l'Accélérateur Linéaire, Orsay; National Institute for Subatomic
Physics (NIKHEF), Amsterdam; University of Melbourne; and INFN laboratories,
Italy - all in conjunction with the University of Florida.
