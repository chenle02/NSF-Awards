Theoretical studies of photoionization on atomic systems are proposed which are
an extension of the authors previous work. An important part of the proposal is
the development of computer codes which will incorporate relativistic effects
into the many body perturbation theory (MBPT) approach used previously and will
thus make possible an analysis of these effects in MBPT calculations of
photoionization.
