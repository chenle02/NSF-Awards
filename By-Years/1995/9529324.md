AST 95-29324 Quasars, as the most distant known objects in the universe, probe
the universe back to the time when it was less that 10% of its present age.
However, there remain many questions about the nature of quasar evolution. To
resolve some of these questions, a new, deep multicolor survey for quasars and
AGNs has been undertaken with a large format CCD and the KPNO 4-m telescope.
Photometrically calibrated images in six filters ranging from 034 to 0.86 um and
covering 0.83 sq. deg down to B = 23.8 have been obtained and reduced. A catalog
of over 21,000 stellar objects with magnitudes or upper limits and error
estimates in all the filters has been assembled. Some follow-up spectroscopy has
also been obtained for selected objects. In this program, the data analysis will
be completed and the data published and made available to the astronomical
community. In addition, further spectroscopic observations will be made to
determine the properties and evolution of both high redshift quasars and
quasars/AGNs near redshift 2, where a determination of the luminosity function
will provide significant constraints on models of quasar evolution. Infrared
observations will be used to investigate the possible evolution of the continuum
and emission-line spectra of high-redshift quasars. The nature and abundances of
the compact, narrow emission-line galaxies will be studied to determine their
chemical history and evolutionary state.
