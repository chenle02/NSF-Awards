Although great progress in understanding the variation in plant mating systems
has been made in the past century, most studies have focused on the role of the
negative effects of inbreeding. Recently, a different approach has been
developed, one that is based on a general analysis of plant reproduction and
pollination biology. It assumes that rates of self-fertilization are determined,
at least in part, by the relative amount of self and outcross pollen on stigmas
--an assumption called the mass-action assumption. Preliminary work suggests
that models incorporating the mass-action assumption may be able to explain the
full range of observed plant mating systems, even without considering the
effects of inbreeding. This preliminary work will be extended in two ways.
First, the mathematical models will be extended to include (1) a more realistic
representation of the spatial structure of plant populations and (2) inbreeding
depression. Second, experimental tests of the model predictions will be made by
taking advantage of a well studied mating system polymorphism in Senecio
vulgaris (1) to make direct estimates of the key features of the model in
natural and experimental populations and (2) to investigate the role of
frequency-dependent pollen export in maintenance of the variations in mating
system.
