Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal : IIS-0229808&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mark
Kornbluh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, proposes to advance
methods of higher-level analysis of diigital spoken word repositories. Starting
with a rich collection of digitized audio resources, associated texts and
images, and a set of integrated online annotation tools, the project will build
integrated tools aimed at overcoming the lengthy and repetitive search and
browse activity associiated with the use of such archives. The poject willl also
test the benefits to undergraduate learning of integrating the new resources
into courses at the undergraduate level by measuring the effects of such
indicators as the pace of content introduction and retention, and gains in aural
literacy. The IT research is primarily concerned with integration of existing
technologies into custom tool kits for online learning environments. This is a
collaborative effort of Michigan State University, Northwestern University and
Glasgow Caledonian University in partnership with the National Archives and
Records Adminiistration and the BBC-Information &amp; Archives.&lt;br/&gt;
