Investigators conduct further terrestrial nightglow observations to characterize
the 500-1000 nm region, initially using long integration times and nightly co-
adding spectra to maximize signal-to-noise ratio. The initial goal, obtaining a
high-quality survey spectrum, is expanded with higher resolution measurements of
isotopic bands in the b-X O-O band region. Accurately determined intensities of
these bands (and other transitions), and their variability with vibrational
level, provide important information on the energy flow among the oxygen
electronic states, the ultimate source being the recombination of oxygen atoms.
Simultaneous SRI experimental programs also stand to benefit some of these
observational questions.
