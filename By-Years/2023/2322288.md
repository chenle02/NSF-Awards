Advances in genomic tools are poised to enable novel analyses of evolution. In
long-lived, slow growing conifers, such as pinyon pine, genomic tools offer a
window into processes that occur over timescales that do not lend themselves to
short-term experiments. Pine trees are important species to many of the worldâ€™s
ecosystems and it is important to understand how their unique genetic
characteristics affect their evolutionary response to environmental change. This
is especially crucial for the pinyon pine, Pinus edulis, which is expected to
decline precipitously under climate change. The large size and complexity of
pine genomes have limited the insights gained from genetic work to date. Recent
technological advances make the assembly of a good quality genome in a pine tree
feasible. The lead researcher will learn new genomic methods and merge that with
extensive knowledge of pinyon pines. Tribes and agencies in the southwestern US
will use information from this project to manage pinyon woodlands. Additionally,
pinyon pine seeds are a critical food source for the pinyon jay which has
recently been proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act. This
project will use long and short read DNA sequencing of seed tissue to assemble a
complete genome sequence for Pinus edulis. The lead researcher will be trained
to interpret the genome using sequencing of genes from multiple tissues of the
sequenced tree, a sample of trees from across the species range, and offspring
from a hybrid zone subjected to variable growing conditions in common gardens.
This training will be provided by a collaboration with Dr. Wegrzyn and her
laboratory at the University of Connecticut. The research will examine how
genome structure affects expression across climate and genetic gradients. The
genome will be compared to other pine genomes to assess gene family structure,
copy number variation, and other characteristics of the genome. Sampling of a
hybrid zone in a location with high drought stress will help answer questions
about the role of hybridization, expressed genes, and gene regulation in
morphological variability in a hybrid zone. This will lead to recommendations
for the genetic management of the species. This collaboration will lead to
additional proposals exploring novel areas such as investigating the role of
stress in inducing retrotransposon activity, the resulting new variants, and the
fate of those new variants in evolving pine populations.
