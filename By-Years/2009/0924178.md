Dr. Douglas J. Rogers (Yale University) will investigate the changing nature and
functions of "petro-states" in the modern world economy. His research will focus
on oil companies in present-day Russian society, using the Perm Region of the
Urals as a case study. Lukoil, the primary oil company operating in the Perm
Region, has pumped enormous sums of money into social and cultural projects over
the last decade, often partnering with state offices and other companies to fund
everything from museums and youth festivals to the reconstruction of churches
and scholarly research on ethnicity. Rogers will explore the effects of these
highly visible sponsorship activities on configurations of state and market,
concepts of citizen and citizenship, and, ultimately, the petrostate itself,
which appears to becoming quite distinct from the postcolonial oil-exporting
states most familiar to social scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogers will
conduct research in four different districts of the Perm Region, in order to
investigate the local significance of social and cultural projects funded by new
oil wealth. He will collect primarily qualitative data through a variety of
ethnographic research methods. Data will come from semi-structured and
unstructured interviews, employment and training histories, cultural project
narratives, histories of particular cultural objects, participant observation,
and archival and newspaper research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is
important because existing social science research focuses primarily on
international pipeline politics or the manipulation of oil wealth to support and
contest political power. Very little is known about how oil has affected local
society, culture, and state in today's global political economy. This project
will be among the first to approach recent developments ethnographically,
exploring and then theorizing the effects of oil-driven social and cultural
change at the ground level.
