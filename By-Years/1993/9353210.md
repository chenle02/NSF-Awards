Researchers in mathematics education are writing foundational papers to be
included in the new Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences series
RESEARCH IN COLLEGIATE MATHEMATICS EDUCATION. These papers serve both pure and
applied purposes, contributing to the field of research in undergraduate
mathematics education and informing the direct improvement of undergraduate
mathematics instruction. The dual purposes imply dual but overlapping audiences.
Papers focus on learning within particular mathematical domains as well as on
more general cognitive process such as problem solving, skill acquisition,
conceptual development, mathematical creativity, and cognitive styles. Papers
also deal with issues associated with variations in teaching methods, or
classroom and laboratory contexts. More broadly, research may address
institutional arrangements intended to support learning and teaching; for
example, curriculum design, assessment practices, or strategies for faculty
development.
