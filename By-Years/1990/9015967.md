This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a high performance, high field,
instrument (500 MHz for proton observation) that will be dedicated to
macromolecular structure determination. It will serve a small group of
investigators in the chemistry department of Yale University who have ongoing
projects directed at structure elucidation of biological macromolecules. These
projects span a range of subjects that include DNA and RNA binding proteins,
proteins and nucleic acids important in ribosome function, proteins important in
lipid biosynthesis, and molecules important to cell surface recognition.
