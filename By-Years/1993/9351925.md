"Real Time Microprocessor Application" uses solderless breadboards and test
equipment to support a laboratory oriented course in Microprocessor based
design. Each student builds a 68000 microprocessor based computer which is
applied to real time systems (currently, distributed control of an electric
train set). The instruction not only covers basic computer interface and
operation, but will allow focus on interrupts and their timing considerations,
multi-tasking, priority levels, and communications issues. By having each
student build up his own processor from the device level, students become more
aware of issues that can be overlooked with board level products.
