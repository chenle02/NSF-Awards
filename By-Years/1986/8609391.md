This research extends the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to a wide class of
problems involving large strains and large rotations relating to the analysis of
inelastic deformation of thin shells. A key issue to be resolved in the large-
strain and large-rotation class of problems is the constitutive model which
adequately represents material behavior while retaining efficiency in the
computational procedures. Comparisons of BEM and FEM methods will be made in
this study to ascertain the most effective numerical approach to each class of
problems.
