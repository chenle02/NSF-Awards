This project addresses techniques algorithms for design and implementation of a
debugging system for parallel programs. The use of flowback analysis provides
information on causal relationships between events in a program's execution,
without having to re-execute the program for debugging. Flowback analysis
directly focuses the programmer on the cause of a problem. Two major issues are
addressed: (1) making flowback analysis practical by developing a method that
significantly reduces the overhead induced during program execution, and (2)
extending the semantics of flowback analysis to parallel programs. Incremental
tracing, using semantic analyses of the debugged program, makes the folwback
analysis practical with only a small amount of trace generated during execution.
Flowback analysis is extended to apply to parallel programs, handling
synchronization activities, dependencies between processes, and shared memory
access. A method to detect race conditions in the interactions of the co-
operating processes is also described. The techniques and algorithms necessary
to efficiently debugging both parallel and sequential programs are incorporated
in a prototype system built on a commercially available multiprocessor.
