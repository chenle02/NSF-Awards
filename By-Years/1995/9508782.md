9508782 Papantonopoulos This proposal supports a six month postdoctoral
fellowship for Dr. Sotiris Papantonopoulos of the Department of Engineering
Management of the George Washington University. Project funding will enable Dr.
Papantonopoulos to undertake a collaborative research effort with Dr. Takao
Enkawa of the Tokyo Institute of Technology. The investigators intend to study
the methodology of cross-functional design teams, including how design teams
collaborate to generate design conjectures, resolve trade-offs, and reach
decisions. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Papantonopoulos will have the
opportunity to become familiar with researchers and research techniques at the
Tokyo Institute of Technology while contributing to the overall research effort.
The six month visit by Papantonopoulos will enable him to establish a personal
and professional link with a leading engineer in Japan. The PI's studies of
concurrent engineering design in Japan should be of benefit to the U.S.
engineering community upon his return. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
through an international collaboration. ***
