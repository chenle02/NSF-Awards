Recommendation: Funds are provided for C-13 isotopic analysis of planktonic
foraminifera sacculifer and benthic foram wuellerstorfi in two piston cores from
the western equatorial pacific. This will provide arecord of surface and deep
water changes in total dissolved inorganic carbon for the past 350 to 400 k.yrs.
The PIs plan to compare these records to the ice- core records of atmospheric
CO2 of the last 160.yrs. with the objective to determine patterns of change of
net biological productivity and deep ocean circulation during the Pleistocene.
The study is a continuation of the senior PIs work on the box modelling of delta
C-13 and additional two years funding for a graduate student will allow the
completion of this important work.
