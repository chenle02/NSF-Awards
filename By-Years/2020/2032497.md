This award from the NSF Chemistry Division supports Professor Bhuvnesh Bharti
and Professor Kalliat T. Valsaraj of Louisiana State University to study
micro/nanoplastics. Micro/nanoplastics have become very common in the
environment because of the gradual aging and weathering of discarded plastic
waste. They can move up the food chain and potentially impact both aquatic and
terrestrial species. In order to assess the potential health risks of
micro/nanoplastics, it is critical to understand how they interact with an
aqueous environment. The team studies the effect of sunlight-induced oxidation
and aging of micro/nanoplastics which increases their wettability and ability to
disperse in water. This project is exploratory with risk but the knowledge
gained helps guide future in-depth studies of the environmental transport and
fate of microplastics. The project provides opportunities for graduate students
to develop new skills in an emerging field and actively engages undergraduate
students from Baton Rouge Community College in the proposed research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project addresses the question: Do
micro/nanoplastics exist as micro or nanosized particles or do they aggregate
into larger structures? This question is critical because any biological,
environmental, and atmospheric impact of the micro/nanoplastics will be governed
by their dispersed/aggregated state. Photooxidation processes lead to the
formation of hydrophilic chemical functional groups on the surface of a
degrading polymer, which increases the water wettability and dispersibility of
the micro/nanoplastics. The team investigates the effect of photooxidation and
solvent pH/ionic strength on the dispersibility of spherical shaped model
micro/nanoplastics made from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. These
model plastics are photooxidized under controlled laboratory conditions and
characterized for their dispersed state using a combination of small angle
scattering, light microscopy, and spectroscopic techniques. This is important
for understanding the potential of micro/nanoplastics to be transported into the
atmosphere by incorporation into aqueous aerosol droplets such as fog, smog, and
mist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
