0337161&lt;br/&gt;Menezes&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Ronaldo Menezes and
students from the Florida Institute of Technology in a collaboration with Robert
Tolksdorf of the Department of Net-Based Information Systems at the Free
University of Berlin, Germany. The collaboration will focus on abstractions from
the field of swarm-based systems and study their applicability in the context of
coordination systems. In particular, the project focuses on the problematic
issue of scalability of Linda systems. The results of the project will be
twofold: the design of a new Linda based on techniques from Swarm systems
(called SwarmLinda), and the evaluation of the scalability of the Linda
implementation. The broader impacts of the work will be to make Linda techniques
more practical, thereby encouraging wider use, especially in commercial systems.
Swarm-based approaches may be able to improve efficiency of communication and
coordination with decentralized control. This could lead to enhanced ways to
manage large distributed systems, including computers, people, machines, and
interacting combinations of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
