Xanthan is an industrially used microbial biopolymer synthesized by the
bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. Its usefulness derives from its unique
physico-chemical properties when in low concentration aqueous solutions: high
viscosity, recoverable shear-thinning behavior and synergistic gelation with
polysaccharides. This project is aimed at improving thecost- effectiveness of
xanthan by determining whether the optimum temperature and pH for quality
(pyruvate content), yield, and production rate shift withsubstrate concentration
in batch reactors. If shifts are found, the researchers will attempt to specify
how the set points should be varied. The knowledge thus obtained can then be
used for thermo-chemical control of all secondarymetabolite syntheses.
