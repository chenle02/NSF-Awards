The Pacific Science Center will design, circulate, and evaluate a major
travelling science outreach exhibition and accompanying program, Science
Carnival, designed to reach rural populations not easily served by urban science
museums. A 3,000 square foot exhibition on basic science topics combined with
public demonstration programs and teacher training activities in science will
travel to 15 sites throughout Washington, Idaho, and Montana during a three year
period, reaching more than 500,000 people with limited access to science museums
and to modern science education methods. The traveling museum will be designed
to work within communities as small as 10,000 population, and will fit into many
different facilities, ranging from schools to county fairs and exposition
centers. A special effort will be made to insure the participation of Native
American, Hispanic, and Black minority families from the communities the exhibit
will reach. The majority of operating expenses will be covered by earned income,
insuring the long term viability of the program. A variety of evaluation
activities will monitor the success of the project and determine both marketing
opportunities and educational impacts of the visit to each community. Following
its successful demonstration, the Pacific Science Center will share essential
planning information with science museums nationwide and hold a dissemination
conference for interested museum staff. Overall, more than $2.0 million in local
support and earned income will be added to this NSF award.//
