9423741 Allen The electronic structures of selected narrow band materials are
measured by the techniques of photoemission and inverse photoemission
spectroscopies. In these spectroscopes the interaction of photon with the
electrons is used to determine the spectrum of ionization and affinity energies
of the electrons. The experiments are performed both in a home laboratory at the
University of Michigan, and at various national synchrotron facilities. The
experimental data area analyzed by comparison to theories which treat the
Coulomb interactions in different ways, and which provide a link between the
spectra and the electrical or magnetic properties. Thereby the various theories
can be tested, with the possibility for discovering new phenomena. The program
relies on strong collaborations with other groups for providing well
characterized sample to measure, and for expert theoretical advice and advanced
calculations. %%% The electronic structures of rare-earth and actinide metals
