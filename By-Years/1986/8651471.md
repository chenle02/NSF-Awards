The major goals of the project are to: 1) improve the effectiveness of school
visits to museums, and 2) improve the quality of instruction in schools by
integrating the school visit to museums with the science curriculum. The project
provides a model which changes the structure of museum departments. Classroom
teachers will be included to assist with school visits to the museum, the
development of pre/post materials, workshops in the museum, and on-floor museum
interpretation. The project targets grades 4-6, and will use the existing
mandated science curriculum in preparing content selection for school visit
activities. The New York Hall of Science will assemble three teams of five
"Distinguished Teachers" each who will work with museum staff over a two-year
period to develop all aspects of the school visit. Museum and school staff will
then evaluate and refine the materials. Participants will train their peers in
the use of the museum as a curriculum resource. The involvement of teachers in
the development of school visits to museums should greatly enhance the value of
such visits. This type of collaborative effort can serve as a model for other
museums.
