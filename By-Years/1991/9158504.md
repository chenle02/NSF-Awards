The importance of high performance computing to contemporary issues in science
and engineering has been well documented. It is the goal of this Presidential
Young Investigator to develop efficient algorithms for large scale computing, in
particular, solution of electromagnetic field problems fine- grain systems, e.g.
CM and N-Cube. The physical problems to be studied will include both device
modeling as a well as coupling and scattering problems. This research program
will include the following: pre- processing mesh generator and parallel full
three-dimensional vector field solvers.
