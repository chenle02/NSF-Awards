Technical Description:

This project centers around the construction and analysis of algorithms for the
simulation of the motion of nematic liquid crystals. Such algorithms will
facilitate simulation of the manufacture and operation of devices (such as
computer displays) built from liquid crystals. Equations characterizing the
motion of liquid crystals were proposed by Ericksen and Leslie in the 1960's;
however, until recently there were very few general results concerning the
existence, uniqueness, and stability of these equations. Recent discoveries by
F. Lin and C. Liu of new energy estimates enables many of these fundamental
questions to be answered, which, in turn, facilitates the development and
analysis of algorithms for the approximation of these equations. Preliminary
results by the author, in collaboration with C. Liu, for a specific instance of
the Ericksen--Leslie equations have been very promising, and this proposal
outlines a program of research that will result in robust and reliable codes for
the simulation of these equations in their full generality.

Non-Technical Description:

Over the past half century computers have stimulated a major change in the
design and manufacture of virtually every industrial product produced in the
U.S. Computer simulation of product strength, operation, and performance has
replaced much of the expensive prototyping and testing phase required before any
product is brought to market. In order to further reduce design and development
costs better computer algorithms are required for each step of the manufacturing
process, ranging from the simulation of advanced materials to the operation of
complex systems. This project plans to draw upon recent theoretical
breakthroughs to predict the behavior of materials like those found in modern
liquid crystal computer displays. These materials exhibit many complex
phenomena, and simulation and prediction of their properties requires modern
high performance computers.
