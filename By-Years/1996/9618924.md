9618924 Gerard F. Consuegra The Science Connections Project is a five-year
professional development program for 320 middle schools science teachers in the
county system. The goal is to extend the revised elementary science program into
middle schools and to provide the professional development at the middle school
level. The proposed project, in cooperation with the University of Maryland, The
American Physical Society, and the National Institutes of Health will provide
intensive training for middle school science teachers, Grades 6-8, so that
students who were taught by elementary teachers participating in the NSF funded
elementary teacher enhancement project will continue to develop science literacy
skills and knowledge using inquiry-based and constructivist-based learning. The
middle school science teachers will receive professional development in science
content; and instructional pedagogy which will include constructivist learning,
cooperative learning, and inquiry-based teaching; performance teaching and
assessment; and technology applications. An action research model will be used
to promote permanent and ongoing change in teachers' professional development.
