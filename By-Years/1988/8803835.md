By using new techniques to measure the relationship between joint permeability
and joint closure over a wide range of pore and confining pressures, the
investigator will study the effective pressure laws for both closure and
permeability as well as combine constitutive laws which relate the aperture
geometry to both transport and mechanical properties of joints.
