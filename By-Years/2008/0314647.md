Research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic optimization is an essential component of
many process design activities. In previous work the PI developed an efficient
simultaneous approach for dynamic optimization that handles both unstable and
path-constrained differential-algebraic systems. He developed an improved
nonlinear programming strategy based on interior point or barrier methods, which
leads to significant gains in performance. For example, on his dynamic process
optimization case, nonlinear programs with over 1.2 million variables can be
solved in approximately two hours of CPU time on a 1.0 GHz computer. In this
project he will extend his simultaneous optimization strategies to large
systems. To do this, he will consider several improvements in the formulation
and algorithm for dynamic optimization problems as well as extending the scope
of the dynamic optimization problems to include discrete decisions that involve
phase equilibriums and other complementary relationships. Because these features
are exploited in a novel way by the interior point algorithm, difficult
optimization problems that include a class of discrete decisions can be treated
with little additional computational cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He plans to
incorporate these into a modeling framework that will combine well-developed
user interfaces and object-oriented software as well as demonstrate the
application of the algorithms within a state-of-the-art parallel computing
environment on a wide variety of process optimization problems drawn from
process control, operations and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemical Process Industries (CPI) could greatly
benefit from the development of more efficient dynamic optimization
methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;
