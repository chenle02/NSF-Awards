This coastal geomorphology project is relevant to the large coastal populations
that rely on dunes for protection during storms and it could provide useful
information for coastal planners and engineers. The project aims to advance
understanding of the recovery and building of coastal dunes with a focus on the
welding of intertidal sandbars to the shoreline. The investigators will develop
novel approaches to measure the effects of waves and wind on the movement of
sand. They will communicate findings to coastal management agencies and will
train one PhD student and two undergraduate students.

The goal is to improve understanding of beach-dune dynamics by testing the
hypothesis that sediment supply to the backshore beach and dunes is dominated by
the welding of intertidal sandbars to the shoreline. While this mechanism has
long been proposed as critical, only limited quantitative data exists. The
investigators propose a comprehensive field experiment (SEDEX2, the Sandbar-
aEolian-Dune Exchange EXperiment) in which measurements of waves and wind,
subaqueous and aeolian sediment transport, and subsequent morphological changes
will be collected synoptically during an intertidal bar welding event along a
highly progradational beach. The findings will inform conceptual and numerical
models of beach-dune interaction and help to improve management of vital
backshore resources.
