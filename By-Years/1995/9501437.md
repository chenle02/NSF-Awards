ABSTRACT CTS-9501437 An experimental study will be undertaken on the physical
mechanisms underlying axial segregation and mixing in binary mixtures of
granular materials. A horizontal cylinder partly filled with granular material
is rotated along its long axis. Particle size segregation and mixing in the
axial direction occur as a function of the binary mixture and their dynamic
angle of response, cylinder dimensions and rotational speed. The process is
found to be determined by two competing mechanisms, the Fickian diffusion and a
drift current. The diameter, mass and surface roughness of granular material
(glass beads) will be systematically varied during experiments. The reversible
segregation effect will be investigated like a phase transition, microscopic
diffusion coefficients will be determined, and basic understanding of the
generic axial segregation processes in granular materials and complex non-
Newtonian fluid systems will be sought. The research will provide guidance to
design industrial processes based on mixing and segregation of granular
materials. ***
