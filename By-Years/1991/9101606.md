This applicant proposes to study a genetic sequence in the maize Adhl gene that
is known to be necessary specifically for gene expression in the root. In
particular, the work will focus on identifying the location and nature of the
cis-acting sequence with characterization at the RNA level. The work is planned
to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Freeling at the University of
California, Berkeley.
