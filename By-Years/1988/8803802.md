This research, undertaken in collaboration with Robert D. Rodman of North
Carolina State University at Raleigh, is concerned with the problem of how to
interact with a computer system in natural language by voice. It continues and
builds on the results of research carried out by the investigators over the past
seven years. Working in the problem domain of electronic equipment repair, they
are currently investigating a range of interactive modes from "passive" (the
computer merely follows orders and ans- wers questions) to "directive" (it takes
charge and questions and instructs the human user). They are also investigating
the nat- ure and role of comments in a task-oriented dialog and ways of
representing and generating appropriate, fully grammatical, natu- ral language
spoken responses. The motivating goal of the research is to be able to design a
machine partner, capable of natural language voice dialogue, and able to assist
human beings of varying abilities and experience in an electronic repair task.
Progress toward this goal contrib- utes in important ways to knowledge of how to
employ automata in roles previously possible only for skilled human beings.
