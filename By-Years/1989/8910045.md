This award is for a research planning study under the Research Opportunities for
Women Program. The Principal Investigator will explore research opportunities
related to problems of particle contamination in the microelectronics industry.
The exploration will consist of literature review, contact with industry, and
attendance at specialized conferences. Preliminary experiments will begin using
existing facilities and university support. This award should help initiate a
research program for a young woman engineer.
