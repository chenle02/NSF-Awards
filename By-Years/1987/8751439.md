The proposed project intends to offer a six-week summer workshop for 28 high
school mathematics teachers. The two major components of the workshop are
courses in discrete mathematics and one in probability and statistics, each for
four quarter hours of credit. In addition to these courses, there is to be a
seminar devoted to sharing of ideas and the evaluation and development of
resource materials for use in secondary school mathematics classes. Throughout
the summer workshop and the academic year, microcomputers will be used as tools
to teach mathematics as the teachers are encouraged to plan ways to use
computers to make their teaching of these relatively new topics more effective.
During the academic year following the workshop there will be monthly seminars
for the participants. The project staff will visit each of the participants at
their schools at least twice during the year; also, the staff will be available
as consultants as needed by the participants throughout the year to facilitate
their learning and application of the mathematical concepts of the two major
courses that may be new to them. The topics in discrete mathematics, especially
elementary combinatorics, are important in the considerations of curricular
revision at the secondary school level. Several recommendations to revise the
mathematics curriculum have placed a great emphasis on topics from discrete
mathematics. These courses did not exist, for the most part, when the present
crop of high school mathematics teachers were in their teacher preparation
programs and yet many of the topics in the courses are now to be included in the
courses the teachers are expected to teach. It is essentially the education of
the material as well as the adaptation of the concepts to the school program
that is the thrust of this project.
