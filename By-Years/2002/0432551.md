Tropical cyclone development and intensification is driven in large part by the
release of latent heat of condensation in cumulonimbus convection organized
around the center of the storm. For developing storms, these areas of convection
are highly asymmetric and often displaced from the storm center. In previous
work, the Principal Investigator has shown how the heat energy released in
asymmetric convection is converted into kinetic energy of the axisymmetric wind
field through a sequence of asymmetric and then symmetric adjustment processes.
From previous work using balance models of axisymmetric dynamics, it is already
known that the efficiency of this process (the amount of vortex intensification
per unit heating) is quite small, on the order of 5%, and depends strongly on
both the location of the convection and the structure of the cyclone itself. The
new model used for this work resolves the unbalanced, fully nonhydrostatic
dynamics of both asymmetric and symmetric motions. This project will further
analyze the symmetric and asymmetric processes, which mediate these energy
transfers, and in particular will document the efficiency of the intensification
process for particular heating distributions and storm structures. The
interaction of outward propagating gravity waves with the symmetric wind field
also will be examined, along with a new possible mechanism connecting gravity
waves to spiral band formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work potentially will
lead to better understanding and forecasting of tropical cyclone development and
rapid intensification phenomena. The computer programs used to simulate the
symmetric and asymmetric adjustment processes will be made available to the
community for general use. This project may also lay the foundation for a new
approach to hurricane intensity forecasting, which would combine satellite
observations of precipitation and convective heating with a simple dynamical
model to predict short-term intensity change.
