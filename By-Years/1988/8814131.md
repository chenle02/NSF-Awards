Mathematicians at Washington State University will develop, coordinate, and
write multi-disciplined computer-based curriculum materials for calculus to be
implemented at two high schools, a community college, a private college and a
public university. Generic curriculum materials for engineering calculus,
calculus for life sciences, and business calculus will be developed by faculty
from engineering, biology, chemistry, business and sociology. The materials will
include "laboratory" exercises that use computing devices such as HP-28 and
microcomputers using symbolic manipulation programs. These realistic problems
will use numerical methods that illustrate the power, difficulties and logic of
computation and graphical solution to problems. Electronic "slide shows" with
both animated and static computer graphics of classroom demonstrations and
lectures will also be developed. The principal investigators are well known
researchers, who have wide range experience in mathematics education. They will
work closely with Pullman and Moscow High Schools, Spokane Falls Community
College and Gonzaga University.
