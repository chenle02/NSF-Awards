Analyses of the published sulfur isotopic data on bulk rock samples of Archean
sediments have led to a new model for the Archean atmosphere-ocean-biosphere
system: the oceans, as far back as about 3.8-3.2 billion years ago, were already
sulfate rich with a sulfate concentration of &gt; about 1/3 of the present
level, were 30- 40 oC warmer than modern oceans, and supported a very high
activity of sulfate reducing bacteria world wide; the early Archean atmosphere
already contained appreciable amounts of free oxygen. The objective of the
proposed research is to test the above and other models for the Archean
atmosphere-ocean-biosphere by examining the sulfur-carbon-iron chemistry and the
microscopic- scale variation in the sulfur, carbon and oxygen isotopic
compositions of sediments from the Warrawoona Group, Australia; the Isua Group,
Greenland; and the Fig Tree Group, South Africa, using a state-of-the-art stable
isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped with a laser ablation system.
