9604678 Matthews The overall goal of this research is to understand the
mechanism by which the amino acid sequence of a protein directs its rapid and
efficient folding to its native conformation. A combination of biophysical and
genetic engineering methods will be used to probe the mechanism of folding of
homologous dihydrofolate reductases from a common bacterium, E. coli, and from
humans. Circular dichroism, NMR, fluorescence and x-ray scattering studies will
provide insight into the secondary and tertiary structures, as well as the
dynamics and sizes of transient, partially-folded forms that have previously
been observed to appear during the folding of both proteins. Ultrafast mixing
will probe the collapse of unfolded forms and the development of nonpolar
surfaces within 100 microseconds. Mutational analysis will probe the involvement
of nonpolar side chains in several hydrophobic clusters that appear to play key
roles in two classes of folding intermediates. Protein engineering will test the
potential of fragments to fold. Finally, the role of a bacterial chaperone,
GroEL, in influencing the folding of human dihydrofolate reductase will be
investigated. Progress in understanding the structures and dynamics of partially
folded species that appear during folding should provide insight into the
process by which the amino acid sequence of a protein spontaneously directs the
formation of its unique three dimensional structure. A solution to the protein
folding problem would have an important effect on biology, biochemistry and the
biotechnology industry. The folding and transport of extracellular proteins is
often coordinated with their own synthesis or with the synthesis of other
proteins with which they form complexes. Thus, folding plays a key role in the
normal functioning of cells. Because the biological activities of proteins are
directly related to their three dimensional structures, an understanding of the
sequence/structure relationship is a critical component of the processing of the
genetic information stored in the DNA sequence.
