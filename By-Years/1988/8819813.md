ABSTRACT The subject of this conference is the distribution and control of
phonologically empty subjects. Examples of empty subjects are the (logical)
subjects of the infinitive clauses in such sentences as " Felix persuaded Max to
eat turnips", or "Eunice promised John to hurry home". Although the topic of
empty subjects has been studied for several years, non consensus has been
reached, even internally to any of the disparate theoretical frameworks in which
the problem has been addressed. The objectives of this workshop are: 1) to
assess the present understanding of control related phenomena from the
perspectives of semantics (model theoretic and truth theoretic), syntax
(categorial grammar, government and binding theory, and lexical functional
grammar), historical linguistics, and language acquisition; 2) to compare and
synthesize these various approaches to control; and 3) to encourage further
cooperation among researchers working within these different theoretical
frameworks. The workshop will bring together leading scholars who have done
substantial work on control phenomena from diverse perspectives.
