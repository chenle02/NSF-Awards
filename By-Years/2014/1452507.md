Program (HFSP) is an international partnership aimed at promoting basic research
on the complex mechanisms of living organisms. The current members are the
original G-7 members plus Switzerland, Norway, the European Union, South Korea,
Australia, India and New Zealand. Japan and the United States are the principal
financial contributors. The U.S. continues to be the primary beneficiary of the
program with a disproportionate amount of both Fellows and grantees coming to
the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HFSP, headquartered in Strasbourg, France,
provides support through peer-reviewed postdoctoral, early career, and cross-
disciplinary fellowships and collaborative research grants. Postdoctoral
fellowships are available for research in foreign laboratories and career
development awards are offered for repatriating HFSP fellows.
