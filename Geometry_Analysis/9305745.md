9305745 Ramachandran The proposal is concerned with geometric questions
pertaining to complex manifolds. Specifically, the investigator will study an
interaction between invariants of the covering group of a compact Kaehler
manifold and function theory of the covering. This will lead to questions
concerning the fundamental group of quasiprojective varieties. The techniques
and expected results may have applications to algebraic geometry and other areas
of mathematics.
