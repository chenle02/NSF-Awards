The objective of this research is to study fundamental aspects concerning the
microstructural stress-strain behavior of cohesive soils by conducting in a
systematic manner laboratory experiments on a number of real clayey soils, and
numerical experiments on assembly of clay particles. Scanning electron
microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electrical methods will be employed in
characterizing the fabric of laboratory specimens. Numerical experiments will be
simulated using the Distinct Element Method.
