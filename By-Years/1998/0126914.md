Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;The joint project of the mathematics and
biology departments is focused on the entire biology curriculum, including
biology education. It is adapted from materials developed in the well-tested
programs of the University of California at Davis, the University of Tennessee,
and the University of Utah. The ideas implemented at Beloit College and
Macalaster College provide additional guidance. Aspects of each of these
programs are integrated with ideas developed at Appalachia State to take full
advantage of existing local resources and support systems. The aims are to: a.
increase students' computational maturity through realistic biological
applications in mathematics and statistics coursework; b. reinforce students'
computational skills through mathematical, statistical and technological
integration in biology coursework; c. foster communication and collaboration
between the departments for research, student projects, and course development;
and d. increase the marketability of students by giving them a broader set of
skills from which to draw. The courses affected include the introductory
mathematics sequence (use of biology related examples and guest lectures from
biology faculty to highlight biologically important mathematics concepts),
introductory biology courses (introduction of mathematics modules many of which
parallel research being done at Appalachia) and introduction of advanced cross-
disciplinary courses developed and co-taught by faculty from both departments.
Evaluation of the project includes oversight by a team of mathematicians and
biologists who are actively involved in similar curricular reform and of a
science educator and mathematics educator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
