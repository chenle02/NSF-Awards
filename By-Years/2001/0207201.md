The aim of the project is to advance the development of analytic tools to study
various asymptotic and singularly perturbed problems, including the
semiclassical (or zero dispersion) limit of the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger
equation (NLS) and exponentially small effects in singularly perturbed dynamical
systems. Numerical experiments for the focusing NLS reveal the formation of
regions of violent and disorganized oscillations. This is in drastic contrast to
the case of the defocusing NLS, which is reasonably well understood by now. The
method of Riemann-Hilbert problems will be used to describe the complicated
behavior of the focusing NLS. The second part of the project is connected with
the phenomenon of breaking of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections in
singularly perturbed and discretized systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of
aspects of nonlinear optics, such as the stationary profiles of beams
propagating in nonlinear media and propagation of certain pulses in optical
fibers, can be described by the NLS equation and its various asymptotic regimes.
We will concentrate on one of the most difficult asymptotic problems for this
equation. The second part of the project investigates the phenomenon of
transition between integrability and chaos in dynamical systems.
