Professor Michael D. Raftery is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program for his research on NMR of single crystal surfaces. Xenon optical
pumping and magic angle spinning solid-state NMR will be combined to produce
unique, surface specific studies (OPMAS). Powder semiconductor surfaces
passivated with organic functional groups will be studied to examine bond
coordination, surface heterogeneity and surface oxidation processes. Extensions
to surfaces of crystalline silicon and germanium wafers will be attempted.
Experiments for measuring chemical shifts as a function of depth in diamond and
group IV materials will also be performed. Techniques for improving polarization
transfer from optically polarized xenon to surface nuclei will be developed.

Surface phenomena have been traditionally difficult to study, and the addition
of NMR to the battery of surface sensitive methods would be a large advance with
possible biological and even medical outcomes. This application, hydrocarbons on
silicon, is important in the semiconductor industry.
