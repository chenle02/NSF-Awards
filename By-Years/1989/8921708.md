This award will provided partial support for the International Conference on
High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy; Ann Arbor, Michigan; October 2-5, 1990. The
conference will review the data which are now becoming available from a number
of cosmic ray detectors and which will provide a new look at a number of
astrophysical objects such as Hercules X1, Cygnus X3, SN 1987. Topics of the
conference will include among others theoretical models of gamma-ray production;
dark matter sources of gamma-rays; implication of results for elementary
particle physics; proposed new gamma-ray and neutrino detectors.
