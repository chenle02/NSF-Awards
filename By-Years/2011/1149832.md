The ability to communicate and readily access information helps make possible
positive social and political change. The Internet's effects on developing
nations' educational, economic, and governmental institutions have been well
explored by social scientists and technical experts. However, in unfortunately
many instances, undemocratic governments monitor and censor Internet
communication to attempt to control their populations. Although there are a
number of existing technologies that support private communication in the
presence of a restricted adversary who controls only a fraction of the network
and has limited resources, we currently lack solutions that enable anonymous
communication when the network is fully controlled by a nation-state
adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops methods of providing
unfiltered, anonymous, and high performance Internet access, even in the
presence of strong nation-state adversaries. The project (i) investigates
methods of improving connectivity in heavily regulated networks using novel
hidden channels, (ii) improves the resilience of anonymity networks to denial-
of-service attacks, (iii) introduces techniques for detecting suspicious
behavior in anonymity networks, and (iv) enables high performance anonymous
messaging through the development of novel anonymity protocols and
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's themes of privacy and security
have been integrated into security courses developed for Georgetown's newly
established Ph.D. program. More broadly, the project benefits society by
improving the ability to privately access information, even in networks
controlled by oppressive governments. The project will increase the
participation of groups whose ability to communicate is currently muted, and
will provide unfettered Internet access to regions in which free communication
would otherwise be unavailable.
