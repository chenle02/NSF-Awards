This REU Site Award is modelled after the successful site established in 1987
and carried on for five summers since then. Over the next five years 75 students
(15 per year) will be directly funded by the program. Research is to involve
principally materials science investigations including studies in: Remote Plasma
Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition; Thin Films and Interfaces: X-Ray Absorption
Spectroscopy Studies of Solids; Near-field Optical Microscopy of Solid Surfaces;
and Theoretical Investigations of Macromolecules and Clusters. %%% Programatic
aspects of the REU site include: broad recruitment efforts particularly focussed
on minority and women candidates; weekly REU meetings and numerous social
functions designed to stress the coherent programatic aspects of the site;
encouragement of strong faculty-student interactions; development of speaking
and writing skills as an integral element of research education; and regular
evaluation at the conclusion of each summer's program
