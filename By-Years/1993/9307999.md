9307999 Sinervo An increase of energy invested in current reproduction is
thought to entail :costs" that are either reflected in a decrease in survival or
a decrease in future reproductive success. We have devised an experimental test
of these ideas in a natural population of lizards. By experimentally enhancing
the number of eggs in a clutch using a hormonal treatment, we should exacerbate
those costs and decrease survival or future reproductive success. A
complementary manipulation that decreases the number of eggs laid in each clutch
should ameliorate these costs and enhance survival or future reproductive
success. Because the hormones that control reproduction are relatively conserved
among vertebrates (e.g., reptiles, mammals, birds, fish), our results are likely
to be quite general. Consequently, these results will be relevant to domestic
animal husbandry (e.g. aquaculture, bird rearing, etc.) and these results could
theoretically be used to maximize yield in such agricultural programs.***
