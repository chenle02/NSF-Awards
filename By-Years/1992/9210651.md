This is a joint seminar proposed by Dr. Jackson Yang, the University of
Maryland, and Professor Yung-Chun Wu, National Chiao Tung University supported
by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This seminar
will focus on the issue of automation and productivity for small and medium
scale manufacturing industries. Advanced manufacturing processes is an important
topic for both the U.S. and Taiwan. Automation has not been extensively
incorporated in the small and medium-sized manufacturing industries in the U.S.
Taiwan, on the other hand, has been successful in incorporating such processes
in its manufacturing process. A workshop on this topic can benefit the
scientists and the manufacturing industry in both the U.S. and Taiwan. The issue
is important and the knowledge derived from this meeting can be useful in terms
of future U.S. industrial competitiveness. The Materials Processing and
Manufacturing Program and the Industrial Centers Division have each contributed
$2,500 in joint funding for this workshop.
