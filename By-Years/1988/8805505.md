This research program has two principal objectives. The first is the
determination of properties of the interaction between hadrons from the spectra
of charged kaons leading to strangeness - 2 hypernuclei and for photo-eta
production on nuclei. The second objective is to determine the response of the
helium nucleus in the quasi-free region when excited by electrons and pions. The
principal investigator is a world expert in continuum shell model calculations
of nuclear reactions which include with recoil corrections. He is currently
extending the model to use relativistic Dirac nucleon spinors from mean field
theory for the nucleon wave functions in calculating a variety of nucleon-
nucleus reactions.
