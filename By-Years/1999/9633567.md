This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), jointly funded by the Theory
of Computing (TOC) Program, CCR and by the Informations Technologies Office,
DARPA, addresses problems in the new area of Biomolecular/DNA Based Computation;
in particular, in the area of parallel molecular computation (PMC), massively
parallel computation at the molecular scale. The goals of this SGER project
include:(1) Exploring possible implementations of PMC;(2) Assessing the
feasibility of the PMC implementations; (3) Empirically determining the
parameters of performance (e.g., time, volume, etc.) of PMC for some set of
applications;(4) Doing trial recombinant DNA implementations of such key
operations as: (a) parallel memory read and write, and (b) parallel arithmetic
on small integers;(5) Planning a study of the implementation of a biological
application of PMC with small or at most moderate I/O and volume requirements.
In addition, one of the goals of this SGER award is to foster to facilitate a
multidisciplinary effort between the Computer Science Department, the Duke
Center for Molecular Diversity and the Microbiology Department of Duke
University.***
