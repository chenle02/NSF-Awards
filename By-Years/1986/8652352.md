Saint Mary College will develop, execute and disseminate a three year Model
Program for Preparing Computer Science Teachers for forty participants who teach
at the middle and high school level in Kansas. This project will provide a
computer studies teacher program that meets the guidelines for certification in
Kansas. It will educate teachers in computer studies so that they can then
conduct in-service sessions in computer literacy for teachers in their
districts. It will provide a forum where teachers from various districts can
share their materials and ideas about computer learning and develop a model
program of computer studies in education, that has been tried and tested by
teachers in the field, to be shared with other State Education Departments.
Participants in this program, which encourages interdisciplinary connections,
will receive graduate credit for their coursework. Each site where a participant
teaches will be visited each year by Craig Haugness, Computer Specialist for the
Kansas State Department of Education. He will submit a formal evaluation of the
entire project. Saint Mary College is making plans to sustain the program at the
end of NSF funding. The PI, Sister Barbara Kushan is Director of Academic
Computing at Saint Mary College. She was the project director of an NSF CAUSE
project from 1980 to 1983 in which a computer center was established on the
campus and a computer science major developed. Other staff members are Sister
Andrea Johnston, PhD, chairperson of the Mathematics Department, Professor
Victor Meyer, Sister Mary Erwin Baker and Sister Mary Denise Sternitzke, Sister
Kathy Atkins all of whom are experienced mathematics and computer science
faculty members. Saint Mary College is qualified in terms of staff, facilities
and commitment to develop a program to prepare computer teachers. Cost sharing
by the College is 30% of the overall budget.
