Beginning in the 1980s, Dr. David Barker theorized that conditions and exposures
during early development may relate to epigenetic modifications that effect
outcomes in later life. This view has permeated scientific literature and
practice, precipitating a new field of basic science and capturing public
attention. Drawing on in-depth interviews with scientists working in this area,
fieldwork in basic science settings, and a content analysis of scientific
literature and popular media coverage, this research examines this scientific
development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As scientific debates and public
conversations about genetics continue, a fuller understanding of the ascendant
epigenetic paradigm will assist broader understandings of determinants of health
and disease. With growing concern about the prevalence of chronic diseases, this
emergent science engages pressing health concerns.&lt;br/&gt;
