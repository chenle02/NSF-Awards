0304934&lt;br/&gt;Deering&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Delaware
provides support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used
on R/V Cape Henlopen, a 120' research vessel operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically,
support is recommended to acquire three new oxygen sensors and a fluorometer for
shared-use operation. These acquisitions should provide a substantial advantage
to marine scientists using R/V Cape Henlopen in their research during 2003 and
future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
