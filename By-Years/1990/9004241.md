The Cordillera Darwin complex in southern Chile exposes high grade metamorphic
rocks in close proximity to rocks of considerably lower grade across the Beagle
Canal. Recent models suggest that the high grade rocks form the core of an
extensional "metamorphic core complex" and their exposure was accommodated by
large-scale tectonic denudation. This project is a continuation of a
petrographic and age dating effort to test this model by assembly of PTt paths
and radiometric dating techniques. Data collected so far are consistent with the
proposed structural models, but are not sufficiently robust or abundant to
unambiguously constrain them. The purpose of this renewal is to document
additional PT paths from both high and low grade localities and to collect age
data to constrain particularly the early cooling history. Results are expected
to place tight constraints on the pressure (depth), temperature and time
evolution of this area that will allow a thorough test of the extensional core
complex theory.
