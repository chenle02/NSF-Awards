This project investigates the foundational computational underpinnings of secure
systems. Cryptographic constructions such as encryption, signatures, and more
rely for their security on the conjectured computational difficulty of certain
problems. For example, many public key encryption currently in use would be
broken if someone discovered an efficient algorithm to factor large integers.
Unfortunately, the current state of art is that we are unable to prove that
these problems are truly hard, and so need to rely on unproven conjectures.
Moreover, a handful of these conjectures serve as the foundations of many if not
most of current cryptographic schemes, and so each such conjecture is a single
point of failure whose refutation could have severe consequences for a large
fraction of our systems. In particular, progress in quantum computing threatens
some of these conjectures, and motivates reevaluation of the right basis for
cryptography.

The goal of this project is better understand and remedy these issues.
Concretely, this project investigates cryptographic schemes, and particularly
public key encryption, that are based on assumptions that are qualitatively
different from current ones, and hence more likely to survive technological or
algorithmic advances that would break current schemes. The project obtains new
forms of evidence for computational assumptions, thus deriving some assurances
that current schemes are secure. The project also explores assumptions for new
cryptographic primitives such as software obfuscation that are more well founded
by computational complexity considerations
