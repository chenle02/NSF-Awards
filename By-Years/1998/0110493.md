Daniel L. Reger, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South
Carolina at Columbia, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program for his work developing new metal complexes of
tris(pyrazoyl)methane (tpm) ligands. These ligands are closely related to
tris(pyrazoyl)borates, but have been much more difficult to prepare. Reger has
developed new synthetic pathways to tpm ligands such as HC(pz)3, HC(3,5-Me2pz)3,
HC(3-Phpz)3, HC(3-tBupz)3 and HC(3-iPrpz)3. Linked bi- and poly-functional
pyrazoyl methane ligands, such as all three isomers of C6H4[CH2OCH2C(pz)3]2,
will form building blocks for the preparation of coordination polymers that have
unusual 2-D or 3-D supramolecular structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal
complexes of tpm ligands may show unique reactivity or catalytic activity. The
coordination polymers, especially those containing two different metals, will
have interesting physical or electronic properties. In addition, several
graduate students and faculty members, including coworkers from a HBCU
undergraduate institution, will have the opportunity to participate in the
research project.&lt;br/&gt;
