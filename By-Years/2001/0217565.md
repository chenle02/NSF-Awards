This project is a fundamental study of directional recrystallization processing,
the process whereby one or a few grains or crystals nucleate at one end of a
specimen and grow along with a moving hot zone. Directional recrystallization
has a number of advantages: net-shape processing; potential energy and cost
savings compared to directional solidification; and the ability to process
materials not amenable to directional solidification. The overall goal is to
understand how key microstructural parameters (the size and spacing of
particles, and the grain size and orientation) interact with the processing
conditions (rate of hot zone movement and temperature) to control the
microstructure. How the initial microstructure and processing conditions can be
exploited to produce columnar grains or single crystals of a particular
orientation will be explored in polycrystalline nickel sheets. The role of
particles will be examined in a model system of copper (both single crystals and
polycrystals) containing finely-dispersed particles that can coarsen during
processing. Determining the role of particle coarsening or dissolution is key to
understanding how columnar grains or single crystals can be produced in many
commercial alloy systems.

The work will involve a close coupling of experiments with computational
microstructural simulation of the processing utilizing a front-tracking grain
growth model. While working on specific materials, the goal is to understand
directional recrystallization processing at a fundamental level so that this
generic technology and the associated modeling can easily be applied to many
materials. In addition to graduate education, activities with the Women in
Science Project and / or Dartmouth Presidential Scholarships will be encouraged
to expand participation of a diverse group of undergraduates on this project. In
addition, material developed with the aid of a high school teacher will be
presented to high school students.
