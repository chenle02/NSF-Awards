Dr. Stuart Goldberg is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at Scripps Institution of
Oceanography. Dr. Goldberg will determine the origin, age, composition, and
accumulation mechanisms of dissolved organic matter from three lakes in the Lake
Tahoe Basin. Dr. Goldberg will measure the abundance the carbon isotopes (12C
and 13C) and hydrogen isotopes (H and D) in preferentially preserved lipids to
infer the origin of the organic matter (for example, terrestrial plants, soils,
or aquatic plants). The age of the organic compounds will be determined using
14C. The results from this research will contribute the understanding of the
modern and past carbon cycle in terrestrial and aquatic environments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr. Goldberg will contribute to the
scientific education of high school students and entry level graduate students.
Dr. Goldberg will mentor two high school students on their science fair projects
and he will lead graduate students in discussions and laboratory work relate to
the study of natural processes using the isotopic composition of organic matter.
