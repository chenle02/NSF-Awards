On the occasion of Sergei Kuznetsov's 60th birthday, the principal investigators
will organize a conference on superprocesses and nonlinear differential
equations to take place June 2010 at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The
plan is for a two and one-half day conference. Each of the first two full days
will feature four (hour) lectures, two each morning, two in the afternoon. Each
afternoon will also feature three short talks by junior researchers. Further,
the second day will culminate with an open problem session. On the final day of
the workshop there will be two morning talks and a planned outing in the
afternoon.
