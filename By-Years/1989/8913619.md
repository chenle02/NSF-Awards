A noninvasive technique for measuring the temperature field inside three-
dimensional living tissue using tomographic methods based on electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of nitroxide stable free radicals will be
developed. The studies will examine temperature variations likely to be
encountered in experiments and in clinical applications involving hyperthermia
in the mammalian body. The experiment consists of three major parts: First,
detailed data on temperature dependent spectra of appropriate nitroxides will be
obtained in model systems, such as solutions and blood: Second, the spectra will
be reexamined in the tissues of living, anesthetized mice with the additional
objective of localizing the signal to specified, small additional objective of
localizing the signal to specified, small volumes. Third, preliminary work will
be done on the development of tomographic applicable to this method. The most
significant result of this research would be a breakthrough in noninvasive
temperature measurement techniques. A major shortcoming of current hyperthermia
procedures is the uncertainty of the temperature distribution in the region of
the application of the thermal treatment. The primary aim is to develop an
effective and reasonably economical technique for in vivo uses. Variations of
the technique, however, could be developed for other uses as well. Thus, ESR
based thermal tomography would become a significant new component in the art and
science of heat transfer.
