A four year program of research and teaching activities will be carried out. The
research program consists of fundamental measurements of the interaction of high
energy photons with nucleons and light nuclei with primary emphasis on a
measurement of the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the neutron, quantities
of fundamental interest in nuclear and particle physics. Also a test of charge
symmetry in photon interactions with mass three nuclei is proposed. Both
measurements will be carried out at the Saskatoon Accelerator Laboratory.
Measurements of eta meson production with polarized photons are proposed for the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. In addition to the training of
students in research, teaching aspects include the upgrade and development of
experiments for an undergraduate laboratory and the introduction of a new course
for non- science majors.
