Abstract

Award: DMS-0705284 Principal Investigator: Kefeng Liu

Moduli spaces have played fundamental roles in many subjects of mathematics from
geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, to number theory. String duality from
string theory has motivated many deep mathematical results and theories. The
principal investigator proposes to have an intensive study on applying
localization method combined with other newly developed geometric techniques to
solve fundamental problems arisen from string duality about the geometry and
topology of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and stable maps. There are several
specific problems that we hope to solve under the support of the proposed
research grant, these include the general recursion formulas for intersection
numbers of general tautological classes which include the Faber conjecture as
special case, the Virasoro conjecture for general projective manifolds, the
understanding of topology, algebraic geometry of moduli spaces, and the
computing of the holomorphic anomaly by using our geometric results about moduli
spaces.

The interactions of mathematics and physics have motivated many fundamental
advances in both disciplines. String Theory, as the most promising candidate for
the grand unification of all fundamental forces in the nature, should include
all previous theories like the Yang-Mills and the Chern-Simons theory. String
duality which identifies different theories in string theory has produced many
surprisingly beautiful mathematical formulas about the geometry and topology of
moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. The mathematical proofs of many of these
conjectural formulas depend crucially on localization techniques. This program
will not only help verify important physical theories, but also produce
beautiful and fundamental mathematics. In carrying out the project we will also
train several young students and post-doctors to conduct research in these
subjects through collaboration and lectures.
