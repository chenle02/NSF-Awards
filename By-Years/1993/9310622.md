Durham/Sawyer 9310622 The conditions under which sustainable development and
resource conservation can occur are frequently modeled in narrow economic terms.
In contrast, this project investigates land use in the context of community
politics within an indigenous community of the Pastaza Runa of Ecuadorian
Amazon. The goal is to understand the forces directing distinct households'
agricultural practices and political allegiances. Three methodological tools
will be employed. First, the analysis of agricultural techniques in swidden
systems and the mapping of multi-level land use (swidden agriculture, commercial
crop production, and cattle grazing) detail actual practices and examine
indicators for the intensification and/or depletion of resources. Second,
interviews with household members elicit historical understandings of land use
changes, resource conflicts, and households' affiliation with the local Indian
federations or Campesino organization. Third, archival research of state,
church, indigenous relations and state adjudicational legislation presents
historical insight into changing racial and legal relations of Indians in the
Oriente. The research is significant on two counts. It contributes to
scholarship on indigenous resource management and ethnicity by investigating the
conditions under which indigenous peoples practice ecologically sound land use
and maintain a politicized ethnic identity. In examining refinements in native
politics and land-use along the colonization frontier, the study extends current
knowledge of options of sustainable agriculture in the neotropics. ~ u F V F V
