This award will provide funds to purchase a current-generation X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer in the GeoAnalytical laboratory at Washington
State University, in order to continue to provide a reliable chemical analysis
service to the geoscience community. The WSU GeoAnalytical Laboratory is
considered an important component of academic geoscience research and research
training in North America through the analytical services it provides, most
notably for the research community studying volcanic processes. Basic research
in this field underpins applications to natural hazards.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The XRF facility at WSU is employed in a broad range of
geological, environmental science, and archaeological research. Chemical
composition is a necessary part of the description of igneous rocks, gives
fundamental information about weathering and sedimentary processes, and is
growing in application to geoarchaeology. Projects that use data from the
instrument include studies of super-eruptions from calderas and large igneous
provinces. Additionally, chemical analysis of Earth surface materials such as
sediments, paleosols and archaeological materials feeds the knowledge base for
global change science, including past human impacts on the environment. Ensuring
a steady supply of trained geochemists and skilled technicians into the national
workforce is therefore essential to the future health of society.
