9315333 Chu This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Quantum Electronic Devices and States of Matter, scheduled
for August 1994 in Napa, California. The co-organizers are Professor Steven Chu,
Department of Physics, Stanford University, and Professor Tsutomu Yabuzaki,
Department of Physics, Kyoto University. In addition to participants from the
United States and Japan, scientists from France and Germany will attend the
meeting. Research developments in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics
continues to develop at a rapid pace. In particular, newly developed techniques
to control and manipulate particles such as atoms, ions, and micron sized
particles have caused much excitement both in the AMO community and beyond.
These developments are enabling the design and construction of a host of
fundamentally new instruments capable of unprecedented sensitivity. At the same
time, the methods are being used to study fundamental interactions between
matter and light, the creation of new states of matter such as ionic crystals,
and better insights into the quantum nature of the physical world. The theme of
the meeting is the development of new quantum electronic devices based on new
understanding of light/matter interactions and the application of new AMO
techniques to the creation of new states of matter. The seminar will emphasize
the interplay between basic research and the creation of new devices and
scientific instruments. ***
