Decision making under uncertainty in dynamic, structured, and complex
environments is a major area of research in AI. Research under this award aims
to make novel contributions in this area by developing and expanding a new
compact representation known as First Order Decision Diagrams (FODDs)and new
learning and planning algorithms based on abstract Markov Decision Processes
that have relational structure. The development of such structures, semantics
and algorithms is a crucial step towards optimization and planning in complex
real-world domains, such as emergency response, product delivery, and other
service domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
