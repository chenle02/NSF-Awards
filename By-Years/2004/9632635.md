963265 McMillan The Material Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at
Arizona State University supports research on the synthesis of new families of
materials, with a focus on the synthesis of materials at high pressures. The
research combines experimental and theoretical studies to predict the stability,
properties, and appropriate pressure range for the synthesis of novel target
phases of nitride glasses, oxide perovskites, carbon nitrides, and
chalcogenides. Additional research efforts address the process of vitrification
in amorphous materials and the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial
nitride films. The MRSEC supports shared experimental facilities for materials
research, exploratory research through seed funding, and collaborations with
industry and other academic institutions. Educational outreach programs include
development of educational modules on materials science for middle school
students and a collaborative research program with the College of Eastern Utah.
The Center supports 13 senior investigators, 4 postdoctoral research associates,
12 graduate students, 1 technician, and 5 undergraduates. The MRSEC is directed
by Prof. Paul McMillan. %%% The Material Research Science and Engineering Center
