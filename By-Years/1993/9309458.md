9309458 DeTar Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be
centered on two broad areas in quantum field theory. The first area is in
computer studies of quantum chromodynamics, whose equations are believed to
describe strong forces among elementary particles. The second area is in the
mathematical foundations of certain quantum field theories. These are relevant
to a wide class of phenomena, including superconductivity at high temperatures.
The research is important in providing a better understanding of fundamental
forces among elementary particles. ***
