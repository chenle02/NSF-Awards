Extremal combinatorics has grown significantly in both depth and breadth in the
21st century, resulting in methods that apply well beyond their original
settings. These include applications, and often significant breakthroughs, in
number theory, design theory, probability, group theory, and theoretical
computer science. The questions that are studied here represent obstacles to our
understanding, and it is likely that progress on these challenges and the
methods developed in solving them can later be exported to other areas. As such,
a major goal of this project is to develop new tools and techniques and to
expand on existing methods so that they apply in more general settings. This
work will involve training undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study a variety of fundamental
questions in extremal combinatorics, spanning three main areas: extremal graph
theory, Ramsey theory, and the study of pseudorandomness. In the first area, the
PI intends to study several classical questions on extremal numbers, including
the rational exponents conjecture and the compactness conjecture, as well as
problems regarding the relationships between the homomorphism densities of
different graphs. In the second area, the PI will tackle some of the classical
problems on graph Ramsey theory, such as that of determining diagonal Ramsey
numbers, as well as questions from arithmetic and geometric Ramsey theory.
Finally, the PI intends to make further progress on developing the sparse
regularity method and on finding and applying high-dimensional expanders. Common
themes run through these areas, and the methods developed in one area are likely
to have implications for the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
