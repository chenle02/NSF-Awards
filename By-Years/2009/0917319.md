This project develops compile time techniques and a software tool (called the
Reduction Simplification Engine, RSE) for optimization of equational programs
with reductions (associative, and usually commutative, operations applied to
collections of data). By using these techniques and tools it is possible to
generate programs with lower asymptotic complexity than the original
specification. Such complexity reduction is an ambitious, almost unheard of,
goal in compilation: most compilers seek constant factor gains, usually a few
percentage points. The techniques developed in this project build on more than
twenty years of research by the PI on a formalism called the "polyhedral model."
The main novelty of the current effort is that in addition to polyhedral
techniques, algebraic properties such as idempotency and distributivity are also
used to augment the analyses performed.
