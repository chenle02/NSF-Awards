This research is to further develop and utilize matched filter techniques to
study deep earth structure by improved measurement of travel times, seismic Q,
and dispersion and attenuation of surface waves including higher modes of the
earth. The work, while in the high-risk category as are most new theoretical
developments, has the potential to be a logical and powerful extension of normal
mode studies. The impact of the new techniques, if successful, will be important
to determinations of the structure and properties of the earth which will be
used as constraints on models related to nuclear test detection and the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
