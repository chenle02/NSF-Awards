Functional data, where the observational units represent curves, surfaces, or
images, are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern measurement systems. While
most statistical methods focus on simplifying assumptions such as independence,
real-world functional data often contain far more complex structures. For
example, in neuroimaging, the dependence network across brain regions needs to
be characterized using graphs based on EEG or fMRI measurements; in proteomic
and spectral analysis, researchers frequently encounter functional data with
featured regions. These structures represent generic complexities in data that
cannot be handled by existing analytical tools. This project focuses on the
development of novel statistical theory and methods to model complex structures.
The proposed tools will be applied to datasets from neuroimaging, mass
spectrometry, genomics, and bioinformatics. The research will be integrated with
various educational and outreach activities that will impact teaching and
learning both within and beyond the university.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
project has the following four interrelated objectives: (1) Develop a functional
graphical model framework to characterize conditional independent relationships
between random functions, and apply the methods to estimate large-scale brain
networks; (2) Develop novel frequentist regularization strategies and Bayesian
priors to select regions of functional data; (3) Use Markov random fields to
characterize spatial dependency between functions, and apply them to functional
areal and functional point-reference data; and (4) Educate and engage students
in the field of high-dimensional data analysis, develop K-12 outreach programs,
and mentor minority students.
