This award will support collaborative research in physical chemistry between
Dr. Daniel Kivelson, University of California at Los Angeles and Dr. Gilles
Tarjus, University of Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France. The objective of
the project is to develop a microscopic description of friction in liquids. The
investigators are studying the motions of molecules in liquids, with particular
emphasis on the motion of a reacting group traversing an activation barrier
during a chemical reaction. In liquids the surrounding fluid plays an important
role, not only in altering the activation energy, but also as a source of
friction in determining all molecular motions. The project will focus on this
frictional effect. Since friction is a macroscopic concept, they will seek to
understand under what conditions it can validly and usefully be applied in
describing dynamics at the molecular level. They will also explore how the
frictional concept, extended if needed, to give a better microscopic
description, can yield insights into chemical kinetics in liquid solution. Their
approach will be both theoretical and computational. The results of this
research should contribute to the understanding of frictional effects in
liquids, particularly those connected with chemical reactions. Understanding
chemical kinetics on a molecular level is one of the most fundamental problems
in chemistry. Dr. Kivelson has been a leader in the area of studying molecular
motions in liquids, particularly rotational motions, for many years, and he will
benefit from the complementary expertise of Dr. Tarjus in the proposed research.
