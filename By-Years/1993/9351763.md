9351763 Wittman This project has established a well-equipped, quantitatively
oriented laboratory for undergraduate instruction in applied economics. Emphasis
is being placed on in-depth training in empirical research techniques that
includes econometrics and experimental approaches. Specifically, funds are being
used to establish an applied economics laboratory course that will be required
of all economics majors, and to develop a modular experimental workshop into the
curriculum. It is expected that the project will produce instructional units
with software, data, instructions, and a laboratory text. Also, this applied
economics course could serve as a model for other economics departments, and the
experimental modules, themselves, could be taught by other experimentalists at
other institutions. ***
