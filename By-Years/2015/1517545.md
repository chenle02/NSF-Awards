The proposal aims to use observations of galaxy clusters to investigate models
for dark-matter particles. Galaxy clusters can be thought of as enormous
reservoirs of non-radiating, thus "dark", matter. Particles of dark matter
respond to the force of gravity, but little else is known about them. Theories
predict that dark-matter particles will annihilate or decay, yielding gamma-ray
emission plus high-energy electrons and positrons that can radiate in other
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The team's models show that the
products of dark-matter annihilation are best traced via their radio emission,
and they will use galaxy clusters to investigate that radio linkage. The team's
models also show that the products of dark-matter decay are best traced via
their gamma-ray emission, and they will use galaxy clusters to investigate that
gamma-ray linkage. Finally, the team will modify their models and apply them to
unusual clusters that exhibit radio halos, to try to solve the long-standing
problem of the halos' origin. The PI will continue her efforts at departmental,
institutional, and national levels to promote the involvement of women in
physics. She will expand these departmental and institutional efforts to include
other underrepresented groups
