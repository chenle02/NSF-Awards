This renewal grant is for continuing work on density functional calculations of
the electronic structure of high temperature superconductors. After nearly four
years of intense study since the discovery of the high temperature
superconductors, there is still no clear evidence of the mechanism that is
responsible for their high transition temperatures. In light of recent
experimental and theoretical studies, first principles theoretical calculations
will be carried out on the electron-lattice coupling in order to assess the role
played by this interaction in the high temperature superconductors. In these new
materials unusual electron-lattice coupling may arise due to the presence of
structural instabilities that are similar to those found in more conventional
materials with related crystal structures. Investigation of such instabilities
will therefore be undertaken. Computational techniques which will speed up these
computationally- intensive calculations will also be explored.
