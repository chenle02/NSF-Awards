Johnson Gross 9224876 The brain is protected from contact with the environment
by a relatively impermeable blood-brain barrier induced by the neuroglial cells
that surround brain capillaries. But there are gaps in this barrier. Specially
differentiated organs -- circumventricular organs -- in the ventricular walls
contain neurons with receptors for a variety of blood-borne chemicals. These
neurons form early warning networks that maintains brain and body homeostasis.
They are influential regulators of autonomic and neuroendocrine system
functions. Some of these organs have shown to be crucially important in the
regulation of blood pressure but there is as yet no understanding of the role of
the newly discovered peptide neurotransmitters or how the organs function
together as a system. This NSF grant will allow eight young scientists to
participate in a summer research conference on the circumventricular organs
organized by the Federated Societies of Experimental Biology. The purpose of
this conference is to bring basic and clinical scientists together to exchange
information and to foster a greater understanding of the potential importance of
this area of research. ***
