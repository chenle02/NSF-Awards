10th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage
(NAS), a premier international forum for the presentation of research results in
networking, high-performance computer architecture, and parallel and distributed
data storage technologies, seeks to increase student participation in symposium
and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US
students to the symposium. Travel grants encourage the research interests and
the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who
are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in
entering it. A special effort is made to reach out to women and under-
represented minorities. Preference is given to students who will present their
research at NAS.
