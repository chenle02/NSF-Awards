This project will provide research in the area of health care logistics modeling
and analysis through a TIE project between two highly successful
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC). The Center for
Engineering Logistics and Distribution at the University of Arkansas is a multi-
campus I/UCRC specializing in logistics research. The Center for Health
Management Research is also a multi-campus I/UCRC with a lead institution at the
University of Washington specializing in health care research. The research foci
of these centers present a unique opportunity to examine issues related to the
health care supply chain. The health care value chain consists of the producers
of medical products such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, the purchasers
of these products such as wholesalers and group purchasing organizations, the
providers including hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies, the fiscal
intermediaries, and finally the payers. Each health care value chain may have a
different structure, and therefore, different strategic management issues, costs
and performance abilities.
