The investigators will deploy an array of latitudinally spaced magnetometers at
low latitudes along the coast of Chile. The array will include a total of 11
sites extending from the northern coast of Chile to the tip of the Antarctic
Peninsula. The array will provide the scientific community with much needed low
latitude data from the South American continent by bridging the gap between
existing chains of stations. The data are used to study the processes by which
energy from the solar wind is transferred to the inner magnetosphere and
generates pulsations and transient variations on the ground at low latitudes.
The project is a collaborative effort between UCLA and a number of Chilean
universities. Data from the array will also be used to study geomagnetic effects
resulting from large solar storms.
