Courses in Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry,
Instrumental Analysis, and Modern Organic Analysis have been revised to include
60 MHz NMR experiments. This will complement the chemistry program policy of
providing students with opportunities for "hands-on" experience with FTIR, UV-
VIS, GC, GC/MS, HPLC, DSC, and other instruments. The number of viable projects
in a recently developed undergraduate research program will increase
significantly. Cooperation with area universities has been established to
provide access to high resolution FT-NMR. The acquisition will advance major
departmental goals of gaining ACS-CPT approval and attracting additional
chemistry majors. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
