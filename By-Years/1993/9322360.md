9322360 Hill The investigators propose to carry out theoretical investigations
of the plasma interactions associated with the impending encounter of the Comet
Shoemaker-Levy-9 fragments with Jupiter and its magnetosphere. They will
concentrate on potentially observable consequences of the interaction of comet
material with the magnetosphere, both before and after the impact episode.
Because the comet is already fragmented and carries significant dust (and
perhaps gas) components, its interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere may well
have observable effects upon its first encounter with the bow shock or
magnetopause, about a month before planetary impact. These effects include
electrostatic disruption of grains, copious ionization, and the intriguing
possibility of remote optical imaging of the magnetospheric boundary. During and
after the impact episode, magnetospheric convection may be influenced by the
mass-loading effect of comet ejecta, with observable consequences in the optical
Io torus, the Jovian aurora, and Jovian radio emissions. The theoretical
investigation of these phenomena will combine analytical and tested numerical
techniques, and will be carried out in close conjunction with relevant
observational programs to maximize the scientific return from this rare
celestial event. ***
