This research is devoted to the theory of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) organic
conductors (TMTSF)2X and (TMTTF)2X, where TMTSF is
tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, TMTTF is tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene, and X
represents a monovalent inorganic anion, such as PF6 and ClO4. These materials
demonstrate an antonishingly rich variety of physical properties and states:
metallic, insulating, superconductive, charge-and spin-density-wave states,
antiferromagnetism, spin-Peierls states, and the state of Mott-Hubbard
paramagnetic insulator. They exhibit a multitude of magnetic oscillations as a
function of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field. A strong
magnetic field induces the cascade of phase transitions between the magnetic-
field-induced spin-density waves (FISDW), which exhibit the quantum Hall
effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical research will be conducted on the
following topics: fractional quantum Hall numbers of the subgap electron states;
electron states in superconducting junctions; bound electron states at the
superconducting and FISDW vortices and impurities; collective modes in the
triplet superconducting state; and, coesistence of metallic Fermi surface and
charge gap. There will be close collaboration with experiments and an emphasis
on real materials.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical research will be
conducted on a novel class of organic conducting materials which display a rich
variety of properties. These materials are of great fundamental interest due
these properties arising in organic materials and of great practical interest
due to many potential applications.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
