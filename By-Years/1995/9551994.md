Through this project, the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer
Science provides a graphics-based, interactive applied mathematics laboratory to
stimulate active, hands-on learning in two courses that together enroll 290
students annually: A first principles, mathematical modeling course,
Computational Modeling; and a first course in differential equations,
Differential Equations. In these courses, the new equipment transforms a
traditional passive, instructor-centered lecture into a classroom requiring an
active role by students. The laboratory is made up of 26 color X terminals,
monochrome laser printer, computer server, and software for statistical/data
analysis, symbolic manipulation, and documentation preparation. During the
project period, instructor-centered and student-centered sections of the
Differential Equations course are being run in order to obtain data for project
evaluation. The active engagement of students in problem solving, where students
initiate the investigation of the problem rather than passively waiting for
directions, is a major pedagogical outcome of this project. With the new
computing hardware and software, students not only are able to examine more
problems, they ar able to examine more realistic problems in far greater detail
than paper and pencil methods.
