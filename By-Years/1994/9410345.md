9410345 Niemi This project involves an international conference arising from the
expansion of scholarly work on democratic processes, fuelled by recent
historical events. The key goals of the proposed conference are fourfold: 1) to
develop a thematic understanding of elections in established democracies. 2) to
integrate, synthesize and consolidate theoretical, empirical and institutional
studies comparing elections, parties, and voters. 3) to disseminate the
conference results widely to an international readership through publication of
an edited book. Comparative research on democracies has traditionally drawn
heavily on the experience of major Western countries. Through this conference,
the research will be updated to take account of substantial changes within many
established democracies during the last decade, as well as the growth of 'third
wave' democracies in the Southern Mediterranean, Central and Eastern Europe,
Latin America, Asia, and Africa. The conference will bring together colleagues
with expertise in established and emerging democracies. One set of participants
will contribute papers providing an overview and synthesis of existing
theoretical and empirical work on key topics associated with the study of
political parties and elections in established democracies. A second set of
participants will write papers focussing on similar themes from the perspective
of newer democracies. The conference objective is to integrate these sets of
papers to develop a broad understanding of democratic systems that includes
established and emerging democracies.
