The objective of this award is to develop an analytical framework, known as two-
time-scale analysis, to predict time-dependent performance measures for a class
of unconventional stochastic networks. These networks model the management of
hospital inpatient flow with patients modeled as arrivals and inpatient beds as
servers. This new analytical framework will overcome many challenges that cannot
be solved by existing methods for large-scale queueing systems. They include (a)
the arrival process has a periodic arrival rate, (b) the service times are
endogenous, depending on length of stay (LOS), admission and discharge times,
and (c) service times are extremely long compared with the time-variations of
the arrival rate. Using the framework, the PI and his collaborators will develop
methods to predict the time-dependent mean queue length and mean waiting time in
steady state for both single- and multi-cluster models. The models under study
handle several realistic and critical features including day-of-week phenomena,
non-geometric LOS distributions, and allocation delays. The multi-cluster model
has a novel partial sharing mechanism, where the sharing among different
clusters is triggered by patients' long waiting times.

If successful, this research will produce an analytical and numerical tool that
can evaluate various operational and strategic policies including discharges,
nurse staffing, and capacity planning. The tool can provide insights into (i)
efficient inpatient flow management to alleviate emergency department
overcrowding during certain hours of a day, (ii) resource allocation among
different wards to optimize multiple patient-centric performance measures, and
(iii) coordination within the entire hospital and with other related healthcare
systems such as step-down care facilities.
