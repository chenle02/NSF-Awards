For some insect societies a colony can comprise several discrete nesting units.
This phenomenon of colony fractionation, or polydomy, produces nest subunits
that can differ primarily in whether or not they contain a queen. Since workers
and their mother queen are in conflict over how reproductive energy should be
allocated polydomous colonies represent natural systems for studying conflict
and cooperation within the squabbling family. Furthermore, polydomous colonies
represent a tractable ecological system for studying levels of selection.
Colonies of the ant species Myrmica punctiventris are seasonally polydomous: in
spring a colony emerges aboveground as a unit, but then fractionates. Nest
subunits are functionally autonomous during the summer months, but re-coalesce
in fall for overwintering. Previous work has shown that workers can exploit this
system to bias reproductive broods towards their own interests and away from the
interests of their mother queen. The proposed research will characterize colony
structure and reproductive allocation for three populations of this species;
contextual analysis will allow us to distinguish selection on the local nesting
unit versus on the entire colony. A field experiment will be carried out to
assess the impact of ecological parameters for seasonal polydomy, reproductive
allocation, and levels of selection in this species. The research will provide
considerable insight to the evolutionary mechanics of social behavior.
Furthermore this project, while primarily basic research, may have implications
for control of pest ant species, which are notoriously polydomous.
