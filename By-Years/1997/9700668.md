9700668 Kapahi Description: This award supports a collaboration between Dr.
Joanna Rankin, Department of Physics, University of Vermont and Drs. G.Swarup,
Director of the Giant Meter-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and V. Radhakrishnan,
Director of the Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, India. The GMRT is
under the auspices of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) in Pune.
The research will deal with pulsars, pulsar emission, beaming and evolution,
pulsar microstructure, and pulsar timing and polarimetry. It will include broad
observational programs using the GMRT and involves large and currently active
teams from the NCRA and the RRI. Scope: This project supports a collaboration
between U.S. astronomers and two of India's most distinguished researchers on
pulsars, a topic of strong current interest. They will use India's latest radio-
astronomy facility outside Pune. This is the world's most powerful radio
telescope operating at meter wave-lengths. This is a highly beneficial
collaboration in a field of science that is strong in both countries. The
project meets the criteria of the Division of International Programs. ***
