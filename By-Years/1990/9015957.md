Indiana University's Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) provides experimental resources
for conduct of fundamental research in intermediate energy nuclear physics with
light ions, utilizing a 200 MeV cyclotron and a 500 MeV Cooler ring. IUCF is a
national user facility, serving over 240 researchers. The central research
thrust is polarized proton and neutron scattering, and is aimed at the study of
nuclear structure, effective nucleon-nucleon interactions in nuclei, few body
systems, threshold pion production, pionic atoms, and more. The core of the
cyclotron research program is in charge exchange studies and inelastic proton
scattering, both with polarized beams, and makes use of a high resolution
magnetic spectrometer with focal plane polarimeter and of a neutron time-of-
flight facility. The Cooler program is used in the study of threshold pion
production, pionic atoms, dibaryon searches, nuclear structure with recoil
particle detection, accelerator physics of spin transport, polarized few-nucleon
gasjet targets, and more. Instrumentation development in support of the research
program and of users is an essential function at IUCF, and includes development
of such items as specialized spectrometers, polarized targets, detectors,
beamline apparatus, polarized ion sources, and related equipment. Graduate
students are integrated into all aspects of IUCF research, including equipment
development, and their training is a prominent aspect of IUCF activities.
