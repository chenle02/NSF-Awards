This project entitled" Enhancing Mathematics Courses Through Engineering
Applications" is a collaboration between the Mathematics Department and the
Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Departments. The project is informing and
developing the understanding of engineering applications of mathematics, with
the expectation that this motivates students within their math courses to
understand how the math is used. The project is producing multimedia modules for
specified mathematics courses, training math faculty on the use of the modules,
implementing classroom use of the modules, and training faculty to develop
additional multimedia modules. Twelve multimedia modules are being developed.
Each module consists of an applications module and two Maple labs based on the
applications module. The applications modules are being developed using
multimedia, including video, text, audio, and the computer. In the applications
modules, in-depth engineering applications selected from courses are being
introduced, the mathematics explained, the mathematics revisited with the math
theory explained, and then extrapolation with in depth questions or other
applications. The two associated Maple labs involve students interactively. The
modules are being incorporated into the target courses. The expected impact on
students (87% African-American) is better understanding of the need to learn the
math as well as better retention of the math. The expected impact on the
teachers is more knowledge of applications and continued further understanding
of and use of technology in instruction.
