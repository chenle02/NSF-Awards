A study of carbenes and related reactive intermediates by laser flash photolysis
will be conducted. Spectroscopic and kinetic measurements of these highly
reactive intermediates in solution will be made. The research projects will
include investigation of: (1) the properties of nucleophilic carbenes; (2) the
kinetics of carbene/metal salt reactions (carbenoid formation); (3) the
properties of "push pull" carbenes as well as pyridyl and pyridinium carbenes;
(4) the effects of fluoro and methoxy substituents in modulating intramolecular
carbene rearrangements; and (5) the fragmentation of oxycarbenes to
carbocations. These studies will be of particular importance in providing
insight and understanding for reactions that are characterized by low activation
energy barriers. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
continuing work of Professor Robert A. Moss at Rutgers University. These studies
will be centered around the production and reactions of carbenes, which are
species that contain a carbon atom with two formal bonds rather than four bonds
as found in stable carbon compounds. Carbenes are reactive intermediates that
are very short-lived. Special flash laser techniques will be employed to observe
these reactive intermediates and to study the rate at which they react. Carbenes
can undergo reaction to give other reactive intermediates. For example, carbenes
can react with lithium chloride to generate an adduct called a carbenoid with
the normal complement of four bonds. With appropriate substitution, carbenes can
give another reactive intermediate, a carbocation, which contains a carbon with
three bonds and a net one unit of positive charge. These reactions will provide
a means to study some of the important reactive intermediates in organic
chemistry.
