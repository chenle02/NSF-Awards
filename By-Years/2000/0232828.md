This Small Business Innovation Research Phase project will implement and test
the feasibility of a new algorithm for statistical text categorization. This
algorithm combines the ease and effectiveness of learning from examples, while
incorporating task-specific constraints that currently require ad hoc rules. The
project will evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms.
Alternative optimization algorithms and alternative approximations to
intractable quantities will be benchmarked. Categorization accuracy will be
evaluated on public text categorization data sets and on data from operational
text categorization users. Ornarose, Inc. will develop and license software
libraries including this algorithm to software vendors in a variety of
industries. Vendors for whom text categorization is not a core competency
increasingly wish to support categorization in software that works with text
data. Market niches where text categorization under task-specific constraints is
compelling include knowledge management, news alerting, email/web filtering, and
data mining. Discounted licenses will be provided for academic institutions and
scholarly publication of nonproprietary results on publicly available text
categorization data sets is planned.
