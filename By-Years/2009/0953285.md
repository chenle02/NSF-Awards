This research studies how people use social media tools (e.g. blogs, wikis,
electronic social networks) to work together more effectively to advance
individual, group, organization, and community objectives. Despite high-profile
success stories, we actually know very little about how best to use social media
to enable effective collaboration among individuals or within organizations. The
mere adoption of these tools by individuals or organizations is unlikely to have
the desired effect unless people know how to use these tools to enable more
effective collaborative processes. This research will employ qualitative content
analysis to provide a rich picture of social media collaboration, conduct
quantitative analysis on large-scale datasets to identify macro-level trends,
and develop computer simulations to predict how social media might affect
organizations in ways not yet observed. The educational activities of this
proposal will focus on how to employ social media in the classroom to improve
educational processes. I plan to introduce five different social media enabled
innovations -crowdsourcing exams, wiki-based peer review, in-class blogosphere,
video podcasting lectures, and in-class electronic social networks - and
empirically test the effects of these innovations on classroom
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is to better
understand how social media tools can be used to improve processes in a wide
range of organizations and settings. These tools have been shown to have
important economic, political, societal, and educational impacts. Regardless of
whether particular social media tools endure in coming years, the technological
features and collaborative capabilities they represent will continue to persist
and evolve.&lt;br/&gt;
