Abstract for the award of Kiran Kedlaya DMS-0400272



p-adic analysis, initiated by Hensel at the turn of the last century, seeks to
bring the "continuous" techniques of calculus to bear on "discrete" problems in
number theory. We study applications of p-adic analysis in arithmetic algebraic
geometry; a typical problem is to count solutions of systems of polynomial
equations. We work on one hand on improving our theoretical understanding of
this problem, and on the other hand on developing practical algorithms for
treating important special cases. Some of these cases occur in applications to
cryptography, error correcting codes, and other areas of computer science.

More specifically, we are developing Berthelot's rigid cohomology in parallel
with the older theory of etale cohomology, which is better understood
theoretically but ill-equipped for explicit computations. One long-term goal is
to extend Lafforgue's work on the function field Langlands correspondence to
p-adic sheaves (crystals). In another direction, we are investigating algorithms
for computing in p-adic cohomology, which may have mathematical applications on
top of the practical ones mentioned above.
