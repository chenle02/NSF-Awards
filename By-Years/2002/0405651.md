This award is an Accomplishment-Based Renewal of NSF grant 0001827, which
supported surveying and sampling of the southern Mariana arc and back-arc basin
during the Cook 7 expedition (R/V Melville) as part of the MARGINS Subduction
Factory experiment. This award will allow the following 4 research efforts over
the next five years: 1) Completion of four sub-projects begun on samples
collected during Cook 7. 2) Participation in a NOAA cruise to study hydrothermal
sites in the Marianas with ROV. The PI has been invited to participate and to
study igneous rocks collected during the planned cruise. 3) Participation in
JAMSTEC study of infant arc crust west of the Bonin Islands. A team of US and
Japanese scientists propose to use JAMSTEC's Shinkai 6500 manned submersible to
study exposures of infant arc crust exposed along scarps west of the Bonin
islands, Japan. The diving program that promises to resolve the ophiolite
conundrum as well as help demonstrate how subduction zones begin; and 4)
Continued Participation in MARGINS Rapid Response to May 2003 Eruption of
Anatahan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
