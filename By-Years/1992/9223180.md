There has long been a controversy over the impact of immigration on the United
States economy. In the North the influx of migrants in the early 19th century
created downward pressures on urban wages, mitigated only by the frontier which
provided a safety valve for the existing wage earners who moved there to escape
the lack of opportunity in the coastal cities. At the same time many immigrants
moved directly to the less settled regions increasing national output. For the
South during the Antebellum period there is great controversy regarding the
geographic and economic mobility of international immigrants. The purpose of
this research is to analyze the internal migration behavior of international
immigration to New Orleans, the major port of entry in the South. Migration
behavior will be investigated by developing a sample of foreign passengers
arriving at New Orleans in 1849 and tracing the location and economic fortunes
of these passengers in 1850 and 1860 using the manuscript census of population
and indexes to those censuses. This research is important because it will shed
light on the role immigration played in the economic development of the United
States.
