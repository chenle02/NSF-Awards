In collaboration with Costa Rican graduate students and scientists at two
universities in Costa Rica, Dr. Owens will carry out a two-year field study of
the behavioral factors influencing the migrations and unique nesting patterns of
the olive ridley sea turtle. The olive ridley and the closely related Kemp's
ridley have a distinctive nesting behavior in which thousands of turtles gather
in nearshore waters at the nesting beach and then emerge en masse to lay their
eggs. This mass nesting is commonly known by the Spanish word "arribada," but
the physiological mechanisms and environmental cues involved are unknown. The
olive ridley is a commercially important species threatened with extinction
because it is under extreme exploitation pressure from fisheries between Mexico
and Equador. Because of the lack of data on the at-sea behavior and movements of
the olive ridley, any information collected will contribute significantly to our
understanding of this animal. The objectives of this study are to (1) monitor
the pre-nesting and post-nesting at-sea movements and diving characteristics of
the olive ridley and (2) determine the behavioral components involved in
arribada mating and massing. These data will then be combined with information
on the physiology of the same turtles, being obtained under grant BNS 88-19940.
Dr. Owens and his colleagues will attach satellite-tracking transmitters to
female and male olive ridleys to follow their movements. Both behavior in the
vicinity of the nesting beach and long-term migrations away from the nesting
beach to the feeding grounds will be studied. Monitoring these movements will
allow the researchers to evaluate feeding, courtship, mating, and massing
behaviors prior to and following arribada events. An improved understanding of
the factors regulating the mass nesting and migratory behaviors has basic
importance in marine zoology and potential value in developing improved methods
for conserving this commercially exploited species.
