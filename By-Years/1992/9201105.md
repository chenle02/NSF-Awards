9201105 Plemmons Two undergraduate students will be involved in this project.
One of them will work on developing iterative methods for linear estimation in
signal processing. The work includes developing effective FFT-based
preconditioners for conjugate gradient iterative algorithms. The other student
will study matrix eigenvalue methods in the adaptive control of deformable
mirrors. Matrix computations play an important role in aero-optics applications
for astronomical and aero-optic imaging. Numerical experimentation will be
undertaken, using data from an astronomical facility. ***
