9523667 Frank The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a major feature of
the global atmospheric circulation with complex synoptic-scale structure. Under
this award, the principal investigator will examine the three dimensional
structure of the northwestern Pacific ITCZ, its variability, and its role in
tropical cyclogenesis. A combination of diagnostic analyses and numerical
simulations will be used to study these phenomena. The diagnostic component will
employ both composites and case studies of globally analyzed fields to determine
the mean ITCZ structure and changes associated with cyclogenesis. This will be
supplemented by composites of rawinsonde data to further delineate the
temperature, moisture, and divergence fields associated with the monsoon trough.
Numerical simulations will be performed with a non-hydrostatic version of the
Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5). This full-physics model will be used in a
series of initial value experiments to assess the effects of external
circulations on the structure of the ITCZ and on the formation of tropical
cyclones within the monsoon trough.
