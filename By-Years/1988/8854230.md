Computers and mapping are the topic of a one week seminar that is familiarizing
undergraduate college and university science teachers with recent developments
in computer mapping, including how computers make maps, and how computers
eventually will change both the nature of mapping and the appearance of maps.
The specific objectives are to enhance science teachers' knowledge of the
methods and techniques of computer cartography in undergraduate education;
encourage the use and development of spatially-referenced data bases for
undergraduate instructional activities; develop among undergraduate science
teachers a more meaningful understanding of spatially-referenced data types and
data sources and their uses in producing maps; and establish a forum for the
continuous communication of teaching strategies between professional
cartographers and undergraduate teachers of science education.
