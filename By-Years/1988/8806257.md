This project provides for equipment to support current and future research on
two classes of aerospace structures, rotorcraft and spacecraft. The general
rotorcraft research addresses vibratory rotor loads and rotor impedance
measurements, general rotor-airframe stability testing, and general rotor-
airframe vibration testing. Tests for specific rotor types are addressed as
well. These include aeroelastic stability tests, vibration characterization
tests, and tail cone vibration tests. For spacecraft structures research, a
scaled portion of a space structure, representative of a space structure, will
be tested to validate finite element analysis techniques. The equipment provided
completes two test facilities under construction at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, a model rotor impedance test facility, and a shake test facility. A
power drive system and support pylon, an articulated drive shaft assembly, and
supplementary data acquisition equipment are provided for the first facility.
Transducers and other hardware as well as signal processing, modal analysis and
data reduction equipment are provided for the second facility.
