The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. Access to X-ray
crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists to
carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt
University will use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help
acquire an X-ray diffractometer. The areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition are as follows: 1) Preparation and study of the
structure and reactivity of novel hypervalent species 2) Dinuclear compounds
containing bridging hydrocarbon ligands with unusual photochemical reactivity 3)
Preparation and structure determination of novel main-group heterocycles 4)
Organic charge transfer complexes and the study of intramolecular electron
transfer in bifunctional organic molecules 5) Lewis acidic Organoalkaline-earth
compounds containing sterically bulky ligands 6) Structure and reactivity of
homoleptic transition metal alkyl complexes.
