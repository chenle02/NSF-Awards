9502631 Hanrahan This award provides support for a high performance giga-flop
compute server, a high performance 3D graphics server, a high performance
image/video/data server, and a high bandwidth network to couple these machines
together. The requested equipment will contribute to the computational
infrastructure of a new computer graphics laboratory. Many national challenges
such as health care, education, manufacturing, and crisis management, require
graphics and imaging technologies. The investigators will be working in the
areas of graphics systems and algorithms, involving research in efficient
rendering algorithms, high-performance graphics architectures, and coupling
compression and graphics; in scientific visualization with research in volume
rendering for scientific and medical applications; in vision and graphics with
research in the digitization of 3D models; and in imaging and video with a focus
on the manipulation of image and video databases.
