Many terranes in the North American Cordillera contain Paleozoic arc and
basinal assemblages of uncertain paleogeographic origin. Standard facies and
biogeographic analysis have not been able to conclusively separate those
terranes that originated along the North American margin from those that
experienced greater transport. This project will expand and develop a promising
new technique to help fingerprint the source of detritus now found in these
detrital zircons may provide a unique signature of major precambrian cratons
that would allow the separation of locally derived terranes from long-traveled
allochthonous ones. The work will consist of extensive sampling in several
terranes in the Pacific Northwest and single-crystal zircon age determination.
Results will help build a data base and will contribute to understanding the
correlation, paleogeographic setting and displacement history of Paleozoic arc
and basinal sequences along the continental margin.
