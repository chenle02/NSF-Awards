*** 9760791 Certain This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will investigate methods for human body modeling and automatic
extraction of body measurements from body scans. The goal of the research is to
devise algorithms that are capable of merging and interpreting multiple range
images capturing the body in slightly different postures. Mass customization is
expected to play a significant role in the future of the garment industry. Body
scanning and automatic body measurement extraction will be important components
of mass customization systems. The proposed algorithms will allow construction
of small and inexpensive body scanners. ***
