Infrastructures are commonly conceptualized as large-scale projects created and
developed by governments (e.g., when they build roads) or other large
enterprises (e.g., when they build large systems for telecommunications).
Historically, rural co-operatives also built roads and farmers were known to
develop their own phones --although not very good ones. This project analyzes
the development of wireless ad hoc Internet services to determine whether or not
a decentralized communication infrastructure is a viable alternative to
centrally developed systems. Specifically, "Wi-Fi" technology (also known as
802.11 networking) will be studied. The project will measure the spread of
disorganized ad hoc Internet services in two neighborhoods, distinguished by
their socio-economic status, in a mid-western city. The "Wi-Fi" networks will be
mapped to record their spread and coverage over time. This project will
elucidate the role of amateurs and cooperatives in the creation of communication
systems, and will contribute to theories of communication infrastructure
development and the comprehensible visualization of technical phenomenon. It has
direct application to communication policy, and will support the cross-training
of students in engineering and the social sciences.
