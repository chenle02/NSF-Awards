This research is primarily concerned with the investigation of astrophysical
situations in which strong gravitational fields play an interesting role. The
oscillations and stability of rapidly rotating neutron stars will be
investigated. Of primary interest here are the secular instabilities that are
moderated by the dissipative effects of viscosity and gravitational-radiation
reaction. Investigations will also be made into the problem of formulating a
relativistic theory of dissipative fluids. The causality of the overall theory
and the structure and stability of the equilibrium states are of fundamental
interest. The attempts to understand completely the symmetries of equilibrium
stellar models in general relativity theory will continue (e.g., "Are all static
stars spherical?"). Finally, the effects of superfluidity on the oscillations
and stability of rotating neutron stars will be evaluated. The influence of the
complicated dynamics of a charge superfluid mixture on the macroscopic
oscillations and the damping of these oscillation by viscous effects are of
particular interest.
