The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue its highly successful
summer course in Advanced Bacterial Genetics. This course has its roots in the
original Bacteriophage Course initiated by Dr. Max Delbruck in 1945. This three
week course prepares the participant to enter directly into research that makes
use of advanced techniques and concepts in molecular genetics and microbial
bioinformatics. Experiments providing a solid grounding in classical genetic
analysis support training in contemporary uses of transposon mutagenesis, gene
fusion technology, chromosomal mapping, deletion mapping and complementation
analysis, second-site suppressor analysis and whole genome analysis. Experiments
also introduce the student to new molecular techniques of gene cloning, new
advances in site-directed mutagenesis, DNA microarray analysis and polymerase
chain reaction as applied to diverse problems in bacterial and bacteriophage
genetics, "mapping" genes by sequencing from transposon insertion ends and
genome sequence searching, and the use of transcriptional, translational and
cellular localization reporters along with indicator media and deconvolution
microscopy to identify mutants. This course, which is unique in providing
instruction in both genetics and molecular biology, gives participants the
wherewithal required to perform analogous experiments in their home
laboratories.
