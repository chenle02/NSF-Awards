The glow of the upper atmosphere at night (the airglow) can be seen with the
naked eye from sites with very dark skies as the faint light from between the
stars. Its spectrum is that of recombining molecular fragments. This airglow and
its wave-like variations are an indication of the deposition of energy in the
upper atmosphere. From above, the direct solar ultraviolet radiation and
particle precipitation driven by the solar wind are the major sources, while
chemical transport from below is modified by planetary waves, gravity waves and
tides, that are seen as quasi-periodic variations in the range from minutes to
days, and occurring for hours to tens of days at a time. This award is for
observations of the airglow at a high latitude station (Alaska), to identify the
solar cycle, seasonal, diurnal and sporadic variations, due to the coupling from
above and below, and to relate them to numerical models of the chemistry and
dynamics. To understand these processes is an important part of the ultimate
description of the flow of energy from the sun to the earth.
