Using a newly developed plasma diagnostic, Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence
(PLIF), planer ion densities and velocity distributions will be measured.
Studies will also be made on ion motion in large amplitude drift waves which
were found previously to develop chaotic motion. A two laser scheme (optical
tagging) will be used to follow the trajectories of ions in two dimensional
space. Modeling studies will be conducted concurrently in order to explain the
experimental results.
