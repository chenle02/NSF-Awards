Physics (13) This project adapts the well-known textbook "Six Ideas That Shaped
Physics" for use in the algebra-based introductory physics course for non-
physics science majors at Hope College. This textbook was written for a course
for physics majors with the idea that it is better to help students master the
fundamental principles of physics rather than expose them to every possible
application of these principles. Another guiding theme is that the material be
relevant to students. Textbooks for algebra-based courses have not always been
developed with these two principles in mind, and there is a need for an algebra-
based textbook that follows this philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because a
large fraction of the audience in the algebra-based course is life-science
majors, an additional goal of this project is to make the material relevant to
these students. Supplemental materials that emphasize the connection between
life sciences and fundamental physics concepts are developed in this project to
accompany the new textbook. These supplemental materials will range in style
from end-of-chapter problems to case studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is
adapting the text and supplemental materials in consultation with several life-
science faculty at Hope College. These materials are available to other
institutions through online libraries. The publisher and author of "Six Ideas
That Shaped Physics" have given permission for adaptation of the textbook for
use at Hope College and testing at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project helps to change the way introductory physics for non-majors is taught
nationally in the same way that curriculum reforms spurred by the Introductory
University Physics Project changed many introductory physics courses for majors.
The text and supplementary materials are being published on the web and
presented at national meetings. Furthermore, negotiations are underway to
publish the materials through a commercial publisher or in the LON-CAPA
library.&lt;br/&gt;
