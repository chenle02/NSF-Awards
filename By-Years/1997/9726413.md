ABSTRACT EEC-9726413 KU This two year "TIE" project funds a collaborative study
with two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC). The two
I/UCRC's are the Rutgers University Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Wireless Information Networks and the University of California San
Diego Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ultra-High Speed
Integrated Circuits and Systems. The "TIE" project is entitled, "Interference
Cancellation Prototyping and ASIC Development for Wireless CDMA Communication."
The Rutgers University I/UCRC will investigate the critical issues of
acquisition and synchronizing essential for multi-user direct sequence CDMA
communication convolution coding and utilize recent results on multi carrier
DS/CDMA systems. In the second year, further research to study other multi-user
detection architecture will be carried out after adding radio frequency
hardware. The University of California - San Diego Center will work with the
Rutgers University Center in designing an interference cancellation chip and
give it to National Semiconductor Corporation for fabrication. In the second
year, the chip will be tested and incorporated into a CDMA communication system
for multi-users.
