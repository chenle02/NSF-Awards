This is the first of a three year continuing award. There search focuses on
planning of multifingered robotic grasping of objects in situations where there
is incomplete information. The grasping behavior will be continuously and
incremetally refined based on sensed information during task execution and
reasoningabout object and manipulator geometry. The grasping operation will
combine reflexive behavior based on simple stimulus-action rules and local
information only, with reactive behavior which provides robust capabilities for
dealing with uncertainties and minimizes the amount of preplanning resourcefully
without a priori models of the environment or the task. Such systems will be
needed for autonomous robotic operation in unstructured, unfamiliar, or
unpredictably changing situations such as space, underwater, or environmental
operations, and may also be easier and more economical to deploy in more
structured environments such as some manufacturing processes.
