Professor Anick intends to extend his resarch in rational homotopy theory to
the study of homotopy theory at large primes. The principal methods will be the
use of H-spaces and exponents (Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer, Gray, Selick);
algebraic models for spaces (Dwyer, Felix-Halperin, Quillen); and V1-homotopy
(Mahowald, R. Thompson). Homotopy thoery is one of the standard algebraic
techniques for dealing with geometric questions. Typically one starts with such
a question, translates it into its algebraic counterpart, calculates concerning
the algebra which has been introduced, and then translates the results back into
the language of geometry. None of these steps has a cookbook recipe, of course,
but this is often the type of argument one attempts to construct.
