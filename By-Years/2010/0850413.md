This work will produce a stratigraphic template of Pleistocene climate change in
the North Atlantic over the past 3 million years. Working with colleagues in the
UK, the PI will generate and correlate high-resolution stable isotope and paleo-
magnetic intensity records along a proximal to distal transect from the mouth of
the Labrador Sea across the belt of detritus left by ancient ice-rafting events
in the North Atlantic. The project will document millennial-scale variability in
ice-rafting, ocean circulation, and geomagnetic properties with the goal of
addressing important questions about the evolution of the Earth's climate during
a critical period of transition (the mid-Pleistocene transition) and mechanisms
for abrupt climate change. In addition, the results will provide a stratigraphic
framework for the broader scientific community studying climate change in the
North Atlantic. Further broader impacts of this work include international
partnership and student exchange with NERC-funded UK scientists.
