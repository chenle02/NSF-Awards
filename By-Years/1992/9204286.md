This workshop is to be held in conjunction with the 1992 International Symposium
on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation in July of l992, at the University of
California, Berkeley. The area of integrated symbolic-numeric computing is an
emerging discipline which combines these methods for scientific and engineering
problem solving. In addition, high performance computing environments shall be
considered.
