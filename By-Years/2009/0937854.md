High-End Computing (HEC) systems are designed for performance, not energy
efficiency. In recent years, HEC users have found that as energy costs increase,
network and disks have become significant bottlenecks; worse, scientific
workloads vary wildly, exercising different parts of HEC clusters, making it
impossible to understand where the bottlenecks are and where energy is being
wasted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the impact of storage-stack
configurations on power and performance, using actual cluster configurations and
realistic scientific workloads. The research follows three thrusts: tracing and
analysis, adaptive cluster reconfiguration, and new storage software
stacks.&lt;br/&gt;(1) Traces are collected and analyzed which combine both
performance and energy data on a large set of scientific workloads: I/O-,
network-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. Three popular scientific cluster
configurations are investigated, varying many configuration parameters. (2)
Tools are being developed to dynamically adapt a cluster's configurations to a
given workload, so as to optimize power and performance prior to running long-
term scientific experiments or simulations. (3) New operating systems software
is developed specifically to optimize power and performance for scientific
workloads: a new lightweight file system and disk I/O
scheduler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term results of this project help
society save energy in computing without unduly hurting performance.
