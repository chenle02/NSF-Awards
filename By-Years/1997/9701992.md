This research explores inductive machine learning using mathematical
optimization as a foundation. Optimization techniques such as linear and
nonlinear programming have been shown to be effective in solving error-
minimization problems inherent in inductive learning. This work builds upon such
a system, MSM-T, that constructs multivariate oblique decision trees. This
system is used as a platform for research into learning issues such as
overtraining avoidance. In particular, new methods for feature selection, node
splitting, and overflow avoidance are being incorporated into MSM-T. These
techniques are intended to optimize the generalization performance of the system
in high-variance learning situations such as feature noise and sparse, high-
dimensional feature sets. The results of this work will be used in applications
in medical diagnosis and prognosis that require efficient programs for learning
from large volumes of data. In addition, research in machine learning and
medical decision making will be incorporated into the computer science
curriculum at Oklahoma State University, as part of the CAREER activity.
