Ethics in computer science research, and in particular in cybersecurity, is
beyond issues considered by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Unethical
security research could cause significant harm to society and in turn hurt the
research community. Researchers may lack clear guidelines and resources to
address research questions.

This workshop sponsors students to participate in the 2nd International Workshop
on Ethics in Computer Security (EthiCS 2023), held in conjunction with the
Network and Distributed Systems Symposium in February 2023. The workshop is a
venue for researchers, practitioners, and administrators, from security and
other areas, to bring and exchange perspectives, lessons learned, and new
insights into the guidelines and practices of ethical computer security
research. As a result, it expects to help generate new guidelines for future
ethical security research, to call for resources assisting security researchers,
and to raise awareness of even implicit ethical concerns.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
