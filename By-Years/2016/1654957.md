Through this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project,
U.S. students will conduct research needed to develop solutions to sustainable
grassland agriculture. Students will experience life in the Inner Mongolian
steppe of China. U.S. students will work with counterparts and mentors from the
Inner Mongolia Agricultural University to study how hydrology, topsoil erosion,
and vegetation degradation are interrelated in typical steppe grasslands. This
project will prepare students for future STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
aim of the project is to give U.S. students an interdisciplinary and
international research opportunity focused on the physical mechanisms affecting
grasslands. Three cohorts will spend twelve weeks working with their Chinese
peers and mentors. The teams of undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students
will develop new algorithms and enhance an existing model. Students will do
field and laboratory work to develop new modules on topsoil and primary
production. The research activities will include simulating a range of scenarios
to identify threshold conditions that trigger grassland degradation. The U.S.
students will build peer-mentoring skills and learn about the unique culture and
traditions of Inner Mongolia.
