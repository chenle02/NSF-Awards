This award is for support for a project to develop long-term records of the
atmospheric deposition of aerosol-borne, marine- derived elements to the
Antarctic ice sheet. The project includes the sampling of Antarctic ice core
samples from the Vostok ice core and the laboratory analysis of soluble ions in
the ice. The analyses include methanesulfonate, non-sea-salt sulfate, and
several additional ions derived from gaseous emissions from the sea surface,
from seasalt, and associated with continental dust. The principal emphasis of
this work is on sulfur, because of its role as a major aerosol-forming
constituent of the atmosphere, and its potential importance to climate. The main
goal of the project is to complete analyses of the Vostok ice core.
