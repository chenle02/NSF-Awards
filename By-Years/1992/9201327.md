The Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (SBI) presents a unique blueprint for the
acquisition, dissemination and utilization of the ecological knowledge required
to sustain the biosphere. The SBI has become a very large endeavor, whose
success is sought by many agencies, organizations and professional scientific
societies. The SBI has quickly outgrown the possibility of implementation by a
group of volunteers. Because of both the intensity and breadth of interest in
the SBI, it now becomes necessary to place the next steps on a more professional
basis. A continuing research Project is proposed with the responsibility of (a)
providing a national focal point for the implementation of the SBI; (b)
developing symposia, workshops and other means to more fully define SBI
programs, particularly the three research topics and the decision-making topics;
(c) maintaining continuous interactions with federal agencies to help provide
coordinated efforts and to meet agency needs as the SBI evolves; (d)
coordinating efforts of the SBI with those of the international community of
ecologists through the International Sustainable Biosphere Initiative; (e)
involving other professional disciplines and societies in the SBI; (f) providing
responses to the many requests for information about the SBI; and (g) reporting
the status and progress of the SBI to the broad scientific community, decision-
makers and the educational community.
