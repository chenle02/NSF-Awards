The objective of this proposal is to explore the feasibility of exploiting
recent advances in the understanding of power system voltage relationships and
phenomena, and in the structuring and application of artificial intelligence
methodologies, for control of power system voltage profiles. Since the
relationship between voltage control means and their effects are predominantly
local in nature, hierarchical structures are naturally indicated. The
complexities of the problem, including mixed mode controls and radical
nonlinearities, have defeated practicable implementation of conventional control
synthesis. Recent advances in artificial intelligence methodologies, including
artificial neural net applications, suggest that their application to this
problem might be feasible. We propose to develop an appropriate problem
definition, and to assess possible training and control strategies, including
several that have recently been developed or suggested in the literature.
