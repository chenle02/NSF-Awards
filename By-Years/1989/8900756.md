The purpose of this project is to accumulate more knowledge leading to a better
understanding of the structure of bounded linear operators acting on a complex
Hilbert space of infinite dimension. In the past ten years much progress has
been made in this direction by employing the concept of the dual algebra
generated by a single operator. Professor Pearcy and others have made an
extensive analysis of the predual of such a dual algebra, and this has led to
considerable progress on the dilation theory of contraction operators, and on
the invariant subspace problem. Professor Pearcy plans to continue this program
of mathematical research, focusing now on the the class of contraction operators
having spectral radius one. The kind of mathematics to be pursued here is
operator theory. Operators may be thought of, very roughly, as enriched (real or
complex) numbers. One can do arithmetic with operators just as with numbers,
except that multiplication of operators depends in general on the order in which
the factors are taken, and not every non-zero operator has an inverse.
Furthermore, numbers are inherently one-dimensional, whereas operators generally
act on an infinite-dimensional space. The notion that physical quantities are
more realistically represented by operators than by numbers lies at the heart of
quantum mechanics, a subject whose development provided much of the original
impetus to operator theory.
