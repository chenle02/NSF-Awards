****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid systems combine the desirable
features of two or more technologies in a way that improves the performance of
each component. This project seeks to develop hybrid "molecules" formed of
phosphorus dopants embedded inside silicon double quantum dots. The project will
study methods for transferring information between the spins in two distinct
subsystems: the electron spin in a quantum dot and the electron spin (or nuclear
spin) of a phosphorous donor. The high degree of tunability of gated quantum
dots offers the possibility of new ways to interact with nuclear spins (which
are highly coherent) via electronic degrees of freedom (which can be manipulated
and measured very rapidly). This project seeks to probe new types of hybrid
states between a donor and a quantum dot, and to use those states to bridge the
length scale mismatch between atomic donors and other semiconductor
nanostructures. Computer modeling will provide a link between the experimental
results and the underlying theory. Through this research, graduate students will
be trained in areas including nanofabrication, electronic measurement, and
theory. The project will also create a new outreach module, focused on
nanoscience, and merge it with a program that currently reaches thousands of
students each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical
Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid systems combine the desirable features of two or
more technologies in a way that improves the performance of each component. This
project seeks to develop hybrid "molecules" formed of individual real atoms
embedded inside artificial atoms. The project will use artificial atoms formed
in single-electron transistors that are constructed from two common
semiconductor materials: silicon and silicon-germanium. This project will study
methods for transferring information from the artificial atoms to the real atoms
(and to the real atomic nucleus, where it is especially long-lived), and back
again. From a practical perspective, the project seeks ways to manipulate atomic
systems using tools that work well for silicon transistors. Fundamentally, the
project will probe the interactions between real and artificial atoms-systems
that have very different characteristic length scales. Computer simulations will
be used to relate experimental results to the underlying theory. Through this
research, graduate students will be trained in areas including nanofabrication,
electronic measurement, and theoretical simulation. The project will also create
a new outreach module, focused on nanoscience, and merge it with a program that
currently reaches thousands of students each year.
