Dr. Mark Berg is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to investigate the molecular motions of solvent molecules in the
vicinity of a solute in solution. Berg will use sophisticated laser techniques
to study the rattling motion of solute molecules within their local solvent
cages, and the cooperative rearrangements of the local solute- solvent
structure. This research will explore the solvent motion around a solute
molecule and the coupling of that motion to the electronic, vibrational and
orientational states of the solute. Ultrafast laser technology will permit the
direct time resolution of the fundamental motion in liquids. Through a
combination of nonlinear and coherent spectroscopic techniques it will be
possible to discriminate between the effects of different types of solvent
dynamics. These techniques, specifically transient hole burning and Raman
echoes, have well understood analogues in the solid state and gas phase, but
have not previously been widely applied to the liquid state. These experiments
will lead to new measurements of solute reorientational dynamics, and the
delocalization of vibrational motion in pure solvents.
