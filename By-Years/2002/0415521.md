Professor Akos Vertes of George Washington University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the formation of ions from
molecules in liquids under electrospray conditions. In spite of the long history
of work in this area as well as the importance of Electrospray Ionization Mass
Spectrometry (ESI-MS) in bioanalysis, details of our understanding of the
associated phenomena remain unresolved. This is due in part to the complicated
electro-hydrodynamics that must be addressed more or less simultaneously.
Additional complications have become apparent as our understanding of ionic
solvation has become more sophisticated. Insight is sought into 1) dispersion of
a liquid stream into electrically charged droplets and 2) the ultimate stage of
liberation of sample ions from these droplets. One experiment is to modulate the
electrospray using the spraying voltage in order to synchronize the spray with
the repetitive introduction of ions into the time of flight mass analyzer. Phase
Doppler anemometry, mass spectrometry and microscopic imaging are used to
correlate (primary) droplet size and velocity distributions with the observed
mass spectra. Molecular dynamics is used to study droplet breakup and ion
formation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Fenn's recent Nobel Prize for Electrospray
Ionization Mass Spectroscopy (ESI) is only the most public recognition of its
impact, and in particular, its biochemical applications. Improved understanding
of ESI is highly likely to lead to even more impact. In addition, this
fundamental work on droplet and ion formation is likely to have scientific and
technical impact in diverse processes such as formation of clouds, inhalation
toxicology and drug delivery, nano-processing and manipulation, and printing.
