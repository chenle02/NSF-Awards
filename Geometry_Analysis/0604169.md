The PI proposes to study one and two-dimensional conformal geometric flows and
their applications to image processing. The ideas are original. The PI and his
collaborates have obtained some breakthrough results. These results establish
the solid foundation for their studies of lower dimensional flows via integral
estimates and for them to seek the applications of these geometric flows in
imaging process.

Currently, the PI is working in an interdisciplinary area. The PI is planning to
offer an interdisciplinary course "Geometric flow in imaging process" next year.
The PI is attracting some undergraduate students into his research. The training
in research will have great impact on these young people's future career.
