ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0227337&lt;br/&gt;Douglas M. DeCarlo&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers U, New
Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to show that non-photorealistic
renderings which exhibit meaningful abstraction&lt;br/&gt;are easily understood.
Abstract images are designed to make meaningful structure clear. We
have&lt;br/&gt;worked on the interactive transformation of photographs into
versions which manifest meaningful&lt;br/&gt;abstraction by drawing on eye
movement data [DeCarlo &amp; Santella SIGGRAPH 2002, Santella
&amp;&lt;br/&gt;DeCarlo NPAR 2002]. Over the next year, we intend to carry out
psychophysical experiments that&lt;br/&gt;could both validate our interactive
technique, and provide new ways of learning more about human&lt;br/&gt;vision
eye movements, in particular.&lt;br/&gt;This is high-risk research. Non-
photorealistic rendering (NPR) is an established field, but has&lt;br/&gt;never
been evaluated. Psychophysical methods are typically applied to simple patterns
(i.e. dots&lt;br/&gt;and blobs). However, our method already involves a close
link between NPR and perception and&lt;br/&gt;psychophysics, and our lab
maintains close connections with psychophysicists including
Eileen&lt;br/&gt;Kowler and Thomas Papathomas (both are, like us, affiliated
with the Rutgers Center for Cognitive&lt;br/&gt;Science). Many simple
conjectures and experiments can be stated naturally in our framework;
we&lt;br/&gt;believe we can obtain compelling results.
