Morison 0909408&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct
measurements of oceanic mixing are difficult, but decades of research suggest
that deep background mixing is a consequence of dissipation of internal wave
energy. The exact nature of this relationship is an open question, but it makes
it possible to infer mixing from relatively simple observations of internal wave
energy. The anticipated increase of summer ice-free waters in the Arctic should
result in an increase in internal wave energy in the ocean and potentially
unanticipated consequences for ocean processes and climate. The PI will analyze
existing ocean data for internal waves and mixing using new methods, which in
many cases have not been applied to the Arctic environment. The techniques will
be tested against direct measurements of mixing done in an experiment by a
collaborating Norwegian scientist. He will use existing data to examine the
relation of mixing and internal waves and the relation of internal wave energy
to the ice cover. He will also perform a simple study of the energetics of
internal waves that combines existing ideas about the forcing of internal waves
with new ice model results. Sensitivity studies with a large-scale ice ocean
model will explore the Arctic Ocean model behavior under specified temporally
and spatially varying background mixing and the potential for a positive ice-
mixing feedback on climate.&lt;br/&gt;
