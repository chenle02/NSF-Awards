This is the first phase of an investigation of the "biological pump," a concept
that describes the mechanism by the ocean. The mechanism incorporates the
photosynthetic fixation of carbon in the surface waters, the transfer of this
newly-made particulate organic matter through the food web, its sedimentation to
the deep sea (and/or transport by swimmers), and its subsequent
remineralization. The PI will investigate this conceputal mechanism with an
insitu pumping systemof his own design and construction. This award will enable
him to construct the pumping system.
