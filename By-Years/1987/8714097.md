AISES will undertake a series of activities intended to encourage and support
Native American students to undertake graduate study in science and engineering.
These activities include a 2-hour workshop on "Why Graduate School" at their
Spring Leadership Training Conference, a booth on the same subject to provide
information to the students attending their national conference, and a graduate
scholarship program. This program will provide AISES/NSF Graduate Scholars
Challenge awards of $2,000 each to 10 students selected by the AISES Scholarship
Committee. Each of the students will be assigned an AISES mentor who will
provide guidance and encouragement. The drop-out rates of Native Americans are
extremely high at all points along the educational pipeline and very few secure
graduate degrees. This project, while modest in scale, will be highly visible in
the Native American Communigy and will help to bring more students into the
pipeline leading to careers in science and engineering.
