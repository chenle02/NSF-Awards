*** Auchincloss This grant will support the involvement of undergraduates
nationwide to undertake supervised research projects in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy at the University of Rochester. Aiming at 50%
participation by women and underrepresented minorities, the project complements
other college-wide and departmental initiatives to more fully engage these
groups in science. Students may choose from the following experimental and
theoretical research areas: particle and nuclear physics; quantum optics and
laser; astrophysics and infrared astronomy; condensed matter physics; and
biological and medical physics. On-site housing is available for all
participants. The central research experience takes place during a 2.5-month,
full-time work period each summer, during which time each student works closely
with a faculty advisor to select a research project and pursue it. Mini- courses
in machining and electronics are also offered, and a series of participant
sessions is organized, including seminars on varied subjects -- such as applying
to graduate school, ethical and policy issues in physics, and current topics in
physics research -- and tours of research facilities (the Laboratory for Laser
Energetics, the Mees Observatory, the Laser Cooling and Trapping Lab, and
others). The summer program ends with a mini-symposium at which students present
their research results. Students provide written reports of their research
experience, and faculty advisors are requested to comment on student work. Each
student is strongly encouraged to continue part-time work with his or her
research advisory during the academic year, with the aim of completing a
scientific publication. ***
