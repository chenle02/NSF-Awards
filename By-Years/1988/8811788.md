The essential role of proteases in cellular control mechanisms warrants the
identification of the proteases involved. We propose to investigate processes
dependent upon protease action in the dimorphic fungus Mucor racemosus by
combining biochemical and molecular biological techniques. During spore, swollen
spore, and budding yeast-to-hyphal conversions, increases in aminopeptidase as
well as carboxypeptidase levels were observed. Preliminary studies indicate that
a 39 kilodalton protease (carboxypeptidase; CP2) is expressed in hyphal cells,
but not in spore or yeast cells. We propose to isolate and study CP2 by using
biochemical and protein chemical methods. The elucidation of the basic
biochemistry of CP2 will provide a basis for developing hypotheses about its
physiological functions. In addition, these studies should lay the foundation
which will lead to our cloning and characterizing the CP2 gene. These
investigations should increase the understanding of the relationship of protease
to biological control processes in general and could provide information about
the control of morphogenesis. These studies, using a fungal model system, are
important to our understanding of the growth of this organism. In the long term,
these studies have implications for our understanding of protein synthesis and
metabolism, and nutrition in many organisms. Protein synthesis, function and
transformation is vital in all organisms, yet we know little about the important
biochemical events and their regulation. These studies are aimed at increasing
our understanding of these important processes.
