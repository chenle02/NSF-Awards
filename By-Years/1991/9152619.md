The goal of this project is to expand and enhance the curriculum in animal
physiology by (1) creating a new laboratory course in Neurobiology, (2)
modernizing and expanding the exercises in an existing course, Laboratory in
Physiology, and (3) enhancing exercises and demonstrations in Contemporary
Issues in Biology, a large introductory course for non-science majors. The
purchase of computerized data acquisition systems and software as well as
scientific instruments used for neurobiological and physiological techniques,
such as transducers, electrodes, stimulators, amplifiers, micromanipulators,
fiber optic illuminators, and a microelectrode puller, provides students with
hands-on, working knowledge of current methods used in neurobiological research.
Examples include: (1) intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological
recording techniques; (2) neuroanatomical techniques; and (3) basic biochemical
techniques used in the isolation of neuroactive substances.
