The project will develop the use of interactive graphics and molecular modeling
software as the equivalent of a laboratory for teaching structural principles in
chemistry and biochemistry. Students will do modeling, energy calculations and
conformational analysis of small molecules, as well as analysis and manipulation
of protein structures. Use of the equipment will be extended to the organic and
introductory courses. Student/faculty research is an important part of the
curriculum and the workstations and software will be utilized in all areas of
chemistry represented in the department. Introducing students to the uses of
these systems early in their scientific careers will allow them more
independence, permitting them to discover for themselves how chemical properties
are related to molecular structure.
