This project, CalcVR, will explore the use of virtual reality (VR) in the
teaching of multi-variable calculus. An important outcome is that the principal
investigators will more than triple the number of lessons and demonstrations
they have created so far on a cutting-edge educational platform based on the
Unity software platform and freely available tools from Google. Additionally,
the new materials may be extended to allow others to build VR materials that can
be easily deployed. The design of the software will allow for distribution at no
cost to the user through the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. Further,
the hardware costs are negligible, because Smartphones are almost universal.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In multi-variable calculus, one of the greatest obstacles
for students is the visualization of surfaces and other figures in three or more
dimensions. To support students' visualization in calculus, CalcVR has two
overarching goals. The first is to create and improve demonstrations and lessons
of multi-variable calculus concepts in an immersive virtual reality environment
that can be easily accessed using mobile technology, via the freely-available
CalcVR app. The second is to measure the effectiveness of the educational
material in the CalcVR app and corresponding course materials. Formative
assessments will include student interviews, feedback from an Advisory Board of
experts, and broad student surveys. Additional research will include the
analysis of student responses to specific exam questions on conceptual topics of
importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
