This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will have a novel
approach for the rapid fabrication of low-cost and net-shape, silicon carbide
components with specifically tailored multifunctional properties. These
materials will be produced by microwave-induced pyrolysis of an actively seeded,
high-purity preceramic polymer. The control of processing parameters will allow
for direct control over material micro/nano-structure, mechanical, electrical
and/or thermal characteristics, and physical properties including porosity and
gas permeability.

A variety of polymeric precursors to silicon carbide have been formulated that
contain silicon and undergo a polymer-to-ceramic conversion when heated at
temperatures above 800C, which allows the production of highly three-
dimensionally covalent refractory components that are difficult to fabricate via
the traditional powder processing. In order to reduce processing time and
provide a larger throughput rate, nonconventional heating systems, such as
microwave heating, are being investigated.
