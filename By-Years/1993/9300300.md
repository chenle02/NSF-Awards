This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Wake Forest University
to continue a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE.
Undergraduate students, with the primary emphasis on women and minorities, will
be given the opportunity of a 10 week research experience (Summer Undergraduate
Research Experience) with faculty members in the Department . The research
interests of the students will be matched with those of participating faculty.
In conjunction with the research experience, students will be exposed to a range
of other activities, including two, overnight field trips and a weekly seminar
program given by departmental faculty members. Special time will be set aside
for instruction in elementary biostatistics, experimental design, slide
preparation, etc. The summer's research activities will culminate with an
afternoon-long colloquium, at which time the students will present the results
of their work to faculty and other summer participants. Students will be
quartered in one of the University's residential houses in order to facilitate
maximum student-student interaction. During the final days of the summer
program, the students will be joined by their faculty Mentors from their home
institutions. In this way, it is hoped that the students can better share their
research experiences with faculty with whom they may be spending the remainder
of their undergraduate career. In this way they may also be able to sustain
their research momentum and perhaps entice them into a graduate program on
completion of their baccalaureate degrees.
