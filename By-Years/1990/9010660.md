This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Przemyslaw B. Maslak at the Pennsylvania State University. The results of this
investigation will provide an improved understanding of the relationships
between chemical reactivity and electronic and molecular structure fora highly
reactive class of chemical intermediates. The experiments that will be carried
out by Dr. Maslak will focus on the unimolecular cleavage of radical ions into
radicals and ions, a processes called mesolysis. Kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters will be determined for mesolytic cleavage reactions of sigma bonds in
a series of radical ions that can be generated by photoinduced electron
transfer. Standard redox potentials will be measured for corresponding radicals,
ions, and radical ions. Experiments will probe the effects of molecular
structure, ion pairing, and solvent on the relationship between activation
energy for mesolytic cleavage and the corresponding free energy change for bond
rupture.
