This project is developing a laboratory to house the junior/senior level
physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and polymer science labs. These labs
are being developed in concert with other aspects of curriculum revision. The
concept for these labs is unique. Laboratory experiments are being grouped into
clusters, with each cluster stressing a particular chemical theme and individual
experiments stressing a fundamental principle. Students are learning basic
chemistry, and yet their experiments will build on each other from one week to
the next, and even from one lab course to the next. The flexibility to
continuously introduce or phase out experiments and experimental clusters is
built into the program.
