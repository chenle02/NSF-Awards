Ohio State University requests support from NSF for connection of Heidelberg
University, Antioch University, and Ohio Wesleyan University to the Ohio
Academic Resources Network (OARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that
serves the State of Ohio. A primary goal of OARnet is to facilitate
collaborative projects and sharing of resources between instutuion, including
those outside the state. OARnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the three universities a connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The universities need greater functionality and network speed to be
able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with
being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty
research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the
schools to explore annovative educational resources.***
