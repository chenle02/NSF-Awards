9309123 Bamieh The design of robust controllers has progressed significantly in
the past decade, resulting in sophisticated design theories and algorithms that
produce high performance controllers in the presence of uncertainty, and
enabling the designer to probe the fundamental limits of performance of control
systems configurations. However, theoretical design problems ignore some
important implementations issues and constraints, and thus robust control
designs tend to be currently used for investigating limits of performance rather
than actually producing the controllers. The proposed research is centered
around the idea of incorporating general implementation constraints and
requirements in the theory of robust controller design. An example is the design
of sampled-data controllers with continuous-time performance objectives, which
arise from the consideration that sampled-data controllers. Controller design
with implementation constraints give rise to theoretically challenging problems,
and their solution will greatly enhance the applicability of robust control
theory to control practice. ***
