This award will fund the participation of US-based researchers in the third US-
Mexico Conference on Representation Theory, Categorification, and Non-
Commutative Algebra that will take place at Universidad Nacional Autonoma de
Mexico in Mexico City, November 27-December 1, 2017. Representation theory is a
major branch of mathematics that studies symmetries of physical theories and of
mathematical objects. Often the main objects in representation theory are only
the shadow of richer structures that are recovered through deeper study. Non-
commutative algebra is another major, related branch of algebra that studies
deformations of commutative objects found in quantum theories, representation
theory, and geometry. The foci of the conference will be on recent advances at
the interface of representation theory and non-commutative algebra; on fostering
an environment for the establishment of international collaborations between the
US and Mexico in this research areas; and on exposing graduate students, post-
docs, and young faculty in both countries to current developments in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have been organizing one week-long
conference in this US-Mexico series each academic year since January 2015. These
conferences alternate between the US and Mexico. The main scientific topics for
the 3rd conference will be algebraic, geometric and homological methods in
representation theory, categorification, and representations and ideal structure
of non-commutative algebras. The talks will cover some of the most recent trends
including: cluster algebras, quantum symmetries, monoidal and additive
categorifications, Calabi-Yau algebras and categories, and non-commutative
projective algebraic geometry. The website for the conference is
