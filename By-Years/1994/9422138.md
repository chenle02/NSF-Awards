9422138 Dorr This award is to purchase equipment (cost-shared with The Institute
for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) and Department of Linguistics at the
University of Maryland) dedicated to support specific projects in the laboratory
for Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP). These projects
are in the areas of information mediation, language translation and tutoring,
and text filtering and retrieval. The software requirements include large
dictionaries, corpora, data models and databases, high-level database query
languages, and a Prolog interpreter. Since many of these resources are available
only on CD ROMs, the hardware requirements include an optical disk controller
and large disks for storage. Also there is a need for two workstations with
significant computing power for indexing and processing of text and installation
of an object server. Finally, four Xterminals for extensive prototype
development and an eye-tracker for testing hypotheses related to the development
of psycholinguistically-grounded NLP models are needed. ***
