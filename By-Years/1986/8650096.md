The University of California, Riverside, is sponsoring a program to retain
current physics teachers who are teaching outside their college major, in order
to improve their classroom presentation. The program will provide specific
teaching aids, and will review the mathematics essential to the teaching of
physics. Twenty-eight high school and junior high school teachers of physics and
physical science will attend a four-week summer workshop. Participants will be
drawn from the Riverside and San Bernardino County Schools. Weeks one and two of
the workshops will cover a number of basic physics principles and the
construction of demonstrations which explain these principles. In addition to
previous activities, week three will review the mathematics necessary to the
teaching of physics and will incorporate computer usage. Week four will be
devoted to the specific interests and problems of the individual participants.
Teachers will return to their schools with lecture-demonstration devices
designed and built during the summer. The workshop will be supplemented by a
series of guest lectures. During the academic year, there will be two one-day
workshops in February and May, where teachers will share their experiences of
incorporating the materials into their classes.
