The constituents of many abundant elements on the Earth, including those
composing our own bodies, are manufactured during the brief explosion stage of a
massive star known as a supernova. The Principal Investigator proposes to
continue his theoretical work on the advanced stages of evolution of stars,
including several aspects of supernova explosion. His previous work has been
pivotal in the past to an understanding of the explosion of the Supernova 1987a
from a blue supergiant progenitor. The continuation of his study will focus on
providing the astronomical community with evolutionary models of stellar
structure, of improving the physics of semiconvection and diffusion on which
these models have been based, on treating the explosion of a supernova as a
problem in the well-understood context of stellar winds, and on improving the
"rapid"-process rates of nucleosynthetic reactions.
