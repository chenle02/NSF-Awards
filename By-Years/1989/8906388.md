The instrumentation requested in this proposal will enhance the PIs research in
animal-cell culture engineering and metabolic engineering of anaerobic bacteria
by enabling the PIs to more closely monitor changes in cell metabolism and
product expression. The requested instruments will be initially used for three
major research projects. The first project investigates the effect of various
environmental stresses on monoclonal antibody production by hybridoma cells. It
will also examine the utility of stress-protein promoters for production of
recombinant glycoproteins by animal cells. The second examines effects of the
bioreactor hydrodynamic environment on the viability, metabolism, macromolecular
synthesis, and product expression of animal cells in microcarrier and free-
suspension reactors. The third project will investigate the ability and means of
altering the primary metabolism (metabolic engineering) of butyric-acid
anaerobic bacteria (clostridia) in order to construct more efficient whole-cell
biocatalysts for large scale anaerobic fermentations.
