This exploratory research project will study the feasibility of a major
national initiative to change the standard practice of staff development in the
United States. Current reform movements call for teachers to take on new
responsibilities for school decision making and instructional leadership and
then to be held accountable for student outcomes. Our teachers must, therefore,
be provided with opportunities to advance their understanding of subject matter
and to build collegial networks in support of their efforts. A shift to this new
view of staff development will require broadscale changes in policy, practice,
and public opinion. As a first step, this study will address a number of
unanswered questions about the nature and extent of the dominant paradigm of
staff development and about the interest and commitment of individuals or
organizations whose attention to the issues of staff development is a necessary
ingredient for future success. The study should have two important results: 1)
It will provide a much more accurate picture of the dimensions of the problems
surrounding the funding, organization, and delivery of staff development in
mathematics and science, and 2) It will lead to greater understanding of and
investment in the issues related to the reform of staff development in the
United States.
