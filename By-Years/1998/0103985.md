The Principle Investigator proposes to focus on three central problems in set-
theoretic topology which involve basic countable convergence issues and set-
theoretic independence results. The first question, due to Efimov, is to
determine if it is consistent that any compact space that does not contain a
converging sequence will contain the Stone-Cech compactification of the
integers. The second, due to Bashkirov, is to determine if there can be a
countable bound on the sequential order of a compact sequential space. This
problem can, in some ways, be viewed as a very interesting strengthening of the
recently resolved Moore-Mrowka problem. The third is to continue a systematic
study of the Stone-Cech remainder of the reals analogous to that which has long
been conducted for the remainder of the integers. There appears to be many
obstructions to progess caused by the additional complexity imposed by the
connectedness property.

General questions of the existence of converging sequences and the extent to
which converging sequences fully determine the topological structure arise
frequently in a variety of settings. These questions are particularly meaningful
in the context of compact subsets of function spaces (natural informative
topologies on sets of real-valued functions). The investigator is continuing to
pursue lines of investigation that have stimulated intensive interaction between
the fields of general topology and set-theory for de
