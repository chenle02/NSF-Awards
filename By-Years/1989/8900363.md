This project will support a review of literature on interna- tional flows of
scientists and engineers to and from the United States. It will describe and
evaluate, and summarize materials relevant to the improvement of the treatment
of international flows of scientists and engineers in models of the science and
engineering labor market in the United States. Results of this survey will be
used by used by NSF analysts and other science policy analysts to improve the
modeling of the supply of scientists and engineers to assist in projecting
future supply and demand balances. This work falls within the Founda- tion's
mission of performing long-term projections of the scientific and technical
labor force.
