0418366&lt;br/&gt;Ibarra&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE), will take place in Mendoza, Argentina in January 2005 on the topic
of Advanced Networking Technologies leveraged for Physics and Astronomy.
Organized by Julio Ibarra and Heidi Alvarez of Florida International University,
the institute will involve approximately 40 advanced graduate students and 10
lecturers in the field from the United States and Latin America. One expected
result is that a bridge between astronomy, physics and the advanced networking
community will be created, fostering new discoveries. The institute will act as
both an educational tool, and an incubator of ideas. It will not focus solely on
fundamental research but rather will seek to encourage a new generation of
scientists and engineers who are capable of fully integrating advanced
networking into astronomy and physics research and education. &lt;br/&gt;
