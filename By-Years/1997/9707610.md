9707610 Levin An important process shaping the ecology of any organisms in
nature is coevolution, the evolutionary interplay among distinct species.
Understanding coevolution requires mathematical and computer models to describe
how interactions among species change over long time intervals; yet the
construction and analysis of such models is rarely possible because of
inadequate understanding of the biological processes, and the complexity of the
mathematical description. Empirical work by the investigators, however, has
produced useful short-term models of interactions between insects and their
pathogens, and mathematical breakthroughs in the PI's lab have greatly
simplified long term coevolutionary models. In this research, the investigators
will apply these advances to understanding how host-pathogen interactions,
especially in insects, are affected by the coevolution of host and pathogen.
Because insects are important agricultural pests, and because pathogens are
important natural means of pest control, the research will have direct and
important environmental applications.
