The Divison of Statistics at Northern Illinois University will purchase
computing equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in
statistics. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
in particular: 1. Additive models and data mining 2. Bayesian modles in
reliability. 3. Small sample performance of models with dependent binary data.
4. Bayesian model selection for stochastic volatility. 5. Performance of
bootstrap confidence intervals.
