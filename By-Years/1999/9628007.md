9628007 Kirschvink This grant provides $65,287 as one-half support of the cost
of acquiring a new 2G Enterprises Direct-Current (DC) superconducting
magnetometer (SQuID) for the Department of Geology at the California Institute
of Technology. The instrument will replace an antiquated radio-frequency (Rf)
SQuID that has a high potential for failure. The new instrument will provide
much greater sensitivity and broader dynamic range than the Rf-SQuID and result
in a significant reduction in lab operating costs due to the DC-SQuID's much
more efficient use of liquid helium. This acquisition will allow the PI to
continue his extremely well-respected research in geomagnetism and biomagnetism
and will provide a valuable resource to the frequent users of this laboratory.
