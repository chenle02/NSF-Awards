High-performance computing systems (supercomputers) continue to grow in size and
complexity. Today's leading edge systems contain tens of thousands of server
nodes, and proposed, next-generation systems are likely to contain hundreds of
thousands of nodes. At this scale, maintaining system operation when hardware
components may fail every few minutes or hours is increasingly difficult.
Increasing system sizes bring a complementary challenge surrounding energy
availability and costs, with projected systems expected to consume ten or more
megawatts of power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For future high-performance computing
systems to be useable and cost effective, we must develop new design
methodologies and operating principles that embody the two important realities
of large-scale systems: frequent hardware component failures are a part of
normal operation and (b) energy consumption and power costs must be managed as
carefully as performance and resilience. As part of this research, the principal
investigator will apply new ideas from commercial cloud computing to HPC
systems, focusing on reliability and energy efficiency. This includes models of
high-performance computing system design based on right-sizing hardware building
blocks to balance operating costs for component replacement and repair against
capital costs for over-provisioning, and incorporation of energy costs and
constraints into scheduling systems and resource allocations, making computing
costs visible to researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deployment of very
large-scale computing systems, which target science, engineering and defense
problems of critical national interest, is currently limited by both system
reliability and energy consumption. New design and operating approaches for
reliability and energy management can both reduce costs and increase access,
allowing computer companies to design larger systems, research institutions to
deploy systems more widely, and researchers to better manage computational
resources.
