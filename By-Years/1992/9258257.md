The aspartate receptor will be used as a model system for transmembrane
signaling. It will be investigated using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance
techniques and mutant receptor proteins to determine critical distances and
geometric relationships in the combining site and accessibility of solvent and
ligands to the combining site. Clustering of the receptor protein will also be
studied. The results should yield a visualization at the molecular level of the
receptor binding site and the role of receptor clustering and conformational
changes in the receptor binding process. %%% Signal transduction is essential to
biological organisms or organelles for the sensing of the environment, reacting
to it if necessary and in intercellular communication. This research will focus
on understanding how membrane receptors transmit information across cell
membranes. The goal is to determine how structures of specific regions or active
sites of the receptor molecules in the membrane change during the signaling
process. Both the biophysical approaches used in this study and the insight
gained into the molecular mechanisms of signaling should be generally useful for
understanding more complex membrane receptors.
