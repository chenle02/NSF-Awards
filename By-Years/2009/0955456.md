This CAREER award will enable the PI, Patricia Vahle, Assistant Professor of
Physics at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, to participate in
the commissioning and operation of the NOvA Integration Prototype Near Detector
(IPND). This CAREER program describes a plan of research with realistic
potential for broader impact which takes good advantage of the PI's experience
and expertise and positions the PI to make a significant contribution to NOvA in
the areas of calibration and data analysis, areas which are obviously important
too for future particle physics experiments. The IPND will be installed on the
surface at Fermilab starting in the summer of 2010, providing a test bed for the
NOvA detector design and systems integration. After a year of running on the
surface, the detector will be disassembled and reinstalled underground, becoming
the NOvA near detector. The neutrino data collected with the detector allow for
the development of detector calibration techniques, signal versus background
separation algorithms, and tests of the simulation of nuclear hadronization and
reinteraction processes, all of which are crucial to the success of the
experiment. Within the broader impact, the project will be a training ground for
undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc. The IPND program offers ample
short term hardware and analysis projects, ideally suited to an undergraduate
summer research experience. To ensure a vibrant scientific program into the
future, one needs to capture the imagination of students well before they enter
college. To that end, Vahle proposes providing local high school and middle
school teachers the opportunity to participate in summer research projects on
site at Fermilab. In the summers she is in Williamsburg, she would exploit the
relationship developed between the W&amp;M neutrino group and the local school
teachers by employing a teacher for several weeks over the summer to help
develop, then implement, science events.
