0214280&lt;br/&gt;Farquharson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to develop a real-time anthrax
(Bacillus anthracis) detector for mail-sorting systems. The proposed analyzer
would allow detecting, identifying and removing anthrax laden letters in a mail-
sorting machine prior to distribution. The Phase I Project will focus on
improving sensitivity so that 1000 spores can be detected in 10 seconds. The
folow on Phase II Project will develop a prototype anthrax detector for testing
in mail sorting facilities. Successful completion of the proposed project will
result in a tool that will decrease the threat of widespread
anthrax&lt;br/&gt;infection and increase homeland
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are
self evident. The proposed analyzer wil be of immediate use at the US Military
Postal Service Agency, at the US postal office, at private postal services, as
well as in large office buildings and corporations that employ their own
internal mailing office centers. Modifications to&lt;br/&gt;the system would
also allow rapid detection of chemical agents in glass or plastic containers at
ports of entry (e.g. at airports).
