9722378 Robertson Ion channels are proteins that allow the flow of ions across
cell membranes. The movement of the charged ions produces electrical activity
that is the basis of communication in the brain. The long-range goal of this
research is to understand how the Eag family of potassium channels contribute to
electrical signaling in the nervous system. Although these channels can be
detected biochemically, their functional properties and physiological roles are
unknown. The specific aims of the project include a combined
electrophysiological and pharmacological approach to characterize currents
produced by these channels in brain tissue slice. A simpler "expression system"
containing pure populations of these channels will be used to further
characterize factors that control the opening and closing, or "gating," of the
channels. These research activities involve undergraduates in an integrated,
supervised program in which students cooperate in the design, execution and
analysis of experiments. They will report their findings at scientific meetings
and in manuscripts for publication, thus developing writing and communication
skills in a scientific setting. The educational goal of the project is to
provide these students the opportunity for scientific discovery in an active
learning paradigm not typically available to undergraduates, and to develop the
skills and self- confidence necessary to pursue careers in science.
