****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;One of the central issues in condensed
matter physics is understanding the nature of the ground states in strongly
correlated materials, the transitions between those states, and the associated
dynamics. This project will seek to answer those questions by conducting a
series of linear, non-linear and time-resolved transport measurements on two
model experimental systems: two-dimensional electron system in semiconductor
heterostructures and underdoped copper oxides. The knowledge gained from those
studies will be essential to the development of condensed matter subfields of
strongly correlated materials and out-of-equilibrium phenomena. This project
will support the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students,
who will acquire valuable technical and analytical skills for a wide range of
careers in the areas of science and technology in academic, industrial or
government settings. The PI and graduate students will also engage in a variety
of outreach activities, such as the Annual Open House at the National High
Magnetic Field Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical
Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;In many novel materials with potentially great
technological importance, such as high-temperature superconductors, the state
that conducts electricity (a "conductor") is created by chemically doping an
otherwise insulating material. Such materials, therefore, find themselves close
to the conductor-insulator transition. Understanding the nature of this
transition thus represents an important issue for materials science and
technology. It also presents a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics.
This project will address the problem of complex behavior near the conductor-
insulator transition by performing electrical transport measurements on
semiconductor devices and high temperature superconductor materials. The results
anticipated from these experiments are expected to provide fundamental insights
into these problems, and may be of relevance for future applications. The
project will give graduate and undergraduate students an excellent preparation
for careers in academia, industry, and government.
