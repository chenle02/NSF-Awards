A set of experimental and analytical studies is conducted to control compressor
noise using shaped piezo actuators. Experiments are conducted to obtain
equivalent forces exerted by piezo-actuators, wave numbers, and mode coupling
characteristics of different shapes. A finite element method based formulation
is developed to verify these observations. Piezo actuators are mounted on
compressors commonly used in household air-conditioning units to prove the
effectiveness of the developments.
