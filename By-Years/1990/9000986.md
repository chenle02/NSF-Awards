The aim of this project is to provide research experience to undergraduate
students, including women and minorities, selected from the host and other
institutions. It trains them in laboratory experimentation supplemented by
numerical modeling procedures, appropriate to the research in civil engineering.
Its objectives are to train the selected undergraduate students, so that upon
the completion of this project they are able to: 1) select and make a
formulation of the research problem in their field of interest; 2) identify the
different methods of experimental and numerical modeling procedures available
for the solution of the problem; 3) choose a particular procedure relevant to
the current problem based on inherent parameters and applicability of procedure;
4) implement the methodology of selected experimental and/or numerical modeling
procedure; 5) describe the modeling procedure and present the results in a
professional manner, i.e., in the form of a project report and/or a technical
paper; 6) communicate the results of the project to others orally; and 7)
interact with people of diverse educational, social, and cultural background.
