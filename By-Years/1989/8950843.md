The Department of Chemistry at Calvin College has purchased four reparative gas
chromatographs and a FTIR with a solids sampling accessory. These instruments
complete the conversion of the organic chemistry laboratory program from macro
to microscale. These instruments acquired for this project are fully integrated
in to the sophomore level organic chemistry as well as organobiochemistry and
advanced organic chemistry. These instruments provide students with hands-on
experience in reparative gas chromatography and enables the students to purify
small samples of liquids isolated in the microscale experiments. FTIR
spectroscopy provides experience with a modern instrumentation and strengthens
the students education. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
