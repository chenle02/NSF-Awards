This project explores an architecture, mechanisms, and interfaces for helping
users manage access control in the digital home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The home
is a challenging, yet critical, target for usable security.&lt;br/&gt;It
requires abstractions that are intuitive for laypeople, interfaces that allow
users to manipulate those abstractions, and access-control and storage
infrastructure that can support the abstractions. Without a holistic, usable
approach to access-control management, adoption of new technology in the home
will be slowed and there will be no effective data security once the transition
inevitably occurs. Based on their early experiences with home storage, the PIs
seek to adapt and integrate:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) the semantic query as an
abstraction for describing a set of files to which a specific policy
applies;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) the Expandable Grid as a visual interaction
technique for creating, editing, and viewing security
policies;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) logic-based access control as a rigorous
foundation for specifying and implementing policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User
studies, surveys, and test deployments are a core component of the project; they
are used to discover needs of users in the digital home and users' ability to
effectively apply approaches developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has
several forms of impact. First, it develops tools and techniques that can
significantly simplify the use of access control in the digital home. Second, it
increases understanding of user behavior and access-control needs in the
emerging home storage environment. Third, it enhances education at CMU and
elsewhere, as new insights are embedded into storage systems, distributed
systems, and computer security classes taught by the PIs.&lt;br/&gt;
