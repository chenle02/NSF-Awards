9416779 Stock There is a significant misfit, ranging from 50 to 250 kms, of
magnetic anomalies 13, 18, and 20 along the section of the Southeast Indian
Ridge east of the Balleny fracture zone. This project will survey the critical
plate boundaries and relevant magnetic anomalies in the South Tasman Sea,
Emerald Basin and north of the Ross Sea embayment that will better constrain the
history of the this plate motion. Data collected will be used to test the
hypothesis that the Antarctic side of the ridge acted as a separate plate,
attached to Marie Byrd Land, and that these anomalies indirectly indicate motion
between East and West Antarctica between anomalies 24 and 13 time. Surveys will
be conducted on the R/V W M Ewing in the Tasman Sea, and on the R/V N B Palmer
north of the Ross Sea embayment. ***
