9304962 Kelts This award supports a paleoenvironmental investigation of Lake
Victoria under the auspices of the International Decade for the East African
Lakes (IDEAL). A seismic reflection and side-scan sonar survey will be conducted
to delineate modern sedimentary environments, determine previous lowstand
shorelines, locate and measure thick sedimentary sequences, and identify
promising core sites for the recovery of 20 meter sediment cores. The primary
objective is to reconstruct a detailed environmental and climatic history of
Lake Victoria and its environs over the last 15,000 years, and compare that
record within the regional and global network of sites showing decadal and
century-scale rapid climate change. This work will provide a chronologically
robust, high resolution, multi-proxy mapping of the Lake Victoria system's
response and sensitivity to climate variation. This work will be undertaken in
close collaboration with the African scientific community. ***
