Squall lines occur over most moist areas of the Earth. In the Great Plains of
the United States, a large fraction of the growing season precipitation comes
from squall lines. In addition, severe weather is common with squall line
systems. The Principal Investigator will continue research into the structure of
squall lines. This will be both an observational and numerical modeling effort
using data collected during the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project. A
particularly unique aspect of this research is that a wide range of aircraft and
remote sensing observations exist on the early stages of the squall lines
lifetime. This provides an opportunity to study the development of a feature
known as the rear inflow jet which has been shown to be a dynamically important
feature of squall lines.
