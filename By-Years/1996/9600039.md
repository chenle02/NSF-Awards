The goal of this research project is to study the response properties of free
metal microclusters and carbon fullerenes in order to map out the progression
from molecular to nanostructure to bulk characteristics. Specific attention will
be paid to the determination of the electric polarizabilities of the clusters
and the electron attachment via capture in the cluster polarization field.
Measurements of this type for the alkali metals and mercury are important in
sorting out the results of theoretical treatments of the changeover from the
practical understanding of the behavior of delocalized electrons in clusters and
nanostructures.
