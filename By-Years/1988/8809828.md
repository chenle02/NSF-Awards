This research will investigate the fundamental engineering aspects of laser
ablation of biological tissue. The theoretical aspects of optics, thermodynamics
and biochemistry will be drawn to bear on the problem of tissue interaction with
electromagnetic radiation. Although lasers have been used in surgical theaters
for many years, this research should enlighten users on the detailed biological
effects of the laser beam and living tissue.
