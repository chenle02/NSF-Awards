Using the optimal choice of experimental conditions or of arrangements of
experimental units or material maximizes the precision of the inferences drawn
from the experiment. This research will construct mathematically designs which
are efficient and robust in the presence of correlations among adjacent
experimental units, designs based on clustering techniques which are efficient
and also permit detection of departures from model assumptions, and designs
which can be used simultaneously or subsequently to separate effects of factors
or combinations of factors which are confounded in an initial fractional
factorial screening experiment.
