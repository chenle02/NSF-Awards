The Appraisal-tendency framework (ATF) in emotion science describes how
different emotions act to color the decisions an individual makes, even about
things unrelated to the events or circumstances that induced the emotion. ATF
correctly predicts, for example, that the experience of sadness makes people
willing to pay more to acquire standard economic goods and services. The current
research tests predictions of ATF regarding willingness to engage in pro-social
behavior and decisions about consumption of addictive substances, for which
emotions may have different, and potentially stronger, effects. The results of
this research will contribute to our deeper understanding of the influence of
affect on choice, as well as having potentially broad implications for the
design of interventions to address substance abuse problems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators will conduct five experiments
that test whether experimentally inducing sadness or gratitude can alter simple
altruism, cooperation, cigarette valuation, and sunk cost effects regarding
cigarette consumption, and whether gratitude can counteract the effects of
sadness. ATF predicts that sadness and gratitude will have diverging effects on
pro-social behavior and addictive behavior, with gratitude increasing
prosociality and reducing cigarette consumption and sadness doing the opposite.
