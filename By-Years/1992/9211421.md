Lift planning is becoming more complex, and owner tolerance of the risk of
catastrophic damage to their operating facilities is decreasing. These problems
have motivated planner to explore the use of computer technology to aid the lift
planning process. The objectives of this research are to: 1. Develop preliminary
and detailed crane and object locating and object lift path planning algorithms
in two and three dimensions respectively. 2. Explore means of applying the
algorithms developed above to multiple lift planning, fleet selection, and lift
dynamic control. 3. Recommend ways of extending the methods developed in this
research to automated task and motion planning for construction robotics.
