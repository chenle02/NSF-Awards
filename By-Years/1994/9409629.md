Recent advances in computing technology and data availability have sharply
reduced the cost of real-time forecasting of the economy using large numbers of
time series data. At the same time, there is considerable evidence that economic
forecasting systems have had significant episodes of instability, a recent
example being the poor performance of most models entering the 1990 to 1991
recession and the subsequent slow recovery. The purpose of this research is to
develop and analyze forecasting methodologies when predictive relationships are
changing over time. Several large data and rich data sets will be used to assess
the performance of various adaptive forecasting systems. These include data from
the postwar U.S., data from the U.S. before World War II, and data from Canada
and Israel. This research is important because it holds the promise of improving
significantly economic forecasting. An important application would be in the
area of improving long-term energy forecasting and assessing global
environmental change.
