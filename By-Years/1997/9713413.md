1997 AMS Summer Research Institute on "Differential Geometry and Control" The
American Mathematical Society's long-standing series of three-week long summer
research institutes bring together between 100 and 300 mathematicians actively
working in a particular field of mathematical research. Emphasis is placed on
instruction and information exchange at a very high level, including lectures by
distinguished mathematicians in related fields designed to promote interaction
between participants while broadening their mathematical perspectives. Members
of the Organizing Committee for the 1997 Summer Research Institute are:
Professor Hector J. Sussmann, Rutgers University (Chair) Professor Henry Hermes,
University of Colorado at Boulder (Co-chair) Professor Guillermo S. Ferreyra,
Louisiana State University Professor Robert B. Gardner, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill The Institute will be held at Boulder, Colorado, on the
campus of the University of Colorado between June 29 and July 19, 1997. Staff of
the American Mathematical Society will provide administrative support for the
conference.
