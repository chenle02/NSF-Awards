The principal investigator will study the effect of pressure on hydrogen bonding
in hydrogarnets. To do so he will determine the crystal structures at high
pressure of four synthetic specimens using a new high-P cell developed for the
high-intensity neutron- powder diffractometer at the Los Alamos Scattering
Center. This study will indicate whether garnet might be a storage site for
hydrogen in the Earth`s mantle.
