This Portland Community College (PCC) project creates an opportunity for science
and non-science majors to increase their understanding of physical laws of
nature as they apply to chemistry by using computer-interfaced instrumentation.
PCC requests support from the National Science Foundation to acquire a modern
Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) for the chemistry department
at PCC, Sylvania Campus, and critical pieces of molecular biology equipment to
be housed at the Center for Research on Occupational and Environmental
Toxicology (CROET). The acquisition of this equipment will create a dual-site
instructional laboratory that will provide opportunities for introductory and
advanced learning and training for the workforce for PCC students. The dual-site
will also provide opportunities for faculty enhancement. The link between a
community college such as PCC and a research institution such as CROET is
innovative and will be a national model for the improvement of undergraduate
laboratory instruction.
