This award supports a workshop to be co-organized by Dr. Samuel Bowles and Dr.
Paul Hooper and to be held at the Santa Fe Institute. The workshop will bring
together leading contributors to the theoretical literature on social networks
with anthropologists and other field researchers using network techniques to
study the social structure of small-scale societies. The objectives are: (a) to
enrich network theory by deploying it in a large set of data in an attempt to
answer central social science questions of political hierarchy and economic
inequality; (b) to enhance the theoretical, statistical and computational
capacity of field workers in the quantitative study of networks; and (c) to
provide the basis of one or more synthetic comparative papers, as well as papers
on the individual populations involved.
