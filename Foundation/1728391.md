The 2017-2019 BLAST conferences will be the eighth through tenth in a series of
yearly meetings devoted to the foundations of mathematics, with the BLAST 2017
meeting being held during August 13 to 17 at Vanderbilt University in Nashville,
Tennessee. The BLAST conference series focuses on Boolean algebra, lattice
theory, algebraic logic, general algebra, set theory, and set-theoretic
topology. The University of Denver will host the 2018 meeting and the University
of Colorado will host the 2019 meeting.

Each year this grant will support the participation of 15-20 graduate students
and recent Ph.D.'s and 12 speakers. Participation by women and minorities will
be actively sought and encouraged. The conference series provides an environment
for graduate students and young researchers to learn about new developments in
several related areas of the foundations of mathematics and provides them with a
venue to showcase their own work.
