The Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education (CAEE) at the University
of Washington is advancing the scholarship of engineering learning and teaching
through a partnership with Stanford University, Colorado School of Mines, the
University of Minnesota, and Howard University. CAEE is a multifaceted Higher
Education Center for Learning and Teaching clustered around three core elements:
Scholarship on Learning Engineering, the Program for Enhancing Engineering
Teaching, and Annual Engineering Education Institutes. The Center's Scholarship
on Learning Engineering includes cross-institutional longitudinal research
studies on learning to engineer focusing on the development of engineers from
undergraduate education through entry into the engineering workforce and
targeted studies of core competencies and concepts central to engineering.
Professional development activities under the Center's Program for Enhancing
Engineering Teaching (PEET) include the identification of resources to help
engineering faculty address teaching challenges, thematic and research-to-
practice workshops for future and current faculty, an engineering teaching
portfolio initiative for graduate students, and the development of the
Engineering Teaching Source, a web-based tool to enable engineering educators
and instructional developers to locate high quality teaching resources. Annual
Engineering Education Institutes for engineering faculty and graduate students
build and sustain the community of engineering education scholars. The
Institutes are advancing the engineering education research infrastructure by
increasing the number of people able to conduct rigorous research and to become
leaders in engineering education research and change agents in engineering
education. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate
Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Division
of Engineering and Education Centers in the Directorate for Engineering.
