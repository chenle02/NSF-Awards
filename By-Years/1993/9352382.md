This proposal requests instrumentation for a hands-on process- oriented
laboratory experience in cell biology for intermediate level students at Georgia
Southern University. The pedagogical approach involves mastery learning,
discovery learning and process learning. A few techniques are presented
repeatedly with elaboration at each repetition. This allows students the safety
of making mistakes, and it is through that safety that learning takes place. In
addition to learning a few transferable skills thoroughly, we use the writing of
a scientific paper as a vehicle to teach data analysis, data interpretation,
writing skills, hypothesis testing, and protocol development. Our goal is to
propel our students into a research experience which culminates in a complete,
full, scientific paper and an oral presentation about techniques and equipment
available for cell biology. Students are encouraged to keep a journal of their
subjective thoughts concerning the lab. This enables students in an
unthreatening way to write about science, and to understand the precise and
objective communication of scientific information.
