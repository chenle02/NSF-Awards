This PYI will conduct fundamental electron and proton scattering experiments
using both polarized beams and targets. The principal focus will be on use of a
polarized helium-3 gas target, developed by the PI. This target will be used in
the first clean measurement of neutron charge form factor (Bates expt.) and is
proposed for use at HERA in a measurement of the neutron spin response function.
A third use of this target is planned at the IUCF Cooler ring in an experiment
using polarized proton scattering from polarized helium-3 to probe the spin-
dependence of N-N scattering. High energy electron and photo-reactions are
planned for SLAC/NPAS and CEBAF.
