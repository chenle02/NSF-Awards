0405150 Zhang Percolative models form a very active subfield of probability
theory. They have drawn much of their inspiration and motivation from physics,
biology and computer science. They have also been used heavily in physics,
biology, industry, and computer science. This project focuses on the following
percolation questions: General percolation model: (a) The power laws and scaling
relations. (b) The central limit theorems for the incipient infinite cluster.
(c) Percolation on arbitrary words. (d) On the infinite differentiability of the
right edge in oriented percolation. First passage percolation: (a) Non-
differentiability of the time constant. (b) The large deviations. The research
makes use of probability theorems (martingale, Markov chains, CLT theorem,
correlation inequalities), graph theorems (duality, lattice surfaces,
planarity), combinatorics (partition lattice, renormalization) and functional
analysis (complex variables). The project has a broad impact on research,
education and dissemination to advance scientific and technological
understanding in the following ways: First, percolation theory is one of most
important subjects in mathematics. In fact, issues and open questions in
percolation theory are easy to state, but whose solutions are apparently
difficult and require innovative methods. Furthermore, percolation theory is
also directly applicable in biology, industry, and computer science. Zhang
presents six traditional problems in this field and proposed new methods to
solve them. Second, the proposal promotes teaching experiences for Zhang's
undergraduate students in areas of engineering, computer science and
mathematics. It also offers an opportunity for the students to conduct research
activities on percolation problems. Moreover, the proposal also enhances
scientific and technological understanding. Since percolation theory involves
numerical computations and simulations, technological advances in computing
science are required.
