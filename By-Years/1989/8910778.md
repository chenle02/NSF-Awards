The broad goals of this project are to understand how the brain encodes sound
patterns and how the prior acquisition of some patterns influences the
perception of others. Experiments and computer simulations will provide tests of
a theory of these processes. The experiments will measure the speed and accuracy
with which the perceptual system processes sounds as a function of the pattern
within which the sounds are embedded. The theory holds that sounds will be
processed more quickly and accurately and will be heard as more consonant when
they occur in typical patterns than when they are in atypical patterns. These
experiments will provide objective measures of the perceptual expectations that
depend upon the kinds of patterns to which people have been previously exposed.
The experiments will employ digitally synthesized musical sequences. A computer
will record the speed and accuracy with which a person judges whether or not a
designated sound is in tune. Computer simulations will generate precise
predictions about how a network of neurons in the brain could encode patterns
and consequently influence the perception of other patterns. The simulations
will employ recently developed computational algorithms that model the
organization of neurons into networks that exhibit intelligent behavior. This
project will focus on neural networks that can encode sequential patterns. As an
automatic consequence of encoding a large numbers of sequences, a network will
learn the regularities inherent in the set of sequences as a whole. The
sequential expectations generated by the network will then be compared with
those of people as measured in the experiments described above. These results
will contribute to our understanding of how the ability to learn sequential
patterns depends upon the patterns to which we have previously been exposed. The
results will thus have implications for how this ability might be improved by an
appropriate schedule of exposure.
