This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of chemical applications of information science. Professor Crouch
and his students will employ factor analysis and Kalman filter techniques to
extract analytical information from kinetic data. Factor analysis will permit
characteristics of the rate of a chemical reaction to be discerned and related
to the amount of one of the reactants that is present in the system. Kalman
filtering is a computational technique that enables properties of systems to be
recursively estimated. In combination and with appropriate computational
hardware support, these techniques will be used for the real- time, quantitative
determination of concentrations of chemical species from reaction rate data.
Whereas both factor analysis and Kalman filter techniques are well established,
the combination of the two applied to kinetic analysis should afford a positive
synergism that will be beneficial in many areas of application of analytical
chemistry.
