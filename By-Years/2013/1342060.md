Computational techniques are revolutionizing the way in which research is
conducted in science and engineering.. This is particularly true in the domains
of biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Given that these areas are of utmost
importance to the society at large, it is not enough if advances are made in
these areas in isolation. These communities have to work together to help each
other and come up with the best possible diagnosis tools, treatment procedures,
drugs for various diseases, etc. The proposed conference has the goal of
bringing together scientists in all the three areas and hence serving as a
platform for bridging the research efforts in these areas. The requested funds
will be used to support the travel expenses of graduate students and keynote
speakers. These students will get to meet experts and listen to their research
results. Not only the attending students but also their friends will benefit
since when the students return to their schools they will communicate their
experience with their friends. The conference proceedings will be of great use
to students, researchers, and practitioners. Portions of the proceedings could
be used in different courses as well.
