eommuter, Young Scholars program with follow-up activities during the academic
year for 18 students entering grades 11 and 12. The program is interdiseiplinary
integrating computer science, physics, and mathematics. The students are
introduced to basic computer arehiteeture, after which they assemble IBM-
compatible microcomputers that are given to them to keep at the completion of
the program. Other activities involve students performing labs in digital
eleetronies, engineering and eomputer architecture, under the direction of a
research physicist. The students also perform experiments on mathematical
objects using computer programs they write in Pascal. Field trips are an
integral part of the projeet. Career-oriented field trips will be made to
R&amp;D and production faeilities sueh as AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Motorola,
