Dr. Kalin DudoV of the Genetic Engineering Institute, Bugaria, will visit Dr.
James Moyer of North Carolina State University to prepare a cooperative research
project on Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV). The resulting proposal is intended
for consideration under the U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative Science Program and if
successful, should contribute to our knowledge of the molecular basis of
biological variation in TSWV.
