In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Breckenridge of the University of Utah will study the spectroscopy and
excited-state dynamics of metal/reactant systems using the "half-collision"
approach of dissociating van der Waals molecules. Metals to be examined include
Na, Al, and Cr, while the reactants are molecular hydrogen, H2, and methane,
CH4. The metal atoms are created by laser ablation and are "gently" attached to
the reactants by expanding through a supersonic jet to form the one-to-one van
der Waals complexes. The complexes can be excited to initial states selected for
orbital alignment and initial geometry. Detection is by laser-induced
fluorescence and resonant multi- photon ionization. %%% In this project Prof.
Breckenridge forms a loosely bound cluster of a metal atom and a molecular
partner with which the metal can react. He energizes the cluster using laser
light and follows the products from the resulting breakup of the cluster. By
varying the wavelength of the exciting light, specific reaction paths of the
excited metal atoms and reagents can be specified, which in turn allows
Breckenridge to determine the effect of different types of excitation on the
course of a chemical reaction.
