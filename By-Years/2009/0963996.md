The advent of multicore processors has introduced new opportunities for
achieving&lt;br/&gt;increased software performance, reliability, security, and
availability. However,&lt;br/&gt;powerful dynamic execution monitoring
capabilities are required to realize these&lt;br/&gt;opportunities. This project
addresses the challenges of developing a Dynamic&lt;br/&gt;Binary Translation
based monitoring framework for parallel applications running
on&lt;br/&gt;multicore systems. The programmability of the framework will enable
realization of &lt;br/&gt;benefits in achieving enhanced performance,
reliability, security, and availability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Some of the
instrumentation code required in context of parallel applications
&lt;br/&gt;must be executed by a core in response to events that involve other
cores. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;events relevant to many performance,
reliability, and security related tasks correspond &lt;br/&gt;to the
manifestation of interprocessor data dependences due to updates of shared
&lt;br/&gt;memory locations by multiple cores. Based upon this observation
programmable &lt;br/&gt;architectural mechanisms will be provided that not only
enable the detection of &lt;br/&gt;interprocessor dependence events but also
enable the triggering of the execution of &lt;br/&gt;application specific
monitoring code. This project will then employ these mechanisms &lt;br/&gt;for
improving performance via speculative parallelism, enabling debugging via
a&lt;br/&gt;novel strategy of execution suppression, improving reliability via
an approach that&lt;br/&gt;allows applications to automatically recover from
failures, providing security via&lt;br/&gt;dynamic detection of mutating
viruses, and software availability via dynamic updates.
