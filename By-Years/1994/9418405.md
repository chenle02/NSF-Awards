9418405 Halgedahl Despite the great success of paleomagnetism, our understanding
of the fine magnetic particles that carry the paleomagnetic record is still
remarkably incomplete. Yet the behavior of these fine particles could provide
diagnostic tools for deciphering the origin of NRM (natural remanent
magnetization) in rocks, as well as the grain sizes and domain states of the NRM
carriers. Such tools would be especially useful in interpreting the
paleomagnetism of Paleozoic and older rocks, whose long and complex histories
increase the probability that their original magnetizations were reset. A series
of experiments will investigate the physical bases that govern AF
demagnetization response of single particles carrying different types of
remanences. Although previous workers have utilized assemblages of particles in
such studies, single particles have several advantages over assemblages. The
principal advantage is that, in a single particle, AF response can be directly
linked to observed changes of domain structure and to observed microstructure.
