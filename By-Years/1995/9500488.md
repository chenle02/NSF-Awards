This award provides partial support for Professor Gerald Eagleson of Loras
College to spend several months collaborating in developmental neurobiology
research with Bruce Jenks and others of the Institute of Neuroscience of the
University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands and with Dr. A. J. Dunston of the
University of Utrecht. Their joint research will focus on the factors which
influence the early development of the area of the amphibian brain which
ultimately becomes the hypothalamo-pars intermedia complex. The participating
research groups in the Netherlands have substantial experience and extensive
facilities for investigating the morphological and physiological aspects of this
complex in the adult amphibian, Xenopus. Dr. Eagleson has done landmark work on
the embryological development of the amphibian brain and pituitary gland,
ranging from microdissection and mapping to experimental studies of gene
expression and inductive agents between various tissues. This proposed
collaboration brings together a unique blend of complementary expertise from the
U.S. and Europe to study the origin of the functional relationship between the
brain and the pituitary. The results of the research to be carried out by Dr.
Eagleson and his colleagues will be a fundamental contribution to our
understanding of the development of this neuroendocrine feedback system.
