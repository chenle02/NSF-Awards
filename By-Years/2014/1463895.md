This award provides funds to help support travel costs of conference
participants to the the 10th Gordon Research Conference on Earth's Interior to
be held at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts from June 7-12,
2015, and a preceding Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) from June 6-7. The GRS is a
relatively new venue for this community, and provides a unique environment for
early-career individuals including students, post-docs, and early career faculty
to present and exchange state of the art ideas and results. NSF funds are
requested in part to attract early career individuals to the GRS and GRC.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year will focus on new research that explores the
influence of interior processes on surface processes ranging from tectonics to
volcanism to climate. Specific session topics include the dynamics of passive
margins, connections between mantle processes and volcanism, deep earth volatile
cycles, subduction dynamics, the origin of plate tectonics, the origin of
shallow mantle seismic discontinuities, microscopic to macroscopic connections
between rock rheology and large-scale tectonics, and the structure and evolution
of the continental lithosphere.
