This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
the effects of mechanical forces on molecular events in endothelial cells, and
leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Endothelial cells line the inside of blood
and lymph vessels, the heart and other cavities. The collaboration involves the
research group of Shu Chien of the University of California, San Diego and Xiong
Wang of the National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine in Nancy, France. The
objectives are to elucidate the effects of secondary flow and flow separation on
signal transduction and gene expression in vascular endothelial cells, and to
investigate the molecular biomechanical basis for rolling of leukocytes on
endothelial cells. The US research group brings to this collaboration expertise
on the coupling of mechanical forces and gene regulation in vascular cells. This
is complemented by French expertise in biorheology. The project will advance
understanding of the fundamental biological processes of mechanochemical
transduction and cell-cell interaction.
