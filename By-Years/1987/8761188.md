A novel catalyst preparational method is adapted to a catalyst for oxidation of
halogens in dilute air streams. This procedure produces highly active
oxidation/reduction catalyst from an available set; the primary reaction will be
established; and a preliminary reaction model will be produced which reflects
primary mechanistic steps involved. Preliminary design evaluations will be made
to define improvements needed in Phase II, and a novel electrical heating scheme
of the conducting catalyst will be examined. Electron microprobe and electron
microscope studies will be made through cooperative efforts at the University of
Massachusetts. From surveys of environmental remediation companies, there is a
strong need for air strippers combined with catalytic combustors of halogenated
solvents, in order to remediate contaminated aqueous systems. If successful, the
combustor can be applied economically to many small sources, improving
employment outlook, and reducing RCRA cost burdens.
