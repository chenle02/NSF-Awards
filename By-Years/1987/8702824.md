Robert Gunning will continue his research on theta functions and Riemann
surfaces. The goal is the complete analysis of linear relations between partial
derivatives of Riemannian second order theta functions at the origin, extending
the known relations that provide explicit solutions of the Korteweg-deVries and
Kadomtsev- Petviashvili equations, and the investigation of the role of these
relations in the Schottky problem of characterizing Jacobi varieties. Fornaess
will carry out research on function-theoretic properties of smoothly bounded
domains in the space of several complex variables. The goals are to obtain
estimates for solutions of certain differential equations in various classes of
domains, extending results that are known for strongly pseudoconvex domains, and
to study a notion of uniform extendability of domains that seems critical to the
understanding of the asymptotic behaviour of the Bergman kernel function at the
boundary of a domain.
