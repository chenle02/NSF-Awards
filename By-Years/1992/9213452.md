An REU site project for women and minorities will be established in the
Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. The overriding objective of
this project is to actively encourage members of underrepresented minority
groups and women to pursue careers in physics. This project is part of a
comprehensive program undertaken by the Department to increase enrollment of
women and minorities in physics in general and in particular in the graduate
Ph.D. program as well. The project will consist of placing 10 selected
individuals within research groups of different faculty for a 10 week period
each summer. These projects will cover a variety of Physics research areas (for
the most part experimental) including high energy physics, cosmic ray and space
physics, condensed matter physics, nonlinear dynamics, chemical physics, and
astrophysics. The research experience will be augmented by the availability of
informal review and advising sessions with members of the Physics faculty.
