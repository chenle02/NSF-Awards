9412951 Brown Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the connection
of Northwest State Community College to the Ohio Academic Resources Network
(OARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves the State of Ohio. A
primary goal of OARnet is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of
resources between institutions, including those outside the state. OARnet will
provide operations management and information services and it will give the
school a 56 thousand bit per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5
- 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The school needs
greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers,
libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more
reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.
This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative
educational resources.
