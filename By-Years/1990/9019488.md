These investigations are designed to characterize the mechanism by which a
nuclear plastome mutator (pm) gene causes mutations in the plastid genome
(plastome) of Oenothera. Genetic and molecular traits shared by pm and various
bacterial mutators are consistent with the pm gene encoding a topoisomerase,
helicase, or polymerase that functions within the chloroplast (cp). Another
possibility is that absence of the pm-product increases levels of error-prone
repair of cpDNA. Experiments to differentiate among these alternatives include
chemical mutagenesis treatments of pm seeds, where a synergistic response to a
number of mutagens will indicate a general defect in a component of cpDNA
repair. Determination of the extent of slipped strand mispairing in the pm
isolates will show the likelihood that a defective helicase or topoisomerase is
involved. Other experiments are designed to locate the sites of existing pm-
mutations, and to isolate new pm-mutations in the rbcL gene. Sequence data from
these sites will indicate whether pm causes base substitutions, small deletions,
or other alterations, as well as sizeable deletions observed in other, non-
coding regions of cpDNA and occurring between short direct repeats. In addition
to providing insights into the molecular events that result in the mutation of
cpDNA, these investigations are pertinent to the history of the cpDNA molecule,
which, in an evolutionary time frame, has experienced frequent deletions,
insertions and inversions mediated by short direct repeats.***
