9360853 Koerber This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
seeks to take full advantage of an educationally sound computer- based
technology to build a MathMastery system based on the idea that mastery of
mathematical concepts is cumulative--that mastering these concepts in sequence
is essential to building a sound foundation enabling the learning of higher
mathematics. For a mathematical educational system to be comprehensive for all
grade and ability levels and span all curricular areas of a particular subject,
there must be an understanding of how each concept is linked to others and how
each concept builds on the previous ones. Erko Technologies proposes to build a
such a system which is also responsive to individual learning styles and permits
interactive learning. In Phase I of the MathMastery project, Erko Technologies
will test the feasibility of the construction of a comprehensive Mathematical
Concept Network that maps the interdependencies of mathematical skills necessary
for students in elementary and high school to master, and the firm will test the
importance and usefulness of the Mathematical Concept Network as a component of
mathematical educational software. If successful, the project will contribute to
the development of new educationally sound technology to help more students
excel in mathematics and develop the necessary capability to pursue advanced
study of mathematics and science. ***
