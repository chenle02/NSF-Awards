9504144 Knauss This project will study the nonlinear time-dependent
constitutive behavior of structural polymers. It is a particular emphasis to
elucidate the role of dilatation on the time dependent mechanical behavior and
to provide a framework for time dependent polymer fracture. The study centers on
the small volume changes that occur in the time dependent material behavior.
Preliminary torsion tests have showl that the volume changes occur in such tests
of polymers. ***
