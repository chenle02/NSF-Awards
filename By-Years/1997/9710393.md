This project is one of a set of special awards to junior investigators, of
small amounts of money to allow them to initiative a new research agenda. This
project will study the causes of variation in coding of text, by comparing
different methods-coding themes or words-across different informants. Fifty
informants will write narrative texts of a recent illness. The texts will be
analyzed by ten coders using two different methods: marking contiguous segments
of text for themes, and performing a content analysis of key words. Coders will
do the two tasks in random order. The themes will be tagged in the texts and the
structures of themes used by each coder will be analyzed. In addition the 100
key words mentioned most frequently will be coded. A theme by word affiliation
matrix will be constructed. All pairs of coders will be analyzed for
similarities and differences to identify core themes and words. Prototypical
themes and informants will be identified. Tests of intercoder agreement will be
conducted to see how many or few are required for a consensus on themes of
varying levels of complexity. The research will advance our understanding of the
parameters causing variation in coding, a core task in any quantitative analysis
of text. It will be a first step towards more extensive research aiming to
advance the analysis of texts to a more reliable and scientifically sound
methodology.
