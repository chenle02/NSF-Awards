This award is for continued study of sediment deposition proceses in Glacier
Bay, Alaska, near the termini of tidewater glaciers. (Its is a companion
proposal to DPP 8618789, submitted by Dr. N. Smith.) During the past two years
these processes have been investigated near the termini of Riggs and McBride
Glaciers. The study will now be extended to: (1) Muir Glacier, a tidewater
glacier similar to McBride but fronting a less restricted basin, where the
distribution and origin of fine laminated sediments as well as sedimentation
rates versus distance from the glacier will be investigated, (2) Wachusett
basin, a restricted basin fronting
