9405573 Garcia The purpose of this study is to determine the nature and causes
of compositional variation in lavas from the continuing eruption (1983 to
present) of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. Mineral, glass and whole-rock compositions
and O, Pb, Sr, Nd and Th isotope ratios will be determined and used to evaluate
the relative importance of crystal fractionation, magma mixing, lithosphere
assimilation and mantle melting processes in controlling the lava composition.
Due to the long duration of this eruption (&gt; 10 years), the lavas from this
eruption offer a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of both crustal
and mantle processes on lava composition. This is the only study that has
extensively characterized Kilauea lavas. Only by fully characterizing Kilauea
lavas can we hope to decipher the origin and evolution of this critical key
component to the hotspot paradigm.
