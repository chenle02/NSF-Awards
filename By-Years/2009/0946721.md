With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Timothy M.
Swager and Dr. Peter M. Mueller from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The instrument will be used
to support research activities such as: 1) redox transformations in a number of
metal-containing systems (Jonas Peters); 2) study of molecular photocatalysis
sytems (Daniel Nocera); 3) characterization of metal-containing systems with
multiply-bonded ligands (Christopher Cummins); 4) the development of new
catalysis systems for olefin metathesis and dinitrogen reduction (Richard
Schrock). The instrument will also feature in the educational outreach
activities of Dr. Mueller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows
accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules.
The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry,
catalysis and solar energy research. Students using the apparatus will receive
valuable training with cutting-edge instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;
