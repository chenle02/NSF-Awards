The proposed project seeks financial support for graduate students and Post-
Doctoral Fellows to help defray the cost of conference registration and related
travel expenses for those who will be giving presentations at a conference that
will be held July 10-15, 2016 in San Diego, CA, The conference will address the
latest advances in Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) materials and device
technologies. Topics to be addressed include among other Fundamental Studies and
Modeling of Epitaxial Processes, Wide-Bandgap Group-III Nitride Materials and
Devices, III-V Semiconductors and Devices, Narrow Bandgap Materials and Devices,
II-VI Materials and Devices, Growth of Nanowires, Nanostructures and Low-
dimensional Structures, There will be both invited talks and contributed
presentations. The conference will provide, networking opportunities and
intellectual stimulation for graduate students, Post-Doctoral Fellows and all
attendees. It is expected that the venue will attract a significant number of
members of underrepresented groups in STEM. The proceedings will be published in
a journal which receives wide electronic distribution.
