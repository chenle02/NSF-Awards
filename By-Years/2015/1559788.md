The REU/RET program in mathematics at California State University, Chico hosts
secondary teachers with a strong interest in mathematics or statistics and
undergraduate students who have completed their junior year. For seven weeks
each summer, twelve participants, including three teachers, will work in three
research teams on problems in Mathematical Modeling, Statistics, and Number
Theory. Depending on the field, projects may be appropriate for students from
scientific disciplines other than mathematics.

The research experience is intended to give participants an appreciation for the
breadth and depth of mathematics and its applications, while providing
undergraduates an opportunity to improve their communication skills and in-
service teachers an experience that will deepen their understanding of
mathematical content and inspire pedagogical innovation. By working on open
problems in mathematics, participants will experience the excitement of
exploration, discovery, analysis, proof, and systematization that are part of
the mathematician's world. While much of mathematics is accessible only after
years of study, the field is rich enough to allow for a full mathematical
experience at the undergraduate level.
