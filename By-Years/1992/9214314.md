This proposal requests funds to purchase a special scanning electron microscope
that can examine wet, nonconducting or uncoated specimens without damage in the
electron beam. The microscope can examine specimens during a dynamical process
in an experiment. The researchers propose to use the instrument to study
polymeric coatings and to observe the transport processes involved in wetting a
solid surface. Other projects include the effect of seawater on composites,
semiconductor surfaces used in electro- photochemistry, and
hydration/dehydration reactions in clays.
