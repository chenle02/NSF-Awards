Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: TSE: Layered Silicates with 3-D
Microporous Layers: Synthesis and Modification for Membrane
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0327811&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Michael
Tsapatsis&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to
synthesize novel layered silicate materials with three-dimensional porosity
(AMH-3) as a new class of membranes. The work will focus on understanding the
growth of AMH-3 to guide the synthesis of other three-dimensional microporous
layers and to modify AMH-3 to make it compatible with nanocomposite processing
techniques and to tailor the gas adsorption properties of the silicate layers.
Characterization techniques will include SEM, TEM, NMR, IR, Raman, gas
adsorption as well as synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction at
Brookhaven National Laboratory and NIST. When these inorganic materials are
incorporated in polymeric materials, they should retain polymer processability
while improving permselective properties due to the superior ability for
molecular recognition of the microporous component. In terms of the broader
impacts, this work should have an impact on membrane technology with wider
implications in the generation of nanostructured functional materials such as
catalysts, sensors and adsorbents. The work will contribute to the education of
graduate and undergraduate students in an emerging area of fundamental interest
and of technological and environmental significance. &lt;br/&gt;
