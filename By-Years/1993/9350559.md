9350559 Durig This project conducts a four-week residential camp for forty-four
Black eighth- and ninth grade students from rural areas. The camp is held on the
Columbia campus and on Pritchard's Island. The project focuses on instruction in
life-, earth-space, and physical sciences and includes mentoring by faculty and
graduate students as well as academic-year follow-up. It is consistent with
statewide efforts to restructure science and mathematics education at the K-12
levels and is located in the same region as the undergraduate level Alliance for
Minority Participation (AMP) at the University of South Carolina.
