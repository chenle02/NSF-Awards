In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, with co-
funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A Program, of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Shigeru Amemiya of the University of Pittsburgh
is developing new electrochemical methods that allow for the separate study of
electron transfer and coupled adsorption events at novel nanometer-sized
electrodes. This project focuses on gaining an advanced understanding of
adsorption-coupled electron transfer, which plays a vital role in numerous
electrochemical energy devices, such as fuel cells, batteries, solar cells, and
supercapacitors. Reliable determination of rate and energy parameters is
possible due to the creation of new research tools. Students from
underrepresented groups gain interdisciplinary training in the research and
undergraduate laboratory environments, as a result of their participating in
cross-cutting research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the
quantitative study of adsorption-coupled electron transfer as the key step of
electrochemical technologies that span electrocatalysis, electrodeposition, and
electroanalysis. New nanoelectrochemical methods developed in the Amemiya
laboratory provide an opportunity to kinetically resolve adsorption-coupled
electron transfer into its elementary steps. Specifically, nanogap voltammetry
with a scanning electrochemical microscope affords a path to separately
determine the dynamics of inner-sphere and outer-sphere electron transfer,
surface adsorption, and even coupled chemical reactions. Reliable reaction
parameters can be obtained by employing clean electrodes that maintain vacuum-
level surface cleanliness in air and solution, as a result of new methods
developed by Professor Amemiya's research group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
