ABSTRACT -- III-9360073 PI: OWENS A new electron source for high-energy electron
beam welding is proposed which is simple, yet capable of impressive beam
brightness and high energy in a compact structure. The new device can achieve
reduced spot size, increased energy density, and increased range over
conventional electron-beam welders. Using special techniques, welding at
atmospheric pressures over long distances may even be possible. During the first
phase of the project, a simple electron-beam welding device will be fabricated
and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. A high-brightness,
high-energy device will be constructed during Phase II of the project.
