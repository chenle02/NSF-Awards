9724305 Drucker Imaging instrumentation consisting of a laser scanning confocal
microscope and an atomic force microscope will be acquired by the University of
Texas at El Paso (UTEP). These instruments will support research in several
areas of environmental, material and life sciences, including biological
systems, optical display and photovoltaic materials, and nanomaterials. This
instrumentation will also be a resource for both graduate and undergraduate
education and research training. The instruments will be integrated into
graduate training programs targeted at imaging and image interpretation, and
into out-of-classroom research experiences for undergraduate students. %%%
Acquisition of this instrumentation will impact research, research training and
education in several programs which UTEP has identified as current and future
strategic thrust areas. The instrumentation will enhance UTEP's capability for
meeting its goal of integrating research into the undergraduate curriculum and
of increasing retention and graduation of Hispanics, a group underrepresented as
scientists and engineers. The award is funded by NSF's Major Research
Instrumentation program and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. ***
