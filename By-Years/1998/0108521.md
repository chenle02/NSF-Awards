Professor Michael R. Detty in the Department of Chemistry at the State
University of New York at Buffalo is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program for his studies incorporating organoselenides and tellurides
into dendrimers. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, these compounds may
function as mild oxidants. These dendrimeric catalysts show potential as
environmentally friendly oxidizing agents since the use of heavy metal oxidants
and elemental halogens can be replaced by hydrogen peroxide.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Program, Professor Detty is
developing catalysts which are mimics of halo- and thiolperoxidases, enzymes
which catalyze the oxidation of halide salts and thiols, respectively. These
catalysts avoid the use of poisonous reagents and therefore are potentially
valuable as environmentally benign alternatives to heavy metal oxidants or
elemental halogens.
