This research project investigates basic combinatorial questions about discrete
structures and explores applications of discrete mathematics in computer
science, biology, and engineering. The investigators continue their work on
extremal graph, set, and hypergraph theory and forbidden configurations. They
investigate connections between graph theory and geometry, on the one hand
studying Ricci curvature on graphs, on the other hand studying crossing numbers
of graphs and related incidence problems. The project will study graph and tree
indices originating in chemical graph theory and will apply combinatorial and
probabilistic techniques to phylogenetics and to the theory of complex networks.
Results of the project will contribute to the better understanding of key
phenomena in network science, of discretization of geometric space, of
phylogenetics, and of other fields. The investigators will continue the training
of Ph.D. students through involvement in the research, introducing them to
interdisciplinary and international research collaboration.

The project will contribute to the understanding of "optimal" extreme structures
and "typical" random structures in discrete mathematics. This area is referred
to broadly as extremal combinatorics, and some of the main open questions in the
area will be studied, including various instances of the Turan problem for
graphs, hypergraphs and posets, problems in combinatorial geometry, in the vein
of the Erdos unit distance problem and crossing and incidence problems, and
combinatorial questions on trees such as the Maximum Agreement Subtree problem
as well as topics related to chemistry. This project will build upon
sophisticated methods that have been developed to attack these problems, such as
the approach via crossing numbers and incidences, the Guth-Katz low degree
polynomial method, and the generalization of the notion of Ricci Curvature from
differential geometry to graphs, which allows, to some extent, functional
analytic tools to be brought to bear.
