REU Site: Undergraduate Research in Biology: Cellular Stress
Physiology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pepperdine University summer undergraduate
research program facilitates the professional maturation of a minimum of 8
undergraduate students annually as biological scientists by immersing them in an
interactive, 11-week session of original research activities, thematically-
linked via cellular stress physiology. Students design and pursue projects
utilizing a wide range of cellular and organismal systems, e.g., yeast,
mammalian cells in tissue culture, amphibian epidermal tissue, and xylem vessel
elements in higher plants. Faculty-mentors in plant physiological ecology,
cellular biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, or neurobiology
provide support, supervision, and training, as well as facilitate community
outreach. Visiting scientists hold research seminars and critique student
projects. Past participants in the summer program provide peer mentoring and
modeling. The formal program concludes each year with a written paper, student
research symposium, student poster session, and celebratory banquet. Follow-up
activities include the opportunity to mentor middle school students enrolled in
a campus-based Science Camp, professional presentations, and submission of
research results for publication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Student
recruitment by the Pepperdine University summer undergraduate research program
emphasizes minority applicants, community college students from greater Los
Angeles, and other colleges with limited research opportunities. Project
findings are disseminated widely to schoolchildren at an open house, to
university administration and parents at a poster session, and to local parkland
managers and research scientists at a final student-led symposium. Students
communicate their findings at regional, national and international
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
