The project has two major goals. i) To make experimentation an integral part of
a large set of courses in the Mechanical Engineering curriculum which have
traditionally relied on the strictly lecture/recitation type of presentation.
ii) To provide students with an exposure to complicated instrumentation systems
which contain essential features of systems currently used in non-academic
environments. The project relies heavily on three general purpose data
acquisition modules and one special purpose signal processor-an FFT analyzer.
Two complex Mechanical Engineering systems, a laboratory model of a steam
turbine and a full scale numerically controlled milling machine, will support
the goals of the project. Finally a set of state-of-the-art flowmeters will
extend the Department's inventory of scientific instrumentation.
