This project initiates cooperative research between U.S. and Taiwan researchers
in the area of structural and geotechnical dynamics. The joint study will be
focused on three major topic areas: (1) probabilistic modeling of dynamic forces
utilizing the current data base of earthquakes, winds, floods, slides, etc.
recorded and accumulated in both countries, (2) intelligent buildings - an
emerging research subject of significant impact potential to future civil
engineering practice, and (3) field testing of geotechnical-structure systems
utilizing field experimental facilities planned for advance dynamic testings.
The research will be conducted at the National Taiwan University through joint
workshops and field investigation. The effort is expected to synthesize the
current knowledge and practices, assess the future research needs, and develop
cooperative projects between the two countries. This action is jointly supported
by three programs at the Engineering Directorate: the Structural and Building
Systems Program, the Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program and the Natural and
Manmade Hazard Mitigation Program.
