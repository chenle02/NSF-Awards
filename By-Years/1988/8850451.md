The main goal of the project is to develop a three-year inservice program for
middle school teachers in the Philadelphia area which integrates several
academic subjects in the school setting. There are intensive courses offered for
three consecutive summers to 46 middle school teachers (each year) to increase
their in-depth knowledge of science and mathematics. There is a series of
academic year seminars for the participants to reinforce and continue the goal
of inquiry-based learning. There is a leadership component which draws on the
experiences of participants from previous projects to work with new
participants. The program also includes workshops, during the third year, in
which the participants learn to be part of a cadre of Teacher-Consultants for
science and mathematics in their school and District. The participants learn to
work with researchers applying cognitive science to applications in an urban
setting. The staff's intent is to promote institutional change among colleges
and universities which insure that inservice teachers benefit from the results
of programs such as this one. The staff is developing indicators for assessing
effective science instruction. The results of the project are to be disseminated
through national publications, conferences on educational reform, assessment,
and teacher networking. There is a very active consortium of agencies involved
in the host institution and this is reflected in the multi- layered
participation in the project as well as cost sharing the project activities. The
cost sharing amount is $449,766, which is $449,766/$698,274, or over 65% of the
funds requested from National Science Foundation.
