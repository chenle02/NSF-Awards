One of the most significant impediments to the ability of ecologists to
contribute to understanding and solving issues associated with global change is
the inability to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics at scales that
are relevant to those issues. To date, ecologists have not taken full advantage
of the approaches used and advances made by the remainder of the earth science
community. As a step in the process of increasing, the ability of ecologists to
exchange results with other earth scientists, this project will conduct a
regional analysis of the central grasslands of the United States. The objectives
of the analysis are to understand the current state of ecosystems in the region
and to evaluate their potential responses to climate and management change. The
approach will involve constructing a regional database, statistically evaluating
relationships among biotic and abiotic variables in the database, and using
simulation models to assess the current state of the region and to understand
the potential regional consequences of climate change.
