The Pacific northwest continental margin was the site of extensive accretion of
crustal fragments during the Cretaceous. The suturing of the Alexander and
related terranes to the western margin of Stikine and other inboard terranes was
accompanied by extensive magmatism that formed the Coast Mountains batholith.
However, the presence of isotopically evolved material of possible North
American affinity within and adjacent to the batholith raises fundamental
questions about the degree of allochthoneity of all accreted terranes. This
project will attempt to determine the extent of the possible North American
rocks, their relationships to adjacent terranes and the age relations between
them. Results will allow interpretation of the geometry of accretion- related
structures in the suture zone and will provide constraints on the origin and
displacement history of the stikine terrane.
