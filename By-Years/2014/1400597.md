SAGE (Sustainable Agriculture and Green Energy) is a two-year Advanced
Technology Education project that is laying the foundation for focused rural
technician education and training in sustainability fields that include
agriculture and renewable energy/energy efficiency under an umbrella of
sustainable green education. Greenfield Community College (GCC) is innovating in
technical education for rural students in the Western Massachusetts region
through enhanced curriculum and infrastructure that support its Farm and Food
Systems (FFS) and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency (RE/EE) degree option
programs. These enhancements, along with the many existing relationships between
GCC and regional agricultural and energy employers, are serving as a fulcrum for
improving technical education and for solidifying sustainability career
pathways. SAGE is serving as the foundation for bridging the traditional
separation of vocational training and academic learning in STEM-based
sustainability education. A new 4-credit Greenhouse Management course and
curricular revisions across STEM course offerings are impacting students in both
the Farm and Food Systems (FFS) and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency (RE/EE)
degree options. New curricula feature hands-on learning opportunities utilizing
innovative infrastructure, including Greenhouse External and Internal Solar
Thermal Collection Units, Permaculture Rainwater Harvesting System, and a
standalone 500W Photovoltaic System. A robust internship experience links GCC
students with regional employers in agriculture and renewable energy/energy
efficiency for workplace-based skill attainment that lead to employment
opportunities. Ongoing engagement with secondary and four-year institutions
through 2 + 2 + 2 articulations is helping to improve student preparation in the
technical education pipeline.
