Purdue University seeks to provide a Young Scholars Program in agricultural and
environmental sciences. The seven week summer residential program will be held
on the West Lafayette Campus of Purdue University. The program will consist of
20 high school students who have completed their junior year from Indiana and
the four contiguous states of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois. The
program will provide students an opportunity to broaden their appreciation of
the scientific challenges offered by agriculture and natural resources
disciplines through a combination of classroom lectures, informal structured
discussions, and directed student research projects and hands-on laboratory
activities supplemented by field trips.
