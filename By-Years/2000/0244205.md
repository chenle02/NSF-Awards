0244205 Cox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Oregon State University for ten
undergraduate students each year for research opportunities in coastal processes
and hazard mitigation. The program is designed as a ten-week summer experience.
Research projects will be drawn from the intersection of coastal engineering,
physical oceanography, and computer science, with a focus on coastal processes
and the mitigation of natural hazards, particularly those caused by tsunamis and
coastal storms. The program will, to foster student growth, conduct team
research to solve complex problems; promote breadth and critical thinking
through seminars on topics such as ethics and sustainable development; and
promote collegial student-faculty and student-student relationships. Senior and
junior faculty from three departments in two colleges at the university will
serve as mentors for the students. The program seeks to help students gain
confidence in their research abilities through overcoming the difficulties
inherent in the research process. Students will be recruited from throughout the
United States, with a special focus on attracting students from groups
underrepresented in research fields in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
