The objective of this research is to investigate a mathematical tolerance
allocation approach for design based on desired product specification and known
manufacturing process variability. The allocation criteria will be compared to
the tolerance analysis based on Monte Carlo statistical methods used in the VSA
(Variation Simulation Analysis) commercial package. Once it is understood how
the distributions are combined, a formal tolerance allocation methodology will
then be completed. This approach is a more empirical approach of pre-determining
allowable part tolerance as opposed to the "what-if" tests conducted on the VSA
software
