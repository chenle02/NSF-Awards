This is a postdoctoral fellowship that would allow a philosopher of science who
is interested in visual representation to continue her education and conduct
research at the University of California, San Diego, which is at the forefront
of neuroimaging research and instrumentation. Visual representation has, until
recently, been relegated to the background of philosophical analysis of science.
While we know that scientists rely heavily on images provided them by
sophisticated instruments, the exact nature of the knowledge provided by such
techniques is not clear. Of special importance for this project is the
relationship between visual representation and propositional representation in
the production and presentation of scientific knowledge. The integration of
visual and propositional representation in studies of the brain offers a new
domain for examining the use of integrative strategies in science.
