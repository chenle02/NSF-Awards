This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a laser
based breathmeter for detecting and monitoring asthma in children and adults.
The Phase I work proved the feasibility of constructing a machine, based on
infrared laser absorption spectroscopy, that is capable of measuring exhaled
nitric oxide (eNO) and exhaled carbon dioxide (eCO2) levels to evaluate airway
inflammation for indications of asthma and to monitor treatment compliance. In
the Phase II project, a dedicated hardware design for electronics and data
processing plus user-friendly custom written software will be integrated into a
compact system that is cost effective, highly sensitive, real-time, and reliable
for monitoring airway inflammation.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices
and instrumentation.
