Laboratory and design education in mechanical engineering programs in the U.S.
mostly focuses on steady-state processes. This project incorporates the study of
dynamic response of thermal engineering systems into the upper-division
laboratory and design courses in mechanical engineering. The project enables
students to learn fundamental concepts and reasons concerning flow unsteadiness;
to develop a better understanding of the physical principles governing transient
engineering phenomena; and to study the dynamic response of thermal systems. The
implementation of this project improves the laboratory and design education in
transient studies of thermal systems. The project and its educational benefits
are of interest to other engineering schools. The new equipment includes a
reciprocating compressor, linear and nonlinear flowmeters, pressure transducers,
digital oscilloscopes, a computer-based spectrum analyzer, and a torquemeter.
These devices are being assembled into a test rig where time-dependent flows,
pressures, torque, speed, and power are generated and studied. The instructional
equipment is versatile and can be assembled into other test apparatus for future
laboratory and design projects.
