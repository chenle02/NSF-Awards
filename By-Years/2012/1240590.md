Intellectual Merit: This project takes advantage of the latest development in
X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) at the Linac Coherent Lisht Source (LCLS) to
structurally characterize intact photosynthetic organelles, chlorosomes and
carboxysomes. The research undertaking embodies high-risk, high reward research
since every experiment undertaken at the LCLS is at the frontier of imaging
biology which continues to be under development. Chlorosomes and carboxysomes
have not yet been subjected to these methods. Both types of complexes provide
unprecedented test cases for XFELs diffraction in that they can both be treated
as single particle experiments but with crystalline components. Particles of
this size and complexity have not yet been characterized. This is a high risk
project in that it is difficult to anticipate the characteristics of the
resulting data from these "diffract and destroy" experiments. Methods for
processing and analyzing these data will be developed. The results of the
project will lay the foundation for visualization of functioning macromolecular
organelles.

Broader Impact: The broader impact of the project is associated with the
training of young scientists at arguably the most exciting intersection of math,
physics and biology in a large (9 groups) international collaboration. The
pioneering methods developed will be useful for advancing the community of
researchers gaining access to LCLS beam-time.

This project is jointly funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics Structure and
Function Cluster and the Networks and Regulation Cluster.
