This proposal develops an on-going structure for private sector scientists and
engineers to work cooperatively with teachers to improve math/science
instruction. Partners will be a joint effort by the private sector, the Los
Angeles Educational Partnership, the Los Angeles Unified School District, and
local universities. The project activities will occur primarily in elementary
and middle schools. During the three years of project implementation, partners
will work directly in the classroom with 50 teachers and their students to
increase the quality and quantity of inquiry based instruction, and gear that
instruction to the experimental, cultural, and language backgrounds of the
children.
