Instrumentation for Improving Environmental Science Laboratory Instruction The
primary purpose of this project is to improve the curricula in environmental
science and microbiology laboratory instruction at the institution. Improvements
center on six undergraduate laboratory courses that form the core of curricula
for a new environmental science major and a microbiology major. Specific project
equipment also allows for greater focus of laboratory time on concepts and
hands-on use of modern instruments. It is expected that these project
improvements will also make science more appealing, and more understandable for
undergraduates.
