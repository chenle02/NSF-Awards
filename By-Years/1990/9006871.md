This action is associated with the Engineering Research Equipment Grants
program. Funding is provided for the purchase of specific equipment items; these
are for use in the cross hole seismic technique. The goal is to measure in situ
the damping characteristics of soils. A knowledge of the strength, stiffness and
damping properties of soils is fundamental to earthquake hazard mitigation. Many
techniques have been developed to measure strength and stiffness properties, but
the measurement of damping properties in situ has proven very difficult. The
cross hole seismic method shows a lot of promise in this regard.
