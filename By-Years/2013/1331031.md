This Faculty Scholar award will allow Dr. Yarimar Bonilla of Rutgers University
to spend a semester in residence at Harvard University as a faculty fellow at
the History Design Studio at the W.E.B. Dubois Institute of African and African
American Research where she can also participate in the activities of the
Institute for Quantitative Social Science and the Center for Geographic
Analysis. This training will allow Dr. Bonilla to develop skills in quantitative
research, geospatial analysis, and data visualization in order to develop a new
long-term research project with the following goals: (1) to develop a series of
indicators of sovereignty that build on both quantitative and qualitative
research that will allow us to conceptualize sovereignty in more complex and
sophisticated ways; (2) to gather information on these indicators across
different societies in order to create an alternative archive of sovereign
relationships; (3) to experiment with new modes of data visualization that will
better represent sovereignty as partial, fluctuating, and contested. These
visualizations will serve as a counter to current cartographies that represent
the world through the fixed boundaries of putatively sovereign nations. They
will also serve as tools of inquiry about the nature of sovereignty, its
patterns, its negotiations, and its shifts over time. The results of this
project will have potential implications for public policy regarding
international assistance, humanitarianism, and international aid by adding new
dimensions to existing criteria for determining measures of political
sovereignty, state capacity, and a re-evaluation of the goals of "good
governance."
