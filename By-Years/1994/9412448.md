9412448 Reddy This workshop addresses one of the problems associated with
environmentally conscious manufacturing, namely, the availability of data. It
will be a forum to enable an international consortium of universities to plan
the creation of a global knowledge network to facilitate world-wide sharing of
information needed for designing and developing environmentally sound products.
The global design community has a need for access to this data. All developed
countries have significant problems in the environmental area and developing
countries can see the signs of problems already. This workshop will contribute
to making it possible to any product developer in the world to explore models
and information related to product, process, material, and deployment
alternatives that will have the least impact on the environment.
