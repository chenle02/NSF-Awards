This award will provide one-half of the funds required to acquire an
Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer system for installation and
operation by the Scripps Analytical Facility at the University of California-San
Diego. The University is committed to providing the other half of the funds
required. The instrument will fill the need of the large research group at the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography for a method to measure the abundances of
trace elements in natural and synthetic samples with very high sensitivity.
Applications span a range from the study of the chemistry of sediments and
interstitial water, to natural nuclear reactions and their products, to the
geochemistry of hydrothermal plumes in the ocean.
