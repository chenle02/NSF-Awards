Preliminary evidence indicates that the Drosophila Structure Binding Protein 1
(sbp1) gene is an excellent candidate for involvement in DNA recombination,
replication, and/or repair. The spb1 gene is a single copy gene producing three
different transcripts that are enriched in tissues and life stages involved in
rapid cell division. The SPB1:beta-galatosidase fusion protein preferentially
binds three-stranded DNA structures in a sequence independent manner, and
appears to possess a strand displacement activity. The protein predicted from
the nucleic acid sequence of sbp1 cDNAs shares some sequences similarity with
prokaryotic DNA ligases. The primary objective of this proposal is to define, at
single- nucleotide resolution, the specific binding determinant present in
three-stranded DNA structures that is preferentially recognized and bound by
SBP1. This will be accomplished by first chemically probing isolated structures
to model the three dimensional structure of the DNA. Regions that are accessible
to the probe are predicted to be either single stranded or distorted double
stranded regions in DNA. Subsequently, the relative binding affinity of SBP1 for
modified versions of the preferred binding substrate will be assayed.
Modifications resulting in a reduction or elimination of binding will indicate
the importance of a determinant for SPB1 binding. %%% Recombination, or crossing
over, is the event in which blocks of genes are exchanged between chromosomes
during meiosis. The process involves breakage of two DNA helices and the
subsequent exchange. It is generally accepted that unusual DNA structures are
formed during recombination. This proposal is directed toward understanding how
these unusual DNA structures are recognized and resolved.
