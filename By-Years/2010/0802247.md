The strength of an ideal crystal has long been of interest but 'real' materials
have lower strengths because they have defects. Nanostructures can fail
differently from larger structures, so studies of how nanostructures will break
(fracture) provide an opportunity to connect the 'real' to the 'ideal'. This
study of fracture in nanowires having novel structures that are important due to
their electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties includes collaborators in
the United States, Sweden, and South Korea who will provide nanowires for
mechanical testing. A new microelectromechanical ('MEMS-based') mechanical
loading stage that can operate inside a transmission electron microscope with
sub-nanometer resolution will be used along with other tiny testing devices to
find out what makes nanowires break. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanowires may be used
in nanoelectronics (as logic and memory and interconnect elements), as chemical
sensing elements due to their high surface to volume ratio and exceptional
sensitivity to surface interactions, in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS; as
mechanical components, electromechanical components, actuators, strain gauges,
flow sensors, others), and in structural composites where the crystalline
perfection of nanowires is expected to confer exceptional stiffness, strength,
and toughness. It is thus important to understand the detailed mechanics of
single crystal nanowires so a base of knowledge can be available for their
subsequent use in diverse applications where mechanical stress will be present.
This effort includes research programs for graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows, summer research training for undergraduate students and high school
teachers, and other educational activities.
