The reliable simulation of complex physical phenomena can benefit society and
help satisfy human curiosity in countless ways. Examples range from the very
small, such as the design of nanoscale devices and emerging applications of
quantum systems, to the very large, such as natural disasters caused by
earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as our understanding of the dynamics and
evolution of the cosmos. Although computational capabilities are increasing,
with a push towards exascale systems, the computer hardware itself is becoming
more heterogeneous and difficult to use efficiently, and the challenges posed by
the models one wishes to solve are also rapidly growing. The need to develop and
deploy better algorithms is urgent if the tremendous promise of the new
computing technologies is to be realized. This research program is focused on
the invention of new fast and accurate methods for solving comprehensive models
of physical systems where wave propagation plays a central role, with
applications throughout the range of problems outlined above.

A primary obstacle to simulating waves is the multiscale nature of most applied
problems. On the one hand, the defining feature of waves is their ability to
propagate long distances relative to their wavelength, effectively leading to
problems posed on unbounded domains. On the other, waves interact with media
that may vary at or below the wavelength scale. A central theme in such models
is the appearance of nonlocal operators; one main goal of the project is the
construction of fast, accurate, and memory-efficient algorithms to evaluate
them. This includes the development of (i) effective and mathematically
justified domain truncation algorithms for general wave propagation problems,
which at present are only available for a limited class of systems, (ii) methods
for numerically constructing accurate reduced-order models of wave propagation
in the presence of subwavelength variations in material properties, capable of
efficiently treating engineered materials without assumptions of scale
separation or periodicity, and (iii) low-memory algorithms for fractional and
other operator functions. The second goal of this project is the extension of
robust and efficient discretization schemes to second-order nonlinear wave
equations derived from action principles, yielding, in particular, new methods
to solve equations arising in general relativity and gauge theories.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
