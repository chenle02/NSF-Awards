This research is devoted to an observational study of the microphysical,
kinematic and electrical structure of warm-based convective clouds in Central
Florida as part of the convection and Precipitation/Electrification (CAPE)
experiment. Investigations include multiple-Doppler synthesis of winds,
polarization radar (CP-2) data, aircraft data, and a variety of in-situ and
surface-based electrical measurements. Modeling studies include calculation of
propagation/scattering using polarimetric measurements for a variety of
hydrometeors. Adding a "radar" module to the CSU Regional Atmospheric Modeling
System (RAMS) is proposed based on a new microphysical module currently being
developed by Dr. Cotton's group. The latter will focus on identification of the
"optimum" mix of polarimetric/dual- frequency radar signatures useful for cloud
electrification, hydrometeor classification, and storm evolution studies.
