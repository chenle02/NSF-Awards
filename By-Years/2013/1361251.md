Cells are bombarded with external signals, and respond based on the dynamics of
their internal signaling networks. Genetic variability between species,
individuals, and even tissue types can result in divergent responses to the same
external signal: humans and mice may respond differently to a drug treatment,
and certain cancer cells exhibit resistance to a chemotherapeutic agent while
others are sensitive. By manipulating the underlying signalling networks using
experimental and theoretical techniques, this project addresses the question of
how cells from different species or individuals may respond in a dissimilar
manner to the same external chemical signal. By demonstrating that directed
perturbations of a cell's internal signaling network can lead to specific
physiological changes, this research will improve medical research by suggesting
improvements to the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and enhancements to
animal models of human diseases.

Despite the importance of genetic variability in explaining disparate responses
in varied cell types, very little is known about which genetic alterations are
responsible. To address this knowledge gap, this project utilizes computational
modeling and targeted experimentation on a well-characterized signaling network
in nematodes of the Caenorhabditis genus. The work focuses on the relationship
between the EGF, Wnt and Notch signaling, pathways that are known to be
important in human development and diseases such as cancer. The project goal is
to identify the directed perturbations of a cell's internal signaling network
that can lead to specific physiological changes. The project will define a
rational approach to evaluating networks and intentionally engineering
perturbations to improve animal models of human disease, and to broaden the
utility or otherwise enhance the efficacy of therapeutic agents. The project
also supports training in interdisciplinary applications of mathematics and
biology, with an emphasis on undergraduate students and students from
underrepresented groups.
