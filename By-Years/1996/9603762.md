9603762 Emerich Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is the predominate pathway for
conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into biologically usable forms. While we know
the rhizobial genes that make up the machinery for nitrogen fixation, the
process is complicated by the symbiotic relationship that must first be
established between the Rhizobia and the plant that leads to the development of
plant root nodules. The initial step of how contact is made between the bacteria
and plant cells is in the focus of the proposed work. The overall objective of
the work is to elucidate the role of surface polysaccharides particularly
extracellular polysaccharides in the infection/nodulation process of determinate
legumes. Although all types of polysaccharides will be considered, the proposal
will focus on the role of extracellular polysaccharides in the Bradyrhizobium
japonicum-soybean symbiosis. Objectives include the search for genes that encode
enzymes for polysaccharide synthesis, determination of the function of a reading
frame that is involved in the synthesis pathway, determination of the nodulation
capacity of mutant bacteria, and complementation tests. The research will lead
to a better understanding of plant-microbe communication/interaction.
