The University of Pennsylvania will increase undergraduate research involvement
for ten students from the University of Pennsylvania and post-secondary
institutions in the Philadelphia area. Research areas will include astrophysics,
condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics and nuclear physics. A
pre-summer student involvement will be conducted to maximize summer productivity
and to the maximum feasible extent will continue into the following academic
year, culminating in the form of a written document prepared and defended by the
student. This project is supported under the Program of Research Experiences for
Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the future.
