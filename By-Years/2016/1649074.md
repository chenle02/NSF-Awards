This workshop will explore key challenges and opportunities for the development
of an open data ecosystem for neuroscience. It will bring together experts from
academic, government, and other organizations, and is organized around three
themes: 1. Incentives to Share, and What We Could Accomplish 2. Discoverability
to Discovery 3. Sustainability: How to Fundamentally Change Science

The workshop is scheduled for July 25-26, 2016, in Washington, D.C. A resulting
roadmap will facilitate alignment and coevolution of new and existing data
sharing efforts, and powerful new modes of interdisciplinary discovery.

Generous co-funding is provided by the Divisions of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure
(CISE/ACI), Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (SBE/BCS), and Emerging Frontiers
(BIO/EF).
