The Rochester institute of Technology -- in collaboration with Auburn
University, Carnegie Mellon University, and TERC -- proposes the initial stages
of a years-long iterative process to develop an evidence-based, pedagogically-
sound computing trajectory for students in middle school through early college.
The project is based on a novel three-stage model of programming instruction
using the Microsoft Kodu, Alice, and Tekkotsu programming frameworks. It will
address the questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Can the proposed three-stage
model for programming instruction, accelerate student progress on mastering
computational thinking?&lt;br/&gt;-- Can students develop a deeper understanding
of computer science concepts by learning to draw explicit analogies between
realizations &lt;br/&gt; of the same idea in different settings, i.e., in
different software frameworks, or in Kinesthetic Learning Activities like CS
&lt;br/&gt; Unplugged?&lt;br/&gt;-- How can programming environments be made
more accessible to students with disabilities such as visual impairment,
deaf/hard of &lt;br/&gt; hearing, mobility impairment (e.g., cerebral palsy), or
learning and cognitive impairment (e.g., autism or
ADD)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last question will be addressed in collaboration
with Microsoft FUSE Labs on accessibility enhancements to Kodu, and continuing
development of BridgIT, an alternative to Alice designed with accessibility in
mind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant will do preliminary work on
these questions, collecting pilot data at a week-long summer camp for students,
and a two-day workshop for K-12 teachers. The award will allow the PIs to refine
their hypotheses, conduct pilot experiments, deepen their relationships with
academic and industry partners, and formulate the detailed research plan needed
for the eventual full proposal.
