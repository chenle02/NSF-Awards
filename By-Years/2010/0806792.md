This project is establishing a new program, Providing Support Structures for
Chemistry Majors (PSSCM), to support 15-20 students throughout their
undergraduate chemistry education. To qualify for PSSCM scholarships, students
must demonstrate significant financial need and show promise for success in
chemistry. The goal of this project is to provide significant academic support
for this cohort of students. This program builds on three existing St. Olaf
resources: (i) a nationally-recognized chemistry program; (ii) TRiO/Special
Students Services (SSS) program, which supports students in overcoming
financial, social, and cultural barriers to success in higher education; and
(iii) St. Olaf's Center for Experiential Learning (CEL), which uses workshops,
internships, and career counseling to link students' undergraduate experiences
to future careers. A steering committee includes chemistry faculty and the
directors of financial aid, the SSS program, and the CEL. The committee is
guiding the program, recruiting and selecting PSSCM Scholars, and overseeing
program activities and mentorship.
