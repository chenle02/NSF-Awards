The University of Washington's Center for Information Assurance and
Cybersecurity (CIAC) is supporting three cohorts of graduate students via a new
Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. These students are
mastering the new skills required for managing security in the
cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in one of the top twenty universities in the
world, this existing academic program has already produced over 200 graduates in
two Information Assurance (IA) programs. The SFS students are participating in
research in partnership with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's
Cybersecurity directorate; an active Chapter of the Honeynet Project; and the
Applied Physics Laboratory work on malware and botnets. Other strengths of the
program include: five IA certificates; dozens of adjunct faculty-practitioners
offering interdisciplinary cybersecurity courses across campus; and
collaboration with Agora and Infragard (FBI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFS
project is having an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the
federal workforce by providing graduates with expertise in the security of cloud
computing and smart grids. More than 50% of the University of Washington student
population is female and more than 30% is from ethnically diverse groups; this
diversity is reflected in the recruiting efforts. The Center's is actively
engaged with organizations instrumental in developing the cloud, including
Amazon, Boeing, Booz Allen Hamilton and Microsoft. The program is uniquely
positioned to specialize in the management of cloud security.
