This project concerns the development and analysis of efficient numerical
algorithms for problems arising in computational modeling, with emphasis on two
main topics: algorithms for systems of equations arising from the stochastic
finite element method, and algorithms for algebraic systems arising in models of
fluid dynamics. The first of these addresses the fact that models of physical
phenomena often contain parameters or equation coefficients whose precise
properties are not well understood. Examples include permeability properties of
media in which quantities (e.g., pollutants in groundwater) are flowing or
diffusing, and boundary conditions (e.g., along the ocean bottom). In the
stochastic finite element method, the random aspects of problems are handled in
a manner analogous to the introduction of new spatial dimensions. This
methodology appears to have the potential to be more efficient than Monte-Carlo
methods, provided efficient algorithms are available for the algebraic systems
that are generated after discretization. Our aim is to study the algorithmic
issues that arise from this approach. For the second project, we will develop
and study efficient algorithms for solving systems of equations arising in
models of incompressible flow, principally, methods for eigenvalue problems
derived from linear stability analysis of steady solutions, and multigrid
algorithms for the discrete convection-diffusion equation. These are fundamental
problems arising throughout fluid dynamics, and their efficient solution is
critical for development of effective computational models.

The general aim of this project is to enhance the utility and effectiveness of
mathematical modeling for understanding scientific and engineering phenomena.
There are useful models for many disparate physical processes, including blood
flows, dispersal of environmental pollutants, performance of aerospace vehicles,
and atmospheric and oceanographic phenomena. Understanding such processes
through purely experimental techniques is prohibitively expensive or impossible,
whereas the use of modeling and together with algorithmic solution introduces a
basic understanding of the physics by providing approximations to quantities
such as flow rates and pressures. Accurate solutions are only available,
however, if reliable and fast solution algorithms can be used. Moreover, it is
often the case that certain aspects of models, such as the geologic properties
of transporting media or the velocities of flows along boundaries, are not known
with certainty. Our goal for this work is to develop fast solution algorithms
for mathematical models and to ensure that the solution strategies are able to
handle uncertainty and to produce reliable statistical information about
solutions at low computational cost.
