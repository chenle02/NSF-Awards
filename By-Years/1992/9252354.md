The aim of this project is to improve science education in the disciplines of
psychology, sociology, and geography through the creation of a dedicated
computer laboratory to be shared by the three disciplines. This laboratory will
enhance the ability of students in each discipline to conduct supervised and/or
original research and will facilitate instruction in the use of computers and
computer methods as research instruments.This project will also involve students
and faculty in analysis of data from projects conducted within the community.
Results from these studies would be provided pro bono to community agencies and
local government entities.
