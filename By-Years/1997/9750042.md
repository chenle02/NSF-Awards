Abstract DBI 9750042 Melissa A. Fleming This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolutionary history and distribution of
ermine and mink subspecies in southeast Alaska." Glaciation and sea level
changes have repeatedly fragmented the landscape of southeast Alaska and coastal
British Columbia. This has generated high levels of paleo- and neoendemism. This
research uses mitochrondrial and nuclear DNA analyses to investigate the
phylogeography of two mammalian species with island endemics in the region that
are of potential conservation concern: mink and ermine.
