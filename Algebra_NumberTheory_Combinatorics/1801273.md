An important goal in any mathematical theory is to understand one set of objects
by means of another one. When the two sets are in a one-to-one correspondence,
then one may call the correspondence a reciprocity law. One deep example of a
reciprocity law is that of Artin and Langlands, which is a vast generalization
of Quadratic Reciprocity Law discovered by Gauss that is important for solving
equations over the integers modulo a prime, and which is the genesis of the more
general Langlands Program. While a general reciprocity law within the Langlands
program is still far from properly formulated, even for objects over rational
numbers, one can consider the "Langlands Functoriality Principle," which is a
consequence of Artin-Langlands reciprocity and is a conjecture that is currently
at the core of Langlands program. This project deals with both reciprocity and
functoriality and will establish new techniques and tools to study them.

In more detail, the PI will compare the Fourier transform defined by Braverman-
Kazhdan and the Hankel transform defined by Ngo, for the standard L-functions
for classical groups. In the long run this will lead to a full theory of
L-functions for cusp forms on any reductive group and any irreducible
representation of its L-group. This will not only lead to fairly general cases
of functoriality through converse theorems, but will also provide suitable
Poisson summation formulas that are needed in the Beyond Endoscopy approach to
functoriality. In terms of reciprocity, a number of cases where the equality of
Artin factors with the factors defined by the Langlands-Shahidi method through
the local Langlands correspondence (local reciprocity) for GL(n) will be
established, following the techniques used in the cases of exterior and
symmetric square factors for GL(n) proved earlier. Projects involving p-adic
L-functions, local coefficients matrices for covering groups, and Rankin
products of L-functions for GSpin groups will also be pursued.
