This proposal is to conduct: 1) an in depth study of the isotopic geochemistry
of the Re-Os, Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr systems and of platinum group elements in basic
and ultramafic rocks for the purpose of studying mantle sources, their
differentiation products,and their evolution over the Phanerozoic; and 2) the
application of 230Th and other intermediate daughters of the U and Th decay
series to the dating of Holocene and late Pleistocene volcanics and the
relationship of these volcanics to magma sources and the times of formation of
phenocrysts. In addition to samples at hand, filed work will be conducted to
obtain very fresh materials at key localities. These problems will be attacked
over a three-year period, using newly developed mass spectrometric techniques of
negative thermal ion mass spectrometry of the platinum group elements and a new
generation high abundance sensitivity mass spectrometer (abundance sensitivity
better than 5 x 10-10 for 2 amu) with high transmission. Recently developed
analytical chemical procedures will be used to separate elements at ultra low
level concentrations efficiently and with negligible contamination. This work
should result in new scientific understanding on the origins of the rocks to be
studied, as well as the development of improved analytical techniques.
