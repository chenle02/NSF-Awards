This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop advanced
tools for semiconductor metrology that are essential for high accuracy at finer
resolution as progress continues to the finer lithography nodes. This progress
is essential to satisfy the demand for greater performance in numerous consumer
products as well as many other applications.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in a newly-discovered optoelectronic
effect which will provide much finer resolution in measuring the local density
of the charge carriers in semiconductors, and this new method shows promise for
achieving sub-nanometer resolution. Roadmaps for the semiconductor industry call
for finer resolution, and this project is responding to specific needs outlined
therein.
