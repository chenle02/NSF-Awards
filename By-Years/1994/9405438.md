9405438 Rossman This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of components needed to modernize the electron microprobe instrument
housed and operated in the Division of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the
California Institute of Technology. The institution is committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary for this upgrade. The upgrade will provide new
computer control and data processing and will allow the electron microprobe lab
at Caltech to improve the reliability and analytical capabilities of the eight-
year old instrument so that it performs comparably to modern equipment. The
electron microprobe at Caltech is used primarily to obtain quantitative chemical
composition, with micron scale spatial resolution, of geological and extra-
terrestrial material samples needed for a wide variety of research projects in
the geosciences. ***
