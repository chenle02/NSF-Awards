In recent years there have been a number of extremely fruitful interactions
between combinatorics and physics. This project aims to use combinatorial
techniques to address questions from various fields of physics, including
statistical physics (particle processes including the asymmetric simple
exclusion process), quantum field theory (scattering amplitudes in N=4 super
Yang Mills theory), and mirror symmetry. The mathematical topics and tools
involved include special functions, the amplituhedron, cluster algebras, and
cluster varieties. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project.

More concretely, this project concerns the relationship between the asymmetric
simple exclusion process (ASEP) and important families of polynomials in
algebraic combinatorics, including Schubert polynomials, Macdonald polynomials,
Askey-Wilson polynomials, and Koornwinder polynomials. It seeks to use the
structure of the ASEP to obtain insight and new formulas for these polynomials.
A second direction is to study the combinatorics of the amplituhedron, a
generalization of the positive Grassmannian, and in particular the cluster
adjacency conjecture, and an enumerative conjecture linking its tilings to plane
partitions. A final direction is to use tools from cluster algebras to
understand mirror symmetry for flag varieties and related spaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
