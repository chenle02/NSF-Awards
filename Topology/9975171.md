Abstract: This proposal concerns several problems in the smooth topology of four
dimensional manifolds. One is to find a topological definition of the Seiberg-
Witten invariants, perhaps by exploiting almost complex structures on
4-manifolds which are "tight" in some sense other than being symplectic. Second
is to find a natural construction of a 4-manifold which has as boundary the
connected sum of three copies (with alternating orientations) of a given closed
3-manifold. Third is (with Paul Melvin) to finish work on the handlebody
structure of certain complex elliptic surfaces.

Manifolds of dimension four are the least understood of all dimensions, yet they
occur frequently, for example, in relation to the three spatial and one temporal
dimensions of physical space-time. A fundamental problem is to classify these
manifolds, where classify means to understand them in terms of relatively simple
invariants which can be computed. The Seiberg-Witten invariants which were
discovered in 1994 by mathematical physicists are the best current set of
invariants, and much work needs to be done in understanding and extending them.
One technique is handlebody theory which involves a simple way of describing a
manifold in terms of simple building blocks.
