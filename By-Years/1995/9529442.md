Distributed Computing and Real-Time Networking Research This proposal requests
funding for a homogeneous workstation cluster and ATM-FDDI networking hardware
to aid research in distributed computing and real-time networking. The equipment
is useful for several projects, including: (1) Real-time communication in
heterogeneous networks: This project develops techniques for guaranteeing
deadlines in heterogeneous networks popular in mission-critical systems.
Requested equipment enables experimentation with a network consisting of ATM and
FDDI. (2) Algorithms for distributed systems management: Algorithms are
developed for managing performance and faults in distributed systems, using
formal analysis and experimentation. Realistic assessment requires a dedicated
cluster of homogeneous workstations to allow undisrupted testing and trend
prediction. (3) Failure recovery schemes for parallel applications: Design of
efficient recovery schemes is necessary to minimize execution time in presence
of failures. The requested workstations provide a homogeneous computing
environment necessary for quantitative comparison of different recovery schemes.
(4) Distributed shared memory (DSM) system design: Requested equipment provides
a workstation cluster and high-speed networking for development of an adaptive
fault-tolerant DSM capable of achieving high performance
