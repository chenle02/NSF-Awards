This project is developing and testing computer materials for teaching abstract
qualitative reasoning in physics. The computer activities will cover the first
part of the electricity curriculum. The project emphasis will be on testing
early in the development cycle. Revisions will be based on demonstrated
effectiveness, and on the response of students and classroom teachers. The
modules will deal with electric charges, forces, and interactions; the
interaction of charges with matter; and electric fields. The product will 8-10
activities each requiring about 1/2 hour of student time. The project staff are
endeavoring to develop programs which sufficient robust and complete so as to be
easily used by students with little or no computer knowledge.
