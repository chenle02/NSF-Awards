This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is targeted at
developing a new light-emitting diode (LED) lighting control system called Light
Bursts with RF Control. Existing lighting control systems are typically burdened
by the need for centralized control system that requires significant upfront
costs and commissioning. By employing light burst communication between the LED
fixtures and work-space sensors, the Light Bursts with RF Control system moves
the point of lighting control from a commissioned system, which often requires a
central processor, to point-of-use wireless sensors that do not require
commissioning. Light Bursts with RF Control employs work-space sensors that
monitor the light bursts from the fixtures, provides direct feedback to the
fixtures via wireless communication, is intuitive to use, and allows the
lighting to be readily adjusted to the space and occupant needs in real-time. It
is anticipated that this research will result in an intuitive low cost control
system that does not require upfront commissioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact/commercial potential of this project is anticipated to
significantly lower installation costs and improve usability. The adoption of
energy efficient LED lighting has been slow and is hindered by the need to
install and commission costly central processing systems. LED penetration into
indoor troffers, which in 2010 represented 957 million unique commercially
available units, is less than a 0.1%. By removing and reducing the conventional
barriers to energy efficient lighting and control, Light Bursts with RF Control
will improve the adoption of LED lighting and enable significant energy savings
associated with lighting. By intelligently employing wireless technology with
direct correlation of light contribution from individual light fixtures, Light
Bursts with RF Control is expected to enable reductions in lighting energy usage
by more than 20%-60%.
