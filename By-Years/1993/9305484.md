In applications like image analysis, signal detection and ecological spatial
data smooth and non-smooth parts for curves and surfaces occur simultaneously.
In the higher dimensional case, isolated discontinuities occurring in otherwise
smooth surfaces correspond to boundaries or "break curves". Methods for
analyzing break curves and to estimate smooth-non-smooth surfaces and regression
functions will be developed, using curve estimation, least squares and (local)
maximum likelihood techniques. Applications include confidence regions for break
curves and isoklines, edge detection in image analysis, the Poisson forest
problem, and dimension reduction techniques for high dimensional regression.
Many phenomena in biological, environmental and economic sciences can be
described by the occurrence of sharp changes when either time or location
varies. Statistical tools will be developed for the analysis of data describing
such changes. These will be of particular interest for the detection of edges in
images and for parsimonious descriptions of high-dimensional data. In this
context, confidence regions will be constructed which allow for instance to find
"safe" areas where pollutant levels are below critical levels. The proposed
methods will work under minimal assumptions on the nature of the data.
