This project aims to establish a robust and sustainable data infrastructure to
integrate neighborhood-level data to assist and inform various local
stakeholders. Drawing on local records, census data and other neighborhood-level
data the project will construct a unified database to capture crucial
connections among the variety of neighborhood-level information sources. Project
outcomes include integrated neighborhood-level data and software for
constructing and operating a knowledge graph warehouse. The educational
component of the project will integrate outcomes from this project into course
content, foster student mentoring, and promote educational innovation with a
focus on inclusivity and diversity within the associated STEM programs.

Working in partnership with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and other
expert entities, this project addresses critical issues in unifying disparate
data sources at the neighborhood-level, e.g., demographics, land use, local
incidents and injuries, proximity to trauma centers, and the like by leveraging
advanced data extraction and record linkage methods. The proposed knowledge
graph warehouse is designed to organize and maintain pertinent neighborhood-
level information, with data transformation achieved through zero-shot
extraction techniques and key-phrase generation methods for free text data. The
warehouse will support efficient querying and summarization with adaptable
techniques for its unique structure, including novel pattern mining methods for
trend detection, ensuring sustainability and extensibility with compatibility
for other knowledge graphs, and incorporating incremental updates and extensions
for new data and entity types. To ensure data accuracy, the project plans to
integrate data from various local agencies, provide user feedback mechanisms,
and uphold a robust metadata record. In order to mitigate biases and to provide
a comprehensive view, the project will continuously update the infrastructure
with new data sources, ensuring transparency through accessibility of metadata
and recording of data provenance.
