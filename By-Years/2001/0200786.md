The focus of this research is the development of asymmetric methods for
activating carbon-carbon pi-bonds for attack by external nucleophiles and for
the stereospecific cross-coupling reactions of stereogenic secondary carbon
centers will be developed. In the former, Pd(II)-catalyzed processes will be
used to develop both carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions.
In the latter, palladacyclic intermediates containing Pd sigma-bonded to a
stereogenic secondary carbon will be used to develop the reaction chemistry for
stereospecific catalytic cross-coupling of stereogenic secondary carbons.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Larry E. Overman in
the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. Professor
Overman will focus his work on developing catalytic, asymmetric reactions for
the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. The research has
broad implications for the environment by minimizing the production of chemical
wastes and resulting methodology could be of great interest to the
pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. This area of research has proven to
be a valuable setting for the training of undergraduate, graduate and post-
doctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;
