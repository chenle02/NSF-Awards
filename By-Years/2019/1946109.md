Linguistics is the science of language. Linguists conduct formal studies of the
structure of the world’s over 6,000 languages, investigate the acquisition and
use of language in typical and atypical populations, seek to understand the
neural structures that enable humans to learn and use language, and create the
language models used in computational contexts, such as artificial intelligence
and machine translation. The breadth of the field’s applications makes it vital
to technological and medical advancements, economic competitiveness in a global
economy, humanitarian aid, and U.S. national security. Given the multi-faceted
importance of the field for the country, it is crucial to devote resources to
the introduction of this field to high school students, and to recruit the
brightest minds in the country to pursue careers in
linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the North American
Computational Linguistics Open competition (NACLO) in its mission to introduce
linguistics to high school students, to provide training to interested students
and support to their teachers, to select and coach the team of U.S. students
that represent the country at the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL), and
to support the current work of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) focused
on creating and promoting the teaching of an Advanced Placement course in
linguistics for high school students. Specifically, the grant supports the costs
associated with training a team of eight high school linguists from across the
United States and escorting them to the 2020 IOL. Since 2007, about twenty-five
percent of US team members who attend IOL have continuing involvement with the
fields of linguistics and language technologies. Nearly all team members take
linguistics courses in college, bringing a broadened view of language to their
studies and future careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
