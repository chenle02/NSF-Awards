The research objective is the development of a general analytic theory of the
motion of asymmetric rigid bodies subject to arbitrary forces and torques. A
secondary objective will be to develop control schemes for the motion which take
advantage of the analytic solutions. The theory would comprise finding closed
form solutions for the Eulerian angular velocities, the Eulerian angles, and the
angular momentum vector in inertial space. The results will have a fundamental
impact on practical applications in terms of the analysis and control of finite
sized rigid bodies, particularly spinning space vehicles.
