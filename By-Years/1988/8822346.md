Information relevant to market transactions is usually generated exogenously
and at random times. A given sample of these market "fundamentals" must be
reliably transmitted to prices before the next sample occurs if the market is to
be efficient. Markets clear sequentially at a frequency which is typically far
in excess of the average frequency of fundamentals. This time-base relation
between fundamentals and market clearing prices is shared by communications
channels which transmit individual information source samples using multiple
transmissions on the channel. But the market-channel analog is incomplete
because market agents are motivated by profits while channel users pursue
reliable communication. This proposal suggests these sometimes conflicting goals
can be resolved. The embodiment of the suggestion is a demonstration that a
popular futures market model is identical to a model of bandwidth expansion over
a channel with noiseless feedback when market agents tradeoff profits against
reliable communication. Empirical tests of this tradeoff are proposed for a
grain futures market. The demonstration also suggests that sequential auction
models act as estimators of information sources and therefore are relevant to
the controversy surrounding price volatility in stock valuation models. The
research estimates information rates for recognized stock market fundamentals
and establishes volatility standards by comparing source information rates with
the stock valuation model capacity. The market models considered assume source
information is generated in randomly timed bursts. Consequently, the multiple-
trader futures model is a study in multiple-access channel source coding. In an
efficient market with optimal profit-taking and information transfer, both
testable hypotheses, agent trading behavior should solve a multiple-access
coding problem. Tat solutions of pen problems in market theory can contribute to
open problems in communication theory is further evidenced by showing that the
determination of the proportion of informed market participants solves a
challenging problem of finding the capacity of an arbitrarily varying channel.
The significance of the study lies in the recognition that there are no known
tests yielding a standard measure of the ultimate reliability with which market
prices can reflect fundamental information. Successful empirical studies will
establish such a standard. In addition, treating markets as a symbiont of
communication theory offers the prospect that actual markets can serve as
experimental resources for solving significant problems in communication theory.
