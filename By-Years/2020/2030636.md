The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted commercial supply networks and resulted in
actual and perceived shortages for critical supplies, including personal
protective equipment and medicines. This situation has opened opportunities on
underground markets that present dangers to the health and social and financial
well-being of citizens. These illicit networks, facilitated by online Tor sites
("dark web"), are notoriously difficult to trace and are a major source of
counterfeit products, including counterfeit pharmaceuticals. This Rapid Response
Research (RAPID) project will collect, archive and analyze data on underground
market traffic for pandemic-specific items. A better understanding of the
operations of such networks during the pandemic will help inform an effective
mitigation response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the
collection of longitudinal data from darknet markets, forums, and Telegram
channels on a broad range of products specific to the pandemic, including
personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and disinfectants, and medications
advertised to the general public as treatments for COVID-19 disease. The PIs
will collect and analyze data on market participants (sellers), price, volume,
demand for these items. The project will improve our understanding of how
illicit markets respond opportunistically to commercial supply
shortages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
