The the 2013 installment of the biennial conference series Topology, Algebras,
and Categories in Logic (TACL 2013) will take place at Vanderbilt University
from July 28th to August 1st, 2013. The conference will be held in conjunction
with the 28th annual Shanks Lecture Series. The 2013 Shanks Lecturer will be the
Fields Medalist Vladimir Voevodsky (Institute for Advanced Studies), who will
deliver two lectures on his work on univalent foundations of mathematics. The
conference proper will be preceded by a four-day summer school. The scientific
program of the combined events will include -- in addition to the Shanks
Lectures -- invited lectures, training tutorials and contributed talks (standard
and featured/selected).

The conference is of interdisciplinary nature and brings together a number of
areas contributing to the study of logic, via semantic and syntactic methods.
TACL allows for interaction between methodologies from different areas of
mathematics (including Topology, Algebra and Category Theory) and the formation
of hybrid approaches (for example, Algebraic Proof Theory). At the same time,
via the study of classical and non-classical logics, the conference allows the
investigation of the applicability of logic to diverse disciplines ranging from
classical algebra, to constructive mathematics and analysis, topology, geometry,
theoretical computer science, mathematical linguistics and philosophy.

The combined event will be publicized widely. Due to the high quality of the
planed scientific program, upwards of 120 mathematicians, logicians and computer
scientists are expected to participate. This proposal supports attendance by
principal speakers and other participants, particularly targeting those without
other sources of support, early career researchers, women, disabled persons and
minorities.
