The Global Positioning System (GPS) has matured to achieve relative positioning
accuracies of 0.1 ppm or better. Remaining error sources that limit this
accuracy are: (a) the wet tropospheric path delay suffered by the GPS signal and
(b) multipath reflections. The PIs will run a GPS baseline experiment in
Colorado in order to study both these errors and methods of reducing them. They
will investigate the effect of azimuthal variations of the wet troposphere on
the determination of GPS baselines. In order to study this effect it is
necessary to suppress multipath errors that might mask the tropospheric
variations.
