The 34th Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications (SUMTOPO 2019) will
take place in Johannesburg, South Africa, July 1 - 4, 2019 with sessions from
diverse areas of topology. New this year is the session on topology in data
science, complimenting the NSF "big idea" of Harnessing Data for 21st Century
Science and Engineering. At SUMTOPO 2019, we will bring together established
researchers, early career faculty, and students from all over the world to make
progress on the unsolved foundational problems in mathematics while also
applying our topological expertise to other areas of mathematics and other
fields of study. In particular, mathematicians are using topological methods to
understand the structure of data. Results presented at the conference can be of
use to disciplines in which big data forms an important part. A main goal of the
conference series is to promote participation of young researchers by making
room for many contributed talks and also by highlighting young researchers as
semi-plenary speakers. Organizers continue to recruit women and other under-
resented groups to the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's SUMTOPO
will include plenary speakers and daily sessions in the areas of set-theoretic
topology, continuum theory and dynamics, asymmetric structures and order,
topological algebra and analysis, and topology in data science. This grant will
support the travel of US-based participants who are students, early in their
career, have no other travel support, or are members of an under-represented
population. The featured lectures will highlight cutting edge research in each
of the represented areas while the sessions provide a vibrant and welcoming
space for researchers, established and new, to share ideas and form connections.
