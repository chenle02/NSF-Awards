The Commission on engineering and Technical Systems (CETS), a major unit of the
National Research Council, created the Board on Infrastructure and the
Constructed Environmental (BICE) in 1994: The BICE brings together in an
independent forum expertise from a wide range of scientific, engineering, and
social science disciplines to address problems and issues in the areas of
technology, science, and public policy applied to urban systems; public
facilities; infrastructure systems and services; above ground and underground
construction; the relationship between the constructed and natural environments
and their interaction with human activities; the effects of natural hazards on
constructed facilities; and related issues of planning, design, construction,
management surety, and use of built environment. The BICE provides a unique
structure to respond to specific requests from government, or to act on its own
initiative with public or private sector support. In pursuit of its goals, BICE
plans to conduct on-going strategic planning and oversee committee activities
involving studies, workshop, symposia, and a variety of information
dissemination activities.
