This research will be devoted to a study of powerful extragalactic radio
sources. These sources are associated with the nuclei of quasars and active
galaxies, where enormous amounts of energy are generated on very short
timescales, probably due to the infall of material onto a supermassive black
hole. At radio wavelengths we see very compact (a few light-years) 'cores' and
'jet-like' features, that vary rapidly in total intensity and polarization. In
many sources, bright 'knots' of emission appear to move down the jets at several
times the speed of light. The main part of the research will involve imaging the
polarized radiation from these radio sources at milliarcsecond resolution. The
underlying goal is to elucidate the relationships between different classes of
radio sources and to understand the physical processes occurring in the vicinity
of massive black holes. The Principal Investigator is regarded as an outstanding
theoretical astrophysicist.
