9300217 Mukherjee This research examines fundamental deformation mechanisms of
superplasticity in intermetallics with special emphasis on the role of
interfaces. Superplasticity is the ability of some crystalline materials to
undergo large neck-free tensile strain at elevated temperatures. An important
feature of superplasticity is the phenomenon of grain boundary sliding. This
research explores the influence of grain and phase interfaces on the
superplasticity process. Areas of investigation include the role of cooperative
grain boundary migration, measurements of internal friction due to grain
boundary sliding with correlations to mechanical testing parameters, and effects
of interfacial back stress on the rate parameters in the constitutive equation
for superplasticity. %%% This research is aimed at improved understanding of
superplastic behavior and addresses the application of this phenomenon to
intermetallic alloys. The results are valuable to near-net shape processing of
materials and automated manufacturing. ***
