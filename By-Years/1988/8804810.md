Ion transport and leaflet movement will be studied with: 1) Single and double
barrel ion-sensitive microelectrodes to measure the dynamic relationship of H+,
K+, Cl- and Ca++ fluxes in the pulvinar apoplast, in response to light, channel
blockers, and pump inhibitors; and 2) Patch clamp methods to probe for changes
in the electrical behavior of ion pumps and channels in Samanea protoplast
membranes in response to light, channel blockers, and a variety of ionic
conditions: To further probe the mechanism of light signal transduction,
standard biochemical methods will be used to elucidate the diacylglyerol portion
of the PI pathway. The effects of PI cycle intermediates on ion transport will
also be investigated.%%% Samanea saman is a nyctinastic legume with paired
leaflets that usually separate from each other (open) in the light and fold
together (close) in the dark. These leaf movements are also under circadian
control and furnish a convenient model system for studying biological time
measurements in plants. They are turgor regulated and driven by movements of
ions through membranes of the cells in the motor organ (pulvinus). The ion
movements result from rhythmic and light-regulated changes in pumps and channels
in the membranes. The light signals require amplification and the plant uses the
phosphatidylinositol (PI) pathway. This pathway is well studied in animals but
unexplored in plants. This project will study the tranduction mechanism using a
variety of techniques.***//
