Intellectual Merit. This project provides scholarship support to enable up to 53
academically talented, financially needy students to pursue a Professional
Science Master's (PSM) degree in Applied Genomics or Microbial Systems Analysis
programs. PSM programs across the nation are attracting the interest of
students, educators and employers as a model for best practice in preparing
science-trained professionals for diverse positions in industry, government, and
non-profit sectors. Students in the programs acquire disciplinary competency,
training in the theory and practice of the most current scientific
methodologies, interdisciplinary and professional development experiences, and
mentoring by peers, program faculty, and industry and government
representatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This project contributes
to national competitiveness by recruiting students to graduate training who
might otherwise be lost to the nation's scientific enterprises. Additional
emphasis on recruitment of participants from groups that are underrepresented in
science not only is enhancing the diversity of the scientific workforce, but is
preparing more role models for subsequent generations of students. The PSM
degree program requires that students interact on a regular basis with
representatives from the industrial and government sectors, which is promoting
partnerships between the academic and industrial sectors in both training and
collaborative research.
