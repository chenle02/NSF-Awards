This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research grant will support the
research and development of lead iodide semiconductor devices for the detection
of alpha, beta, gamma and x-radiation. Methods for growing large, extremely pure
crystals of lead iodide will be investigated and developed, and the suitability
of the resultant material for radiation detection characterized and studied. In
particular, indications that the material can be used in high temperature
environments will be tested in detail. Previous Phase I research has
demonstrated the feasibility of the project and identified the research to be
done. Lead iodide detectors, if developed successfully, would provide very
compact nuclear radiation detection devices capable of operating at temperatures
up to 250 degrees C, and would represent a significant advance in the technology
of nuclear radiation detectors.
