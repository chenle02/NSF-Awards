Higher-rank phenomena in integral geometry

(PI Boris Rubin, LSU, Proposal 0556157, DMS)

Abstract

The proposed research lies on the intersection of integral geometry and harmonic
analysis. The main focus is the so-called higher-rank problems, which are
typical for multi-dimensional geometric and analytic objects in geometry,
statistics, tomography, and other sciences. The project includes the following
general topics: (a) Radon transforms and more general intertwining operators on
Stiefel manifolds, spaces of matrices, and symmetric spaces of arbitrary rank;
(b) Analytic families of fractional integrals of functions of matrix argument
with kernels having a complicated geometric structure of singularities; (c)
Problems in convex geometry and geometric tomography, that can be treated using
higher-rank objects studied in (a) and (b). The work combines methods and ideas
from several branches of mathematics: real and complex analysis, convex
geometry, harmonic analysis on homogeneous spaces, Jordan algebras, group
representations, function spaces, and approximation theory. The main objectives
include derivation of new inversion formulas and the study of the algebraic
structure of Radon-like transforms on spaces with complicated, but conceptually
natural, geometry (matrix spaces, flag manifolds, symmetric spaces, and others).
The PI plans to study analytic families of potential operators of the Riesz type
and the Riemann-Liouville-Gindikin integrals associated to homogeneous cones in
context of applications to higher-rank geometric problems. The aim is to
understand new higher-rank phenomena in the Radon transform theory on the
conceptual level, develop new effective methods based on group representations,
wavelet transforms, and other tools of harmonic analysis. The project also deals
with detailed investigation of newly introduced composite cosine transforms on
Stiefel manifolds, totally geodesic Radon transforms on rank-one Riemannian
symmetric spaces of the non-compact type and a series of open problems of the
Busemann-Petty type, related to two- and three-dimensional sections of convex
bodies in spaces of higher dimension.

The proposed research is closely related to contemporary trends in integral
geometry and harmonic analysis. New higher-rank techniques can also be applied
to multivariate statistics and tomography. The activities include development of
research-based educational materials useful for teaching, mentoring early-career
scientists and other effective pedagogic forms.
