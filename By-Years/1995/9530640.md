This career advancement award supports the activities of an experienced scholar
interested in improving her research skills in studying how values influence the
software design process. Activities will include: 1) Acquisition of computer-
related technical skills, including familiarity with tools used in the software
development process and knowledge of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and computer-
aided manufacturing (CAM) packages; 2) Increasing command of qualitative
research methods for study of the design process, particularly methods helpful
to the analysis of videotaped data; and 3) Participation in a studio course in
software design at MIT, experimenting with methods for studying the software
design process and gathering data on the role which values play in the process.
Over the next five years, these activities will enrich two research projects.
One will study several software development field sites for evidence about the
role of values, assumptions and judgments in those processes. The other focuses
on redesign of CAD/CAM software to support the skilled work of machinists and
will result in development of prototype software for machinists. These
professional development activities are critical to achieving excellence in the
investigator's future plans for research.
