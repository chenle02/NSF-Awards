Cross-linguistic variation in semantics How can languages vary in mapping
linguistic form to meanings? How do children learn the semantic properties of
their native language? Can there be systematic differences among languages in
their semantics unmatched by differences in grammatical structure? This
conference and workshop series will draw on recent advances in semantics and
syntax to address such questions with precision. Three semantic areas will be
studied: (1) reference of nominal expressions (e.g., semantic differences among
languages that distinguish "mass" from "count" nominals--like English--and those
that do not--like Chinese), (2) verbal aspect and tense, and (3) interpretation
of pronouns or other "incomplete" expressions (where this often involves
connecting the "anaphoric" expression to some "antecedent") and related matters
of scope (the "range" over which some expression operates). Results will be not
only of theoretical interest but also of potential practical significance for
such areas as foreign language learning and speech pathology.
