The 4th International Conference on Electron Spectroscopy (ICES 4) will be held
on the Manoa Campus of the University of Hawaii, July 10-14, 1989. It is being
held in conjunction with the Ninth International Conference on Vacuum
Ultraviolet Physics (VUV 9), which is being held July 17-21 in the same
location. Topice to be presented and discussed include improved spectral
resolution in x-ray photoemission, improved spatial resolution in XPS, spin-
polarized techniques, inverse photoemission, applications to superconductivity,
polymer-metal interfaces and microelectronic materials.
