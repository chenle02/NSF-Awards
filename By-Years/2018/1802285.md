This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Geometric
Invariance and Partial Differential Equations" that will be held at the Academia
Sinica Taipei January 17-20, 2018. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses
on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of geometric
partial differential equations and several complex variables. A number of
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.
This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and
participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available at:
