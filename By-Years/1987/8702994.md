The goal of this work is to use electron tunneling and tunneling measurements
to better understand the high Tc superconductivity in the new layer-perovskite
compounds. Tunneling is the most direct probe into microscopic superconductivity
and may provide critical information on these new materials. Of initial
importance is producing unambiguous current-voltage traces to accurately
determine the energy gap and the coupling strength. Subsequently the full
electron-phonon spectrum would be attempted. Samples will be obtained in close
collaboration with the Geballe group at Stanford University which has had early
success in producing thin films of the new superconductors. Several visits each
year will be made up to Stanford for sample making. Samples will also be
obtained (when available) from groups at Naval Research Laboratory,
Westinghouse, and TRW. The possibility of seeing non-phononic superconductivity
will be addressed using a test proposed by V.Z. Kresin requiring analysis of
tunneling, heat capacity and neutron scattering.
