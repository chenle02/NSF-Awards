The focus of this research involves the development of asymmetric synthetic
methods for the production of a variety of oligosaccharides. The reaction
strategy is centered on the use of the Achmatowicz rearrangement for the
preparation of pyranones in concert with palladium-catalyzed glycosylation. The
methodology will lead to the production of new and hitherto unknown unnatural
oligosaccharides having interesting materials and biological
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. George A. O'Doherty in the
Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University. Dr. O'Doherty will focus
his work on developing methodology for asymmetric synthesis of oligosaccharides.
The methodology will allow for the facile incorporation of simple sugars into
oligosaccharide motifs thus leading to the discovery of new structures
possessing a wide range of functions. The broader impact of the work is in the
area of materials science as well as the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the
project presents an excellent vehicle for the training of both undergraduate and
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
