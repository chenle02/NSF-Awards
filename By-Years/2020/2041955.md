The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore
the uses of a new platform useful for studying cell cultures with different
oxygen levels. Oxygen, an important factor for cell life and development, is
typically not controlled in conventional culture conditions, but for specific
studies low oxygen levels must be maintained. For instance, low oxygen levels
help researchers study diseases, human tissues and even biological processes.
Other processes, such as disorders of the digestive system, some infectious
diseases, and the human microbiome, are studied with no oxygen. Current
technologies for performing these cell culture techniques are either inadequate,
burdensome or too expensive for widespread use. The proposed technology is a
compact and affordable oxygen-controlling platform for cell cultures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an
oxygen-controlling cryogel cell culture platform. Cryogels are an advanced type
of hydrogels with a unique set of physical properties, including an
interconnected and microporous 3D network, shape memory features, and are
syringe injectable. Low oxygen tension (i.e., hypoxia) is associated with some
tissues and diseases, and anaerobic cell culture is essential for studying
gastrointestinal disorders, infectious diseases and the human microbiome. The
proposed technology is a compact and affordable oxygen-controlling cryogel
platform that creates oxygen-controlled conditions directly within the cellular
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
