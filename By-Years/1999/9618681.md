Land reform has been portrayed as a remedy for rural instability in the Third
World on the grounds that it alleviates the extremes of inequality that are
thought to be the root causes of social instability. However, rarely has land
reform succeeded in abating an on-going civil war nor has land reform precluded
revolutionary challenges from recurring in its aftermath. Part of the problem is
that agrarian reform is often accompanied by repressive violence. Thus land
reform must compete with repressive violence in the `struggle for the hearts and
minds` of the peasantry. This project tests a model of the competing effects of
land reform and repressive violence on the political loyalties of peasants. Data
collected from El Salvador from the 1980s through the 1990s is used to test the
model. These data include election results, land reform beneficiaries, victims
of repressive, insurgent and combat violence and national events over this time
period. These data provide direct empirical evidence on the widely accepted
linkage between inequality and instability and the corollary proposition that
land reform should restore rural stability.
