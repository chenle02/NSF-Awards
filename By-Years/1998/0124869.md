Approximately 20% of the relative motion between the North American and Pacific
plates is accommodated along a system of active right-lateral strike-slip faults
which runs from southern California through western Nevada and into southern
Oregon. This zone is known as the Eastern California Shear Zone and Walker Lane.
The remaining 80% of relative offset occurs along the San Andreas fault. The
northern portion of the Walker Lane, near Reno, Nevada, is especially poorly
studied but is believed to be the youngest portion of the zone and, thus, may
well be the best region within which to study the beginning stages of an intra-
continental transform. This study will attempt to determine primarily the timing
and amount of right-lateral offset across the fault zone by applying a variety
of geologic and geochronologic techniques. The results will have significance
for understanding the evolution of plate boundaries but will also be of
considerable significance in evaluating the seismic risk for the Reno area.
