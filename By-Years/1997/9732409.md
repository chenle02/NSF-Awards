This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department, Wellesley
College, directed by Dr. Adele J. Wolfson. Nine students will participate each
year over the next three years in a 10-week summer program. The program will
focus on recruiting women students, although men are not excluded. The
participants will be exposed to research topics in a number of important
research areas in chemistry. Other program activities include weekly workshops
with oral presentations by students, seminars by visiting scientists, tours to
nearby chemical firms and academic research laboratories, and career counseling.
Students will be required to report research results in the form of written and
oral presentation at a Science Center-wide poster session at the end of the
program.
