This conference is interdisciplinary and foundationally oriented on the concept
of randomness. Randomness from the point of view of various fields, including
probability and statistics, computer science, psychology, philosophy, and
mathematics will be discussed. Invited speakers include M. Blum, L. Blum, P.
Diaconis, J. Keller, and B. Scyrms. Randomness is a fundamental concept in
several mathematically oriented disciplines, lies at the heart of much research,
is subject to various interpretations, and is not fully understood.
