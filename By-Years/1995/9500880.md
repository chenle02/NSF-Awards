DMS-9500880 PI: Shelstad Shelstad will investigate the twisted endoscopy of
connected reductive algebraic groups over local fields. It is planned to develop
descent theory for transfer factors and applying it to some pivotal questions in
transfer of twisted orbital integrals. An overall goal is to establish results
applicable to stabilization of the adelic twisted trace formula and the study of
automorphic representations, especially multiplicity formulas. The theory of Lie
groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one
of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical
vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation
theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself,
particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics,
especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
