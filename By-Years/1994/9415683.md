9415683 Guzman This project is on research to study the synthesis and
development of water soluble bifunctional affinity ligands. These ligands are
potentially useful for a variety of biochemical separations, as well as
analytical, preparative and diagnostic applications. Soluble polymers such as
polyethylene glycol (PEG) will be derivatized with two different reactive groups
at two termini to obtain heterofunctional complexes with two different affinity
groups. A variety of functional ligands, such as chelating agents, peptides,
proteins, enzyme-substrates etc., will be synthesized and studied. Also, the
recovery and reuse of these ligands will be investigated. ***
