9409552 Schaefer ABSTRACT As a part of an interlocking program of linguistic
documentation, this grant provides funding to undertake formation of a bilingual
dictionary for Emai, a previously undescribed language of southern Nigeria.
Utilizing linguistic resources developed through previous fieldwork, the PI will
analyze and select pertinent lexicographic information and arrange it on
computer files in the form of suitable Emai:English and English: Emai dictionary
entries. The result, which will complement a selection of oral tradition texts
and a reference grammar, will be a descriptive dictionary intended for scholars
from a range of disciplines. ***
