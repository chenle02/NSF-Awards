A study of zero-point vacancy effects in quantum solids using magnetic
techniques developed under previous grant periods will be made. Measurements of
zero-point vacancy effects are based on recent evidence that magnetic polarons
may form around ground state vacancies in solid 3He. Quantitative results will
be sought through measurements of magnetization and pressure as functions of
density, applied magnetic field, temperature, impurity concentration, and sample
geometry. The results will be analyzed and compared with theoretical
calculations that remove some deficiencies of existing polaron models and with
predictions based on improved stability criteria of polarons in the paramagnetic
phase.
