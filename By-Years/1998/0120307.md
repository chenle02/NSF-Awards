&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principles of Efficient
Inference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year
funding of a three year continuing award. This project seeks to uncover
fundamental principles for the construction of real-time AI systems that employ
declarative knowledge representations and general reasoning engines. To achieve
this goal, the PI will (a) study the "fine grained" structure of problem
hardness based on notions coming out of work on phase transitions in random
problem distributions; (b) develop faster complete and incomplete reasoning
engines, including systems that employ decision-theoretic control of reasoning;
and (c) apply and test the new algorithms to planning problems in a robotics
testbed. This research will lead to the creation of useful new algorithms for
solving hard combinatorial problems in areas such as knowledge-based expert
systems, autonomous systems, and operations research. The results will also
promote interdisciplinary work on logic and reasoning in the AI, theory, OR,
robotics, and verification communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
