The research objective of this grant is to develop a monolithic, fist-sized,
device for the three-dimensional manipulation of micro/meso-scale objects,
ranging in size from several microns to several millimeters. The device will be
built of a shape memory alloy whose salient feature is to remember its state.
The idea is to integrate structural, actuation and sensing functions into a
single/monolithic component that will provide for high reliability, accuracy and
robustness at a low cost. The manipulator will be built by a novel Selective
Laser Sintering process by which shape memory alloy powder is molted by the
laser and deposited under computer control in the required shapes. A
comprehensive investigation of the physical and mechanical properties of the
manipulator, in conjunction with models of the shape memory effects taking place
during its operation, will also be undertaken. Several generations of prototype
manipulators will be built and tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The direct benefits
of this project are threefold. An inexpensive pragmatic device that will enhance
the efficiency of micro-assembly type of operations and contribute to the
realization of tabletop factories of the future for micro manufacturing will be
built. A better understanding of the manufacturability and operation of shape
memory alloy based devices will add to the knowledge base. The findings will be
incorporated into ongoing courses and disseminated through journal articles,
seminars, reports, short courses, Internet, etc. contributing to education in
micro-manufacturing technologies.
