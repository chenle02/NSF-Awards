This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used in the following research
projects: Terminal Singularities, directed by Ian Morrison; Homology of the
Steenrod Algebra, directed by William Singer; Thue Equations, directed by Julia
Mueller; Homology of Nilpotent Spaces, directed by Robert Lewis; and Goppa Codes
and Drinfeld Modules, directed by Oisin McGuinness.
