Fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry will be evaluated as a method to
measure surface area excess concentration at the gas- glycerol interface of
peptides. Surface concentrations measured using FAB MS will be compared to those
measured using the radiotracer technique, the only method currently in use to
directly quantify the concentration of proteins and peptides at gas-liquid
phase. If successful, the first highly accurate data will be acquired describing
the behavior of peptides at N2-glycerol and vacuum-glycerol interfaces. The
behavior of peptides and proteins in non-aqueous solvents is of increasing
importance because of the chemical and biotechnology studies and application of
enzymatic synthesis in non-aqueous solvents. In addition to the development of a
new method, this research will add knowledge about the fundamental mechanism of
FAB ionization. This research will be carried out by a chemist and two chemical
engineers in consultation with a protein biochemist.
