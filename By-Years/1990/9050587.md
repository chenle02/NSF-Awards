As the United States becomes more dependent on computer systems, the potential
for damage caused by the misuse of private, personal, or secret data stored on
these systems increases significantly. As a result, it is important that the
future generation of computer professionals be trained to understand their
ethical and moral responsibilities in dealing with the information with which
they have been entrusted. In addition, they need to be equipped with the
knowledge and tools to enable them to protect that information from misuse.
Hence, this project develops a laboratory-based sequence in computer security.
The two course sequence covers topics in professional responsibilities, data
encryption, network security, operating system security, viruses, and data base
security. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
