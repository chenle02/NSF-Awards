Williams will continue his investigation of the ideal structure of crossed
product C*-algebras. The primary focus will be on the interplay between
topological invariants associated to a dynamical system and the structure of the
resulting crossed product. This project involves research in ergodic theory.
Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems
whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic
detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how
groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way, ergodic
theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous
spaces.
