This is a combined study of ecology and morphology of salamanders conducted so
as to gain basic information concerning these organisms and their way of life.
The information will have general value for understanding the organization of
vertebrate nervous systems during development, the development of important
vertebrate organs (vertebrae, tongues), and the organization of communities of
tropical organisms. The main purpose of gathering morphological and ecological
data is to understand the diversification of lineages and the distribution of
lineages in space and time.
