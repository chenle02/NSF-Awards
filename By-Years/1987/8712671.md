In recent years, reduced levels of atmospheric ozone observed in the early
austral spring (September - October) over the South Polar region have been
accompanied by increased levels of incident ultraviolet radiation (UVR). UVR is
potentially very damaging to phytoplankton, the microscopic plants which
constitute the base of the food web in aquatic ecosystems. This project is a
quantitative assessment of the effects of UVR on Antarctic marine phytoplankton.
The impact of chronic exposure to UVR will be evaluated via a month-long
incubation experiment to be conducted at Palmer Station, Antarctica using flow-
through chambers and natural surface seawater. Phytoplankton will be exposed to
five different UVR regimes: incident, two reduced levels and two enhanced
levels. Changes in biomass, primary productivity and pigment composition will be
monitored at 15-day intervals. Concurrent with the month-long incubation,
natural samples will also be exposed to the various UVR treatments over short
time intervals (2, 4 and 8 hours) to evaluate the effects of acute UVR exposure
on phytoplankton productivity and pigment composition. Such a combination of
experiments will address the potential ecological consequences of increasing
levels of UVR on Antarctic phytoplankton in particular and on the Antarctic
marine ecosystem in general.
