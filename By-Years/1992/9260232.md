This study is concerned with separating particles suspended in a fluid by using
field flow fractionation implemented with an ultrasonic acoustic force. In field
flow fractionation (FFF), the fluid particle mixture is forced to flow through a
thin channel. A force perpendicular to the direction of flow is applied. The
action of the force on the particles is a function of the nature of the force,
and the identity of the particles. To accomplish a particular separation of
particles, one selects a force which acts with differing magnitude on the
particles to be separated. As the particles move down the slit, the particles
acted upon more strongly by the force move to the flow cell walls (if for
example, the force acts towards the walls) where they slow down since the flow
near the walls is slower. Those particles which were not caused to move towards
the flow cell walls travel with a faster velocity and begin to distance
themselves from the slower moving particles in the wall vicinity. Eventually, at
the cell exit, the center moving particles elute first, and the slower moving
particles exit later, thereby creating the separation. The utility of FFF for a
particular separation depends on the ability to select a force which can drive
the perpendicular separation. In this study, ultrasonic acoustic forces are
used. Standing waves with a frequency on the order of 1 Mhz are set up across
the flow cell, and the particles move by virtue of a second order acoustic
pressure force as given by equation (1) of the proposal. The key advantage of
using acoustic forces is that the acoustic force can separate particles based on
differing volume, density or speed of sound in the particle medium. The research
will design and conduct ultrasonic FFF flow cell, and investigate the ability to
separate particles based on size and density.
