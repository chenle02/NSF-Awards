ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI: Chen, Yu &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:1641077
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop advanced methods for characterizing
minimally-invasive diagnostic medical devices. The research will facilitate the
development and standardized performance testing of novel biophotonic
technologies for early disease detection and image-guided surgery.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3D-printed biomimetic phantoms for the performance testing
of near-infrared spectroscopy systems (NIRS) will be developed and the PI will
investigate near-infra-red (IR) fluorescence (NIRF) image quality through in
vivo and phantom-based measurements to explore the basis for developing
standards that can be used to validate NIRF imaging systems. The development of
novel biomimetic phantoms for noninvasive fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI)
will elucidate optimal fabrication approaches that influence the effectiveness
of 3D-printed phantoms.
