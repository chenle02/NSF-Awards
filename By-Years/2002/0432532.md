AST-0071099&lt;br/&gt;Merritt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will
use sophisticated N-body simulations to study the galaxy--supermassive black
hole connection in galactic dynamics. The HST-STIS spectrograph can be used to
measure velocity dispersions and velocity gradients in galaxy nuclei which can
be used to test the predictions resulting from these
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtually all galaxies appear to contain
supermassive black holes at their very centers, which are almost certainly
relics of the quasar era when the black holes accreted gas and generated
enormous luminosities. These black holes are now nearly quiescent and comprise
on average only ~0.3% of the mass of their host galaxies. There is a growing
body of work suggesting that the gravitational influence of the relic black
holes can extend far beyond the center of a galaxy. Moreover, the formation and
growth of black holes may be intimately connected with the evolution of galaxies
on larger scales. For instance, mergers between galaxies containing nuclear
black holes would produce supermassive black-hole binaries which would
eventually coalesce while emitting gravitational radiation. The proposed
research would address these questions by studying the link between black holes
and their host galaxies. A major component of the work would be a study of
supermassive black hole binaries. The formation and decay of these binaries may
be relevant to a wide range of phenomena. Another goal is to understand how
black holes affect the dynamical state of their host galaxies by influencing the
motions of individual stars. The work would be heavily computational, relying on
state-of-the-art N-body codes and massively parallel
supercomputers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
