Theoretical research will be conducted on the properties of the two-dimensional
electron liquid in the presence of long-range disorder. This type of disorder is
usually created in heterostructures with large spacer width by randomly
distributed remote impurity ions. Screening by the two-dimensional electron
liquid competes effectively with the resultant random potential. However, in
some cases this screening is not effective and the two- dimensional electron
liquid becomes very inhomogeneous. In a strong magnetic field this state occurs
each time the filling factor of the Landau level corresponds to an integer or a
fractional gap. Different manifestations of the inhomogeneous state will be
studied: the low temperature behavior of the conductivity tensor in the filling
factor range where all gaps are destroyed by disorder; the width of the plateau
of the quantum Hall effect; the attenuation of the surface acoustic waves; the
Wigner crystal formation in the presence of the long range disorder. %%%
Theoretical studies will be made on the physics of mesoscopic systems where
quantum effects are manifest on a macroscopic scale. In particular, studies will
be made on the effects of disorder on the properties of the two-dimensional
electron liquid which forms at junctions between semiconductors.
