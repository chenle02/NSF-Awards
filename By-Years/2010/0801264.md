&lt;br/&gt;L-functions are the basic functions of number theory and are
fundamental in the study of prime numbers, solutions to equations in whole
numbers, and the uniformity of the distribution of arithmetic sequences. The
first L-function is the Riemann zeta-function. The location of its zeros is the
subject of the Riemann Hypothesis which is widely regarded as the most important
unsolved problem in all of mathmatics. In this project the PI will study various
approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis. In addition, he will investigate some very
specific statistical properties of the Riemann zeta-function and of families of
L-functions in order to more fully understand thes mysterious
functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his collaborators intend
to prove that most of the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions are on the critical
line. They also will to develop a general tool, the asymptotic large sieve, to
address problems involving averages over all primitive Dirichlet characters of
modulus less than a given parameter. They will use this to investigate the
spacings between zeros of Dirichlet L-functions. Another project is to determine
(conjecturally) the arithemetic part of the distribution of spacings between
consecutive zeros of the Riemann zeta-function.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the PI would
like to prove the reciprocity formula that he conjectured for Vasyunn sums, and
to investigate its relevance in the Nyman-Beurling approach to the Riemann
Hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;
