This is an Engineering Research Equipment Grant for purchase of essential
equipment to establish a laser system for ultrafast near- infrared laser
spectroscopy. The purpose of this system is to generate picosecond or
subpicosecond laser pulses tunable in the 1-um to 2-um near-infrared spectral
range to investigate the dynamical processes in high-speed electronic and
optoelectronic devices and materials based on III-V and II-VI compound
semiconductors whose bandgaps are in the near-infrared range. One specific
project will investigate the dynamical evolution of the carriers, the gain, and
the lasing processes in a InGaAsP/InP laser under mode-locking or pulsed current
switching operation. In another project, systematic studies will be carried out
on the optical and electronic processed in novel structures of HgCdTe materials
uniquely prepared with a laser- evaporated molecular-beam epitaxy technique.
