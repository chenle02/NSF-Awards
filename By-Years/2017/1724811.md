The International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) to be held in
Columbus, Ohio on July 17-21, 2017. The conference is the leading conference on
autonomic computing techniques, foundations, and applications. The conference
covers a wide range of topics that impacts the core of Computer Network and
Systems Research (CNS). This includes but are not limited to data centers, cloud
computing, smart cities, cyber-physical systems, sensors, and embedded systems,
which are all applications for autonomic computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference focuses on exposing the state of the art in the area of autonomic
computing systems that reduce the burden of large unwieldy systems by allowing
the systems to more effectively manage their own behavior in ways that maximizes
performance and minimizes cost reliably and securely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICAC
2017 will offer many opportunities for students to meet, interact, and exchange
ideas in both a formal and an informal atmosphere to ensure that students and
experts interact. It is important for the US to remain engaged and competitive
in this area. This grant will fund US graduate and undergraduate students who
would not normally be able to attend.
