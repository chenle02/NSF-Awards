This project explores the development and use of constraint programming
languages in database applications. Constraint Query Languages (or CQLs) are
applicable to many domain-specific areas, such as spatial databases, because
their basic data type generalizes the relational tuple data type and is closer
to the application semantics, e.g., for spatial databases these generalized
tuples are convex spatial point sets . Most importantly, CQLs are designed so
that I/O-efficient access to large sets of generalized tuples can be supported
through existing multi-dimensional searching data structures. This project is an
investigation of both the principles and the practice of CQLs. The principles
include: the expressive power of various classesof constraints both linear and
nonlinear; the design of calculus/algebra languages combining constraints and
objects; the optimization of constraint programs; and the data structures for
indexing very large sets of constraints. The practice involves developing
prototypes of persistent constraint languages and evaluating them in three
concrete application areas: solid modeling in design databases; map overlays in
spatial databases; and subsequence matching in scientific databases. Constraint
Query Languages will be key components of the next generation of declarative
database interfaces, because they capture domain-specific semantics in an
efficient fashion, and their successful implementation will be a significant
extension of the current relational and object- oriented database technologies
