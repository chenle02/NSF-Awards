This grant uses small islands as a model system to understand how ecological
systems work. Small islands are simple and numerous, facilitating interpretation
and statistical replication. A major goal is to determine the effects of a large
predatory species, concentrating on how that species affects an intermediate
predatory species, and through it,lower levels of the food web such as other
predators, herbivores and plants. While many kinds of effects will be studied, a
particular focus is how natural selection changes traits of the intermediate
predator, in turn modifying how the latter affects lower levels. Models of
extinction will continue to be developed and tested with field data. The speed
and extent of recovery from hurricanes will be ascertained for the animals,
plants and habitat in our study sites. Results of this grant, which seeks in
part to establish broad ecological principles, also have important applications.
These include improving yield from agroecosystems, predicting consequences of
biological invasions, assessing hurricane damage and potential for recovery, and
preserving species and habitat. The grant contributes importantly to educational
outreach, particularly of undergraduates, by making possible their direct
participation in field and laboratory studies.
