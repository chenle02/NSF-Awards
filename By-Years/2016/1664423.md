The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
is to develop methods for modeling Phononic Crystals (PnCs) and to characterize
them experimentally. PnCs are a type of micro/nanostructure that are capable of
manipulating the manner by which elastic waves travel through a material by a
periodic patterning of a material's geometry. Computer simulations will be used
to model the behavior of the PnCs. These simulations will then guide the design,
fabrication and experimental characterization of the PnCs. Deliverables include
analytical and computational tools for PnCs, theoretical and experimental
results demonstrating how elastic waves move through PnCs, demonstration of how
PnCs alter the thermal conductivity of a material, documentation of results,
engineering student education, and engineering research experience for students
from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research
will lead to a wide range of technological advances in the areas of signal
processing and thermo-electric devices. Because the inherent geometry of PnCs
give them their ability to process elastic waves (signals) these types of
devices will be in a position to replace traditional digital signal processing
techniques which consume relatively large amount of power in comparison to PnCs.
Additionally, by manipulating phonons in materials more efficient thermoelectric
devices can also be constructed that can be practically used for thermal
harvesting of energy. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in
this research as well as students from a local community college that serves
only Native Americans. Course material will also be developed as a part of this
award that will address the different modes of energy transport in materials and
the interplay between them.
