9319221 Molnia This award is for support of a six month Small Grant for Explor-
atory Research (SGER) to document and analyze a surge, which is in progress, on
the Bering Glacier in Alaska. Surging is defined as periodic, very rapid
movements of large quantities of ice within a glacier, alternating with much
longer periods of near stagnation. The Bering Glacier is the longest (191
kilometers) and largest (5,173.5 square kilometers) glacier in North America.
This work is part of an on-going program of the United States Geological Survey
to monitor the Bering Glacier (the Bering Glacier Research Project (BGRP)) and
involves analysis of synthetic aperture radar imagery, vertical aerial
photography, time-lapse photography, and stream gauge monitoring. ***
