Dr. James Neff (College of Charleston, South Carolina) and Dr. Douglas O'Neal
(Keystone College, Pennsylvania) will lead an effort to understand the physical
conditions in starspots. Analogous to spots on the Sun, starspots are regions in
the atmospheres of other stars that are cooler than the rest of the stellar
surface. The goals of this project are to use recent advances in atmospheric
modeling codes to determine starspot properties, re-analyze extensive databases
of existing spectra using the new techniques, expand observational surveys to
include cooler stars, and combine various techniques to yield a better
understanding of the observational signatures of
starspots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic activity on the Sun is perhaps the most
dramatic way in which astronomy impacts our daily lives. By measuring the
properties and distribution of starspots on a wide range of active stars, it
might be possible to uncover the fundamental nature of the solar dynamo.
Photometric light curve modeling, Doppler imaging, and the spectroscopic
properties of molecular bands (which are formed only in starspots, not in the
warmer unspotted atmosphere) all yield important information about the
distribution, temperature, and fractional coverage of starspots.
