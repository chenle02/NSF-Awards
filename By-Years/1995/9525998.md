9525998 West This research will develop a flexible accounting system that
integrates four alternative costing methodologies into the product life cycle
framework. Using virtual manufacturing equipment, the operational and financial
impact of proposed technologies can be assessed. Five industry collaborators
will participate in developing and testing a modification to an existing virtual
manufacturing cell environment that incorporates the new cost model. The results
of this work may be used to develop a practical tool for moving beyond
traditional accounting methods in assessing the impact of proposed technology
investments on an existing factory environment. Fundamental issues in making
process design decisions will be explored in this research that should enable
the development of practical models for assessing operational and financial
impact of new technologies. Design tools based on these models would be used in
accounting, process design, and technology management to estimate the cost of
introducing new technologies. ***
