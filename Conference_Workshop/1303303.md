This award is for the support of the Southern California Number Theory Day
(SCNTD) Conference Series at the University of California-San Diego. The first
conference will be held September 20-22, 2013. The other two SCNTD conferences
will be one-day meetings that are organized on a Saturday in 2014 and 2015 and
will consist of 4 or 5 one-hour, high-quality lectures on the latest research in
number theory and related areas (for example, model theory, cryptography, or
algebraic geometry), given by research leaders in these fields who also have a
reputation for their excellent expository skills. The first eight meetings
(2005-2012) have each brought together an average of 40 participants from
universities, FFRDC's, and liberal arts colleges in Southern California, ranging
from beginning graduate students to senior faculty and researchers. The speakers
at the SCNTD conferences are an internationally diverse group of number
theorists, speaking on a wide variety of topics. The lectures are designed to
promote research and to encourage fruitful interactions among researchers at
various stages of their careers. One of the main goals of the conferences is to
disseminate the latest research in number theory and related areas. The SCNTD
conferences offer their participants the opportunity to interact with scholars
from other institutions, and also give graduate students and postdocs the
opportunity to interact with more senior mathematicians in an informal setting,
conducive to learning and collaboration. Most universities and colleges in
Southern California have small number theory groups which makes it difficult to
maintain regular and active number theory seminars. The SCNTD conferences have
become a very effective way to bring together a critical mass of number
theorists in a way that most of these institutions individually could not
possibly afford.

The current award will fund the next three Southern California Number Theory Day
meetings at UC San Diego in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Due to several recent
breakthroughs in the area of research related to Stark's Conjectures (deep
conjectural links between analytic mathematical objects called L-functions and
discrete mathematical objects called global units), the first of these meetings,
to be organized on September 20-22 of 2013, will be a three-day conference
entitled "Stark's Conjectures and related topics", consisting of 15 one-hour
lectures delivered by the most recent main contributors to this exciting area of
research in modern number theory. The conference has been broadly advertised and
the organizers will make special efforts to encourage and fund the participation
of graduate students and young researchers who have showed interest and
potential in this area of research. The conference website can be found at
