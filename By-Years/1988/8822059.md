This workshop will focus on mathematical modeling and solution techniques for
large scale problems in electric power system planning under uncertainty.
Because of the uncertainties concerning future costs, demands for electricity,
and availabilities of generation and transmission facilities, such planning
models must take the form of multiperiod, stochastic mathematical (linear or
nonlinear) programs. Various avenues of research being done in various places to
tackle this problem is the subject of this workshop. The workshop proceedings
will be sent out to the broader research community to stimulate further research
in this area.
