ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;CTS-0102680&lt;br/&gt;A. Garcia/Arizona State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a NER Grant. Surface phenomena become
prominent when fluidic systems and devices are miniaturized since the surface
area to volume ration increases. Biological systems capitalize on nanoscale
surface phenomena by assembling unique elements such as membranes and vesicles
to shuttle materials into and out of cells or to process wastes in organs such
as the kidney. Much research is currently underway to find alternatives to
moving parts in order to move ultra-small volumes of liquid (i.e. micorfluidics)
since mechanical pumps and valves are currently difficult to manufacture at the
nanoscale and require very careful choice of materials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NER research project is an exploration of the
nanoscale engineering of the surface of capillaries to control movement of
ultra-small volumes of liquid. It explores the hypothesis that molecular
mixtures including photochromic molecules can be attached to the surface to form
various types of nanoscale monolayer films in which the solvation and free
volume of the active element (i.e. the photochormic molecule) are controlled.
This in turn will allow the design of light controlled micorfluidic pumping,
switching, and valving systems with biotechnological applications. This project
also supports the establishment of collaboration with the NSF-CREST
Computational Center for Molecular Structure and Interactions at Jackson State
University in order to visualize and interpret our experimental results as well
as to guide further experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;
