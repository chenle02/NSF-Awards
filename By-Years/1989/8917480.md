The ultimate aim of the proposed research is to elucidate the role during
development of the DNA-bind factor Elf-1. This factor interacts with a sequence
element which is specifically required for expression of the dopa decarboxylase
gene in the central nervous system of Drosophila. The first aim of proposal is
no use two different approaches to manipulate the expression of Elf-1 in vivo
and analyse the affect of these manipulations on dopa decarboxylase expression,
and on the expression of the genes Ultrabithorax and engrailed which Elf- 1 also
binds. One approach is to isolate mutations in the Elf-1 gene and the other to
express the protein ectopically in transformant strains. Preliminary experiments
have identified three different Elf-1 isoforms so a second aim of the research
is to investigate the total number and structure of the variant Elf-1 proteins,
and to determine the significance of this variation. This will involve comparing
the activities and distribution of the different forms. The work in this
proposal should increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which different
genes are selectively turned on and off in different types of tissues.
