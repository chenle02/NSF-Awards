Broadband internet access is now widespread; there about 210 million users in
the United States, up from roughly eight million in 2000. These users spend an
average of 30 hours a month using the Internet, up from just one hour per month
in 1995. Surprisingly little is known about the fundamentals of demand for
internet access, such as the willingness-to-pay per gigabyte of data or the
importance of externalities created by network congestions. A key reason for
this gap is the lack of detailed data on broadband
useage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies pricing and usage of broadband
service using a unique data set of subscriber-level service plans and hourly
usage from a group of North American internet service providers. The research
team will produce descriptive statistics on broadband usage, estimate demand and
willingness-to-pay for broadband access, evaluate the welfare implications of
usage based pricing, and analyze the impact of network congestion on demand. The
results will allow the PI team to evaluate the possible effects of congestion
pricing in this market. The PI team will use both the detailed data and
variation in the shadow price created by the usage-based pricing used by some
providers to estimate demand. The demand estimates are then used to compute the
effects of usage based pricing on consumer welfare. Furthermore, by exploiting
exogenous variation in the configuration of the network the team can estimate
the impact of congestion on both usage and welfare. This allows them to compute
the equilibrium effect of congestion pricing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results
of this research form an important window on internet pricing and usage that
sheds new light on recent policy debates on regulation of the internet.
