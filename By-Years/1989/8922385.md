Two fundamental ways for dealing with the growing complexity of query processing
in deductive database systems, Complexity Tailored Design and Complexity
Tailored Query Answering, are investigated. In Complexity Tailored Design, the
acceptance of database updates is based on the estimation of future complexity
of query processing. In Complexity Tailored Query Answering, approximate answers
are provided due to resource constraints, e.g. not having enough time to compute
the full answer. Standard proof techniques used in query evaluation are modified
in such a way that the computation of the answer to a given query can be stopped
before its completion and the meaningful partial answer can still be returned.
This research leads to new methodologies of query processing and database design
in the presence of incomplete information or limited computational resources.
