Physics (13) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the country, physics faculty
acknowledge that solving problems using various computational methods is
important, but many faculty lack the expertise and time to incorporate
computational methodologies into their courses. By focusing on two core
numerical algorithms (Euler method and finite difference) that are sufficient to
solve a large number of problems encountered by students in traditional courses,
a new, yet practical, model to integrate computation throughout the curriculum
is being developed. The approach introduces these computational methods to
students in their sophomore year, and then applies them comprehensively
throughout the upper-division physics and astronomy curriculum with increasing
levels of sophistication. Peer instruction and collaborative learning strategies
are used to enhance the learning processes. New curricular materials are being
developed for faculty to allow them to effectively and efficiently incorporate
these computational methodologies into their courses.
