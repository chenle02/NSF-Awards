This program aims to discover and study neutral hydrogen and prebiotic (and
other) molecules in the environments of extreme starburst galaxies using
centimeter-wavelength techniques. Observations in this wavelength range are
complementary to mm-wavelength spectral-line surveys by probing colder, lower-
density gas. Detailed high-resolution maps of OH-satellite lines and methanimine
in the galaxy Arp 220 will provide constraints on the physical properties of
this starburst environment where the dynamics of galaxy mergers dominate
evolutionary processes. High density molecular gas will also be studied via the
line emission from HCO+ and HCN. Lastly, a study of a complete sample of
luminous infrared galaxies will allow the examination of differences between
pure-starburst dominated galaxies and those containing a hidden active galactic
nucleus.

The broader impacts of this program include support of a graduate student for
research activities, and summer support for a consultant who is a professor at a
minority teaching institution in Puerto Rico.
