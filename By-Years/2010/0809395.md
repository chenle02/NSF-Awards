This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
to Professor Bradford B. Wayland of Temple University focuses on the development
of organo-metal mediated living radical polymerization (LRP), the preparation of
new classes of homo and block copolymer materials, and the self assembly of
block copolymers into nanostructured materials. Organo-cobalt porphyrin
complexes mediate the highly precise LRP of monomers to form low polydispersity
homo-polymers and block copolymers. The self-assembly of block copolymers in
both solution and the solid state is utilized in forming nanoscale, structured
materials with uses in electronics, photonics, and drug delivery. These
applications have the potential to impact the economy, the environment, and
society. Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the research and
their experiences vary from the fundamental design and synthesis of catalysts
and polymer materials to the evaluation of practical applications in
collaboration with material scientists, engineers, and technologists.
