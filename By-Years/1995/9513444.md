This award supports Professor Enrique Del Castillo of the University of Texas at
Arlington to collaborate in Quality Engineering with Professor Elart von Collani
of the University of Wuerzburg, Germany. The objective of their research is to
develop process control procedures that integrate statistical process control
and automatic (or engineering) process control techniques for the quality
assurance of manufacturing processes. Dr. Del Castillo brings to this joint
effort strengths in working with stochastic models that incorporate process
dynamics. This is complemented by Dr. von Collani's expertise in the economic
modelling of manufacturing processes and in the relevant statistical sampling
procedures for quality control. This research will contribute to an emerging
field of industrial research: the application of engineering control theory
principles to the area of quality control. It should result in a new generation
of economically influenced process control procedures for short-run
manufacturing systems.
