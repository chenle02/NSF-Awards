9413859 Haroun, Medhat This is an instrumentation award. The instrumentation is
for a shake table capable of simulating earthquake motions on a 30,000 lb
payload (up to 50,000 lbs) in both the horizontal and vertical directions with
strokes of + 10 and + 5 inches, respectively. A unique aspect of the earthquake
engineering research thrust at UCI is its emphasis on seismic safety engineering
based on risk and reliability considerations, and its innovative development in
control engineering for seismic protection of structures. The acquisition of the
shake table would increase UCI's research and teaching capabilities and aid in
establishment of a unique large testing facility in Southern California, an area
prone to earthquakes yet with no major facility of this size. Such a table is
essential for experimental verification of new theoretical results, as well as
the development of innovative control devices and of effective retrofit
techniques. The shake table will enable researchers to study the collapse
mechanisms of structures such as bridges and highway systems, lifelines,
buildings, and secondary systems under combined horizontal and vertical
earthquake motions with large amplitude displacements and to investigate the
effectiveness of seismic protective systems, including active, passive, and
hybrid systems subjected to both horizontal and vertical ground motions. The
shake table will also enhance UCI's potential as an interactive/training center
from engineers from the Pacific rim countries. UCI is in an excellent position
to collaborate with industry for testing equipment, secondary systems and
structural contents. ***
