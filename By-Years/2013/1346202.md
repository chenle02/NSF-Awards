This SBIR Phase I project proposes to discover digital methods to personalize
reading instruction such that students understand more when they read, retain
knowledge, and build lasting skills. The academic research on reading supports
the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction
can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet
the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a
student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to
help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several
inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading
instruction can effectively be created and delivered for students working with
any text.

The broader impact of this Phase I project will be to improve how students read,
and therefore how they learn. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling
readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are
four times more likely to drop out of school. Difficulty reading extends to all
subjects; poor readers have only a 14% chance of success in math and 1% chance
of success in science. Reading is the heart of education. It is the most
important skill we learn in school. People who read critically have more success
in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand
social resources. Thirty million students in the U.S. struggle to read, so
reducing that number by even 10 or 20 percent would mean a huge improvement in
the educational and financial opportunities for millions of Americans. Globally
the problem is even larger, and digital devices give us the opportunity to reach
over a billion people worldwide. Researchers and educators have been trying to
solve the "reading gap" for decades, but only now does the technology exist to
make this possible.
