The research team will conduct extensive follow-up observations and analysis of
several thousands of transiting planet candidates that are identified by the
HATNet North and South telescope facilities. By using telescopes in both the
northern and southern hemispheres, the researchers will be able to provide
increased spatial and temporal coverage, which will aid in establishing the
orbits of relatively long-period exoplaents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transiting
planets are those whose orbits cause them to pass in front of, and behind, the
host star, which provides unique opportunities for characterization through
subsequent photometric and spectroscopic observations. The project is expected
to have broader impacts by significantly increasing the number of transiting
exoplanets available to the community, and will involve students with special
attention to under-represented groups in astronomy.
