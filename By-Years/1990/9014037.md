This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research. Bacterial genes for poly-beta-
hydroxybutyrate (PHB) will be transferred from the bacterium Alcaligenes
eutrophus into the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. It will then be possible to
determine whether or not these genes can be expressed in plants, and whether or
not the PHB made is stable. If these preliminary experiments are successful
further experiments would be undertaken to maximize the concentration of PHB in
the plant tissues. PHB forms a biodegradable plastic and efficient expression in
plants could lead to reducing its costs to practical levels. These experiments
could also help answer the question of why plants abandoned PHB as a storage
compound in favor of starch and oils.
