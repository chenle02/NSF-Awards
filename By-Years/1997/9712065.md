9712065 Pinter This grant provides $14,758 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring a workstation with expanded memory and disk storage and GIS software
for studies in geomorphology utilizing digital elevation models (DEMs). This
facility will be used to explore fundamental relationships between relief,
elevation, erosion and tectonics for major drainage basins in North America,
will help to characterize the dominant geomorphic agents responsible for
erosions in these basins and will test Anhert's Law, which relates basin-scale
erosion rates and topographic relief. These studies have global relevance to our
understanding of the relationships between tectonics and climate. This facility
will also support studies in groundwater and watershed hydrology, environmental
and resource analyses and geologic mapping. ***
