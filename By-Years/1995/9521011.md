This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This study will look at a previously unstudied aspect of black-white
differences by examining the contributions of total family wealth or assets to
children's educational attainment and the subsequent contributions of children's
wealth on the likelihood of forming stable families. It builds on theories of
social stratification and uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to
statistically model the effects of wealth. %%% This study will contribute to
sociological understanding of differences between blacks and whites in family
formation and stability and in educational attainment. Its focus on the effects
of family assets will also be of use to policy makers concerned with stabilizing
the family and equalizing opportunity for children. In addition to the
scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
