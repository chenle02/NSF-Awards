This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to
acquire a nanolithography instrument, which will significantly improve the
research capabilities at Iowa State and the University of Iowa in the fields of
microelectronics, photonics and biology. The nanolithography instrument is an
e-Line system, which is capable of 20 nm accuracy and can be used to make nano
patterns over large areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The
instrument allows for precise patterning at the nanoscale of electronic,
photonic and biological materials and devices. It will allow fabrication of
photonic crystal structures for improving the efficiency of solar cells. The
instrument will be used for defining nanochannels for ordered regrowth of
neurons and stem cells and for defining channels that will be utilized for
studying the influence of various pesticides on mobility of nematodes, which are
a major corn pest. The instrument will also be used to produce the patterns
needed for negative index materials for advanced photonic devices such as
waveguides and light valves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impacts: The
technological impact of the research will be significant in many varied fields
such as solar energy conversion, stem cell development, photonic devices and
more efficient lighting. There will be significant integration of research and
teaching through development of new lab courses and introduction of new lab
modules in existing courses. Women and minority students at the graduate and
undergraduate levels will be involved in the various research projects and will
also benefit from the new lab classes that will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;
