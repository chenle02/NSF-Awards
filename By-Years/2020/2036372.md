This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
networked, wireless chemical and biological sensing for use in wet laboratory
and manufacturing environments. The technology to be developed addresses a $16
billion chemical and bioprocessing equipment market with a large growth
potential. The ability to cost-effectively monitor these parameters from the
research phase to large-scale manufacturing will accelerate the development of
critical products such as vaccines and cell therapies, as well as better ensure
the quality of everyday consumer goods produced from advanced chemical and
biochemical processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project includes
technical and manufacturing advances that must be made to bring these sensors to
market. This effort combines engineering development in networked, wireless
communication and miniaturization with analytical chemistry development of key
sensing technologies. The innovations include development of manufacturing
processes for a novel pH stir bar, development of wireless dissolved oxygen
sensing modalities, and methods for achieving wireless sensing in larger-scale,
metallic manufacturing vessels. Technology will be developed that enables
wireless sensing of key wet process parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen
for chemical and biochemical process monitoring in research and larger-scale
manufacturing environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
