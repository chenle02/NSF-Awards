Aquatic organisms not only swim in water, they use the flow patterns generated
by other organisms and objects to orient themselves, to catch prey, to find
mates, and to save energy. To understand how animals use and sense flow
scientists must integrate fluid dynamical, sensory, and locomotory research. In
recent years, fluid dynamic analysis and neuromechanics of aquatic locomotion
have made large methodological progress. This symposium will facilitate and
enhance the exchange of expertise at an exciting frontier of cross-disciplinary
research. This symposiums will bring researchers together to integrate research
across multiple systems (copepods, jellyfish, fish), organizational levels (from
flow dynamics to sensory systems to muscle mechanics) and approaches
(computational modeling, flow analysis, robotics). By bringing together experts
in all these areas and disciplines, the symposiums will enable participants to
better understand the mechanics behind complex behaviors that rely on flow
sensing and flow use. The symposium is designed to offer a synthesis of ideas
while highlighting the work of emerging investigators. Each of four symposium
sessions comprises two talks by senior speakers and three talks by junior
colleagues. Senior speakers will provide a broad context and build a shared
foundational understanding for all the participants across disciplines. The
speakers have been selected to offer a mix of disciplines and expertise that has
not yet been brought together and that is unlikely to be assembled at the usual
annual meetings. The symposium will bring together scientists who share an
interest in fluid-structure interaction and flow sensing, yet come at this
problem from many different angles, ranging from oceanography to robotics.
Additional engagement opportunities at the symposium will be provided during
breakout discussions, networking sessions, and coordinated discussions of
research opportunities and limitations. Conference proceedings and publications
will be used to disseminate the workshop outcomes.
