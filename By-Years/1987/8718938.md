This research will focus on the developmental plasticity and the trophic
factors that are important in determining a neuron's fate in the lobster. The
investigator will define the developmental and adult functions of these neurons;
study the biochemical, anatomical and physiological plasticity in identifiable
neurons and manipulate the "turning on and off" of transmitter using hormones.
The outcome should add to our knowledge about timing of transmitter acquisition
as well as assist in defining general principles guiding the biochemical
differentiation of neurons.
