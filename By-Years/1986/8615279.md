This award is to support research to improve understanding of air-water mass
transfer. The liquid film coefficient relates to low solubility and relatively
unreactive compounds where air-water transfer is controlled by the water phase
or by both phases, such as O2, N2, CO2, DDT, most PCB's, and several mercury
compounds. The coefficient describes the resistance to transfer in the liquid
phase. A unique flume has been designed and built to study water-phase
controlled mass transfer on the scale of a laboratory flume, while maintaining
the measurement accuracy of a contained tank or laboratory beaker. The most
fundamental objective of this research is to determine the basic mechanism by
which a flowing open channel interacts with the free water surface to reduce the
liquid film coefficient. The results are expected to provide a basis for the
evaluation of existing natural stream data and to specify the important
parameters to be measured when determining the liquid film coefficient in
natural streams. The principal investigator is highly qualified to carryout the
proposed research. A two year continuing grant is recommended. This award is for
$75,827 for the first year.
