9726252 Anderson The PI will conduct an interdisciplinary study of mantle
dynamics, from the earth's surface downward. Plates, including cratons and
slabs, exert a strong control on mantle motions and surface volcanism.
Lithospheric architecture and stress in the plates will be correlated with
global gravity, bathymetry, tomography and volcanism datasets in order to sort
out surface vs. internal causes, and to explain island chains and large igneous
provinces. Mineral physics and constraints from geochemistry, cosmochemistry and
heat flow will be used to interpret mantle tomography and large-scale variations
of flow and composition. ***
