9354959 Cole This proposal requests support for five graduate fellowships to
support multi-disciplinary education and research in the area of spoken language
interfaces. The proposed program is structurally innovative in that it combines
the disciplines of human-computer interaction and cognitive science to develop
computer systems that interact with humans via spoken language. The proposed
program addresses national research needs as identified by the NSF. OGI's Center
for Spoken Language Understanding has created the first academic program in the
U.S. designed specifically to provide students with the background and research
skills needed to develop spoken language systems. Innovative inter-institutional
components of the proposed program include: (1) partnerships with the University
of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and Clark Atlanta University (CAU), whose
undergraduate populations are predominantly composed of students from under-
represented minorities; (2) outreach and recruitment efforts through the partner
institutions to interest and involve students in advanced study in spoken
language interfaces; and (3) multi- level team-based support of the trainees in
OGI's program. ***
