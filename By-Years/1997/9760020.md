*** 9760020 Weber This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
determine the feasibility of an inexpensive process to manufacture new materials
in the form of continuous glass fibers with well controlled chemical composition
and dimensions. The process is based on the ability to create and maintain
liquids in an undercooled, non-equilibrium state at temperatures below the
normal melting point. The viscosity of the liquid increases in the undercooled
state, allowing new glass fibers to be formed from materials that normally do
not support fiber pulling operations. Extremely large cooling rates occur in the
fiber-drawing process, allowing glass formation from melts that would
crystallize at slower cooling rates. The proposer has performed research that
employed containerless processing to synthesize short fibers from undercooled
melts, determine the temperature and process conditions for several materials,
and show theoretical feasibility of the proposed method of fiber synthesis,
which is amenable to fiber manufacture. The proposed Phase I research is to
experimentally demonstrate this process and its applicability to manufacture new
glass fibers with optical, fiber-laser, structural and other applications.
Successful completion of the proposed work will enable the synthesis of
prototype quantities of fibers needed for commercial applications R&D in Phases
II and III. ***
