This experimental research determines the effect of stress levels on thermal
conductivity of soils. A modified triaxial cell will be used to perform
conductivity measurements in soils at different levels of confining stresses.
The results will help to develop constitutive relations between the thermal and
mechanical properties of soils. Soil is a particulate system made up of discrete
particles with void spaces. Thus, stresses on soils have a considerable impact
on the thermal response characteristics. Experimental measurements on the
conductivity of soils as a function of the boundary conditions have not been
made thus far. The results of this research will have a potential to improve the
basic understanding of the thermal and mechanical behavior of soils.
