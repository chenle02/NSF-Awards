In this project the principal investigator will study interactions between
subfactors and conformal field theories, a topic that has proved to be very
fruitful lately. The main emphasis of this research is placed on two aspects of
the subject: (1) the study of supersymmetric and exotic conformal field theories
using operator algebraic techniques, and (2) the study of a vast generalization
of a conjecture from finite group theory to the general setting of subfactors.
The applications of these operator algebraic techniques are expected to produce
answers to a number of representation theory questions and to shed light on
certain exotic subfactors, such as those arising from conformal inclusions. The
general framework of subfactors will also provide new insight into some old
group theory conjectures.

The theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann in order to
provide a proper mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. Noncommutativity
(i.e., the fact that a product AB may differ from BA), which is a key feature of
quantum mechanics, is an important aspect of operator algebras. Vaughan Jones's
subfactor theory is built on this noncommutative framework and has provided
linkages of operator algebras with some major parts of mathematics. Conformal
field theory is a theory describing critical phenomena in condensed matter
physics, and it also plays an important role in string theory. The remarkable
interactions between subfactors and conformal field theory have led to many
interesting mathematical developments. The aim of this research is to find
solutions to some of the important mathematical issues that surface in this
context and that have a wide range of applications.
