0426172&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt; During the 2004-2005 academic year,
Northwestern University will hold an emphasis year in stochastic analysis and
partial differential equations. Long term and short term visitors will be
invited to spend time there in an effort to increase the interaction between
these two areas of research. Senior faculty at Northwestern are already active
at this interface and will facilitate these interactions. Junior faculty will
benefit from this increased activity and will have the opportunity to meet and
work with a large number of prominent researchers in both areas. The year will
conclude with an international conference in June 2005.&lt;br/&gt;
