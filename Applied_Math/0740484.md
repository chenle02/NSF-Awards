The investigator studies biological and chemical systems that form
spatiotemporal patterns. One research project focuses on the modeling and
analysis of locust swarms. Locusts can operate in either a solitary (neighbor-
avoiding) or gregarious (neighbor-seeking) phase. The investigator constructs a
PDE model incorporating social aspects of behavior as well as environmental
variables and random motion in order to understand how each of these factors
affects the dynamics of phase change, the spatial patterns of the locust
population, and the nucleation of gregarious groups. A second model describes
the rolling motion of migrating gregarious groups. The high-dimensional ODE
model incorporates social interactions, gravity, wind, and the boundary formed
by the ground. The models are studied with tools from dynamical systems,
statistical mechanics, analysis of PDE, and numerical simulation. Another
project examines the control of Turing patterns in chemical reaction-diffusion
systems. Inspired by recent experiments which controlled chemical Turing
patterns by using an external light field, the investigator develops a framework
for manipulating reaction-diffusion patterns via periodic spatiotemporal
forcing. The study is built around a symmetry-based analysis of normal forms, a
perturbation analysis of reaction-diffusion type PDE, and numerical simulations,
all of which reveal how pattern stability is affected by the applied forcing.

Spatiotemporal pattern formation occurs spontaneously in myriad natural systems.
Key challenges include the development of mathematical models of these systems,
the analysis of the models, and the development of methods for controlling the
patterns. The investigator's research on locust plagues primarily addresses the
first two challenges. Locusts are an important pattern-forming biological
systems because their destructive swarms have severe environmental and economic
impacts. Some results are general enough to shed light on other social
biological aggregations such as bird flocks and fish schools. The research on
Turing patterns in chemical systems addresses the third challenge. The results
explain experimental observations and suggest control strategies that can be
tested in the lab. Furthermore, some of the results apply to other Turing
patterns, which occur in such diverse contexts as biological morphogenesis,
population dynamics, neuroscience, ecology, and materials science. The training
and mentoring of research students and the development of math and science
instruction using novel pedagogical techniques all play a key role in the
investigator's program.
