Research will be done on the theory of elementary particles, and related areas
of cosmology and astrophysics. One focus of the work in particle theory will be
the theory of strings, in which the point particles of conventional particle
theories are replaced by extended objects having the form of tiny strings. The
research in cosmology may include such topics as the cosmological origin of the
baryon number, and that in astro- physics such topics as the study of
interaction of the magnetic monopoles with neutron stars. The research will be
carried out by a highly-distinguished young theoretical physicist who is one of
the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1987.
