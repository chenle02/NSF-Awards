This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Where do plants get their nitrogen?
Physiological and community consequences of variation in nitrogen sources." This
research conducted in Mexico and California focuses on the effect of nitrogen
sources on plant photosynthesis, growth, and community composition. One
component addresses the role of nitrogen fixation in explaining the high
abundance of legumes in lowland tropical forest. Another component focuses on
use of fog nitrogen by redwood forest under-story plants.
