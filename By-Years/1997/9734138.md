9734138 Barvinok The purpose of this project is to investigate applications of
higher-dimensional phenomena in Banach Geometry, such as measure concentration,
to optimization and algorithmic problems. The following particular problems will
be considered: efficient computation of mixed volumes, mixed discriminants, and
permanents of non-negative matrices, efficient approximate counting, and
approximation algorithms via semidefinite programming. The investigator will
also be creating new interdisciplinary courses in convexity and optimization.
The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early development of
academic faculty as both educators and researchers. The Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that provides for the
support of junior faculty within the context of their overall career
development. It combines in a single program the support of quality research and
education in the broadest sense and the full participation of those
traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering. This program enhances
and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development of full,
balanced academic careers.
