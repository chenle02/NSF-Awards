This award supports research by a group of applied and computational
mathematicians and biomedical engineers who will analyze, implement, and test
image reconstruction algorithms in the emerging fields of optical tomography and
optical molecular imaging. These imaging techniques are based on using photons
to probe tissues and deduce their optical properties and on using molecular
markers, which seek out changes inside cells that are precursors for disease
development, and emit radiation that is detectable outside the body.
Mathematically, we will analyze linear and non-linear inverse problems in
radiative transfer theory when only angularly averaged information is available
at the domain boundary. We will then devise and implement robust and accurate
algorithms that reconstruct optical properties of tissues and locations of
source terms from practically available measurements. We will develop fast image
reconstruction algorithms, based on analytic methods applicable in simple
geometries, and will test them using large data sets of experimental data from a
non-contact optical tomography system operated by the University of Pennsylvania
group.

This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the
interface of pure and applied mathematics, theoretical physics, and medicine in
order to attack mathematical problems in optical imaging of biological systems.
This research is at the forefront of efforts to achieve a molecular
understanding of both basic biological processes and disease states. The
investigators will combine their expertise in optical physics and the modeling
of the propagation of light in highly-scattering media, such as biological
tissue, with mathematical studies of inverse problems. The long term goal is to
understand the mathematical structure of inverse problems for the so-called
radiative transport equation, and to use this knowledge to develop
computationally efficient methods for image reconstruction in optical
tomography.
