This project is designed to improve the laboratory component of the ecology
course. New laboratory exercises have enhanced the course and the project itself
is allowing the inclusion of two laboratories on aquatic sampling techniques,
and a laboratory on primary productivity using a portable photosynthesis system.
Computer simulations are being conducted to run laboratories with students
working in teams, and videomicroscopy and video systems expose students to a
wide variety of sampling procedures and habitat analyses. It is also expected
that the project will significantly enhance other courses in ecology and
evolutionary biology at the institution.
