Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used for studies of the regulation of cell
division. The specific aims of the research focus on Clb2, one of a group of
cell cycle regulatory proteins known as cyclins. Cyclin Cl2b is important for
initiating mitosis, and previous work has shown that this protein localizes to
multiple sites within the cell, including the nucleus, mitotic spindle, spindle
pole bodies, bulk cytoplasm, and bud neck. This research aims to determine the
contributions of these various populations of Clb2 to proper cell division.
First, sequences within the Clb2 protein that are hypothesized to affect the
partitioning of Cl2b between the nucleus and the cytoplasm will be investigated,
and mutations in these sequences will be used to determine the effect of
diminishing the cytoplasmic population of the protein. The possible role of the
bud neck-localized population of Clb2 in regulating a known cell cycle signaling
pathway will also be examined. To further address the function of cytoplasmic
Clb2, a genetic screen will be performed to look for mutations that compromise
the viability of yeast cells that already contain a mutation that affects Clb2
localization. Finally, a collection of yeast strains in which single genes have
been deleted will be used to screen for genes that are important for localizing
Clb2 to its various sites in the cell. The genes that are identified will then
be analyzed for possible contributions to cell cycle regulation. This project
will provide research training for undergraduate students.
