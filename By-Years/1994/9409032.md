19409032 Fossan This is a collaborative project between David Fossan of the
State University of New York at Stony Brook and Richard Casten of Brookhaven
National Laboratory and Zhang Jingye of the Lanzhou Institute of Modern Physics,
Lanzhou, China. This project is sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy
of Sciences. Professor Zhang is a leading nuclear structure theorist active in
worldwide research at the Niels Bohr Institute of the University of Copenhagen
and the Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research at Oak Ridge. His visits with the
experimental groups at SUNY Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory will
focus on research aimed at understanding nuclear structure of transitional
nuclei. This research is focused on the leading edge of low-energy structure
studies. The key to this program is the effective interaction between the
experimental and the theoretical approaches to the understanding of these
research areas.
