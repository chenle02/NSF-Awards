9625795 Majda The investigator continues research on the theory and applications
of partial differential equations to problems in turbulence and atmosphere/ocean
science. He uses a combination of physical modelling, asymptotic methods,
stochastic techniques, rigorous mathematical theory, and large scale computing
to yield new insight into physical phenomena. This project studies specific
topics in two areas: 1) turbulent reaction diffusion equations, and 2) averaging
over fast, random, and statistical waves in geophysical flows. The work in area
1 involves the development of new stochastic, asymptotic, and computational
methods for studying scaling behavior in turbulent diffision and turbulent
reaction diffusion equations where the velocity fields have many spatio-temporal
scales. Potential applications to atmosphere/ocean science are described here,
including tracer scale up in the mesoscale and turbulent mixing in marine cloud
topped boundary layers. The work in area 2 involves four distinct topics
regarding geophysical flows: A) averaging over fast gravity waves and the
obstructions to balanced dynamics; B) statistical theories for large scale
coherent structure and the Antarctic circumpolar current; C) baroclinic
instability and geostrophic turbulence; D) parameterization of strong mesoscale
convection events in the tropics. The research in topics C) and D) involves
specific collaborations with atmosphere/ocean scientists at GFDL in Princeton
and at NCAR in Boulder. Behaviors of the atmosphere and ocean are complex and
not well understood. This project aims at a better understanding of atmosphere
and ocean flows. Such an understanding could lead to improved predictions of
weather, climate, and environmental phenomena.
