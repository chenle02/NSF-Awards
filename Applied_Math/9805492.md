Fauci 9805492 This project concerns the fluid dynamics of aquatic animal
locomotion, a field that encompasses the study of flagellar motility as well as
invertebrate swimming. The investigator and her colleages explore the coupling
of the internal force-generating mechanisms of the organisms with an external
viscous, incompressible fluid. A unified computational approach can be adapted
to model the internal axoneme mechanics of a beating cilium, the force-
generating internal flagella of spirochetes, as well as the coupling of active
and passive tissue properties to the swimming mechanics of a leech. In addition
to modeling the dynamics of a single organism, the collective hydrodynamic
interactions of groups of organisms and their environment can be examined. The
investigator has developed a mathematical model designed to study the coupled
mechanical system comprised of the fluid and the immersed organism. The
numerical method used is the immersed boundary method. The full incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations are solved in a domain of fluid within which neutrally-
buoyant organisms undergoing time-dependent movements are immersed. The salient
feature of this method is that the suspended organism is replaced by suitable
contributions to a force density term in the fluid dynamics equations. This
interdisciplinary project employs modern methods in scientific computing to
study important biological processes. The understanding of bacterial motility
and aggregation is of vital importance in bioremediation, the process by which
bacteria are used to degrade toxic chemicals. In addition, the study of the
internal mechanisms of cilia, flagella and spirochetes has applications in
medicine and biotechnology. The computational algorithms developed in this
project will be useful in studying other biofluiddynamic problems as well as
contributing to expertise in high performance computing.
