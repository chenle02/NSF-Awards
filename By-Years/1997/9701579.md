9701579 Xiao In this GOALI supported research program magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJ) will be prepared and studied with ultra-fast laser spectroscopy, near-
field optics, and magneto- tunneling. The purpose is to study the fundamental
and technological issues essential to the performance and competitiveness of the
MTJ. The proposed work is closely linked to activities at IBM Research, Yorktown
Heights. IBM will, where appropriate, pay for the support of students for work
done at IBM Research. This activity is jointly supported by DMR and the OMA
office of the MPS Directorate. %%% Magnetic tunnel junctions are devices which
are actively pursued by industry as the new memory and sensor elements such as
data storage reading heads and non-volatile magnetic random-access-memory (MRSM)
cells. The scientific issues include gaining a more complete understanding of
the magnetic behavior of these systems, especially while illuminated by light
and the effect of reducing the device size. The GOALI supported work links
expertise at the academic institution with activities at IBM Research, Yorktown
Heights. IBM will, where appropriate, pay for the support of students for work
done at IBM Research. This activity is jointly supported by DMR and the OMA
office of the MPS Directorate. ***
