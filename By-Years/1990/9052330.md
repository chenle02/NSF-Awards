The curriculum of the Chemistry Department has been strengthened by the
acquisition of an atomic absorption spectrometer in the following ways: (1)
students from several academic disciplines gain first-had knowledge of an
important analytical technique; (2) a critical assessment of the data obtained
is made part of the experiment; (3) new experiments have been implemented which
not only illustrate scientific principles but also relate to current problems of
the environment; and (4) experiments previously in use are done more
efficiently. The instrumentation is used by students in their second semester of
freshmen chemistry as well as Physical and Inorganic Chemistry, Instrumental
Methods of Analysis, and Undergraduate Research. The institution contributed to
this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
