9311605 Genack The aim of this proposal is to give a clear picture of the
transition from diffusive to localized propagation for microwave and optical
radiation. Using tunable single frequency sources, short pulses and
subwavelength spatial resolution, the key statistical characteristic of wave
propagation and the microscopic scattering parameters are determined in an
ensemble of random scatterers. Measurements are made of the scaling of the
probability distributions, correlation function and average value of the
intensity, transmission and conductance as well as time of flight distribution
of localized waves. The description of propagation is cast into a universal form
using appropriate combinations of scattering parameters, sample geometry and
boundary conditions. %%% Classical wave propagation is the vehicle for
communication and provides a measure for discovering the structure of
inhomogenous systems. Moreover, it serves as a model for electronic transport in
ultrasmall systems. The aim of this project is to find a universal description
of the transition from diffusive regime (random scattering from many centers,
like atoms and molecules) to a "localized" regime where the light is no longer
able to propagate through the medium. This is a subtle and complicated effect
that is known for electrons in the semiconductor world, but is just now being
explored for optical and mircrowave radiation propagating through macroscopic
media. The research has important implications for photonic materials
development and technological applications such as compact filters and switches.
