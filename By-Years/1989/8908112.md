Fertilization can dramatically alter the structure of herbaceous plant
communities, and the manipulation of soil fertility levels can offer insight
into the mechanisms of species coexistence in nature. This project will
experimentally test the interaction between competition and soil fertility in an
old- field community by manipulating both the presence of dominant species and
the level of soil resources. Experiments will consist of complete or partial
removals of the 2 dominant species, Dactylis glomerata and Solidago altissima,
alone together at low (control) and high (enriched) soil fertility levels. The
effect on species richness, diversity, and other community properties will be
followed. In complementary experiments, varying amounts of Dactylis seed will be
sown in a newly plowed field to test the effects on community development of the
initial presence and abundance of a dominant species. The study will be the
first attempt to investigate whether competition with the dominant species has a
different effect on community structure at high than at low soil resource
levels. The data from these experiments will test a number of major, previously
untested theories regarding the basis for coexistence among plants in natural
communities.
