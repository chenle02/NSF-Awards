This project will carry out the research needed to update a classic publication
entitled, Designing for Earthquakes, originally published in 1978. One of the
few technical documents that dealt with seismic design for members of the
architecture profession, this publication is now out of print. The new document
will improve vastly on the earlier publication by incorporating advances that
have been made in engineering knowledge and the development of the concept of
Performance Based Seismic Design. The absence of technical seismic design
information for architects has ignored the pivotal role they play in
communicating seismic resistant strategies to building owners and community
leaders. EERI will carry out the necessary research to gain a better
understanding of the current status and limitations of seismic design education
in university architecture and continuing education programs, identify the kinds
of information and training that architects need to better understand and design
for specific seismic performance levels, update the chapters of the 1978
publication, and finally, add several new chapters that reflect current
engineering research and topics that were not considered two decades ago. The
final publication will enable architects to play a significant role in designing
&lt;br/&gt;a safer society.&lt;br/&gt;
