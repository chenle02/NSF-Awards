Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies general properties of
mathematical structures. Work in model theory often answers questions in other
areas of mathematics. In the recent years there have been exciting new
developments in applications of model theory to combinatorics and analysis. This
project advances research on definable topological groups and their actions, and
also on combinatorial questions in the context of distal theories.

This research project builds upon the investigator's previous work on definable
group actions and combinatorial properties of theories without independence
properties. This project undertakes a systematic study of definable
compactifications of group actions, and extremal combinatorics in the not-
independence-property (NIP) setting. More specifically, the project studies
extremal combinatorics in distal theories and the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture for
graphs definable in NIP theories. The project will also investigate growth rates
of Ramsey functions in o-minimal and other tame theories, and will develop a
model theoretic framework for compactifications of continuous group actions, in
particular Riemannian symmetric spaces.
