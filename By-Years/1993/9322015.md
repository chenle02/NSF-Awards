Funding for the REU site within the Physics Department at Lehigh University will
be continued. The Department has a strong internationally recognized research
program which is fully integrated with a strong commitment to undergraduate
education; hence the department is exceptionally well suited to the demands of a
successful undergraduate research program. Such a program has in fact existed in
the Department for the past 13 summers. The Physics Department was designated an
REU site by the National Science Foundation in 1989 and from 1991-93. Since
1989, we have provided highly interactive research experiences for 100 physics
majors representing 57 undergraduate institutions. Generally, these are students
who would not otherwise have had the opportunity as undergraduates to
participate in real research. This program includes research, weekly seminars
and lab tours, an end-of-the-summer symposium, and various faculty/graduate
student/undergraduate student social functions. An effective group housing
arrangement, subsidized heavily by the University, has greatly enhanced both the
academic and social experiences of the participants.
