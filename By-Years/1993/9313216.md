9313216 Lee An integrated study of the dynamic electromagneto-thermo-mechanical
behavior of superconducting materials and structures will be performed. Using
the unified continuum-based approach, a mathematical formulation, which can
readily admit a finite element realization, will be developed for a fully
coupled analysis of dynamic field-structure interactions in superconductors. Two
physical experiments, the vibrating reed (VR) and ultrasonic measurements will
be conducted. The objective of the physical experiments is to validate the
proposed mathematical and numerical model, and to better understand the physics
of flux motion in bulk superconductors. ***
