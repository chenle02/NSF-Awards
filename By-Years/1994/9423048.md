In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Jan Laane of the Chemistry Department of Texas A&amp;M University will
pursue investigations in order to determine the vibrational potential energy
surfaces of excited electronic states. The experimental techniques to be
employed include fluorescence excitation spectroscopy, sensitized
phosphorescence spectroscopy, and two-photon spectroscopy of supersonic jet-
cooled molecules. The system species include cyclic and multicyclic molecules,
and those with internal rotations or inversions, including various carbonyl
compounds and `double molecules`, i.e., those with two closely lying electronic
states. Far infrared and Raman spectra will also be recorded in order to help
with the determination of the ground electronic state potential energy surface.
Molecular-level understanding of molecular properties and behavior depends upon
accurate knowledge of the potential energy surfaces of a molecule for its ground
and excited electronic states. The research conducted in this project will
furnish the requisite data and analyses toward this understanding.
