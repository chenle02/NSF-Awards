9401613 Bleiler The Cascade Topology Seminar will be held at a series of
universities in the Pacific Northwest on a semiannual basis over the three years
beginning in the fall of 1994. While topological topics will predominate, the
range will include geometry and analysis. The stated objectives are to provide
frequent contacts between workers in similar fields, to keep the area abreast of
recent developments by bringing in speakers from outside the area, to encourage
local graduate students and topologists to hear, consult, and possibly
collaborate with the outside speakers, and to provide an opportunity for local
people to lecture on their own work. Inclusion of graduate students will
continue to be a very important aspect of the sessions. ***
