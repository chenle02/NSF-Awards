This research proposal attempts to take advantage of the tremendous
biotechnological advancement of the past decade to increase the production of
the farm-raised fish by reducing their growth cycle from egg to market size.
BioPath attempts to develop an oral delivery system for recombinant salmon
growth hormone as an effective alternative to the current methods of parenteral
injections (ip or im) and bath immersion. This project deals with basic
biochemical and physiological determinants for the transport of intact protein
molecules from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract into the circulation,
specifically, this project is to examine factors that affect the lymphatic
uptake of an intact protein molecule from the GI tract, so the transport of
intact protein molecule can be enhanced. They can thus modify the protein
molecule accordingly. In this proposal, they propose to utilize the whole fish
gut instead of the second intestinal segment of an agastric fish (or its
equivalent of a gastric fish) for protein transport by modifying the protein
molecule in such a way that its absorption in the GI tract mimics the fat
absorption in fish.
