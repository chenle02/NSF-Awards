IBN: 9630813 PI: Sueoka The nervous system of higher organisms consists of
neurons and glial cells; the function of glial cells is to help neurons. These
two cell types are known to come from common, embryonic precursor cells (neural
stem cells). The differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons and glial
cells, therefore, is the critical process for the development of the nervous
system. In spite of the fundamental importance of stem cell differentiation, the
mechanisms underlying this differentiation (identification of the genes involved
and the functions of these genes) are not well understood. We have isolated and
characterized in detail a rat stem cell line that differentiates into neurons
and glial cells in culture. This system is ideal for molecular studies on the
neuronal-glial differentiation of neural stem cells. Using this system, we have
isolated several candidate gene fragments that may be critically important for
neural stem cell differentiation. Using these fragments, we plan to isolate and
characterize the genes and determine their functions in the development of the
nervous system. Among several gene fragments that are potentially important,
there is a particularly promising gene fragment which we are going to study
first. The gene corresponding to this fragment is expressed in the neuronal cell
line but not in the stem cell line. This fragment has a region with almost
identical DNA sequence to a control region of a Drosophila gene that is
essential for the development of the nervous system.
