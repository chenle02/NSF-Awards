Studies are being conducted which if successful will demonstrate the feasibility
of universities fabricating in a few hours their own low- cost prototype
multichip modules (MCM). MCMs represent a state-of-the- art microsystems
packaging technique, improving speed and power by factors of three or more.
Current industrial MCM fabrication costs are prohibitive in prototype quantities
to universities. The cost reduction and short turnaround time offered by this
novel concept along with other fast prototyping methodologies have the potential
to revolutionize microsystems design. The concept is to have standard pattern
substrates mass produced by industry at low cost. Each substrate would have
buried patterns of power and ground wiring, plus a buried level of signal
wiring. All buried wiring would have strategically placed paths called vias to a
surface layer. This surface layer would be a pattern of wiring including
connections to the vias which could be cut by the universities to customize for
a particular design. Pretested bare chips with solder bumps would be bonded to
the customized substrate to form the customized module. The concept is being
demonstrated by 1) designing, fabricating and testing the substrates and two
types of memory MCMs, 2) functional design only of two other complex modules.
