ABSTRACT We request funds to purchase a mass spectrometer for stable isotope
studies using 13C and lSN. The Europa 20/20 instrument combines a high precision
mass spectrometer with a gas chromatograph-thermal conductivity detector and
automated sample inlet system that permits analysis of 66 samples for both mass
and isotopic composition. The instrument would eliminate the use of 14C, a
radioactive isotope, for ongoing time-series measurements of primary production
and so free us from the high costs of disposal from a remote oceanic site. In
addition, it would permit concurrent analysis of both primary production and
nitrogen cycling. The new instrument would replace our current instrument for
15N analysis, an emission spectrometer, to provide increased sensitivity and
automated sample preparation. Savings would also accrue from measuring the
sample mass (carbon &amp; nitrogen) and isotope composition on a single sample
rather than from multiple samples and separate analyses as is currently
required. Our existing courses to train foreign scientists in established
methods for global change research would be modified to include instruction in
stable isotope techniques.
