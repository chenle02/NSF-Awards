In this project, the PI will continue the operation of an office, established in
1989, to coordinate the International World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)
Hydrographic Programme (WHP) and to provide quality control for all WOCE
Hydrographic data. Hydrographic data from WOCE cruises will be obtained from
individual PI's, submitted for quality control, archived, and submitted to the
WHP Special Assembly Center (SAC) in Hamburg, Germany. The director will oversee
a number of external data quality experts (DQE), from countries participating in
the WHP. Priorities will be determined in relation to terms of reference revised
at a meeting of the WHP Planning Committee in October, 1991.
