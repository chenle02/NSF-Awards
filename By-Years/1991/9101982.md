This proposal requests funds as part of the CEDAR initiative for capital
equipment for Jicamarca Radio Observatory in order to continue the upgrading of
the main incoherent scatter radar transmitter. Also this proposal requests
funding for the parts to finish the work on the third and fourth driver stages
for the transmitter and to buy the high power tube for the third final
stage.***//
