Proof-of-work (PoW) is an economic tool used to deter network attacks by
requiring participants to perform verifiable work, typically by solving
computational puzzles. Unfortunately, there is a significant barrier impeding
wide-spread applicability: PoW is expensive. This project aims to significantly
reduce the cost of PoW schemes, and thereby broaden their utility. Our general
model concerns a distributed system consisting of good and bad identifiers
(IDs). The good IDs have two goals: (1) ensure fair sharing of a limited
resource; and (2) securely perform distributed computations. The bad IDs are
controlled by an attacker who possesses a constant fraction of the computational
resources, and tries to subvert these goals. An important security objective is
to develop mechanisms that preserve these goals while incurring bandwidth and
computational costs that scale with the magnitude of an attack. That is, when
there is no attack, costs are low; conversely, when there is an attack, the good
IDs' cost grows commensurately with the attacker's cost.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the design of distributed
algorithms for: (i) tolerating large attacks while having good IDs spend
asymptotically less than the attacker; (ii) handling a setting where
participants are selfish but rational; and (iii) designing fast and robust
diffuse protocols via attack-resistant overlays with low state and bandwidth
costs. The project provides research experience for undergraduate and
underrepresented students, incorporates state-of-the-art results into course
development, and establishes a workshop venue for cybersecurity researchers to
share their findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
