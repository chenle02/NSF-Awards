This research is aimed at understanding pinning, dissipative phenomena and
magnetic stability in high temperature superconductors (HTSC's). This work
includes measurement of hysteretic response, magnetic relaxation and the
magnetic irreversibility line in single crystalline and polycrystalline HTSC's.
Magnetic properties will be correlated with microstructural features responsible
for pinning. Magnetic instabilities (flux jumps) will be explored in large high
quality single crystals.
