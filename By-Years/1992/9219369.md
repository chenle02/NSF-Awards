The PI will continue quantitative deformation experiments on carefully chosen
structural analogues of deep mantle phases and to perform parallel qualitative
deformation experiments on silicates of mantle composition. The analogue
experiments will be performed in Griggs-type apparatus at relatively low
pressures. The mantle silicate experiments will be performed at pressures of
14-25 GPa in a multianvil apparatus. Comparison of the deformation mechanisms
activated in the silicates with those activated in the analogues will provide
constraints on the reliability of extrapolation to mantle conditions of
measurements made on the analogues.
