Abstract

The overall goal of the proposed research, jointly proposed by Purdue University
and Michigan State University is to improve the production process planning and
facility layout design through a "Whole House and Building Process Redesign"
approach. The main objectives in support of the stated goal include, developing
an optimal production process model for manufactured housing that would resolve
the production bottlenecks identified through previous NSF-PATH research;
developing innovative design alternatives for factory layout; simulating the
facility layout alternatives based on the optimal process model to identify the
optimal facility layout(s); and investigating radical and innovative changes in
the production system and the house design itself that would integrate advanced
technology and innovative design into the production system and identify
progressive avenues for future research and advancements. The research results
will be developed as a continuing education program for the industry and will be
disseminated in conjunction with industry partners. The proposed research has a
direct focus on the 3rd milestone identified by the PATH technology road-map
"Whole House and building process redesign". Furthermore, if the broader
definition of the proposed research is taken into account then it will also
substantially affect the 1st milestone, i.e. application of information
technology in housing. This research would have a significant impact on both
criteria 1 and 2 through integration of research & education (criterion-1) and
in integrating diversity into the research process (criterion-2).
