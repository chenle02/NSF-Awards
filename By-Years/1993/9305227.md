The investigator and his colleague construct and explore a range of physics-
like models of computation, from chiefly conceptual to more application-
oriented. Ballistic models of computation, for example, suggest ways to exploit
atomic-scale effects for computer-logic operations. Fine-grained digital models
of processes traditionally described by continuum methods (e.g., fluid dynamics)
help in understanding what types of macroscopic behavior can be obtained from
given microscopic laws. Information Mechanics is the study of computation viewed
as a distinguished mode of operation of dynamical systems with a physics-like
structure. A main task for information mechanics is to develop theoretical
models of computation that more expressively and accurately reflect essential
aspects of the underlying physics (such as locality, invertibility, inertia,
quantum character), opening the way to more direct and efficient physical
implementations of computing processes. Results of this line of investigation
have a direct bearing on the theory and practice of computation and on the
computational modeling of physics. For example, logic invertibility is now being
exploited to reduce energy dissipation in computers; and lattice gases provide
theoretical models and simulation tools for a better understanding of complex
fluids.
