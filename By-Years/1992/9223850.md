High frequency electrodynamic measurements are used as sensitive probes of the
Meissner and mixed states of superconductors. Measurements of the surface
resistance and penetration depth at several frequencies in the MHz and GHz
ranges will be carried out as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The
results will be analyzed to extract information regarding the dynamics of the
condensate, quasiparticles and vortices, and will be compared with fundamental
models. The materials which will be studied are several of the high and low Tc
superconductors. The vortices will be paramaterized and the resulting
measurements will be used to test theories of vortex formation, melting, vortex
glass, and other thermodynamic states %%% This project explores the response of
high temperature superconductors to alternating electric and magnetic fields.
The results are expected to be important for both fundamental understanding and
for applications of superconducting devices at high frequencies.
