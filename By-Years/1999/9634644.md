This award is for the support of a workshop designed to objectively describe,
distribute and sample core and outcrop material recently recovered from the
Sirius Group deposit at Mt. Feather, Antarctica. The Mt. Feather deposit has
been extensively studied by other investigators and it is thought to be one of
the key sites that will help resolve the debate about the Pliocene glacial and
climatic history of Antarctica. Recently, a flurry of international meetings and
publications has seen criticism of the techniques, findings, and reproducibility
of data sets from investigations pertaining to this history. The material
sampled during this workshop will be distributed to investigators who have
registered interest in the project and results from this work will be published
in a communal report which will form the basis for a group publication on the
combined findings of all investigators. Separate concurrent publications will
include a description of the sample collection techniques and the geologic
setting of the deposit.
