Geometry is a basic area of human research, originating with our visual
awareness of the world; it is present implicitly or explicitly in every
scientific discipline. The discovery of symmetries and their usefulness is
arguably one the greatest achievements of human knowledge. Concretely, one of
the most effective ways of understanding and controlling geometric shapes is to
exploit their symmetries. The modern approach is to encode this information in
something we call the fundamental group. One goal of topologists and geometric
group theorists is to understand all possible fundamental groups, classify them,
and study their own intrinsic geometric properties. Classically, the most
studied geometric objects have been in low dimensions, particularly in dimension
two. This is called surface theory and is one of the focus areas of the proposed
projects. The principal investigator is also interested in taking the intuitions
that one gains from studying the fundamental groups of surfaces and
extrapolating them to more complex objects. This area is called geometric group
theory, an increasingly active subject within mathematics over the last few
decades.

The research projects address a broad spectrum of research problems in the
general areas of geometric group theory and Teichmuller theory, with
interactions with hyperbolic geometry, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics.
The specific topics include: (1) Growth tightness of group actions on metric
spaces. This notion was first introduced by Grigorchuk and de la Harpe for word
metrics and it has connections to the Hopfian property for groups and the Rank
Rigidity Conjecture. (2) Stable commutator lengths in right-angled Artin groups
and related groups. (3) The geometry of Teichmuller space equipped with the
Thurston metric.
