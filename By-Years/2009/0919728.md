Marine sponges are hosts to complex microbial communities that may comprise up
to 60% of the sponge biomass. Little is known about the roles of these symbiotic
bacteria and their contributions to the sponge and thereby indirectly to the
coral reef ecosystem in which the sponges live. The hypothesis driving the
project is that diverse assemblages of nitrogen-fixing bacteria play an
important role in providing sponges with nitrogen, taking nitrogen gas and
converting it to organic forms of nitrogen that can be used by sponges. The role
of bacterial symbionts of two sponges from Key Largo, Florida, Ircinia
strobilina and Mycale laxissima in nitrogen fixation will be determined. The
project will include biochemical approaches to demonstrate nitrogen fixation in
whole sponges and bacterial isolates, and molecular approaches to study the
pattern of where and when the nifH gene is turned on and makes the NifH protein,
a key protein in nitrogen fixation. Training will be provided in marine
microbiology to graduate students and undergraduate minority students will be
encouraged to enter careers in scientific research by participating in a summer
course in Marine Microbiology. The project will advance our understanding of
microbial diversity and function in complex sponge symbioses, promoting the
study of sponge symbioses as models of the complex symbiotic relationships found
between microbes and many higher organisms. The project will provide new
information on sources of nitrogen for fragile coral reef environments.
