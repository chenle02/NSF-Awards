Mogilner 9707750 Certain kinds of cellular movements are driven by actin
polymerization. The most conspicuous examples are the lamellipodia of spreading
and migrating embryonic and metastatic cells. A variety of pathogenic bacteria
also propel themselves by constructing behind them a polymerized tail of cross-
linked actin filaments. Collective cellular movements mediated by cell-cell
interactions can generate interesting spatial patterns. These patterns can shed
light on intercellular communication and can be used as novel assays for
understanding the molecular mechanisms of cell signaling. The goal of this
research is to understand at the molecular level (i) the mechanochemical basis
of force generation by polymerizing and depolymerizing actin networks, (ii) the
mechanisms of spatio-angular cytoskeletal organization, (iii) patterns of
collective cell motion. The investigator and his colleagues formulate a
mechanochemical theory of how the thermal fluctuations of the filament tips and
the membrane can be rectified by actin polymerization to generate a propulsive
force. This force is controlled by soluble and transmembrane proteins that
stimulate actin polymerization. The investigators also formulate a theory for
retrograde flow of lamellar cytoplasm. This theory is based on two sources of
contractile force: (i) the contraction of the actin gel that must accompany
depolymerization, and (ii) actin filament contraction driven by myosin. The
results of these models determine the relative roles of actin polymerization and
myosin crosslinking and contraction during cell locomotion. These studies help
forge a link between the basic biophysics of cell motility and the chemical
control of cell motion. The crawling of cells over surfaces is the basis for the
vitally important phenomena of phagocytosis and the migration of metastatic
cells. Despite the ubiquity of cellular motions, the molecular mechanisms
underlying these movements remain mysterious. The investigators undertake
theoretical modeling that provides a solid quantitative basis for understanding
the detailed working cycle of the cell's molecular engines. This description
provides a new interdisciplinary level of understanding cell movements and new
methods of predicting cell behavior in medically and technologically important
situations.
