This program is designed to investigate the possibility of synthesizing a new
class of materials (known as transition metal complexes, with a structure called
zeolitic structure) for rapid absorption and desorption of gases. It is proposed
to use these new materials for selectively absorbing oxygen from air so that the
oxygen can be desorbed subsequently to provide a source of highly pure oxygen.
The presently-available devices absorb nitrogen from air to produce a left-over
gas stream with predominant oxygen content. However, this leads to impure
oxygen, with a substantial amount of argon, carbon dioxide and moisture.
Successful completion of the proposed work promises to provide an economic
source of pure oxygen for medical use and for welding and metal cutting.
Additional applications are also possible. The PI, Dr. Neil Hendricks, ahs very
good training in the background areas needed for this work, and his employer,
Maxdem Inc., has good facilities for conducting this Phase I work under the
Small Business Innovation Research Program. An award for $40,000 for six months
is recommended.
