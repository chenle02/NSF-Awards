9320520 Chang This proposal is designed to study the mechanism of buckytubes and
buckybundies nucleation and growth in a controlled DC arc discharge. A model
will be developed to explain the physical mechanisms. In addition, properties of
buckytubes and monolayer buckytubes will be characterized and studied. A new arc
system will be designed and constructed especially for this program. ***
