This project involves a cooperative effort between Purdue University, the major
institution, and the University of Washington and Stephens Institute of
Technology. It proposes to provide greater access for women to careers in
engineering, while counteracting projected shortages of engineering personnel by
assisting and encouraging engineering schools throughout the United States to
establish innovative programs for women in engineering or to expand the scope of
existing programs. Specifically, this program would: (1) organize a national
conference to study issues and present models of programs for women in
engineering; (2) establish the first national network of Women in Engineering
Program Administrators; (3) provide technical and technical programmatic
assistance to institutions desiring to initiate, replicate, or expand Women in
Engineering programs in a cost-effective manner; (4) establish a central source
of research, information, and resource materials about women in engineering and
related areas; and (5) disseminate information nationally through conferences
and publications. The heart of the proposal begins with items (1) and (2)-the
holding of the national conference and the establishment of the national
network. In this regard, the three institutions, Purdue, Washington, and
Stephens, will have key administrators participating and coordinating - Purdue,
the entire program, Washington, the western region and Stephens, the eastern
region. A time table has been developed and the conference will be held in
October, two months after the planning sessions both years. Subsequently, annual
conferences and continued upgrading of the directories might be possible.
Because of the work of Dr. Daniels at Purdue, the network is fairly well in
hand, and definitive were given for its strengthening, collecting and
dissemination of information. The project will provide a very meaningful source
of information, and to the extent that the network is successful, it should
provide a very useful conduit for women to know about, recognize, and enter
careers in engineering. Financial support will come from eight sources: the
threee sponsoring institutions, various engineering organizations, the
conference participants, industry, the AAAS, and hopefully, the National Science
Foundation.
