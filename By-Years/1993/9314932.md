9314992 Zworski This award supports a two-year collaborative research project
and joint seminar between Professor Maciej Zworski, Department of Mathematics,
Johns Hopkins University, and Professor Mitsuru Ikawa, Department of
Mathematics, Osaka University. The project focuses on various areas of
scattering theory and wave propagation. It involves a series of long and short
term visits by U.S. and Japanese researchers to Johns Hopkins University and
culminates in a bilateral seminar. This project is part of the activities of the
Japan- U.S. Mathematics Institute (JAMI) of the Johns Hopkins University. During
the course of the project, U.S. and Japanese researchers with diverse
perspectives will be brought together to discuss the following topics:
resonances in various settings, ranging from N-body scattering to spectral
theory of automorphic forms; inverse scattering; nonlinear wave equations: long
time existence, formation of shocks, regularity of bounded solutions, stability
under non-linear perturbation. The project is also being supported by the
Geometric Analysis Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences, NSF. ***
