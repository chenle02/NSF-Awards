This is an application for partial funding of the Fungal Genetics Conference
which will be held from March 31 to April 4, 1991 at the Asilomar Conference
Grounds in Pacific Grove, California, under the auspices of the National Fungal
Genetics Policy Committee. The conference is expected to draw between 300 and
350 participants and will focus, through eight scientific sessions, on the
forefront of research into the genetics, molecular genetics, and molecular
biology of the filamentous fungi. Twenty-three speakers have been invited to
speak on their research and approximately twice this many will be chosen for
shorter presentations at a time closer to the conference. All seven session
chairpersons, and all invited speakers have been confirmed. Special effort has
been made both to identify younger scientists whose efforts warrant exposure,
and to encourage participation in the conference by students. At the time of the
meeting, all participants will be encourage to participate in one of three
poster sessions.
