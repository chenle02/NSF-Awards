This project will test ideas about the effects of individual plant species and
lifeforms on ecosystem function in the central grassland region. The focus will
be on the influence of species and lifeforms on soil resource availability using
three levels of investigation: process studies at the Central Plains
Experimental Range, site comparisons across a regional gradient, and simulation
analyses. Process studies will focus on elucidating the relationships among
plant litter chemistry, biomass allocation, soil organic matter and nutrient
supply. A comparative study across a regional gradient will test the extent to
which environmental controls may mitigate or increase the importance of species
characteristics. Finally, the investigators will conduct simulation analyses to
evaluate the potential influence of changing species composition over time at
several sites that cross the regional gradient; this simulation will test the
long-term consequences of patterns observed in the field.
