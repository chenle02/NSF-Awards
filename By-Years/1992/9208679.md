This grant will support the second annual West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar to
be held at the University of Nevada on October 24-25, 1992. The general area of
mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert
space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of
complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put together in an
algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract objects have a
surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key role in knot
theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and
they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming
increasingly important in physics.
