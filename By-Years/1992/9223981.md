Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) requests funding to purchase
shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments
will be used aboard the research vessels operated by WHOI, including the KNORR,
OCEANUS, and ATLANTIS II. All of the instruments are for shared-use by a wide
variety of scientists.
