The Kentucky EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Award will enhance
research and education in two broad priority areas -- biological and
environmental research - at the University of Kentucky, the University of
Louisville, and Murray State University. In biology, Kentucky EPSCoR will
provide facilities and faculty in functional genomics, cellular and molecular
proteomics, biomedical nano- and micro-electro-mechanical systems, and
structural biology. In environmental research, Kentucky EPSCoR will set up
facilities for the new Kentucky Environmental Research and Education Consortium
(KEREC) at the University of Kentucky and Murray State University. The
overarching goal of KEREC is to improve the quality, scope, and national
competitiveness of Kentucky's environmental research programs by provision of
faculty, staff, and laboratories. The facilities will include the Environmental
Research and Training Laboratories housed within the College of Engineering and
the University of Kentucky and the Center for Watershed Environments at Murray
State University. Research in biological and environmental research is vital to
the economy of both Kentucky and the nation. Each priority area has critical
implications for human health, agriculture, and knowledge-based industry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education and human resource programs will be augmented
through undergraduate training. A statewide fellowship program for minorities
and underrepresented groups will be continued and augmented. A minority pipeline
program for including faculty and undergraduate students from HBCUs and other
regional universities in Kentucky's research programs will be extended to HBCUs
beyond Kentucky. Predominately undergraduate institutions of the state will
benefit from the Infrastructure Enhancement Program, which supports research and
education outside of the major research universities.&lt;br/&gt;
