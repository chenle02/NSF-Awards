This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though on-line prediction markets
have attracted significant interest from scholars and increasing application in
corporate environments, little work has been done to apply these markets to
critical issues in science and technology. This project will explore the
application of prediction markets to an emerging field of science - synthetic
biology - where a better understanding of future development and directions
could be of significant value to funders, policymakers, and
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of this project, a set of
scholars involved in the social science of prediction markets will collaborate
to create a set of experimental markets appropriate to synthetic biology. The
markets will be configured such that comparisons across manipulations will yield
insight into the boundary conditions in which such markets could yield
meaningful forecasts for leading-edge science. Topics to be explored include
incentives, time frames, question framing and participants. The project will
also help build a community of researchers interested in exploring and improving
the application of prediction markets to areas of emerging science.
