This program is aimed at development of a novel method of controlling N2O
emissions from fluidized bed coal combustors, involving injection of sodium
vapor at very low levels into the flue gas leaving the fluidized bed. The
objectives of the Phase I effort are: (1) Demonstrate that sodium injection can
cause substantially complete decomposition of N2O at conditions relevant to
coal-fired fluid bed combustors; (2) Obtain chemical kinetic data for comparison
with predictions of kinetic calculations; and, (3) Complete that comparison.
Laboratory experiments will be carried out in a system consisting of four
subsystems, a system for blending fixed gases and vaporized liquids, a sodium
vaporizer, a reactor, and an analytical train. The reactor to be employed
consists of a quartz tube into which a length of steel tubing projects, with the
main flow gas going through the resulting annular space and the nitrogen-sodium
mixture through the steel tubing. The analytical system will be centered around
an NDIR instrument for N2O, with the analytical train also including a CO
analyzer, a Pulsed Fluorescent SO2 analyzer, and a Chemiluminescent NOx
analyzer. Successful completion of the Phase I studies will provide a lab-scale
demonstration of the process and provide a clear understanding of the chemistry
involved. Considerable effort has been expended on development of fluid bed
combustion technology for burning of coal with low SOx and NOx emissions.
Unfortunately, this technology approach leads to production of copious amounts
of N2O emissions, an unacceptably serious drawback since N2O is both a
greenhouse gas and a major contributor to depletion of the ozone layer.
Accordingly, development of a means of dealing with this problem is of major
importance to the viability of fluidized bed combustors for burning of coal.
