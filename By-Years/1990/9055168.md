The Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute will initiate a
three-week, residential Young Scholars project in Agricultural Science for 36
students entering grades 8,9. Project activities include enrichment activities
focusing on the potential of agricultural careers; opportunities to participate
in laboratory and field experiences with a practicing scientist serving as a
mentor; a conference where students will present their findings and discuss the
ethical implications of the project; career exploration activities designed to
build confidence in the decision-making process; and a follow-up project
involving the Young Scholar's sponsoring science teacher and class.
