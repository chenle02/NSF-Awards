The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) will introduce a
free pilot webinar series in Astronomy, conducted exclusively in Spanish,
targeting Hispanic/Latino audiences in the USA and beyond. The webinars will
feature successful scholars from the professional astronomical community. The
focus of the presentations will be aspects of recent developments in astronomy
and space science, introducing scientific data and data analysis techniques and
providing avenues for research using citizen science data. By making
astronomical content available to Spanish-speaking audiences, the program will
promote broader involvement in citizen science (through the AAVSO’s existing on-
line portals) and encourage the entry of young members of this underrepresented
group into STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astronomy has always triggered
human imagination and is considered a gateway to increase familiarity with
scientific terms, build an understanding of data acquisition and analysis
techniques, bring the public closer with scientists, and foster trust and
positive relationships with science. The webinar series aims to introduce basic
science concepts, provide opportunities for casual discussions and interactions
between presenters and participants, introduce strong positive role models, and
increase trust in the scientific method among members of minority
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
