This project continues investigation of the complexity of differential and
integral equations. New problems to be studied include the following: (1)
Problems with singular data. Special attention is paid to problems on domains
having corner singularities, whose coefficient data has known singularities, and
problems for which the forcing function has a singularity of a given type. (2)
Exterior problems. The research concentrates on the Helmholtz problem on
exterior domains, which arise in scattering theory. (3) Further work on mixed
derivative spaces. The research concentrates on problems, as well as the
possible optimality of finite element methods. (4) Stochastic differential
equations. These problems arise in many areas, such as science, engineering, and
finance. Nothing is known about their complexity. The complexity of optimal
algorithms for such problems is being studied.
