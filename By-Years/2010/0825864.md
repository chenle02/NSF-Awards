This project is to develop a nonintrusive carbon nanotube integrated sensing
system for driver detection. The main requirements of this sensing system are
high sensitivity, fast response, low power consumption, low cost, and high
reliability in operation. This project will investigate fundamental scientific
problems associated with applying nanomaterials based sensors to human
physiological sensing in dynamic human-machine interactions. The case study will
be carried out to target one important application: the driver-vehicle systems.
In particular, driver?s gripping force and level of alcohol content will be
measured non-intrusively and in real-time manner. This project will conduct
experiments to validate the proposed technologies in both a virtual environment
and a realistic driver-vehicle system, which are available in the PI?s
Intelligent Human-Machine Systems Laboratory at Northeastern University.
&lt;br/&gt;In parallel with the proposed research, novel developments and
knowledge in sensing technologies for human physiology will be added to the area
of human factors curriculum training program on campus. The education plan
includes a variety of trainees, graduate, undergraduate, high school students,
and the general public, including specially the under-represented groups.
