This is a project in commutative algebra, which, roughly speaking, is the study
of systems of polynomials equations. Polynomial equations, and the geometric
objects that that these equations describe, are fundamental, both in pure and
applied mathematics, but also in computer science, physics, biology, and
chemistry. The project will study the nature of such systems of equations, with
an emphasis on understanding the subtle ways in which they can fail to be
smooth, or regular. The principal investigator will continue to mentor students
that are underrepresented in the mathematical
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the project team will study the
singularities of algebraic varieties. The research seeks to draw, and
strengthen, connections among many areas of mathematics, including prime
characteristic commutative algebra, classical singularity theory, birational
algebraic geometry, polyhedral geometry, and the theory of differential
operators. This project places an emphasis on polynomial equations that lie in
general position, as well as on explicit computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program (ANT) and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
