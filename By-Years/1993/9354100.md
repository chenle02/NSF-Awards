9354100 Miller The Wisconsin Emerging Scholars (WES) program is a workshop-based
calculus program that will be offered at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for
the first time in the Fall, 1993. The program, designed to attract and serve
predominantly ethnic minority and rural students, is modeled after the
procedures developed by Uri Treisman at the University of California--Berkley
and more recently, at the University of Texas--Austin. Evaluation of performance
by tow sections of a calculus course will be done in a formative fashion that
should help to generate a model of the Treisman process. Dissemination of the
results will be done by a series of audio workshops that highlight the findings
in an interview format.***
