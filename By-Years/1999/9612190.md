9612190 Murphey This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
cooperative research project between the University of Michigan-Dearborn and
Ford will provide new ways to do end of line test and fault identification in
automobile manufacture. Vacuum leaks, transmission shift, idle quality and axle
ratio are the variables that the diagnostic system will consider, with the
constraints that diagnostic methods must use existing sensors and be executed
quickly. The technical approach will use a distributed architecture with
diagnostic agents for each potential fault. A central agent will evaluate the
results from each diagnostic agent, taking into account interactions between
faults. The decision making and classification approach uses fuzzy logic, with
membership functions based on engineering heuristics, the easy-out rules
applicable for the majority of vehicles, and complex fuzzy rules to refine and
identify the specific faults. Implementation and testing will use real data
provide by Ford to the University of Michigan-Dearborn, then move to a test cell
at Ford, finally migrating to plant operation. The strength of this proposal is
the significant industry commitment and participation, and the potential to
bridge a technical gap between fuzzy systems and neural networks by focusing on
this important diagnostic problem. The architecture of distributed agent based
fuzzy systems for diagnostics can be transferred to other applications,
improving quality and reliability of manufactured products.
