9321608 Heckel Funding is for two separate experiments. The first is an
experiment to measure the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron using
ultracold neutrons stored in a bottle. A non-zero neutron EDM would be evidence
for a breakdown of both Time Reversal (T) and Parity (P) symmetries. Limits on
the neutron EDM are crucial for determining which theoretical explanations for T
symmetry violation are correct. The goal of the second experiment is to measure
the P violating weak interaction between neutrons and helium nuclei. This
information complements other measurements and will help fully parameterized the
low energy nucleon-nucleon weak interaction to provide a test of a standard
eletroweak theory. We plan to measure the weak-interaction induced rotation of
the polarization vector of a transversely polarized cold neutron beam on
propagation through 50 cm of liquid helium. The effect, expected to be of order
10-7 radians, represents an unprecedented experimental sensitivity.
