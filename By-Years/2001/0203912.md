Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Programming
Entertainment Robots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make humanoid robots a viable
alternative for small scale entertainment applications, easier ways of
programming them are needed. They must have a natural and entertaining style of
motion and often require substantial motion databases to ensure a sufficient
variety of behaviors. One potential solution to this problem is to use human
motion data as the source of joint trajectories. Automatic techniques for human
motion data use would provide the variety of motion that is required for
compelling robotic performances. The postdoctoral associate will develop
techniques that will allow human motion data to be used to control a wide
variety of humanoid and entertainment robots and simulations. This project will
involve significant experimentation both in the development of optimization
techniques and in the construction and control of physical robots. The research
will combine the expertise of the postdoctoral associate in dynamics, planning
and motion filtering with the principal investigator's experience in simulation,
control systems for human motion, and processing motion capture
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
