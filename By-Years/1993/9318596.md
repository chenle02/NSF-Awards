Abstract 9318596 Inan This project will study the effect on the ionosphere and
upper atmosphere of electrons precipitated from the magnetosphere by
electromagnetic radiation originating in thunderstorms. The phase and amplitude
of very low frequency (VLF) signals broadcast by a number of transmitters
located at various positions around the world are perturbed by the precipitating
electrons. The perturbations will be detected by VLF receivers located at Palmer
Station, the British Antarctic Survey's Rothera Base and the Brazilian station
on King George Island. The project is a cooperative effort of the Antarctic
programs of United States, Brazil and the United Kingdom. For many years
Stanford University has been a leader in the study of VLF phenomena in the near
Earth space environment. ***
