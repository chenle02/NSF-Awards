Commodity subsectors are social networks of human and non-human actors organized
around a given commodity. They are a type of vehicle for transforming a
commodity, and social relations and nature surrounding that commodity. This
dissertation research is designed to improve our understanding of how a given
subsector creates and maintains uniformity in a commodity through technical
change. It uses the case of the rapeseed subsector in the People's Republic of
China (PRC) since 1949 as an example. Each human actor in the subsector defines
uniformity differently. Thus, technical changes for creating uniformity in a
commodity reveal negotiations among conflicting interests in and values for that
commodity in a subsector. The project follows rapeseed from production to
consumption by using two complementary methods: (l) historical studies of the
subsector and (2) interviews with participants. This award allows the
dissertation student to undertake the documentary and field work research in the
PRC needed to understand how the actors involved have negotiated the social and
technical directions of rapeseed innovation.
