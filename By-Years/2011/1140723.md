Geometric methods play a central role in dynamical systems and its applications.
To showcase recent theoretical breakthroughs and to outline challenges and
opportunities for applications, in particular in areas in which dynamical
systems have not been utilized much, a conference on geometric methods in
infinite-dimensional dynamical systems will be held November 4-6, 2011, at Brown
University. The conference will be centered around four mathematical themes:
data assimilation, geometric singular perturbation theory, nonlinear optics, and
traveling waves. There will be around 15 long and 10 short talks. Several of the
longer talks and at least half of the short talks will be given by younger
participants. A poster session will give other younger participants the
opportunity to present their results, and a future-directions panel discussion
will feature a broad-scale discussion of the challenging theoretical questions
and applied problems involving infinite-dimensional dynamical
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric methods are essential for the
development of mathematical tools and for applications in areas such as
oceanography, data assimilation, neuroscience, nonlinear optics, and pattern
formation. At present, new geometric methods are being developed to expand our
knowledge of multi-dimensional waves, pulses propagating in structured media,
the dynamics of defects and other localized patterns, and in the dynamics on
neuron populations. Another emerging challenge to dynamical systems theory is to
develop mathematical techniques for data assimilation, which is used in weather
forecasts and climate research. By advertising these opportunities to younger
and senior participants alike, this conference could stimulate additional
research in this field and its applications.
