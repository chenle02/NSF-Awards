Present Massively Parallel Computers (MPCs) have been used as stand alone
single user systems with a batch job interface. However, the next generation
will be sufficiently powerful that time shared control systems will be required
to support multiple users and minimize loss of CPU cycles. For MPCs with
Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) architectures, the dynamics scheduling
of clusters of CPUs can allow effective use without idling CPUs from lack of
work. A dynamic job mix control system will be developed which will optimize job
throughput by maximizing the number of CPUs assigned to jobs.
