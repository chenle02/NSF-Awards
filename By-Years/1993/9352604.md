9352604 Rios The project will purchase an FT-IR for use in development of new
laboratory experiments. The instrument will provide undergraduate chemistry and
biology students with the highest level of scientific research training. The
purpose of the proposed project is to enhance the undergraduate science
instruction at Turabo University (UT) by improving the existing chemistry
curriculum. These improvements in experimental course content, will provide
science and engineering students with a deeper understanding of theoretical
concepts and with an up-to- date preparation for graduate school or employment.
The instrument we are requesting will also provide professors and students with
much needed research experience using sophisticated instruments. ***
