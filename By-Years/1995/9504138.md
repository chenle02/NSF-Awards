Ontological Hierarchy for Spatial Knowledge Spatial knowledge is an important
and ubiquitous kind of commonsense knowledge. it also raises a critical issue
facing computational models of mind: the relationship between behavior in the
continuous world and inference with discrete symbolic representations. in this
project, a hierarchy of representations for spatial knowledge called the Spatial
Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) developed in a previous NSF grant is being formalized
so that it can be more widely useful. The formalization will clarify precisely
when and how different descriptive ontologies and inference methods can interact
effectively. It will also identify the minimal preconditions on sensors,
effectors, and environment required for the spatial model to apply and identify
the minimal set of targets for machine learning and discovery required to learn
an instance of the hierarchical spatial model from experience. It will be
evaluated both mathematically and experimentally on simulated and physical
robots. The results should be theoretically important to the foundations of
artificial intelligence and practically important to intelligent robotics
applications.
