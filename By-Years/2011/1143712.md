This project performs comparative research in the United States and Japan on
cultural models of social behavior and technology that influence how users
perceive, make sense of, and interact with social robots. Social robots are
designed to engage and communicate with people using socially appropriate
behaviors, cues, norms, and roles. We (1) develop a comparative framework to
study how users of social robots understand, apply, and react to cultural models
of sociality and technology, as expressed in the material and discursive framing
of robots, in the US and Japan, and (2) establish the foundation for long-term
research collaboration on cross-cultural studies of robotics between Dr. Selma
Sabanovic at Indiana University Bloomington (IUB), Dr. Takanori Shibata at the
National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in
Tsukuba, and Dr. Kazuyoshi Wada at Tokyo Metropolitan University (TMU) in
Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project produces guidelines for best practices
for using social robots in the US and Japan; this is particularly timely for
Paro, which is commercially available in both countries. We also strengthen
existing and build new collaborations with individuals and institutions in
Japan. The project impacts education through the exchange of students and month-
long internships and provides educational experiences for a broader audience,
including other students, users, and relevant stakeholders through open houses
and presentations by participating institutions.
