Pronouns like 'he' and 'she' are among the most frequently used words in
English. Yet neither a dictionary nor a grammar book will satisfy a learner of
English as a second language who is trying to understand their full meaning and
use. Pronouns often occur in contexts that contain more than one possible
referent. Native speakers accumulate knowledge of patterns in the language that
shift the interpretive preference one way or another. One such pattern involves
the nature of the event being described: for example, a pronoun is more likely
to refer to the doer of the last-mentioned action when that action is
incomplete. Another pattern involves prosody, that is, what parts of a sentence
receive emphasis. Native speakers deftly integrate such information to
unconsciously anticipate how a conversation is going to continue, building
expectations about who will be referred to next even before a name or pronoun is
heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how Japanese- and Korean-
speaking learners of English interpret pronouns, asking specifically whether
their interpretation is affected by patterns of event structure and prosody.
Early evidence indicates that even when learners have advanced knowledge of
English grammar, they may have a reduced ability to generate expectations during
language comprehension, resulting in interpretation of pronouns different from
that of native speakers. Five experiments will examine how native speakers
versus learners continue written and spoken stories with pronouns, and how their
eye fixations reveal, in a fraction of a second, which person in a story they
think is most likely to be referred to next. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are
more second language users of English worldwide than there are native speakers
as a first language. Understanding the nature of their language comprehension
has the potential to improve strategies for successful communication, language
teaching techniques, and our general understanding of how the human mind
functions.
