Southern University requests support from NSF for connection of their campus
network to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern
United States. It will provide operations management and information services
and it will give Southern University a 1.5 million bits per second connection to
the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The University needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to collaborate with peers at other schools on common projects. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity
for the school to explore innovative educational resources.***//
