Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Department is integrating an
environmentally-based service-learning laboratory into the first-year chemistry
course in order to motivate student learning, enhance connections throughout the
curriculum, and promote science, mathematics, and engineering within the local
community. Students in the first-year chemistry laboratory gain experience
dealing with real-world samples, make and test hypotheses based upon statistical
evaluation of data they have collected, generate case-study data for
consideration in subsequent common core classes, work effectively in teams,
explore connections between public policy and environmental chemistry in the
wider community, and communicate their results to both technical and non-
technical audiences through oral or written reports. Students in our first-year
chemistry course plan, sample, and test for lead in soils from vehicle emissions
throughout the community. In the process they will collaborate with students in
a probability and statistics course, students at a local elementary school, and
the California Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. The data collected
in this project will be revisited by students a year later in a mathematics
course in probability and statistics, allowing them to undertake more
sophisticated analyses. The laboratory is modeled after the service-learning
general chemistry projects at Loyola University of Chicago, the University of
Utah, and Kalamazoo College which employ atomic absorption spectroscopy to test
for lead in the local community.
