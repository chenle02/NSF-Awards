The Department of Mathematics and Statistics is strengthening the undergraduate
program in mathematics by providing students with the technological tools
necessary to solve complex and realistic problems. Faculty efforts focus on five
key courses: multivariate calculus, linear algebra, mathematical statistics,
numerical analysis, and the undergraduate research project in mathematics. These
courses are using Maple, MATLAB, and SPSS with the goal of helping students to
develop a qtrong conceptual understanding of mathematical ideas, the ability to
apply mathematical ideas in meaningful and complex contexts, and the ability to
clearly communicate mathematical ideas orally and in writing. This project is
establishing a computer classroom dedicated solely to mathematics and statistics
instruction. The classroom consists of 20 computers networked to a server and
connected to the World Wide Web. The addition of this facility is making
possible the implementation of a technology-intensive mathematics program. The
department has previously used the computer facilities to pilot sections of
multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and numerical analysis. The revised
mathematical statistics course is drawing from faculty experiences teaching
elementary statistics in a computer laboratory. Half of the mathematics majors
in the department are preparing to become secondary mathematics teachers. The
program impacts these students in two direct ways: (a) by increasing the
emphasis on modern technology, the mathematical and technical skills of future
teachers are improving and (b) by actively involving students in their own
learning, the future teachers are preparing the implement NCTM standards that
emphasize appropriate use of technology throughout the curriculum.
