Every two years, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference brings
together leading members of the scientific community, graduate students, and
postdocs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects in marine chemistry
within an informal setting. The National Science Foundation, along with the
Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of at least 15
graduate students/postdocs and 31 invited speakers/discussion leaders/chairs to
the 2015 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research
Conference will be held July 26-31, 2015 at the Holderness School in Holderness,
New Hampshire. The theme for the conference will be " Processes at Interfaces:
Bridging Spatial, Temporal and Disciplinary Divides from Micro- to Global Scales
" with the aims to highlight new approaches available in the field of chemical
oceanography to address cutting edge questions on this theme. The primary goal
of the conference is to provide a forum that brings together scientists that are
leading contributors in the field of marine chemistry along with graduate
students and postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative research.
Presentations and discussions at the 2015 Gordon Conference will center around
the following session topics: (1) Processes and Cycling at the Land-Sea
Interface; (2) Microbe-Organic Matter Interactions and Transformations; (3)
Biogeochemical Cycling at the Seabed-Water Column Interface; (4) Phosphorus: The
Interface Between Geochemistry, Biology and Geology; (5) Biogeochemical
Processes in Oxygen Deficient Environments: Metal, Sulfur and Nitrogen Cycling;
(6) Reactions and Fluxes at the Air-Sea Interface; (7) Nutrient-Trace Metal
Interactions: Cycling at the Particle-Seawater Interface; (8) Biogeochemistry at
Deep-Sea Vents: Thermal and Redox Transition Zones; and (9) The Ocean?s Role in
Climate Change. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become
recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary
field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances.
