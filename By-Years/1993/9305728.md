9305728 Kuzyk This proposal seeks partial funding for an international
conference on the topic of organic nonlinear optics with meeting headquarters at
Val Thorens, France. NSF funds are requested for travel support of U.S. invited
speakers and Ph.D. students. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together top
researchers-whose expertise spans material design, material characterization,
device fabrication, and integrated device architectures-to the intimate setting
of a small mountain town to discuss and assess progress in the field. This
upcoming conference is motivated by a small NSF-supported conference that was
held in Pullman, Washington in the summer of 1992. At the demand of workers in
the field who feel that such a small forum is lacking, a future series of such
conferences are planned in 18 to 24 month intervals and will be held in those
countries that are active in this field. ***
