9652618 Harmon Carbon Accumulation, Storage, and Release by Woody Detritus in
the Forests of Russia Recent analyses of the global carbon cycle indicate that a
major pathway for removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere must exist in
the Northern Hemisphere. A major unknown for this removal term is the amount
being removed by the forests of Russia which comprise over 50% of boreal forests
worldwide. This project addresses this major unknown in the global carbon
budget. Two interrelated studies will be carried out. The first study quantifies
and summarizes the woody biomass of these forests throughout Russia using an
extensive existing data base. The second study measures the rates of woody
detritus decomposition in these forests. The research assesses the size and flux
of carbon in a major forest region of the world. These data will help reduce the
uncertainty in a major component of the global carbon budget.
