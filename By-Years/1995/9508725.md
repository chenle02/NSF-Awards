9508725 Wierman The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
mathematical sciences. The University-Based Graduate Research Assistantships
provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend part of their time in the
classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting. These awards are a
means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the
nation. One important function of the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is to estimate the number of
people who die each year from smoking, or smoking attributable mortality (SAM).
SAM is a function of the attributable fraction (AF) associated with smoking and
the total number of deaths. The attributable fraction, in turn, is a function of
the relative risk (RR) associated with smoking and smoking prevalence. One of
the relevant methodological issues in estimating SAM is how to properly adjust
the SAM for confounding factors such as age, sex, race, occupation, etc.
Methodology does not yet exist for adjusting the SAM when the SAM is estimated
using two independent data sources. One aspect of this research is to study a
quasi-likelihood based method of estimation. Another area of research will be a
study of the relationship between exposure to acrylontrile and cause-specific
mortality, particularly cancers of the lung, brain, prostate and stomach.
