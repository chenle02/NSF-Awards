Professor Richard M. Noyes is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of oscillations and
dynamic instabilities in chemical systems. In particular, Noyes proposes to
perform studies in the following basic areas: 1) to further the mechanistic
studies of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction; 2) to improve our understanding of
the oscillatory oxidation of benzaldehyde; 3) to study the nucleation of bubbles
and transport of molecules between gas and liquid phases; 4) to extend the
theories of behavior in complex systems; and 5) to study oscillations and
instabilities in biological systems. %%% Any chemical system isolated from
further inputs of matter or energy will ultimately decay toward a nonreactive
state called chemical equilibrium. If light or heat or reactant chemicals of
high energy are constantly added, the system may be kept far from equilibrium
and may exhibit exotic behaviors such as oscillations in composition or bursts
of gas evolution. Noyes' research program is directed to discovering and
elucidating these mechanisms and to learning the conditions responsible for
their occurence. Such studies are intended to learn both how to prevent
undesirable instabilitiers and also how to use instabilities to accomplish
useful purposes.
