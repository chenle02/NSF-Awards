ABSTRACT

Title: Understanding and Improving Memory System Performance via a New Approach
to Cache Analysis and Access ordering PI: Sally McKee, University of Utah

Microprocessor speed is increasing much faster than memory system speed: both
speed-growth curves are exponential, but they represent diverging exponentials.
This proposed research strives to develop a comprehensive approach to bridging
the processor/memory performance gap by developing better measures of
performance, better tools for observing memory system behavior and understanding
memory usage patterns, and combined compiler and architectural schemes to
exploit these patterns.

The first component of this research investigates methods and tools by which to
better measure and interpret complex system behavior in the cache and memory
hierarchy. The PI and others are developing a new framework for the analysis of
caching systems; this new "caches as filters" framework focuses on properties of
a memory trace rather than artifacts of a particular memory organization. This
research will support the development of the tools and technology necessary to
apply the new framework to real problems and systems.

The second component of this research investigates combined compiler and
architectural approaches to improving memory system performance in modern
microprocessors via smarter scheduling of memory activity and hardware support
for streaming.
