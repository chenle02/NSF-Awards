9411967 Jacobs Science can make great progress when the knowledge acquired
within one discipline is organized and made accessible for detailed analysis.
Just as molecular genetics has made great strides since the introduction of
electronic databases cataloguing the sequences of genes from animals used in
research, neuroscience would be advanced if appropriate databases were made
available to researchers. In this proposal, Dr. Gwen Jacobs outlined a series of
workshops in which neurobiologists and information scientists will gather to
determine how to institute electronic databases of individually identifiable
nerve cells. Databases for several different research organisms are now
possible, and might include detailed structural, physiological, neurochemical,
and genetic information about each cell. The databases would advance studies of
brain cell function, or the behavior of neural networks. This electronically
stored information could be made available over internet to aid both researchers
and educators. ***
