This workshop focuses on the impact of YouTube and Web 2.0 on the 2008 election
cycle in the United States. It brings together scholar in Political Science,
Computer Science, and related disciplines to examine this topic. At this time,
most work concerning the impact of the web on politics is of an anecdotal
matter. There does not exist agreed upon standards on how to approach this
topic. One of the purposes of this workshop is to serve as a catalyst to develop
baseline measures, metrics, integrative tools, and uniform repositories to
facilitate the study of the impact of Web 2.0 on politics in a coherent manner.
It will also serve to develop new teams and networks of scholars working on
projects involving this subject matter.

In addition, the research presented at and resulting from this workshop will
demonstrate new technical and analytic opportunities and highlight where there
is a need for more focusesd research and tool development. The results of the
workshop might also be of interest to practioners.
