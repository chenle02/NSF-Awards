This research is concerned with the preordering of reactant groups in
photoreactive polymer matrices. Electron donor- acceptor interactions will be
used as the ordering principle in these systems and to choose
poly(vinylcinnamate) as the basic polymeric structure of the study. Electron
donor- and electron acceptor-substituted poly(vinylcinnamates) and some other
derivatives will be prepared and their effect on photoreactivity will be
observed. It is hoped that these chemical interactions will not only promote
group association, but also lead to a pairing of the reaction centers of the
photoreactive chromophores and, hence, to an effective increase in
photoreactivity. The idea of group preordering is interesting not only for the
design of crosslinkable polymers, as in photolithography, but also in new
pathways; for the transport of photonic excitation, for the conduction of
charge, and for the progression of chemical reaction chains throughout a solid
polymer matrix. This research is being jointly funded with the Office of Naval
Research.
