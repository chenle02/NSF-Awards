This award supports participation in the Bloomington Geometry Workshop taking
place at Indiana University on April 5-7, 2019. The workshop will promote
interaction and scientific cooperation among mathematicians engaged in cutting-
edge research in geometry and related areas. The workshop emphasizes the
training and professional development of graduate students and other young
researchers. Such experiences are critical to the development of young
mathematicians, new members of a workforce that will help the nation address the
technological challenges of the 21st century. The workshop will also encourage
participation of members of groups that are under-represented in mathematics,
helping to diversify the ranks of those participating in research in mathematics
and related disciplines.

The workshop employs a format that strongly encourages both formal and informal
interaction among students, postdoctoral associates, and more established
mathematicians. The workshop organizers will videotape all presentations and
post them publicly with links from the conference webpage. Young researchers
will be encouraged to produce and display posters during the meeting. More
information about the workshop can be found at http://www.indiana.edu/~bgw/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
