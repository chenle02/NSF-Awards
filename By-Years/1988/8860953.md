Major earthquakes can cause severe damage to buildings resulting in thousands
of fatalities and considerable societal disruption. An innovative earthquake
resistant construction concept, the Friction Pendulum System (FPS), shows
excellent potential for reducing earthquake damage for new and existing
buildings. This research project investigates applying this earthquake resistant
technique to buildings. Dynamic analyses are used to identify the design
parameters appropriate for different building applications, and to investigate
the performance of building with the FPS when subjected to different earthquake
strengths. Materials which could achieve the desired dynamic coefficients of
friction are identified and investigated. It is anticipated that the FPS system
could increase the earthquake resistance of the buildings by 100% to 300%,
without increasing construction. The system could also substantially increase
the earthquake resistance of existing buildings with less retrofit disruption
and at a lower cost than other methods. Because of the inherent simplicity,
versatility, stability, and durability of the FPS concept, if should become a
major tool for seismic resistant design. This research project represents Phase
I of a Small Business Innovation Research Grant.
