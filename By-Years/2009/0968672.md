This award will provide partial support for the California State University
Northridge to host the International Astronomical (IAU) Symposium 273 on the
"Physics of Sun and Star Spots." The aim of the conference is to bring together
researchers in solar and stellar physics, who will discuss studies of the long
term evolution of stellar magnetism and the origin of the spot
phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invited speakers will be selected by the
scientific organizing committee from the pool of scientists working in the field
of stellar and solar magnetism and activity around the world. The speaker roster
will include both established and young researchers. Contributed talks will be
given by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. The results of the
conference will be published as part of the series of Symposia of the
International Astronomical Union.
