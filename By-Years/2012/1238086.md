The proposed Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics (CDP) aims to develop an
international leadership position in the fundamental material science and
engineering that underpins dielectric and piezoelectric materials. The research
efforts will be anchored by North Carolina State University (NCSU) as the lead
institution, partnered with the Pennsylvania State University (PSU).

The Center will focus on new functionalities in dielectric and piezoelectric
materials that could enable new and potentially disruptive storage and sensing
technologies to drive the energy, electronics, medical, and communications
sectors of the economy. The proposed I/UCRC will support major industries based
on capacitor and piezoelectric materials and devices, through the development of
new materials, processing strategies, electrical testing, and nanoscale
structural characterization methodologies. The Center will strive to anticipate,
define, and address critical material needs for low-power, conformable, mobile
devices, as well as for high pulse electrical power. The proposed center also
aims to identify and recruit companies across the supply chain, i.e. ones that
manufacture dielectric and piezoelectric materials, component manufacturers, and
end users, who will provide the technological pull for CDP research activities.

The Center will support training and research in materials development from the
atomic to device levels, co-processing of various materials in device
integration, and reliability of capacitive devices under high field and cycling
conditions. The center will serve as a primary educational resource in these
materials from the undergraduate student level through the continuing education
of industrial scientists. The CDP will be a resource to other universities,
research institutes, national laboratories, and commercial companies engaged in
developing and utilizing dielectrics for integration into systems. The center
plans to continuously and proactively develop broader participation at both
institutions by having guest faculty at center meetings as a means to introduce
faculty expertise to the center membership.
