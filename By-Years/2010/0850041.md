Belmont University establishes the Pathways to Science, Technology and
Mathematics (Pathways) project which provides four-year scholarships of up to
$10,000 for 20 students over the funding period. It leverages extant long-term
academic outreach programs with school districts across Middle Tennessee, a rich
history of engaging students in undergraduate research, and a commitment of
technology related businesses and organizations in the region to partner with
local academic institutions, to accomplish the Pathways project objectives which
include: Increasing the number and quality of students majoring in Physics,
Mathematics, Professional Chemistry, Computer Science, Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology, Environmental Science, and Neuroscience, with an emphasis on
recruiting women, minorities, first-generation college students, and students
who are economically disadvantaged.

Strengthening the retention of these Pathways Scholars through an early
introduction to collaborative research experiences, an array of academic support
services, and the development of meaningful experiences between these cohorts of
students and the science community internal (students and faculty) and external
(regional conferences, internships, and speakers series) to the university.

Providing knowledge of various opportunities for careers and graduate studies in
science and technology, and providing resources and connections that will lead
to the success of participating students as they explore these pathways.

Enriching the relationships with high schools and industry across Middle
Tennessee that will sustain the growth in the STEM disciplines beyond the scope
of the funding of the present project.
