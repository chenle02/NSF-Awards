This project will overcome major deficiencies that exist in the laboratories of
General Ecology, Plant Ecology, and Plant Physiology at Southwest Texas State
University (SWT) by developing new and innovative exercises in the area of plant
physiological ecology. These exercises address topics that are fundamental to
terrestrial ecology and plant physiology ,i.e. photosynthesis, solar radiation,
and resource competition. The new exercises emphasize the quantitative and
experimental nature of present-day ecology and plant physiology and combine
modern instrumentation with computer simulation modeling as instructional tools.
Specific topics covered include the ecological significance of C3 and C4
photosynthesis, canopy architecture, and photosynthesis in species mixtures and
monocultures, photomorphogenic effects of solar radiation, leaf energy balance,
solar ultraviolet radiation, and stratospheric ozone depletion.
