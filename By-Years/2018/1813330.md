This project considers problems related to the increasing volume of big data
characterized by ultra-large sample size and ultra-high dimensionality. Such
volumes introduce many new and unique challenges to scientists in both
computation and statistical inference. Finding and isolating the important
information in big data is an extremely difficult challenge. In response to such
challenges, the project will develop a novel system that can provide quality
analysis of big data. With the investigator's experience in statistical research
of theory, methodology, and applications, the project will provide an excellent
opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in
cutting-edge statistical applications and methodology development, and thereby
prepare them well for their future careers. By localizing the data, this project
develops a system with a coherent collection of novel techniques for estimation,
computation, asymptotic studies, and statistical inference overcoming the new
challenges for big data. The project will lead to new research directions in
sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) and sufficient variable selection (SVS),
producing new big data mining tools applicable in a wide range of scientific
fields. This work is a major step towards improving the understanding of SDR and
SVS, including their advantages and how to overcome their disadvantages to suit
for the challenge of big data analysis. This project will also provide
scientists a new platform to develop more flexible and efficient methods. The
investigator will establish theoretical properties of the proposed estimators
and develop new scalable computation algorithms for ultra-size and ultra-high
dimensional data with an open-access R package to disseminate the knowledge to
the scientific community.
