9310461 Nielson This project is concerned with the establishment of an
interdisciplinary undergraduate research laboratory for the systematic
prediction and characterization of new inorganic ferroelectric materials. The
three-year project is expected to increase significantly the number of known
ferroelectric materials which now stands at about 200. Ferroelectrics are of
increasing importance in the fabrication of electrooptic devices, integrated
circuits, pyroelectric detectors, and piezoelectric transducers. The project
involves the prediction of ferroelectric behavior in new materials based on
analysis of previously published crystallographic data; the high temperature
formation of these materials in poly crystalline form; verification by X-ray
analysis that the materials have the expected structure; specimen processing;
and subsequent measurement of the dielectric and thermodynamic properties of
these materials as a function of temperature to confirm the predicted
ferroelectric property. The project is designed to offer a series of attractive
undergraduate research topics and will in addition encourage the participants to
follow careers in physics and chemistry. ***
