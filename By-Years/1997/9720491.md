9720491 Amato-Wierda This project aims to introduce a complementary line of
inquiry in the area of gas-phase chemistry of plasma enhanced chemical vapor
deposition (PECVD) to the PI's research program through analysis of the gas-
phase composition during PECVD by molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). The
gas-phase neutral, ion, and radical species, as well as their kinetics and
mechanisms, will be correlated with process variables and final film properties.
The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS
OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). %%% This is a research enhancement
grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and
Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science
knowledge at a fundamental level of special relevance to the synthesis and
processing of electronic materials. ***
