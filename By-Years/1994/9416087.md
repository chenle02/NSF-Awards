Support for this project will incorporate measurements of ionospheric parameters
from the DMSP spacecraft into various data bases. These parameters include the
ion concentration, composition, and temperature, the electron temperature, and
the ion drift velocity. The CEDAR science area influenced by this data that the
PI plans to study is sub-auroral. A number of objectives are: (1) studying the
penetration of energy fields to lower latitudes as seen by the Millstone Hill
radar during magnetic storms with the addition of the DMSP data, (2) obtaining
conjugate data from the southern hemisphere, and (3) extending the study to the
SAR arc features that accompany the polarization jets through the availability
of electron temperature. Finally, other NSF initiatives (i.e., MISETA and
Jicamarca campaigns) will benefit from DMSP measurements.
