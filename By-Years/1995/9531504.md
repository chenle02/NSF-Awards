9531504 Story This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to
design, develop, construct and evaluate a prototype surface acoustic wave (SAW)
dew point hygrometer based on the Phase I research that will be lower in cost
and have several advantages over existing optical dew point instruments. The
advantages include a cost of about half that of existing optical dew point
hygrometers, higher resolution and accuracy, reduced sensitivity to
contamination, frost point transition detection, and stability through the frost
point. Cost and performance improvements in dew point instrumentation are
important in the fields of atmospheric sciences, agriculture, and numerous
industries. Four main objectives are planned for the Phase II work. They
include: dew point measurement research which involves investigating the
stability and robustness of the control algorithm for frost point measurements
during frost point transition, and the effects of SAW substrate microroughness
and surface coatings on dew point measurement accuracy; The design and
construction of the prototype instrument which involves RF oscillator design,
design of the microprocessor based control unit, and packaging of the prototype
instrument; Testing, evaluation, and calibration of the prototype instrument;
Analysis of testing and evaluation. Corresponding design improvements will be
made to the prototype based on this analysis. This work is expected to produce a
prototype for manufacturing. Low cost and accurate dew point hygrometers have
many commercial applications. The need is especially strong in the areas of
meteorology, climatology, agriculture and industries such as microelectronics,
chemical, food, steel, and paper. For example, studies of atmospheric water
vapor concentrations and humidity content of industrial process gases.
