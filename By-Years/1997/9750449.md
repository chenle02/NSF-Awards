Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the fundamental spectroscopic methods
used by scientists for determining chemical structure. It is imperative that
undergraduate students learn how to acquire and interpret NMR spectra. Students
at the University have previously studied spectral interpretation using NMR data
bases or from spectra obtained by technicians. They acquire no direct experience
in operating the spectrometer. Recent developments in rapid scanning NMR
spectrometers permit a spectrum to be acquired in 10 seconds. Thus it is
possible to provide hands-on experience for laboratories of 24 students in
undergraduate course at Hartford. Students are also gaining experience in
collaborative learning and a team approach to research problems. NMR
spectroscopy is introduced along with other instruments in the first-year
chemistry laboratory, in keeping with the trend in chemical education to
introduce students to instrumentation early in their college education. The main
focus of the NMR is in organic chemistry and subsequent laboratory courses. The
instrument is used to support group projects that culminate with presentation of
results by students. Student in more advanced courses have acquired the skill
and confidence to use the NMR in more advanced applications including research
projects. *
