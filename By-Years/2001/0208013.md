This project is a study of computational complexity theory, in particular a
study of structural complexity theory and some compelxity problems relating to
lattice problems. Computational complexity theory is the study of the inherent
hardness of computational problems, both in the worst-case measure as well as in
the average-case measure. This theory is the underpinning of all computer
security based on the hardness or insolvability of computational problems.

The investigator will study the interrelationship between a number of complexity
classes, especially those between determinisitic P and the second level of the
polynomial time hierarchy, building on the recent breakthrough concerning the
class S2, the symmetric second level class of the hierarchy. The investigator
also explores a notion of persistent NP-hardness. This is to be an intermediate
level of complexity measure between worst-case hardness and average-case
complexity in the framework of Levin and others. In lattice problems, the
investigator will search for moderately efficient algorithms for the shortest
vector problem and the closest vector problem, both in the worst case measure as
well as in the average case measure. The investigator will study their
connections to random lattices, and potential applications to the design of
secure public-key cryptosystems based on assumptions of hadness in the worst
case complexity only.
