This four year project, sponsored by Louisiana Tech University, provides three
academic years of special courses work in chemistry and general science
(physics/earth science/astronomy) for middle grades science and mathematics
teachers. The courses, while being essentially science courses, will emphasis
the mathematics undergirding the science content. These courses will be held at
the school site and will be attended by 25 teachers each year. In the summer,
five selected teachers from the academic year program will each be teamed with a
chemistry or physics high school teacher and will learn content, teaching
techniques and take intensive training to prepare them to carry out professional
development activities in their respective school systems. By the third year of
the project, approximately 450 teachers will have been involved in professional
development activities. In the fourth year of the project the program will be
monitored and evaluated. The matching funds from the university and the schools
constitute a match of above 48% of the NSF grant.
