The CSRA High School Student Science Research Program is a 6 week summer
program for rising high school juniors and seniors from the 18 county Savannah
River Area of South Carolina and Georgia. This program is an expansion of a
pilot program recently completed this past summer. For the proposed program,
participants will be 18 highly motivated, talented students who show a strong
interest in the sciences and who have been nominated by two teachers (one of
whom is a science teacher). For 6 weeks students will carry out an independent
project, but on a collaborative basis with individual scientists who will act as
mentors. Each student will learn various aspects of research and experience
first hand active research and development activities. The intent is to allow
the student independence in pursuing his/her project while providing sufficient
supervision to ensure proper development of a sound study. The fields of study
the students will choose from will be microbiology, ecology, environmental
science, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and computer science. At
the end of the program the students will be required to write a formal report on
their research project and submit it for presentation at either the Georgia or
South Carolina Junior Academy of Sciences. Students will also be required to
present their reports to their high school science class or science club.
