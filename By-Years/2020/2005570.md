The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be the
development of a device for treating long bone fractures using robotic
technology. Approximately 350,000 proximal femur fractures and 65,000 femur
shaft fractures occur in the United States annually. Current surgical procedures
are manual, and patients experience a myriad of complications to align femur
fractures, including difficulty in achieving accurate reduction, subsequent
malalignment of bone fragments, high x-ray radiation, nonunion complications,
and soft tissue damage. The proposed surgical robot alleviates these
complications and reduces the costs of surgery by decreasing procedure times,
the number of assistant personnel in the operating room, radiation exposure,
hospital stays, risk of infections, and blood loss. This project paves the way
for more human-robot collaboration in the operating
room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of
technology for a novel surgical robot for orthopedic surgeries, especially for
long bone fracture alignment. The robot has a unique architecture with a
frontally open deign. This facilitates positioning the leg inside the robot and
provides a large workspace for surgical maneuvers. Using its own imaging
technology, the robot will drive the bone fragments into correct alignment and
holds them in position for the duration of the surgery. The focus of the
surgical robot is for treating femur fractures in the hip and femoral shaft.
Unlike traditional femur fracture surgeries, this technology will enable the
surgeon to accurately apply large traction forces, precisely align the fractured
bone, and significantly reduce radiation exposure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
