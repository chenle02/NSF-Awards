This engineering education research project seeks to investigate the alignment
between the popular Maker movement and engineering careers. The researchers plan
to develop models of how those involved in the hobbyist community, as
represented by the Maker movement, find their ways into engineering degree
programs. The proposed approach uses qualitative data collection and theories
grounded in how adult learners navigate career
pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project arises from the current emphasis on creating more STEM graduates. The
project specifically investigates alternative pathways into engineering degree
programs which may be taken by those currently under-represented in engineering.
This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers
through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and
expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
