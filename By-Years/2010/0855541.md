The project considers various problems in the area of partial differential
equations, including free boundary problems, variational problems, and geometric
problems. These problems have been chosen because they are not technical and
confined to narrow areas but are interdisciplinary in spirit. For example, the
problems on composite materials are derived from engineering questions. As the
principal investigator has done in the past and expects to continue to do now,
he will rely for the resolution of these problems on techniques and tools from
several areas of mathematics (e.g., partial differential equations, geometry,
the calculus of variations, mathematical physics). Some of the problems under
investigation are also amenable to numerical simulation. This, the principal
investigator hopes, will provide additional insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
chief impact of this project on areas outside of mathematics lies in the set of
problems that focus on the design of composite materials. Lightweight and strong
composites are playing increasingly important roles in fields such as aerospace
engineering, medicine, etc. Theoretical studies like those to be undertaken in
this project, in which one tries to maximize rigidity, should furnish valuable
insight into the fabrication of such smart materials. There could, of course, be
other areas of application. For instance, a survey of the literature reveals
that the principal investigator's earlier work on composites has found use in
ecological studies.
