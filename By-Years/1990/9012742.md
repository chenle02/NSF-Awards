The first goal of this project is to empirically assess, by using a simulated
insanity defense trial with mock-jurors how mock-juror insanity defense verdicts
are affected by: a) shifting the burden of proof to the defendants; b) the
availability of the "guilty but mentally ill" verdict choice; and, c) narrowing
insanity tests or standards. The second goal is to empirically determine (again
with mock-jurors) how race of defendant and race of victim influences juror
decision-making within the insanity trial domain. In addition, the PI proposes
to examine how jurors's attitudes toward: a) "due process of law" versus "crime
control"; b) the death penalty; c) the insanity defense itself; and d) the
efficacy/believability of expert psychological testimony relate to their
insanity defense verdicts. One of the most fundamental questions being asked in
regard to the insanity defense is: What are the causally efficacious factors
which affect juror determination of a "Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI)"
verdict?
