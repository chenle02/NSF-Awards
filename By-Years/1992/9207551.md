The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) is a research unit of the University of
California (UC) located on the Sonoma coast 70 miles north of San Francisco.
Since 1966 the Laboratory has provided unique opportunities for field research
on a rich flora and fauna in close proximity to the Laboratory buildings. BML
has well-equipped laboratories, an excellent seawater system, strong on-site
support staff and a firm commitment from the Davis campus to continue developing
the facilities and support needed by the growing number of resident and visiting
researchers at the site. The Laboratory is located on the Bodega Marine Reserve
(BMR), a 362-acre protected field site with a diverse set of marine and
terrestrial coast habitats. Adjacent subtidal areas are protected and available
for study within the Bodega Marine Life Refuge. Subtidal research on
invertebrates, algae, and fish (population biology, physiological ecology,
biochemical and behavioral studies) is expanding rapidly at BML. This project
will supply partial support for expansion of the existing dive locker and
installation of an Enriched Air Nitrox Scuba facility. Nitrox Scuba is quickly
evolving as the technology of choice for scientific underwater operations.
Current research diving at BML is accomplished using air Scuba under physically
demanding conditions. Nitrox Scuba capability will approximately double the time
available per dive for benthic studies, while reducing diver fatigue, nitrogen
narcosis, and incidence of decompression sickness. An enhanced diving facility
is vital if BML and visiting researchers are to expand in situ benthic research
exploiting the unique aspects of the site.
