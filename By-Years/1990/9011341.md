Dr. Manfred M. Kappes is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study clusters of atoms in the gaseous state using
molecular beam and laser techniques. These measurements will help us to
understand a diversity of system behaviors ranging from solute behavior in the
liquid state to insulator-conductor electrical behavior in the solid state.
Collinear molecular beam photodissociation and resonant 2-photon ionization
spectroscopies will be used to obtain particle size specific data on (i) neutral
and positively charged clusters of main group elements, on (ii) "alkali
solvation complexes" containing transition metals surrounded by a shell of
alkalis and on (iii) mixed metal/insulator clusters. Results will include: real
time measurements of cluster formation and ionization cross-sections,
unimolecular dissociation rates, dissociation energies, quantitative valence and
structural isomer distributions and probes of isomer interconversion.
