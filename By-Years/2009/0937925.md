This research focuses on the design and implementation of a lightweight, yet,
versatile middleware framework that provides effective and scalable solutions to
the problem of interleaving storage workloads with a wide spectrum of demands.
The framework uses simple and non-intrusive collection of workload statistics
such as workload histograms and measures of temporal dependence to provide
accurate forecasting of system workload characteristics and their impact on
system metrics. The framework maps accurately and swiftly complex processes that
exist and interact in storage clusters into robust allocation decisions. Central
to the framework is its ability to estimate beforehand the effect of resource
allocation policies on system metrics, which enables navigating through multiple
possible allocations of system resources and selecting the on that best meets
system targets.&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to revolutionize
autonomic resource management in storage systems and provide methodologies to
meet conflicting targets such as discovering trade-offs and dependencies between
performance and other metrics including cost, energy consumption, reliability,
and availability.&lt;br/&gt;This project enables enhancement of graduate courses
on parallel and distributed systems with aspects of emerging paradigms such as
data intensive, cloud, and green computing, as well as advances the education of
the multiple students directly involved.&lt;br/&gt;
