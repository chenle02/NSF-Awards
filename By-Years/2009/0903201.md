Abstract Gangbo

Partial support of US participants is requests fund for an international
conference in Nice France, which will be held from February 02 to 07, 2009. The
Laboratoire J.A. Dieudonn´e of ?Universit´e de Nice-Sophia Antipolis? has
graciously agreed to host that conference. This is the first international
conference sponsored by the French National Research Agency (ANR) through a
project named KAMFAIBLE. This conference will bring together leading experts
from various continents (Europe, the United States of America and Latin
America), who are expected to interact with postdocs and students. The workshop
includes the participation of scientists from emergent nations such as Mexico,
Brazil and the People?s Republic of China. The intellectual merit of this
conference is to continue unearthing new connections between the weak KAM theory
and other fields of mathematics such as dynamical systems, partial differential
equations, optimal transportation theory, and many others. Another merit of this
proposal is to continue exploring the ramifications of the weak KAM theory in
many other subjects of sciences such as the homegenization theory, the kinetic
theory of gases and fluids mechanic [GKP] [GNT2] (see also works in progress
[GT1], [GT2]). This workshop will expose graduate students as well as faculty
members to recent progress in the weak KAM theory, geometry and partial
differential equations. The broader impact includes advancing knowledge,
disseminating findings and exposing young researchers to this vibrant area at
the crossing of Analysis, Riemannian Geometry, Dynamical Systems and Symplectic
Geometry.
