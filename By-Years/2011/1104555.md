This proposal consists of several projects using algebraic topological
techniques to study questions arising in String Topology, the topology of moduli
spaces, and the study of Topological Quantum Field Theories. The theory of
String Topology, first introduced by Chas and Sullivan in 1999, now involves a
vast array of rich structure on spaces of paths and loops of manifolds. In this
proposal, there are projects that will relate string topology to geometry and
topological field theory. This includes a joint project with A. Blumberg and C.
Teleman that will relate string topology to the recent classification theories
of topological field theories due to Costello and Hopkins-Lurie. In particular
they will construct and study a string topology category of a manifold, and
compute its Hochschild homology. They will investigate the ``Calabi-Yau"
properties of this category. In this study interesting questions involving the
role of Koszul duality in topological field theory arise, which the authors will
address. Cohen and his collaborators also have a goal of comparing the
symplectic field theory of the cotangent bundle of a manifold, with the string
topology of that manifold. Other projects in this proposal include a
collaboration with M.Schwarz on the development of the ``Quantum String
topology" of a symplectic manifold, and a project with N. Kitchloo, to address
conjectures by the geometers F. Lalonde and D. McDuff on the Serre spectral
sequence for bundles with symplectic fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
consists of several projects investigating the area of research known as "String
Topology", as well as related questions. String topology, a theory that was
first introduced by Chas and Sullivan in 1999, studies structures on spaces of
paths, loops, and surfaces. This structure was motivated by formalisms in string
theory in physics. The idea is to understand how loops (or paths) in a
background space can evolve in time. Loops can evolve by changing in size and
even breaking apart. These phenomena are measured by studying surfaces mapping
to the background space, that span these loops. In this project, Cohen tends to
study various aspects of the theory related to topological quantum field
theories, as well as those related to symplectic geometry.
