Understanding printed documents is an intelligent activity. This research is
about automating one aspect of analyzing a document image and deriving a high-
level representation of its visual content. Documents contain photographs and
accompanying text. This effort is concerned with arriving at an integrated
interpretation of the communicative unit consisting of photographs and their
captions. When text describes salient aspects of a photograph, it is possible to
use the text to direct a vision system in understanding the photograph. There
are two components to this research: the first deals with language issues and
the second with development of a vision subsystem. Methods of extracting visual
information from text, specifically cues required to identify salient objects,
are to be studied; such information may be present in a variety of forms, based
on both syntax and semantics. The role of textually extracted visual cues in
performing visual object recognition is also to be studied. As a test of the
theory, it is proposed to develop a system where the result of parsing a caption
of a newspaper photograph is used to identify human faces in the photograph. The
face location subsystem will incorporate scale invariant techniques, and filters
that characterize faces based on the presence of distinguishing visual features.
