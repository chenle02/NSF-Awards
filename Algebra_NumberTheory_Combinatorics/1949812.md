Algebraic Geometry has connections to many areas in mathematics, including
topology, differential geometry, number theory, representation theory,
combinatorics and the theory of differential equations. Over last 20 year
important connections with string theory were discovered as well. Algebraic
Geometry is the study of algebraic varieties: geometric objects that can be
described as the collections of points satisfying a set of polynomial equations.
One of the aims of the field is to classify algebraic varieties. This can be
done by first associating discrete invariants to algebraic varieties and then
studying all algebraic varieties with a given set of invariants. A basic
invariant used in algebraic geometry, as well as in differential geometry, is
the first Chern class. Algebraic varieties can be divided into classes according
to the positivity properties (or lack thereof) of this invariant. One of the
most important of these classes is that of varieties with first Chern class
equal to zero. These varieties have a crucial role also in physics and in
differential geometry. With this project the PI aims to advance our knowledge of
hyper-K\"ahler manifolds which are, together with complex tori and Calabi-Yau
manifolds, one of the building blocks of varieties with trivial first Chern
class.

More specifically, the PI plans to carry out the research in following
directions: investigating the relation between hyper-Kahler manifolds and cubic
fourfolds, improving the current knowledge of Lagrangian fibrations, using
Lagrangian fibrations to expand our knowledge of the known examples, and
carrying out a systematic study of symplectic resolutions. These lines of
research build on past work of the PI as well as on recent progress in this
field.
