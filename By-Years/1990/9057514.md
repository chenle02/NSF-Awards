This Presidential Young Investigator Award provides general research funds for
Dr. Werner-Washburne's studies of the regulatory events that control entry into
stationary phase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Stationary phase
represents cells' response to starvation through specific physiological and
morphological changes as well as the arrest of cell division. Yeast is an ideal
system for this study because it is amenable to both molecular and genetic
analyses, and a number of mutants defective in entry into stationary phase have
been isolated.
