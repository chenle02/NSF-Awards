Abstract Terzian Cornell University will continue the Observational Astronomy
Program established in the Summer of 1989, in which undergraduate students are
involved in the research activities of the astronomy group at Cornell
University. The undergraduate students will work with members of the Cornell
faculty and research staff on a variety of projects, including optical,
infrared, and radio/radar astronomy, and other related topics. The students'
research at Cornell will provide them the opportunity to participate in
astronomical observations at facilities used by Cornell researchers, such as the
Palomar Observatory and National Astronomy Centers. The students will be
encouraged to participate in the Undergraduate Research Forum at Cornell and to
present and discuss their various research projects with other students who are
at Cornell in the summer. The Undergraduate Research in Observational Astronomy
program will continue to encourage the participation of students who are women
or underrepresented groups and whose own institutions do not provide this kind
of research experience. Special efforts will be made to facilitate the
logistical aspects of the student participants, such as housing and cultural
activities.
