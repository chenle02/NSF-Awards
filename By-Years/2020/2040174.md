This travel award project will provide travel funds for 15-20 US-based students
to attend the 2020 International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER) in
Malta, Nov 9-12, 2020, and participate in the doctoral consortium. The symposium
features both invited and selected research presentations that focus on robotics
research that has been validated through experimental results. This unique
conference presents the latest advances across various fields of robotics, with
ideas that are not only conceived conceptually but also explored experimentally.
It has a high visibility in the international robotics research community as
well as a high relevance to applications due to its emphasis on experimental
validation. ISER 2020 will provide excellent opportunities for students to learn
about the latest advances across a wide spectrum of robotics research,
development, and applications and to network with seasoned researchers and
practitioners in the worldwide robotics community. In the case where the current
schedule becomes not practical, the Doctoral Consortium Workshop will be held
during the March 2021 period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
