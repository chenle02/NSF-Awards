Engineering-Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative effort between
McNeese State University (MSU, Lake Charles, LA), and Louisiana State University
at Eunice (LSUE, Eunice, LA) to enhance introductory core engineering courses at
MSU and establish introductory engineering courses on the LSUE campus.
Specifically, this work concentrates on the topic areas of thermodynamics,
circuits, and engineering statics. The project uses educational methods of Just
in Time Teaching (JiTT), the Instructional Design Model by the National Center
for Manufacturing Education (NCME), and eCourses to a) increase the retention
rate of engineering majors between the freshman and sophomore years at MSU, b)
increase the understanding of engineering course concepts, c) increase student
processing skills required for engineering problem solving, and d) improve
student attitudes about engineering as a field of study and a profession. The
course design uses an activity-based, hybrid approach, with three components, a)
face-to-face (live and virtual), b) web-based, and c) on site support. The on-
site support component includes a) holding office hours and assisting students
with homework and other class assignments, b) proctoring quizzes and exams, c)
serving as the faculty sponsor of an engineering club focused on the core
introductory concepts, and d) promoting engineering to LSUE students at large
and the community served by LSUE.
