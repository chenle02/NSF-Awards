In this project, the investigator, his colleagues, and a team of undergraduate
researchers study electrocapillary surfaces and electro-elastocapillary systems.
Electrocapillary surfaces are capillary surfaces, i.e., surfaces which minimize
surface energy subjected to a volume constraint, that are placed in an electric
field. Electro-elastocapillary systems are electrocapillary surfaces that are
additionally constrained to reside on a flexible elastic body. Mathematical
models of these systems are developed via a variational principle. The resulting
systems of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations are studied using
tools from perturbation theory, nonlinear dynamics, and numerical analysis. In
addition, experiments are carried out in the investigator's laboratory and the
mathematical theory is compared with experimental data.

Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) operate at a scale where forces common to
everyday experience, such as gravity and inertia, hold no sway. Rather, in the
microworld, behavior is dominated by less familiar forces such as surface
tension and the electrostatic force. Inspired and informed by recent advances in
MEMS technology, this project develops the mathematical theory of systems
dominated by the unique balance of capillary, electrostatic, and elastic forces.
The development and analysis of this mathematical theory allows MEMS researchers
to improve and optimize the design of MEMS devices. In turn, improved MEMS
devices can be used in areas ranging from automotive safety to biomedical
engineering. This project also focuses on outreach to mathematics faculty and
students from local high schools. As part of this project, the investigator
strengthens existing ties with several local high schools and help develop novel
lab-based exercises to be integrated into the high school mathematics
curriculum.
