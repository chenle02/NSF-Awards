In this project, part of the Cross-Directorate program for Multidisciplinary
Research in Optical Science and Engineering, William Stwalley and colleagues at
the University of Connecticut will extend optical and other physical techniques
for control and manipulation of atoms and atomic ions, such as cooling and
trapping, to molecules and molecular ions for studies of ultracold chemical
reactions and inelastic collisions. Such ultracold collision dynamics, at
temperatures near 0.001 K, are virtually unexplored, but they are predicted to
show extreme quantum behavior which is highly sensitive to details of the
interactions, including the collision energy and quantum states involved.
Ultracold molecules will be formed by photoassociation of ultracold atoms.
Chemical reactions, such as between a cryogenic beam of molecular hydrogen and
laser-cooled cesium atoms, will be explored in both the cold and ultracold
regimes, that is, at temperatures less than 10 K and 1 mK, respectively. The
techniques of laser manipulation, which have proven so fruitful with atoms, will
be extended to allow investigations involving molecules and molecular ions.
Novel chemical processes and physical behavior are expected to be found in the
ultracold temperature region examined in this program. This interdisciplinary
research will have significant educational impact at several levels.
