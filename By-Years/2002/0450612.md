This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a robust, generic, front-end, bio-sampler that when combined with either
a wet or dry biological detector, will result in more accurate and rapid
detection of hazardous airborne biological agents. While most current systems
require samples to be delivered in a fluid for analysis, emerging dry detection
technologies facilitate near-real time detection, reduce sampling errors and
allow for unattended operation. The prototype bio-sampler developed in Phase I
demonstrated very high efficiency in the dry collection mode. This Phase II
project has the following objectives: (a) to optimize sampling performance for
particles at the low end of the range (<2 micron), (b) to maintain high bio-
viability of collected organisms, (c) to function efficiently in the wet or the
dry mode, (d) to demonstrate self-cleaning / decontamination features, (e) to
evaluate scalability to larger air volumes and, finally, (f) to demonstrate
enhanced overall performance in an integrated biological detection system.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of homeland
security and public safety. The proposed technology will enhance the performance
of both the detection systems that are presently deployed and that of the
advanced biological detectors that are currently under development. Additional
applications will be in the monitoring of the environment and of industrial air
quality.
