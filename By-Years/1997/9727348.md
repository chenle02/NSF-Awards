Funds are provided to examine sediment transport processes in three estuaries
in South Carolina or Georgia. Each study will focus on the physical processes
responsible for trapping sediments within the estuary. Support is also provided
for Project Interface, which is a goal-oriented, multi-year program for
undergraduates to attain the skills of scientific thinking, methods, and
communication. The study of sediment dynamics in Winyah Bay will provide the
platform for multi-disciplinary studies of productivity, nutrient and organic
carbon cycling, and physical-chemical estuarine processes.
