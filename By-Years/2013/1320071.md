From key-value stores to distributed file systems to distributed
&lt;br/&gt;databases, networked storage underpins modern Internet services.
&lt;br/&gt;Networked storage allows programmers to separate logic and data,
enables &lt;br/&gt;high throughput scale out, and takes advantage of
increasingly fast &lt;br/&gt;datacenter networks. However, in the big data era,
networked storage &lt;br/&gt;faces a new challenge: The amount of data accessed
per user request is &lt;br/&gt;growing rapidly; outpacing processor speeds and
DRAM capacity. &lt;br/&gt;Increasingly, user-perceived response times are
dominated by the slowest &lt;br/&gt;storage accesses, i.e., the 99th percentile
tails. Networked storage is &lt;br/&gt;notorious for fat tailed response
times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing networked storage systems that are
1) always fast and 2) &lt;br/&gt;cost efficient. A key approach is to understand
and selectively use &lt;br/&gt;replication for predictability (or cloning). In
this approach, clients &lt;br/&gt;issue redundant storage accesses against
independent hardware resources. &lt;br/&gt;The first to respond provides the
result. Replication for predictability &lt;br/&gt;reduces client-perceived
variability, leading to always fast response &lt;br/&gt;times. Our
implementations are especially cost effective at scale. To &lt;br/&gt;lower
costs, we study the root causes of slow response times, saving
&lt;br/&gt;resources by focusing on common causes. We also trade quality---e.g.,
&lt;br/&gt;slightly degraded search engine results--- for lower hardware costs
when &lt;br/&gt;appropriate. For broader impact, the PI will work to transfer
the &lt;br/&gt;technology to national and local companies.
