This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
topical formulation incorporating a polymeric platform that releases therapeutic
levels of nitric oxide gas, and assess its efficacy in dispersing wound-relevant
bacterial biofilms. The intellectual merit of the proposed project is built
around the remarkable characteristics of the polymeric system, where under
appropriate conditions this polymer can provide sustained release of nitric
oxide over long periods of time and at low concentrations that are
biocompatible. The benefit of this characteristic is substantial. Firstly, it
avoids the toxicity problems associated with high levels of reactive species
formed in response to concentrated nitric oxide release. Secondly, the low
levels of nitric oxide release from the polymer will result in increased
bioavailability of nitric oxide for promotion of wound healing. Taken together,
the characteristics of the proposed nitric oxide releasing polymer prodrug may
offer a significant improvement over current approaches to chronic wound
treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project will be determined by market needs that the technology addresses.
Colonization of surfaces by biofilms is a significant problem not only in the
clinical field, but also across industry and environmental biotechnology
sectors. As such, there is a growing requirement for technologies that can
either prevent biofilm growth or disperse an existing biofilm, and that can be
manufactured in a cost effective manner. The technology that is put forward for
development in this Phase I proposal has characteristics that are in line with
these requirements. By demonstrating successful development of a product for
treatment of wound-related biofilms, a solid foundation will be put in place for
exploring similar biofilm prevention or eradication needs across other market
sectors.
