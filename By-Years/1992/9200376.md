San Diego State University will conduct a university-level research experience
focused on modern geophysical exploration. Known as SAGE (Summer of Applied
Geophysical Experience), this hands-on research will provide an advanced
learning experience for undergraduate and graduate students. Students will
participate for 4 weeks in the field segment in the Rio Grande rift near Santa
Fe, New Mexico, an area that provides stimulating tectonic research as well as
an opportunity to study occurrences of groundwater and hydrocarbons. Research
uses seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetics, electrical
resistivity, electromagnetics, and magnetotellurics. SAGE students will
participate in every phase of the field research from the collection and
processing of data to its interpretation, culminating with both an oral and
written report. Where the required supervision is available at their home
institutions, students will continue their research on their own campuses. This
research is augmented by a visit to a SAGE faculty member's campus and
attendance at a scientific meeting.
