This is an experimental study of the interaction of nutrient flux and food web
controls in regulating the productivity of lakes. Four lakes will be manipulated
in a 2 X 2 design that tests the capacity of alternative food web structures in
response to increased nutrient loading. The theoretical framework for this
program is focused on stability and compensatory capacity of ecosystem
processes. It is based on scale-dependent perspectives that range from diel
dynamics to paleolimnological calibration and from single species to entire
communities. Models developed by the program will range from population dynamics
of individual cohorts to integrated indicators of trophic level responses.
Results of this study will provide both conceptual and tactical advances in
furthering the use of food web management techniques as a means for improving
water quality. This is an excellent research team that has been involved
previously in trophic cascade research. The facilities available for this
research are outstanding.
