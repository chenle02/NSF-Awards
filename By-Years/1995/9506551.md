9506551 Miller This project will test and apply a new methodology for estimating
the U/Pb composition, and hence time of growth, of differently zoned areas of
zircons and monazite crystals that have undergone high temperature metamorphism.
The technique uses a combination of cathodoluminescence and backscattered
electron imaging and ion microprobe analysis. The methodology will be tested on
zircons and monazites from two natural laboratories in the Blue Ridge of
southwestern Carolina and the Old Woman Mountains area of southeastern
California. In addition, laboratory experiments will examine the controls on
zircon and monazite growth kinetics. The results of this combinations of field
and laboratory tests will enable a clearer understanding of what is being dated
by U/Pb analyses of mineral zones, which will have an impact of tectonothermal
studies of all orogenic belts.
