The objectives of the proposed research are 1) to develop a continuum theory of
damage with field equations and boundary conditions based on the gauge
principle; ii) to fully implement the theory using symbolic computations and
direct interface with a finite element code; iii) to investigate the
interrelation between global instability and local compressive failure based on
bifurcation analysis of the continuum damage theory with connection to fiber
microbuckling; iv) conduct compression tests on composite cylinders under
combined loading in order to identify the failure micromechanisms and correlate
with theoretical predictions. The proposed research will have an impact on the
optimum design of composite structures loading under combined loading and prone
to compressive failure. It will also improve the modeling of manufacturing
processes for high performance composites by identifying the micromechanisms of
failure.
