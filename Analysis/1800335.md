The study of operators on Hilbert space became important with the advent of
Quantum Mechanics, but in addition, understanding of these operators has proven
to be vital to progress in many areas of mathematics. Historically, a method of
studying and understanding such operators is to break them down into simpler
components, based on spectral decomposition. This consists of describing parts
of the operator that behave like multiplication by certain numbers, and to
explain how these parts assemble into the whole. One major goal of this project
is to advance such understanding of large classes of operators. Another major
goal is to study families of operators that arise in various quantum mechanical
models, in light of certain deep mathematical conjectures regarding finite
dimensional approximations of infinite dimensional objects.

More specifically, the principal investigator, together with collaborators, has
made advances in recent years on spectral decomposition results for non-
selfadjoint elements of finite von Neumann algebras. These are centered around
upper triangular forms, analogous to the classical results of Issai Schur for
matrices, and both utilize and extend results about hyperinvariant subspaces
found recently by Haagerup and Schultz. Particular proposed projects include (a)
studying norm convergence properties of bounded operators and (b) extending
spectral distribution and upper-triangular form results to unbounded affiliated
operators. In related directions, the principal investigator will work on the
hyperinvariant subspace problem for elements of tracial von Neumann algebras and
to investigate the Murray--von Neumann puzzle, which is akin to the Heisenberg
relations. A second area of proposed research concerns the notion of bi-freeness
and bi-free products. A third area of proposed research concerns quantum
correlations. Recent results of the principal investigator showing non-
closedness of the set of quantum correlations for five inputs and two outputs
open the door to new understanding of these small cases, which the principal
investigator proposes to pursue.
