The team has developed a patent pending electrolyte chemistry that is believed
to have the potential to improve the performance of ultracapacitors that are an
important, but underutilized component in energy storage solutions. To date, the
adoption of ultracapacitors has been limited due to inadequate energy storage
performance and high costs. However, a number of technological breakthroughs
have made the ultracapacitor commercially viable. Applications are currently
dominated by the automotive and electronic industries with large potential in
solar and wind energy storage and industrial applications. The demand for
ultracapacitor in automotive start-up systems is projected to be the primary
source of growth over the next decade. As the ultracapacitor market grows and
more firms enter, it will become increasingly competitive. These companies will
need to provide technically superior products. The adoption of the proposed
patent pending electrolyte will allow companies to easily improve performance
with little engineering effort.

The proposed electrolyte has demonstrated promising improvements in proof-of-
concept testing that were validated by an independent laboratory. The proposed
electrolyte was compared with the current industry standard and showed 19%
higher capacitance and 15% high breakdown potential translating into more energy
storage, and wider temperature and voltage ranges. Longevity testing has shown
that the proposed technology has a lifetime of approximately 100,000 cycles, and
these improvements could translate into new applications for electrochemical
double layer capacitors (EDLC). The goal of this proposal is to show that the
proposed electrolye can be smoothly integrated into existing and future
ultracapacitor devices in a "plug and play" fashion. The team will use the
I-Corps training to develop a commercial-scale prototype to demonstrate the
technology to potential customers and partners and develop a commercialization
plan to bring the product to market.
