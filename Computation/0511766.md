This project involves a three-year program of research on several fundamental
computational issues involved in the parallel implicit solution of optimization
problems with partial differential equation (PDE) constraints. Such problems
arise in many contexts in engineering and scientific computation, since physical
reality is often expressed through models involving PDEs. Accurate
discretizations of PDEs lead to very large sparse constrained optimization
problems, where at least part of the structure reflects the discretization. The
goals of the research on methods include, but are not limited to, advancing the
state-of-the-art in four fundamental topics: (1) the formulation and analysis of
algorithms for large-scale nonlinear optimization; (2) adaptive mesh generation
for PDEs; (3) multilevel PDE solvers; and (4) parallel computation. Although
each of these topics can be investigated in isolation, the investigators believe
that the exploitation of their interactions is crucial for the creation of
effective global algorithms. The research is motivated and guided by three
particularly challenging applications: (i) geophysical inverse problems; (ii)
projection methods for evolution PDEs with constraints; and (iii) constrained
level-set methods. These topics cover a number of important applications of
computational science, including off-shore petroleum exploration, the numerical
modeling of black holes, the modeling of crystal growth and biomembranes,
capturing diffraction effects of waves and path planning. Two features common to
all these applications are that the PDE constraints must be handled using modern
adaptive multi-level techniques and that the underlying optimization problem is
highly nonlinear and hence nonconvex.

The Investigators are members of the Computational and Applied Mathematics
(CAM) Group within the Department of Mathematics at UC San Diego. They have a
combined expertise in applied mathematics, numerical optimization, numerical
partial differential equations and parallel computation. An important goal is
the development of software embodying the above algorithms. Software developed
as part of the project will provide an effective method of technology transfer
and will extend the scope and effectiveness of existing codes that have been
developed by the investigators at UC San Diego. The software component of the
project will have a substantial impact on research involving the modeling of
complex systems as it will provide scientists and engineers with instant access
to state-of-the-art methods. Within the Computational and Applied Mathematics
Group, the Investigators offer a program of instruction and research that
emphasizes the role of computational science in the formulation, modeling, and
solution of problems from diverse and changing areas. The activities associated
with this project will help attract advanced graduate students into the area of
computational science, which plays a vital role in the study of systems arising
in manufacturing, engineering and the natural sciences.
