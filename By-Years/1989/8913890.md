Drs. Howard Bigelow and Margaret Barr were mycologists (fungal specialists) on
the faculty at the University of Massachusetts prior to their retirement. During
their long careers, they amassed the country's most comprehensive collection of
fungi from the northeast U.S. The University has decided to discontinue its
mycology program, and has offered this important collection to the New York
Botanical Garden. NYBG has absorbed several regional collections of cryptogams
in the recent past, and is emerging as one of the world's premier repositories
of fungal specimens. The proposed transfer of the University of Massachusetts
mycology collections to the New York Botanical Garden will provide improved
access to an important research resource. NYBG will integrate the new collection
and will publish a catalog of the type specimens it contains, increasing the
utilization of the collection for biodiversity research.
