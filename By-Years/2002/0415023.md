The project aims to use workload forecasting in approximate query evaluation
applications. For this purpose, existing forecasting techniques are leveraged to
develop an approach for forecasting a sequence of workloads for a future time
interval based on the data access pattern. These applications operate in two
phases: off-line compression and on-line query evaluation. In the first phase,
an access pattern is extracted from a sequence of accessed data elements mapped
from the queries in a log, and is used to forecast a workload for each
subinterval of a given future time interval. This generates a sequence of
workloads. The workload information is then used to compress the data elements
targeted for each subinterval. The compressed data elements are then stored on
disk and, at run-time, loaded and translated into a main memory data structure
needed for query evaluation in each subinterval. These steps of forecast,
compression, and loading combined directly influence the trade-off between the
approximate query result accuracy and query speed, thereby necessitating an
optimization. The research will have immediate impacts in application areas
needing the approximate query evaluation abilities of DBMSs, particularly those
needing to use limited system resources effectively through workload
forecasting. Furthermore, the developed techniques will have impacts in various
fields of science and engineering by enabling efficient and effective
utilization of limited resources based on forecasted
workload.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
