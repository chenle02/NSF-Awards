ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 May 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1122952&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution&lt;br/&gt;PI: R. Trask&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests 5
years of support (2011-2015) for the oceanographic Wire Pool managed by Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). This facility is necessary to properly
support federally-funded oceanographic research aboard vessels in the US
Academic Research Vessel Fleet (www.unols.org). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The Wire Pool provides "the essential link between a surface vessel and
specific area of interest [to science] in the deep ocean." Wire ropes and cables
support a wide variety of instrumentation and sampling devices throughout the
Academic Research Vessel Fleet from standard equipment such as corers and CTD's
to advanced systems from the National Deep Submergence Facility like the
DSL-120A to the JASON II ROV. Maintaining a centralized wire pool that
supervises appropriate distribution has proven to be an efficient and cost-
effective system that optimizes the availability of oceanographic cables and
wire ropes to ships and science as they arise.
