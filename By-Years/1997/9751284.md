For the past 3 years, the proposers have developed (on a small scale of 15 18
students) a modeling course (MA581B) based on fundamental physical processes:
heat flow, wave propagation, and fluid and structural dynamics. Among the
specific topics covered in the course have been thermal imaging and detection,
dynamics properties (stiffness, damping) of structures such as beams and plates,
acoustics, and fluid transport. The course, at a level appropriate for juniors,
seniors, and first-year graduate students in the mathematical sciences, has been
an unqualified success and is being expanded from a one-semester trial course to
a two-semester regular course sequence. One of the difficulties during the past
3 years has been the necessity to use several different laboratories (e.g., NASA
Langley, local industries, and even other universities) throughout the semester.
In order to bring this pedagogy to a wider group of students (including students
from a new Applied Mathematics Honors Program and students in selected sections
of undergraduate courses), the university must have a dedicated laboratory where
experiments can be scheduled at the convenience of the courses using it. The
objective of the new equipment acquisition is to equip an instructional
laboratory for undergraduate mathematics majors. Several specific areas
(thermal, acoustic, mechanical vibrations, and Fourier analysis) of capabilities
can be developed for the laboratory experiments and demos. For prospective
academicians as well as young mathematical scientists entering the industrial
(multidisciplinary) workforce, the experiences afforded by these laboratory-
based mathematics courses are invaluable.
