With the availability of advanced computing facilities and the improvement of
the environment of floating point arithmetic, there is a need and an opportunity
for further development and analysis of accurate, stable and efficient numerical
solutions for many numerical linear algebra problems. This proposal is concerned
with several fundamental matrix computation problems, such as computing
eigenvalues of large nonsymmetric matrices, computing invariant subspaces with
specific spectra, estimating condition numbers of the nonsymmetric eigenvalue
problem, and computing the generalized QR factorization and the generalized
singular value decomposition. The goal of the research is to develop efficient
algorithms and portable software for high- performance computers, motivated by
many applications of these problems in scientific computing and other areas of
numerical analysis.
