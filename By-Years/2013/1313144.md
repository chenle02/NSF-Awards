The Trojan asteroids orbit the Sun in a 1:1 resonance with Jupiter, centered on,
and librating around, that planet's L4 and L5 Lagrange points. Originally
thought to have been captured form the outer parts of the asteroid belt, the
Trojans are proposed in newer theories to have been captured from the Kuiper
belt during a period of extreme mixing of the small bodies of the Solar System.
In-depth study of these objects provides constraints on the degree of dynamical
mixing in the early Solar System as well as on the compositions of primitive
bodies. In this project, the Principal Investigator and collaborators will use
ground-based telescopes in Arizona and South Africa to make visible and near-
infrared spectrophotometric observations of hundreds of Trojan asteroids as well
as dozens of near-Earth objects (NEOs), obtaining taxonomic classifications and
spectral slopes. Determining the relative fractions of the dominant taxonomic
classes at different sizes of Trojans will constrain dynamical mixing implied by
the "Nice Model" of the early Solar System. By combining new and archival data,
the team hopes also to determine whether the different spectral types seen are
related by "space weathering" processes or actually reflect compositional
differences. The NEO observations will complement other ongoing observational
programs and are designed to aid in the timely characterization of potentially
hazardous objects and possible space mission targets.
