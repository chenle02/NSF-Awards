A significant portion (70% and upwards, typically) of the cost of a medium to
large-scale computing system is in its software. In turn, two-thirds or so of
the software cost goes into maintenance--fixing the inevitable program bugs that
are discovered later. Capability-based addressing has been suggested as a
technique for detecting and avoiding many run-time errors because of its
usefulness in enforcing small protection domains, data abstraction and secure
module interfaces. Several machines proposed or implemented in the past to
support capability-based addressing have been plagued by their abysmally slow
speed. The purpose of the research project is to design a high-speed capability
mechanism, examine and evaluate its implementation assuming realistic
technological constraints. The project starts with the formulation of a simple,
yet powerful set of primitives for the capability mechanism, followed by the
design and simulation of an architecture using these mechanisms. High-level
benchmarks would then be run on the simulator to evaluate the architecture.
