Modern human society relies heavily on web applications and is deeply affected
by their poor dependability. Unfortunately, no matter how much effort is put
into verification and validation of software, existing techniques are inherently
limited, and software is routinely released with bugs and issues that limit its
functionality and can dramatically affect the user experience. This project
investigates an approach that has the potential to significantly improve the
scalability and effectiveness of symbolic program analysis and verification
techniques, that will improve the dependability of modern web applications,.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops techniques and tools that use
symbolic execution and automata-based verification techniques to automatically
analyze and verify web applications, and store results of symbolic analyses in a
graph database for efficient storage, and retrieval. The methods use incremental
and differential analysis strategies that utilize the graph database in order to
improve scalability and effectiveness of software analysis and verification. The
project trains graduate students, and will make its artifacts publicly available
to other researchers and educators.
