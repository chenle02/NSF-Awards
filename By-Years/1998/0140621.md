The objective of this work is to prepare foldamers (unnatural oligomers or
biopolymers) that adopt defined and predictable conformations. They will
synthesize and conformationally analyze a number of heterogeneous oligomers
where one type of monomer (such as alpha amino acids) provides functional
diversity while another type of monomer (cyclically constrained beta or gamma
amino acids) provides conformational specificity and stability. Homogeneous
oligomers containing just gamma amino acids will also be synthesized and
analyzed as will oligomers that are heterogeneous due to monomer stereochemistry
variations. Once new oligomers are identified that adopt specific conformations
in aqueous solutions, they will be tested for stability to proteolytic
degradation and for their ability to move across membranes of living cells.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Samuel H. Gellman of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Wisconsin. Dr. Gellman will explore the synthesis of new proteins
using combinations of natural and unnatural amino acids. These proteins will
then be screened to look for those which adopt specific conformations (shapes)
in aqueous (water based) solutions. Those which do fold into specific and
predictable shapes will be screened for their affinity to biomolecular targets.
In particular, they will be screened for their ability to disrupt other protein-
protein interactions. Controlled disruption of protein-protein interactions has
possible future biomedical science applications in cancer prevention. Students
trained as a result of working on this project will gain experience in
bioorganic and supramolecular organic chemistry, hence they will have skills
needed by the pharmaceutical and speciality chemicals industries.
