Scaffolding Understanding by Redesigning Games for Education (SURGE) is a three
year exploratory project focusing on the redesign of popular commercial video
games to support students? understanding of Newtonian mechanics. In support of
this goal, SURGE develops and implements design principles for game-based
learning environments integrating research on conceptual change, cognitive
processing-based design, and socio-cognitive scripting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial development enhances ?marble? virtual obstacle
course games with visual signaling techniques to help make explicit underlying
physics properties and processes present in the games. SURGE augments this
popular type of game to help learners extend and connect the rich tacit
understandings that video games typically support with broader explicit
formalized knowledge structures to facilitate transfer across contexts. These
enhanced games thus bridge the gap between student learning in non-formal game
environments and the formalized knowledge structures learned in school by
leveraging and integrating the strengths of each. As a consequence, school
learning is more attainable and more broadly applicable.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project strategies and assessment focus on closing
achievement, motivation, and self-efficacy gaps among female students, English
language learners, and students with low prior success in science. Various
methods are used to assess learning such as the Force Concept Inventory, the
Patterns for Adaptive Learning Survey, and the Test of Science Related
Attitudes. An iterative design and test process is used with full experimental
design and random assignments in late phases. &lt;br/&gt;
