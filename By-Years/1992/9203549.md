Dr. Sonny Lee has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Lee's
doctoral degree was from Harvard under the supervision of Professor Richard
Holm. Dr. Lee intends to continue research at the California Institute of
Technology with Professor Harry Gray where he intends to study photoinitiated
electron transfer. This will also expose him to techniques of molecular biology
such as site directed mutagenesis, and protein purification and handling. This
experience will prepare him for his long term goals of studying the coupling of
electron transfer to chemically active sites in biological systems. %%% The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.'s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
