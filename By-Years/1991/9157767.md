This project focuses on techniques for photorealistic visualization of sampled
scalar, vector, and tensor fields of three spatial dimensions --- i.e. volume
data. A key requirement of the photorealistic approach is real-time image
generation. The goal is to provide tools of sufficient power and polish that
scientists and physicians, not their assistants, will use them. Since no
commercial workstation is capable of rendering usefully large volume datasets in
real-time, the research plan includes a significant architectural component.
