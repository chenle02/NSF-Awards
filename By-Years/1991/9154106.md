Hughes Aircraft Company is contributing up to $15M and a corporate platform to
develop the Hughes GALAXY Classroom (SM) targeted for educationally at-risk
children in our nation's elementary schools. It is a systematic program to
strengthen curriculum through the development of video-based supplementary
educational materials distributed, unscrambled, via a dedicated satellite
interactive network without commercial advertising. Hughes GALAXY Classroom (SM)
includes integrated classroom activities and materials and a strong enhancement
program for teachers, administrators, and parents. The three-year demonstration
will include two 13-part science video programs (closed captioned, Spanish
track) for grades K-2 and 3-5 and comparable programs for English- language
arts, broadcast to 37 representative urban and rural elementary schools (and one
in Mexico), reaching 190 classrooms and teachers and 6,000 students. Also,
included will be hands-on science curriculum materials and substantial formative
and independent summative evaluations. The following operational phase will
provide an expanded curriculum with a goal of 20,000 schools by the year 2000,
supported by public and private funding sources. A prestigious eight-member
Science Advisory Board will guide the Project.
