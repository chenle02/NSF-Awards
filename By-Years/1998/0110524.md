&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
develop a novel non-contact strain sensor for quality control in production of
polymers and fiber-reinforced composites. By measuring residual strains, good
parts can be distinguished from bad parts in the production stream. Internal and
surface residual strains will be measured by a strain gauge based on the
principle of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR). A small percentage of tiny
additive crystals are blended into the resin during fabrication of the
composite. For strain measurement, the composite is irradiated with radio
frequencies (RF) to evoke a strain-dependent NQR response from the embedded
crystals. Phase I manufactured parts with embedded additive via compression
molding. Phase II will build a single-sided strain prototype and measure
residual strains in pultruded parts. The NQR-active additive will be introduced
into the pultrusion process, and several batches of different types of
composites, e.g., fiberglass, will be manufactured. Pultrusion will permit
several large batches of samples to obtain the statistics needed to refine the
NQR-based quality control method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial
applications are expected in many industries, such as civil infrastructure,
automotive, sporting goods, aerospace, and many others utilizing composite
materials.&lt;br/&gt;
