9412285 Sites Coral snakes (Elapidae:Micrurus) constitute a large and colorful
group of highly neurotoxic New World snakes that attain high species diversity
in the tropics and have served as models for a variety of studies of mimicry.
Recent studies of their phylogenetic (genealogical) relationships have failed in
many respects; species groups have only been tentatively identified and remain
weakly supported. The present study will address this problem using a
combination of morphological, isozyme, and mtDNA sequence data. Its second
objective will be to develop a hypothesis about the history of change in venom
biochemistry within this group of snakes using 10-12 commonly assayed venom
enzymes. This hypothesis will provide a framework for additional natural history
and venom toxicity studies of the species within an ecological context.
