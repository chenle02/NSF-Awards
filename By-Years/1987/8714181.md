This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds to establish a
fluorescence imaging facilities center. The fluorescence imaging center will
draw on the strengths of the Center for Fluorescence Research in Biomedical
Sciences, the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, the Center for Art and
Technology, and several companies. This facilities center will integrate the
technologies of quantitative fluorescence microscopy, imaging technology,
computational science, graphics display computer science, and advanced
instrumentation developments to construct the next generation quantitative
fluorescence microcope/imaging system for the biomedical sciences. One system
will be assembled for fluorescence spectroscopy on living cells and tissues and
another for immunofluorescence and fluorescence-based in situ hybridization of
nucleic acid probes. These systems will have an immediate impact on research in
cellular, developmental, and molecular biology. The instrumentation and
methodology developed will directly benefit 30 researchers in the Fluorescence
Center when fully operational. Researchers outside of the Center will benefit
from the development of new sophisticated equipment as it becomes accessible to
all biomedical researchers within the next few years.
