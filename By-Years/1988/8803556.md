The project will study the coherence concepts for a given assessment of
likelihood. The whole field of Bayesian analysis is based on the subjective
assignments of probabilities to the observed events. Such assignments are only
locally coherent. On the other hand the measure theoretic model for
probabilities requires countable additivity of the probabilities, a condition
that is hard to accept on philosophical grounds. A theory will be developed to
address questions of both coherence and mathematical properties such as
countable additivity. The theory will be developed based on the concepts of
upper and lower exchange rates. The research will have applications to non-
Boolean event structures of quantum mechanics necessary to give notions of
quantum probability.
