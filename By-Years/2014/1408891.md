The meeting "Scattering and Inverse-Scattering in Multi-Dimensions" will be held
on the campus of the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, during the period
May 15-23, 2014. The meeting features three days of conference talks (including
tutorials) on May 15-17 followed by five days of workshop activity on May 19-23,
separated by a break on May 18. The purpose of this conference is to bring
together workers in integrable systems, dispersive nonlinear equations, and
inverse scattering to forge collaborative links and advance research on
completely integrable, two-dimensional systems, particularly dispersive models
of nonlinear waves and normal matrix models. The meeting will pursue several
lines of inquiry: (1) semiclassical limits of the direct and inverse scattering
transforms, (2) eigenvalue distributions of random normal matrices, (3)
exceptional sets and soliton solutions, and (4) one-dimensional limits of two-
dimensional integrable systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring
together participants with expertise in pure and applied mathematics to attack
problems with relevance for applications in physics, engineering, medicine, and
oceanography. Applications to physics include models of random media, solvable
models in statistical physics, mesoscopic physics, biophysical models, and water
wave theory. Applications to engineering and medicine include non-destructive
testing of materials and medical imaging. A common mathematical structure
underlies all of these applications: the goal is to make progress in the
understanding of applications in these diverse areas through collaboration among
pure mathematicians, applied mathematicians, and numerical analysts. The award
supports participation in the meeting by twenty junior researchers and fifteen
senior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting web site:
