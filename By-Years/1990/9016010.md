The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Philip
Goode of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Dr. Wojciech Dziembronski of
the Copernicus Astronomical Center is to use helioseismic data to determine the
stability of the internal rotation and magnetism of the Sun. The researchers
intend to relate this degree of stability to the properties of the dynamo during
the solar surface activity cycle. Additionally, the work will emphasize use of
similar seismic data to learn more about Ap star magnetic fields and the origin
of such stars' spectral properties. The combined results of the work will build
upon our knowledge of the seismology of slowly rotating, nonmagnetic Ap stars
and should contribute to better developed solar and stellar evolution models.
The project in stellar evolution fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
