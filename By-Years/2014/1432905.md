ACM MobiHoc conference is the leading international conference on the theory and
practice of mobile multi-hop wireless networks. It invites research
contributions addressing the challenges in the area of multi-hop wireless
networks, ranging from cognitive radio networks to ad hoc networks. The
conference features a high-quality technical program, with an acceptance rate of
around 10% out of around 250 submissions. It has a single-track session, which
offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups that foster
technical and social interactions among a diverse set of participants. MobiHoc
is also an international conference that stimulates exchanges between various
international research communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help
increase the representation and participation of United States-based students at
the conference by providing 20 or more travel grants limited to a maximum of
$750 each. By creating new opportunities for graduate students, especially those
from under-represented groups, to attend a high-quality conference, this award
will benefit the students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-
class researchers, inspire them to try new research directions, providing
mentoring opportunities, as well as the chance to seek out internships and post-
doctoral positions which will help the students advance in their research
career.
