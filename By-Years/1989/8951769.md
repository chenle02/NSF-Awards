The existing X-ray diffractometer will be upgraded and computerized for data
acquisition and analysis. The upgraded instrument will be used in a series of
intermediate level laboratories and in courses in mineralogy, sedimentology, and
petrology. Through these laboratories, students will learn how to use the
instrument to answer their own research questions. An important focus of several
of these improved laboratories will be sediments from Seneca Lake, on which the
colleges are located, and on which they maintain a research vessel to support
studies of the lake and its sediments. An upgraded and automated diffractometer
will provide greater support for this unique undergraduate research opportunity.
The college will provide 50% matching funds.
