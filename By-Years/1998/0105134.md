Domestication occurs as humans select and cultivate plants from wild
populations. In many crop species, the adoption of high-yielding, uniform
cultivars has resulted in the abandonment of genetically variable, indigenous
varieties. It is well known that during these later stages of domestication,
genetic diversity is lost as high-yield crops are developed; however, the fate
of genetic variation during the early stages of domestication (prior to
intensive plant breeding) is not known. This study examines the process of
domestication in a tropical fruit tree, the purple mombin (Spondias purpurea
L.), which is believed to be in the early stages of domestication. DNA sequence
data will be used to pinpoint the geographic origin of the purple mombin, and to
examine relationships among cultivated and wild populations. Genetic variation
will be quantified to determine the proportion of total variation captured in
the cultivated populations.

Recently, much attention has refocused on crops and their wild relatives as
concerns mount about the lack of genetic diversity in cultivated species. This
proposal will result in a comprehensive assessment of the origin, distribution,
and amount of genetic variation in a tropical fruit tree, providing insights
into the evolutionary processes involved in the domestication of our cultivated
plants. Historical knowledge of cultivated plant populations will yield critical
information required for developing conservation strategies.
