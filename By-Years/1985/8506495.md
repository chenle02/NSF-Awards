This project provides resources to procure equipment for four projects at the
City College of the City University of New York. These projects address the
constitutive relation of a damaged bone-cement interface, the experimental-
analytical analysis of bone ingrowth prostheses, the analysis and prediction of
the dynamic fatigue failure of adhesive joints and the vibration of mechanisms
with clearances. The equipment comprises a holographic camera system and a
shaker system.
