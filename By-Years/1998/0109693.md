This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of fabricating a carbon nanotube based field emission device
(FED) and of operating FEDs. The approach is a natural extension of the patented
Nanotube Catalyst Retaining Structure (NCRS) method. Phase I is expected to
overcome limitations that have prevented FEDs from successful use in the
established liquid crystal display (LCD) market and to initiate a broad range of
other applications that require growth of aligned carbon nanotubes as functional
elements of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This new concept in
nanotechnology will be useful in application of carbon nanotubes as functional
elements of integrated circuit (IC) and MEMS devices involving a multi-layered
structure of metal, insulator, and carbon nanotubes.

Potential commercial applications are expected in field emission displays,
electron microscopes, illumination devices, sensors, and similar devices.
