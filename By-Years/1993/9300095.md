9300095 Eyler This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida in the
purchase of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance Mass Spectrometer. Four
faculty members whose research is dependent upon Fourier transform mass
spectroscopy will greatly benefit from the acquisition of this instrument.
Research projects to be carried out with this instrument include: 1) Resolution
of glow discharge polyatomic interferences, 2) Electrospray FT-mass spectral
studies of mono-nuclear and polynuclear metal complex ions, 3) Spectroscopic and
thermodynamic studies of gas-phase photoactive metal complexes, 4) Reactions of
metal and semiconductor clusters and photodissociation spectroscopy, 5) Laser
formation and photodissociation of ions, 6) Formation and bimolecular reactivity
of pyridinium ions. %%% A Fourier transform mass spectrometer is capable of
extremely high mass-resolution and is used to measure the precise molecular
weight of a molecular ion. It may also be used to obtain highly detailed
information about ion molecule reactions in the gas phase. This information may
be used to help determine the atomic composition and, sometimes, the molecular
geometry of a molecule. ***
