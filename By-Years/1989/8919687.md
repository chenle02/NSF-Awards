This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will support the research of Dr. Edward I. Solomon in bioinorganic chemistry.
Metal complexes which are models of the active sites of such metalloproteins as
plastocyanin, the azurins, cucumber blue copper protein and iron sulfur protein
will be investigated by a wide range of spectral methods. Studies will focus on
reduced Cu(I) and HS Fe(II) centers, attempting to define their electronic
structures and the change on ionization, thus probing the oxidation-reduction
properties of such protein active sites. Excited state spectral studies will
extend to two-iron and four-iron sulfur clusters to define features associated
with dimer interactions and electron delocalization. Also, spectra of a series
of Blue Copper proteins will be compared to plastocyanin in an attempt to
correlate structural variations with reactivity.
