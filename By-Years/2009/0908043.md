This collaborative award will fund continuation of a project to measure
distances to the Galactic high velocity clouds (HVCs), massive clouds of neutral
hydrogen gas moving at velocities incompatible with a simple model of
differential galactic rotation. Since they stand out from the gas in the
Galactic Disk, they can be used as test particles for energetic phenomena in the
Milky Way. The program will study HVC metallicities and distances using
interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of stars projected against the
clouds. The results of this project will be important for estimates of several
fundamental parameters of Galactic evolution, including the rate of infall of
low metallicity gas, the potential of the dark matter halo, the rate of
circulation of gas between Disk and Halo, and the fraction of ionizing photons
escaping the Disk.

The Broader Impacts of this program include training of graduate and
undergraduate students.
