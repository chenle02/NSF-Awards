The overall objective of this project is to improve undergraduate education in
the psychology department. Specific objectives of the project are to (1) improve
the overall teaching of courses in the psychology curriculum, (2) improve the
teaching of general scientific principles and methods, (3) improve the teaching
of critical thinking skills, and (4) improve student attitudes about science and
computer technology. These objectives are being met by creating a computer
laboratory capable of sustaining a cohesive sequence of courses in research and
statistical methodology in psychology. The laboratory consists of 15 linked
computer workstations that contain software specifically designed to enhance
learning in a required sequence of courses that convey the principles and
content of the scientific study of psychology. The purpose of this project is to
facilitate a shift in the emphasis of undergraduate education in psychology from
one of passive (lecture-based) learning to that of active (experiential)
learning, by allowing students to explore psychology-related concepts in a
hands-on, engaging manner. Furthermore, this project enables students to more
easily acquire the skills that will enable them to conduct their own research
projects, which will lead to greater enthusiasm toward developing, conducting,
analyzing, and reporting psychological research.
