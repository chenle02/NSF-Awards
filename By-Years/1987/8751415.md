William Miles, an award winning Black documentary filmmaker, will collaborate
with WNET, New York to produce "Black Stars In Orbit," an hour-long television
documentary for PBS broadcast on black astronauts and black Americans'
contributions to America's space program. The program will utilize personal
interviews with archival footage, family photographs, and news headlines to
profile such individuals as Edward Dwight, Jr., Guion Bluford, Jr., Ronald
McNair, Frederick Gregory, Patricia Cowings-Johnson and Robert Shurney.
Videotape copies of the program will be made available for use by national
organizations concerned with encouraging black youth in science and engineering.
This film project has a substantial opportunity to reinforce science and
engineering role models for black youth. Approximately 50% of the $450,000
project budget will be provided by NSF.
