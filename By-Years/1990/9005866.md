This facility is being developed to measure fast transient photoconductivity
with sub-picosecond resolution using electro- optic sampling techniques. The
fast transient photoinduced conductivity of high temperature superconducting
oxides will be studied initially. This facility will also permit measurements in
the sub-Picosecond time domain for the study of carrier generation recombination
and transport in conducting polymers, and will allow measurements of
superconducting transmission line characteristics from a few gigahertz (GHz) to
more than 200 GHz.
