The research objective of this project is to characterize the microscale
mechanical behavior of bone tissue. Bone is a hierarchically structured material
with organization levels ranging in size from nanometers to millimeters.
Composition and microstructure vary with age and disease. The majority of work
to date on mechanical characterization of bone has focused on macroscale
properties (e.g. millimeter-centimeter scale), and little is known about the
intrinsic mechanical properties of the mineralized tissue that constitutes the
building block of bones. This research project characterizes these properties by
applying micromachining techniques to isolate specific microstructural
components, which are then tested in simple compression. Micropillars ranging in
size from hundreds of nanometers to tens of microns are produced by femtosecond
laser ablation and focused ion beam micromachining techniques and then tested
using a modified nanoindenter. The results of the mechanical tests will be used
to develop micromechanical models of bone fracture.

The results of this research project will establish an experimental approach for
micro- and nanoscale mechanical characterization of a tissue whose mechanical
function is critical for musculoskeletal health. These methods will complement
existing techniques for studying age- and disease-related changes in bone
composition and microstructure by providing a means of determining how these
changes affect bone mechanical properties at the same length scale as the
changes themselves. This research project will also focus on professional
preparation of young scientists and engineers. Undergraduate and graduate
students will participate directly in the research activities. The research
activities will also be incorporated in courses and outreach events that expose
pre-college and non-technical students to the field of materials science and
engineering.
