Earnest 9511238 All living things have internal "clocks" so that even when they
are placed in constant environmental conditions, certain physiological functions
display spontaneous changes that cycle with a regular period of about 24 hours.
Specific cells in the hypothalamic region of the brain are believed to generate
the rhythm, but how they do so is unknown. With this award, Dr. David Earnest
will test if individual brain cells are programmed for spontaneous rhythms by
cloning individual cells and studying their innate potential to display rhythmic
changes in function. This work will advance basic understanding of biological
rhythms, and may also provide cell lines for future detailed biophysical qtudies
of the mechanisms of rhythm generation. ***
