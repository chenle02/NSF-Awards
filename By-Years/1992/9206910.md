Many formal techniques for testing software have been proposed, but relatively
little evidence has been gathered to indicate how effective these techniques
are. The goals of this research project are 1) to compare the fault-detecting
ability of various previously developed testing techniques, including control
flow based, data flow based, and mutation testing techniques, and 2) to evaluate
the effectiveness of partial symbolic evaluation of path expressions (PSE), a
heuristic technique that addresses certain semantic analysis issues arising in
testing. Fault-detecting ability of various test data adequacy criteria will be
compared experimentally by generating large numbers of test sets for each of
several subject programs, and measuring the proportion of adequate test sets
(according to the various criteria) that expose faults. Fault-detecting ability
will also be examined analytically by investigating conditions under which one
criterion is guaranteed to be better than another according to certain
probabilistic measures. Effectiveness of PSE will be investigated by measuring
the proportion of cases in which the heuristic succeeds.
