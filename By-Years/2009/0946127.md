This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing a
spin torque magnetoresistive random access memory (ST-MRAM) that has
significantly reduced write current. The highest bit density is possible if the
switching current is low enough to be passed by a minimum sized access
transistor beneath each magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) storage device. Reducing
the write current also improves reliability because the smaller current density
through the MTJ during the write operation reduces the stress on the thin
dielectric tunnel barrier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ST-MRAM has the potential to
provide non-volatility, high density, high speed,&lt;br/&gt;low power, and
unlimited endurance in a single memory. ST-MRAM technology has the potential to
meet the need for a high-performance, scalable semiconductor memory while
providing benefits in power consumption that are critical in portable
electronics and increasingly valued in many other areas, such as enterprise
computing. Conventional semiconductor memories like Static RAM, Flash, and
Dynamic RAM are facing significant scaling challenges in the coming years and
none of them have the unique set of attributes provided by MRAM.
