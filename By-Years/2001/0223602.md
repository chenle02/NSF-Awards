INT-0223602&lt;br/&gt;Stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 36 month
project submitted by Dr. Sheldon Stone, Syracuse University, to cooperate with
Professor CHEN Ting-Yang, Nanjing University, and Professors HE Mao and FENG
CunFeng, Shangdong University, China, to carry out a U.S.-China cooperative
project on BteV calorimetry. This is an excellent proposal for understanding the
use of lead tungstate crystals for applications in calorimetry, and can
contribute to the research and training interactions between high-energy physics
groups in the U.S. and China. This proposal addresses an important scientific
question and contributes to the NSF goals of human resource development. The
National Science Foundation of China and NSF will jointly support this project.
