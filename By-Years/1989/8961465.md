Microbial inoculants, in particular fluorescent pseudomonads, have been used to
control a variety of plant pathogens, both bacterial and fungal. Currently there
is a strong impetus to promote research and commercialize these biological
control agents due to increased environmental and health concerns over synthetic
pesticide use. However, while scientific interest and effort in microbial
pesticides is considerable, there remain many limitations for their use and
effectiveness. Some of these limitations are the difficulty of use over a
diversity of crops and limited knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution of
a root system with respect both to colonization and expression of antifungal
compounds. This proposal is directed towards defining the range of hosts
supporting the production of an antifungal compound, oomycin A, expressed by
Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Hv37a and toward identifying the effect of
constitutive expression of the antifungal compound over that host range. This
proposal is also intended to determine the timing, the site(s), and the
influence of wounding of roots on expression of oomycin A of a selected host.
This information will be used to help identify opportunities for generic
modification of the regulation of antifungal compound(s) for controlling
specific types of pathogens of those hosts. %%% The long range goal of this work
is the development of consistently effective microbial pesticides for protection
against soilborn plant pathogens as a less toxic alternative to synthetic
pesticides.
