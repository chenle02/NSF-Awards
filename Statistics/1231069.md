The proposed project is a workshop on "Developing Novel Statistical Methods in
NeuroImaging". The plan is to hold the workshop on July 24-26, 2012 at the
University of California at San Diego which will immediately precede the Joint
Statistical Meeting (JSM 2012) in San Diego, California. The primary goal of the
workshop is to identify open problems in statistical research that emerge from
current challenges in neuroimaging. The analysis of brain data presents
statistical challenges because of its massiveness, high dimensionality and
complex spatio-temporal dependence structure. It is anticipated that open lines
of statistical research will be identified -- especially in the areas of time
series, spatial analysis, dimension reduction, statistical learning, functional
data analysis, statistical computation and foundations of statistical inference.

To achieve the stated workshop goal, the first step is to equip quantitative
scientists (statisticians and mathematicians) with the necessary theoretical
background in neuroscience, thereby familiarizing them with the data. Several
lectures will be delivered by leading neuroscientists. The second step is to
cover the state-of-the-art statistical methods for the analysis of brain imaging
data and to identify the limitations of the current approaches. Scientists from
diverse research areas and career stages will meet in order to identify and
discuss key emerging areas of interdisciplinary neuroimaging research where
mathematical sciences promise to play an important role in the coming years. The
plan is to utilize funds from the NSF to provide partial support to young
researchers (including recent PhD grads, PhD and post-doctoral students). Junior
statisticians who belong to under-represented groups (e.g., women and
minorities) are encouraged to apply. Details on the workshop are available
