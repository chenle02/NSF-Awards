This project will deal with inverse problems arising in image reconstruction.
Attenuation and scattering of low energy probes by unknown media, soliton theory
applied to slice selection in magnetic resonance imaging, and application of
group representation to signal processing will be considered. In addition,
considerable effort will be placed in further developing a technique introduced
by the PI to obtain rank two solutions to certain partial differential
equations. This technique avoids using complicated algebraic geometry methods.
This project has been motivated by problems arising in imaging reconstruction
processes such as X rays and magnetic resonance. The mathematics to be developed
has direct implications in the construction of algorithms and devices used in
medical imaging.
