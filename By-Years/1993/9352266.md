Purchase of a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer will provide
the basis for laboratory curriculum development in years 2, 3, and 4 of the
undergraduate program. Following recent laboratory renovation and conversion to
microscale experiments, new experiments will be introduced into the sophomore
organic laboratories which require the sensitivity and resolution of this high
field instrument. In the senior organic course in qualitative organic analysis,
a research component involving 2-D examination of earlier spectral assignments
for complex molecules will be introduced. In the senior organometallics
laboratory course, new experiments will utilize multinuclear NMR to characterize
transition metal complexes and illustrate important concepts not possible to
demonstrate with presently available equipment. In physical chemistry
laboratory, experiments involving gas phase kinetics as well as relaxation
phenomena will be introduced. The instrument will also be used in a newly
organized undergraduate research program.
