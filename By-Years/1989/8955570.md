The University of Chicago will initiate a 4-week commuter Young Scholars
project for 81 students in grades 7-12 in mathematics. The University of Chicago
Department of Mathematics proposes to conduct a program in mathematics and
science, mainly for students who attend the Chicago public schools. The goal is
to identify mathematically talented students, especially members of minority
groups and females, early in their schooling, and maintain contact with them
over a period of several years. The program has three components, one for
students entering grades 7 and 8, one for students entering grades 9 and 10, and
one for students entering grades 11 and 12. Each component operates on a two
year cycle. We intend to provide participants with a rich and diverse experience
in computer science, mathematics, and physics.
