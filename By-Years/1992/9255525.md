The State University of New York College at Brockport, in cooperation with the
U.S. Geological Survey, will hold a two- week workshop in July 1993, at the
National Training Center in Denver, Colorado, for 25 selected undergraduate
college instructors of introductory courses with hydrology and water resources
content. The major purposes of the workshop are: (1) to bring participants up-
to-date on the science of hydrology and those technologies used to measure,
analyze, and calculate hydrologic flows, surface and groundwater resources, and
pollutant loadings and consequences; and (2) to equip and encourage these
teachers to use the latest in water resources information and instructional
materials in their classrooms. Educational materials developed by workshop
participants will be presented at the Twenty-Ninth Annual American Water
Resources Association Conference in the Fall of 1993.
