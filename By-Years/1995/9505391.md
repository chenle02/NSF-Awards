ABSTRACT OPP-9505391 This dissertation project will examine the effects on
local society and culture of community-based indigenous tourism development in a
small community in southwest Greenland. The main goal of the project will be an
assessment of the economic, social and cultural viability and sustainability of
this form of tourism. The project employs anthropological theory and methods and
serves as an important contribution to the study of sustainable development in
the Arctic as well as advancing the development of arctic-based research within
the wider concerns of social science. ***
