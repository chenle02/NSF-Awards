Funding is provided to support three key areas of scientific inquiry: 1)
developing a framework for evaluating speleothem proxy applicability that can be
used in multiple geographic regions; 2) understanding climate and hydrology
mechanistic links in semi-arid environments; and 3) integrating high-resolution
climate records with climate models for the central Texas region over a period
of significant environmental change so as to ground-truth climate models that
forecast future change for the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
involve supporting a graduate student and enhanced educational linkages with
another project awarded to the researcher and funded by the NSF for GK-12
Program that partners science graduate students with K-12 classes and a lecture
series with integrated webcasts that brings university science to K-12 educators
and the public. The science results from the project will aid further
understanding of climate and will specifically aid Texas water resource
managers.&lt;br/&gt;
