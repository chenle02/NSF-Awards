This project addresses the critical regional need of the medical community and
medical industry for well-trained biomedical electronic technicians by
developing an enhancement to the existing Biomedical Electronic Engineer
Technology program. The development effort specifies an interdisciplinary
curriculum to assure that students acquire strong mathematics, science,
computer, telecommunications, and other critical thinking skills as part of
their degree program. The project encompasses planning for curriculum
development, faculty enhancement, and laboratory improvement and establishes a
stronger partnership with the medical community and industry to increase
internship and co-op opportunities. In addition, the project addresses
articulation arrangements with secondary schools, and two- and four-year
colleges.
