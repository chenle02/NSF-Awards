9308911 Larson The research will determine the relative importance of
interfacial friction and interfacial toughness in maximizing crack retardation
while minimizing the possibility of fiber failure. The growth of a matrix crack
may be retarded if the fiber/matrix interface is cohesive and/or adhesive. The
benefits of raising the friction coefficient (cohesion) and critical energy
release rate (adhesion) must, however, be balanced against the potential for
fiber failure in the high stress zone near the periphery of a matrix crack or an
interfacial sliding zone. The resulting guidelines for designing optimal
interfaces will reveal implications for arresting small cracks. The
investigation will combine computational modeling in conjunction with
experiments on a model fibrous composite (glass/glass). ***
