This project supports a conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry to be held at
the University of Miami, Florida, from January 28 - February 1, 2013. More

While mirror symmetry initially arose from phenomena in string theory, this
active area at the interface between mathematics and physics has been shown to
be relevant to numerous mathematical structures. In particular, methods from
Lagrangian intersection theory and Floer homology theory, integrable systems and
wall-crossing, derived and higher categories, and non-commutative Hodge
structures are all intimately connected with homological mirror symmetry. The
wide range of topics in homological mirror symmetry research necessitates venues
such as this, particularly for early-career researchers to be introduced to and
stay abreast of current topics. The main topics of this conference will be wall
crossing, stability Hodge structures and topological quantum field theories.
There will be 3 lecture courses, by M. Kontsevich, by M. Abouzaid and by S.
Keel. There will be two discussion sessions.

The conference will result in dissemination of results and getting a young wave
of researchers to join these projects. All considerations on giving
opportunities to underrepresented groups were taken. The conference will also
serve to facilitate interactions between US-based researchers and international
participants who will be attended the conference. This will be particularly
beneficial for US-based graduate students and should lead to a fruitful exchange
of ideas among representatives of many mathematical communities. In addition,
the conference will be a means of "giving back to physics." Many of the ideas at
the beginning of the subject come from String theory - Mirror Symmetry. It is
time for the mathematical aspect to give back to physics. The singularities on
the discriminant loci we study correspond to a new physics theory of 6d type. In
this way the circle comes to a close.
