Herbst will conduct research in the area of partial differential equations in
quantum mechanics. The problems to be considered concern scattering theory and
the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Schrodinger equation which describe
bound particles. The former work will involve eigenfunction expansions
diagonalizing N-particle Hamiltonians and the investigation of the scattering
theory of homogeneous potentials of degree zero. Modern physics, quantum
mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth century. It is founded
firmly in the last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter and
to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance, electro-magnetism,
and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations for these developments,
collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of
Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles, to unified
field theory, which attempts to unite the four known forces into a single
theory.
