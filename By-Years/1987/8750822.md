A recently acquired Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR) is being
used in the laboratory programs in Analytical, Organic and Physical Chemistry at
Lafayette College. Experiments hitherto not possible, such as analyses of
residues in extracts from contaminated soils, studies of structural changes of
compounds upon interaction with solvents, and studies of very rapid
decomposition reactions, are being carried out. Contrasting the capabilities of
FTIR with dispersive infrared spectrophotometry in these cases gives a deeper
understanding of the inherent superiority of FTIR and of certain aspects of
instrument development. In addition, the availability of FTIR is increasing
student-faculty research activities, thus strengthening the professional
training of chemistry majors. At Lafayette College, a large proportion of these
are women.
