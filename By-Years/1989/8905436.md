This award in the Joint NSF/DARPA Initiative on Image Understanding and Speech
Recognition is for development of sensing and navigational algorithms for
service robots. The ultimate goal is to develop robots for servicing vehicles,
loading munitions, scraping paint on shipboard, scrubbing surfaces, etc. Indoor
robotics will be emphasized, although the studied techniques of passive stereo
vision and continuous- contact tactile sensing should also be of use for outdoor
robotics. The multidisciplinary team (including ties with several industrial
groups) will also study problem-solving techniques in machine learning,
planning, geometric reasoning, and robot control.
