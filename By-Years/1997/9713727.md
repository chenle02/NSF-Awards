Olsen 9713727 This grant provides funding for the study of batch production
environments with random yield. In these environments, products are produced in
batches because either setup times or setup costs between product types are
significant. Furthermore, the output from production is assumed to be highly
variable. The motivation for this work is from the automotive parts industry and
particularly a plant which produces molded and painted plastic bumpers. The
paint line in this plant has highly unpredictable yield and changeovers between
different paint colors are expensive. This research will further the development
of (a) models that take into account random yield in a continuous time
environment; (b) solution methods for these models that achieve computable error
bounds on optimal values using both discrete and continuous approximations; (c)
characterizations of general properties of optimal solutions of these random
yield models that provide insight into managerial decisions; and (d) comparisons
of discrete and continuous time models in general with insight into fundamental
model characteristics of each approach and their relationship to underlying
situations. The main impact of the research will be to improve decision making
in random yield systems. It will provide methods that have computable bounds and
that can be applied in a variety of settings from machining to painting to
semiconductor fabrication. The methodology will be tested on real data to ensure
that it is implementable in real time in complex manufacturing environments. The
results of this research are expected to have a significant effect on industries
critical to U.S. competitiveness (such as the automotive parts industry) where
product yield is highly variable. The investigators will work with interested
companies to ensure that the results are relevant. The research is also expected
to have significant academic contributions in the areas of queueing theory,
scheduling, and stochastic programming.
