The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental role of malate
metabolism in plant cells. 13C NMR spectroscopy is being used to determine the
compartmentation of malate between cytoplasm and vacuole in maize root tips.
These determinations are coupled with in vivo and in vitro measurements of
malate synthesis, decarboxylation, vacuolar transport and the conversion of
malate to other metabolites to obtain a comprehensive picture of the behavior of
malate within the cell. The results of these analyses will help establish 1) the
extent to which malate (versus pyruvate) is the major metabolite utilized to
drive the operation of the TCA cycle in plant mitochondria, 2) the role of
malate in the regulation of PEP carboxylase activity in the cytoplasm and 3) the
interplay between cytosolic bicarbonate levels and malate metabolism in response
to salt stress.%%% Malic acid (malate) has long been recognized for its
potential as a major intermediate compound associated with respiratory and
related metabolisms in higher plant cells. However, the exact importance of
malate has eluded precise clarification due to a lack of ability to measure
malate and its rates of synthesis/breakdown within the intact cell. This project
uses NMR spectroscopy, coupled with a series of more classical biochemical
assays, to look at the levels. rates and directions of movement of malate within
corn root tip cells to develop a precise picture of the role of malate in plant
respiratory metabolism. A better understanding of the function of malate in
plant respiration should lead to a clearer picture of what factors act to
regulate plant respiration and, ultimately, plant productivity.***
