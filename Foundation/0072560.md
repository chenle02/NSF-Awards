ABSTRACT

The first direction of the research will be an investigation of the ordinary
partition relation and the polarized partition with exponents 2 and 1,1
respectively.

The second direction will be the continuation of a long and fruitful
collaboration with Peter Komjath. The investigators will work on the following
topics: Square bracket partition relations for order types, the simultaneous
chromatic number and splitting of graphs, and the obligatory finite subsystems
of large chromatic set systems.

The PI will collaborate on compact scattered spaces with Istvan Juhasz:

The award will also contain Visitor Support, which the continues a very
successfull visitor program. Pofessor Saharon Shelah regularly spends the months
September and October at the Rutgers Mathematics Department. Many logicians come
to work with him on their problems.
