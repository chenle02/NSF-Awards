In order to develop a complete model of the evolution of the Universe, we need
to understand how all the components have evolved. One component that is not
well understood is the origin and evolution of the material between galaxies -
the intergalactic medium (IGM). The goal of this research is to combine an
analysis of very high quality quasar spectra with theoretical considerations to
answer open questions about the evolution of the IGM. Broader impacts of the
work include mentoring of underrepresented freshman undergraduates, training of
a graduate student, and a series of public lectures in the Seattle area to
astronomical societies and public schools.

The work will address several important issues concerning studies of the Lyman-
alpha forest, including a test of the standard picture of IGM evolution. By
combining high-resolution quasar spectra with numerical simulations, the
objective is to reconcile the existing observations with theoretical
expectations for the Lyman-alpha forest.
