Willick, Jeffrey 96-17188 Dr. Willick will conduct research on the subject of
large-scale deviations from uniform Hubble expansion. These peculiar velocities
are thought to be due to anisotropic gravitational forces that arise as matter
in the universe becomes increasingly clustered over time. Thus, they can be used
to test models of the formation of large- scale structure. Coherent peculiar
motions over volumes many tens of megaparsecs in diameter are indicative of mass
density fluctuations over comparable or larger scales. These mass fluctuations
must be shown to be consistent with angular fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation if the standard Big Bang model is to remain internally
consistent. The peculiar velocity field within the local universe can be mapped
in sufficient detail to compare with theoretical predictions based on redshift
survey data and thus provide strong constraints on the cosmological density
parameter.
