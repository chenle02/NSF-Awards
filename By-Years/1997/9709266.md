IUTAM SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR UNBOUNDED DOMAINS This symposium
will be held on July 27-31, 1997 at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
Sponsored by the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and
attended by sixty researchers from fifteen countries, the symposium will focus
on the use of non-reflecting computational boundaries to address wave-
propagation problems in unbounded domains. Such problems frequently arise in
acoustics, aeronautics, electrical engineering, meteorology, oceanography,
ultrasonics, and seismology &amp; earthquake engineering. The objectives of this
symposium are to improve communication on this topic across several scientific
and engineering disciplines, illuminate the performance characteristics of
recently developed methods, and facilitate the formulation of improved methods,
especially for highly challenging problems. In pursuit of these objectives,
participants will propose and then agree on some generic benchmark problems with
which to compare the characteristics of existing methods, and brainstorm
promising approaches for the development new methods.
