The PI will test microplate in the Pito Deep area of the Easter Microplate
using a submersible-mounted magnetic gradiometer during a French Nautile
expedition to the area in late 1992. The results should make an important
contribution towards resolving the relative importance of deformation and rigid-
plate rotation in microplate tectonics.
