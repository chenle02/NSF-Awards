This research is to develop a new technique for mapping the geometry and
internal properties of fault zones by means of seismic waves travelling inside
the low-velocity wave guide of the fault zone. For vertical faults such as the
San Andreas, conventional seismic reflection and refraction techniques have not
met with much success. The use of dispersive properties of trapped modes should
lead to a better delineation of the fault zone, and a better understanding of
the source rupture process and the process of earthquake occurrence. The work
will consist of both field observations and theoretical modeling of the trapped
modes. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
