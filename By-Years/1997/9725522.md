ABSTRACT REC 972552 The University of Texas at Austin will accomplish the
preliminary planning for a new educational center, called the Center for the
Improvement of Science, Technology, and Mathematics Education. The Center, when
established, will develop the national infrastructure for research on systemic
improvement of science, mathematics and technology instruction. The primary
discipline focus would be on the implementation of standards-based instruction,
with supporting policy and technology. The planning phase will establish the
infrastructure necessary to support the Center. The activities undertaken will
include: forging partnerships, within the University and with the state;
developing organizational and managerial strategies; establishing sites for
implementation activities; and developing a corresponding graduate program. Much
of the planning will be accomplished through a series of small conferences, each
with a focus on a particular aspect of the Center infrastructure.
