9406295 Slemrod This proposal outlines proposed research in three areas: (i)
kinetic modeling of gases exhibiting change of phase and metastable states, (ii)
resolution of Riemann problems of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws via
hydrodynamic and viscous limits, (iii) analysis of the structure of shock waves
for spherically symmetric three dimensional fluid flow. The main goal is the
understanding of the dynamics of these highly nonlinear phenomena and applying
this insight to interpretation of the motivating physical problems. The
technical approach to the above research will be to (i) examine cluster
Boltzmann like dynamics and try to simulate van de Waals intermolecular
attractions to develop discrete velocity phase transition models: (ii) apply
self similar scaling methods to recover hydrodynamic and viscous limits for
systems of conservation laws, (iii) impliment the viscous self similarity method
to the analysis of spherically symmetric gas dynamics (conservation laws of
mass, momentum, energy).
