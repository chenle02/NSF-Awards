ABSTRACT PROPOSAL #: DEB 9710790 PI.: Dr. Gregory Florant INSTITUTION: Colorado
State University This proposal seeks support for a workshop to be held at
Colorado State University on February 28 and March 1, 1997. The goal of the
workshop is to provide a unique opportunity for faculty and administrators from
16 midwest and mountain state universities and colleges, the majority of which
are land-grant institutions, to discuss in depth, life science issues that are
now, and will continue to, face these institutions in the coming years. On many
campuses life science programs are organized along traditional disciplinary
lines, are spread out over the campus, and are not optimally meeting the needs
of life science students for the 21st Century. Many issues such as, how should
introductory courses be organized for majors in different disciplines, how
should departments be organized at a land-grant universities with numerous life
science departments, and what administrative structure best suits a land-grant
university for the life sciences, will be discussed during a series of plenary
sessions and breakout groups. Concrete, implementable recommendations are the
expected outcome of this workshop.
