9527592 CLARK Genes that influence fertilization success are likely to be under
strong natural selection. Despite this selection, the genes are variable within
populations, which makes this an interesting system to study how genetic
variation is maintained. This project will quantify how genetic variation
affects gamete competition in the fruitfly Drosophila. This model organism
allows examination of general questions that would be much harder to study in
larger organisms. Several aspects of gamete competition will be studied,
including genetic variation among females in the tendency to use gametes from
different males, and the opportunity for male by female interactions in the
magnitude of gamete competition. The genes that encode the male accessory gland
proteins (Acps) have been identified as likely components of gamete competition.
Joint analysis of molecular sequence variation within species and variation in
gamete competition will allow inferences of causal connections between Acp genes
and gamete competition. Experiments will pursue components of displacement from
both directions: from phenotypic variation in sperm displacement toward
identifying the molecular basis for the difference, and from identifying
molecular variants toward testing their effects on gamete competition. Results
of recent and proposed experiments raise several crucial theoretical questions
about the maintenance of variation in genes that affect gamete competition.
Results from the theoretical work will suggest explanations for the maintenance
of variation and the rapid evolution of Acp genes.
