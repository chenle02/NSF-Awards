This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program is made to
Dr. Michael P. Castellani of the Chemistry Department, Marshall University.
Pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl complexes of (1) chromium and iron phosphines and
isocyanides and of (2) zirconium (IV) oxides and sulfides, and related niobium
and tantalum hydrides, will be prepared. Reactivity of the electron-deficient
radical species produced is expected to be reduced by the introduction of the
bulky pentaphenyl- cyclopentadienyl group. These compounds are of interest
because they serve as models for radical intermediates that have been proposed
for many catalytic and organometallic reactions. Once prepared, the catalytic
activity and mechanisms of substitution reactions of these compounds will be
explored and implications for analogous reactions drawn. %%% Highly reactive
species important in catalytic processes are not easily characterized, but this
project allows determination of the reactivity of closely-related species. The
findings have implications for catalyst development and sensor technology. The
research will be carried out by undergraduate students.
