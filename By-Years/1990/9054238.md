This workshop is considering methods, problems, and curricula changes necessary
to use and teach the General Purpose Instrumentation Bus (GPIB) laboratory in
the undergraduate EE curriculum. The workshop stresses the smoothe integration
of GPIB equipment and computer simulation into sophomore and junior courses.
During the workshop, each participant is developing an experiment of his/her own
design; during the subsequent academic year, each participant writes a report on
the GPIB activities at their institution.//
