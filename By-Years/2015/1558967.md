Data breaches are a major threat to societal progress. The use of computers in
financial, healthcare, and in any business enterprise requires that sensitive
data be protected from unauthorized access. However, banks like JP Morgan Chase,
medical insurance companies like Anthem, and enterprises like Target and Home
Depot have been the target of massive data breaches that have cost millions of
dollars, eroded trust and reputation among users, and in some cases, even cost
the chief executives their jobs. As we move towards wiring up homes, offices,
and vehicles to computers, it is imperative that we lay a secure foundation that
protects sensitive data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breaches occur because data is
vulnerable when in use by applications. Once an application is exploited, it is
used to leak sensitive data records to an unauthorized user. Neither regulating
policies and processes through regulations like HIPAA nor encrypting data at
rest and in transit can fully address such breaches that stem from compromised
apps. Instead, data-security as a service is introduced. The team's key insight
is that while existing security mechanisms protect applications, the proposed
platform takes users' access control policies, translates them into information
flow control policies on untrusted apps automatically, and ensures that even if
an app is malicious or compromised it cannot leak data to an unauthorized user
or remote server. In addition to protecting data, the proposed platform frees
enterprises from vetting each application they trust sensitive data to - this
could unleash many creative apps for users and enterprises that today do not
have access to sensitive data. This I-Corps team has been in touch with several
external resources that will assist the team in accomplishing the required
I-Corps objectives and customer discovery. This includes high-level executives
from hospitals, platform providers, and medical application developers.
