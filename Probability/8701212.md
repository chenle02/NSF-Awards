This research has three components. The first part will be carried out by both
the investigators in association with each other and the other two, separately.
The first part will study the occupation measures for Gaussian random fields.
The occupation measure is the measure of the subset of the index space on which
the random field takes values in a specified set. One of the investigators has
already established some relationship between the occupation measure and the
capacity of a set. The investigators now plan to explore these results further.
Investigator Pitt will continue his probabilistic analysis of lacunary
trigonometric series and will investigate further the utility of "local
nondeterminism" in sample path analysis of Levy processes. Investigator Taylor
plans to continue his development of analytic tools relevant to the sample path
analysis of Levy processes.
