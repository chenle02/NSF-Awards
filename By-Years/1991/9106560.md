The continuing interest in information retrieval systems is based upon the need
to cope with the massive problems associated with storage, access, and retrieval
of information. It is clear that text processing is a vast area, which
encompasses information retrieval, is of prime importance in computing and
beyond, and that it also relates to many aspects of computing, including
architecture, data and file structures, and, of late, graphics and interface
design. The ACM/SIGIR International Conference on Research and Development in
Information Retrieval (ICRDIR) is the premier conference concerned with the
vital area of information access and retrieval as it effects the important
issues in text processing. The topics at ACM/SIGIR are highly interdisciplinary.
At least ten graduate students from different disciplines in various
universities across the country are invited to participate in the conference,
based on submitted papers, in order to be able to present their work and be
exposed to scholars from all over the world doing parallel work. The students'
participation offers them the opportunity of getting wide feedback on their
ideas, and on the other hand enriches the conference by their innovative ideas.
