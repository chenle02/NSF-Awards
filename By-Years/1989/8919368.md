Two potassium channels: one, K(ATP) sensitive to ATP, and the other, K(Ca, V),
sensitive to calcium and voltage, play a pivotal role in excitation-secretion
coupling in beta cells of the endocrine pancreas. Both channels are glucose
sensitive, implicating them as part of the cell glucose sensing mechanism,
linking glucose stimulation to insulin secretion. Previous patch clamp studies
have shown that the K(ATP) channel modulation by glucose is mediated via
inhibition of a protein kinase A- dependent phosphorylation process. The
proposed patch clamp and biochemical studies primarily aim to demonstrate that
glucose induced K(Ca, V) channel inhibition is mediated via protein kinase C
(PKC) and G protein activity. From our preliminary data it is hypothesized that
the K(Ca, V) channel possesses a G protein binding site that is occupied either
by an active, non- phosphorylated, alpha subunit of Gk (alpha k), or following
an increase of PKC activity, by the phosphorylated inactive form (alpha k.P),
the binding of alpha k.P resulting in channel inhibition. It is further proposed
that activation of PKC following production of diacylglycerol in response either
to increased glucose metabolism or to activation of phospholipase C by alpha k,
is essential for K channel modulation. This finding of PKC and alpha k
regulation of K channel activity will permit the formulation of a model which
will integrate the function of various insulin secretagogues that modulate beta-
cell function via protein kinases and G proteins. Investigation of the role of
the individual components of the second messenger cascade, particularly the "G
protein"-protein kinase C interaction in potassium channel regulation will be
essential for the understanding of the chain of events linking glucose
stimulation to insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. The results of these
studies promise, in addition, to shed new light on the regulation of ion
channels by second messenger molecules in a wide variety of other cell types.
