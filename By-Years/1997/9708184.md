As the number and significance of concurrent software systems continue to
increase, the need for reliable methods to ensure that these systems behave as
intended becomes more pressing. A number of very different analysis techniques
have been proposed by researchers, but experience with these techniques is
limited chiefly to simple academic programs and little is known about which
techniques and tools are most appropriate for particular problems, or how to use
the techniques effectively in practice. This project involves carrying out a
series of experiments to gain information on the applicability of these
techniques to real concurrent programs. These experiments include the analysis
of several real programs as well as controlled experiments with special programs
designed to isolate particular features identified in the analysis of real
programs as having significant impact on the utility of one or more of the
analysis tools. The results of those experiments will provide guidance to
software developers, feedback to researchers developing analysis techniques, and
a set of benchmark programs and properties that can be used in the development
and evaluation of additional analysis techniques.
