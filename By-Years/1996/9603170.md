This award provides travel support to India for Mr. Schwab, of the Inter-Union
(IUGG-IUGS) Commission on the Lithosphere/International Lithosphere Program Task
Group, to participate in three planning meeting with scientists from the Indian
Institute of Technology, the Indian School of Mines, Banaras Hindu University,
and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, for the purpose of initiating a
project to develop an electronic data base of the earth's upper mantle under the
Indian subcontinent. The data base will be linked with similar data bases from
other regions of the world to construct a three-dimensional map, in electronic
data base form, of the earth's lithosphere and astenosphere. This activity will
result in an important contribution to the understanding of geological processes
in the earth's upper mantle in and among various regions of the world.
