Bed surface coarsening, broadly termed armoring, is a pervasive feature of
gravel rivers. Armoring strongly influences channel hydraulics, determines the
population of grains available for transport, and defines the habitat for
aquatic invertebrates, salmonid spawning, and juvenile fish. A general and
predictive understanding of flow, transport, and benthic ecology in gravel-bed
rivers requires an ability to predict the bed surface composition as a function
of water and sediment supply. In general, the bed surface is not in equilibrium
with contemporary conditions, so cause and effect cannot be deduced from simple
correlations of field observations. Instead, we turn to the laboratory for
controlled observations and to computational models to capture the varied and
transient conditions in the field.

Observations of armoring have been made for decades and algorithms capable of
predicting armoring have been developed. Key elements are missing in both data
and models, however, and the empirical and the theoretical have not yet merged
into a complete model. This work aims to bridge that gap by building from both
sides. On the empirical side, we will use a laboratory flume to make coupled
observations of flow, transport, and bed surface composition in order to
describe the evolution of surface and subsurface grain sizes with unprecedented
spatial and temporal detail. On the theoretical side, we will develop a
transport and armoring model that includes size-dependent vertical transfer of
grains between surface and subsurface (kinematic sorting). This mechanism can be
incorporated in current models, but the necessary transfer functions remain
undefined and will be identified using the data from the experimental portion of
this project. Testing of the model will be based on internal comparisons between
different sediment supply configurations and a set of runs with progressive bed
aggradation and degradation. The result will be a physically-based, tested model
capable of predicting transport and armoring under the complex, transient
conditions typical of the field.
