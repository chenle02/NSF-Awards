This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports U.S.
participation in a U.S.- Argentina Workshop on Metal-microbe Interactions:
Corrosion and Fouling to be held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, October 19-23,
1992. The organizers are Dr. William G. Characklis of Montana State University
and Dr. Hector Videla the University of La Plata. The objective of the workshop
is to address the immediate research needs necessary to solve the most pressing
industrial problems related to the control of biofouling and biocorrosion. The
workshop brings together scientists with substantial expertise in terrestrial
and marine biocorrosion and biofouling processes and industrial monitoring. The
opportunities afforded by the workshop for both technology transfer and for
establishment of future collaborative efforts are excellent.
