The goal of this project is to continue a seven-year old summer program in
solid-state chemistry for undergraduate students and college faculty. The
concepts and techniques of solid-state chemistry will be examined for
integration with the well- established and full curriculum of chemistry based
upon molecular concepts. Selected students and teachers will be offered
opportunities to interact with solid-state chemists from industry and
universities in a program of tutorials, site visits, and summer research.
Participants will devote a nine-week period to research on individual projects.
Results of these efforts will be presented by each participant in a final
symposium.
