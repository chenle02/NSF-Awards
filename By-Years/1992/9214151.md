The genesis and stabilization of small platinum particles in zeolite L are
being investigated. The inorganic chemistry that occurs between the time that
the platinum salt is placed in contact with the zeolite and the formation of the
final platinum particle is investigated using temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR) followed by observations of X-ray absorption (chemical shift and near-edge
structure Ä±XANES!) and hydrogen consumption; the structures of the platinum
species before initiation of TPR, at stages during, and after complete reduction
to platinum metal determined by extended X-ray absorption catalytic reaction
probes (neopentane isomerization and u-hexane aromatization), and X-ray
absorption are used to investigate destabilization of small platinum particles
in zeolite L, including particle growth, deactivation by hydrocarbon residue
during reaction, sulfur poisoning, and sulfur-promoted migration. Platinum in
zeolite L is one of the fastest-growing catalysts in volume. It has valuable
applications in the chemical and petroleum industries. Its principal use is in
the upgrading of heavy crudes to high-octave gasoline, although it has other
applications in chemical synthesis and environmental control as well.
