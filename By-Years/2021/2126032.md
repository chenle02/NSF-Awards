NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Bimetallic nanoparticles show great promise for
various applications ranging from optical, sensing, and catalysis due to
synergistic interactions between the two metals. However, the ability to tailor
and control the properties of supported bimetallic nanoparticles is still an
existing challenge. This project focuses on developing a family of transition
metal-doped complex oxides capable of forming bimetallic nanoparticles through
structural transformations under exposure to reducing conditions. However, a
fundamental understanding of the mechanism of this process is still lacking. The
experimental efforts will be used to understand the formation of bimetallic
nanoparticles as a function of their bulk defect chemistry and reaction
environment. Outreach opportunities include an engineering entrepreneurship
workshop geared towards increasing the participation of underrepresented
engineering students. This work offers exciting research for undergraduate and
graduate students in chemical engineering, material science, and solid-state
chemistry. In addition, students will likely find employment in the
semiconductor or energy sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Geo-
inspired perovskite materials, those within a select family of perovskite oxides
(LaFeO3, SrTiO3, etc.), use the ionic transport of metal dopants to form
nanoparticles under a reducing environment. The nanoparticles formed are
inherently thermally stable, and the rich defect chemistry of these perovskite
oxides can be used to tailor the size and composition of bimetallic alloy
nanoparticles. The project encompasses three studies to gain fundamental
insights into the exsolution phenomena: 1) Elucidate the relevant parameters to
control the exsolution of bimetal nanoparticles; 2) Determine how manipulation
of the bulk defect chemistry can change the size and composition of
nanoparticles; and 3) Use in-situ spectroscopic and microscopic studies to
understand the nucleation and growth mechanism of nanoparticles. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be trained using state-of-the-art tools such as in-
situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy at national laboratories. Educational
endeavors promote the participation of engineering transfer students in research
and entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
