A workshop on the role of fluids in sediment accretion, deformation, diagenesis
and metamorphism at subduction zones will be held in October 1988 at Il Ciocco,
Italy. The workshop will focus on (1) sea floor manifestations of fluid flow;
(2) sources and evolution of fluids; (3) geometry of flow and physical
properties; and (4) the effects of fluids on tectonics in sedimentary
accretionary prisms. A major objective of the workshop is to develop scientific
plans for an international program of cooperative research on the subject.
Participants to the workshop will be invited experts, recommended by the
organizing committee. %%% The problem of fluid flow in accretionary sediment
environments is a subject of intense study by earth scientists today. These
environments occur at a number of places around the world, in a variety of
settings. The material in accretionary prisms is incorporated into continental
rocks and not much is known about this process, nor about the role of water in
deformation and metamorphosis of them. International coordination and
cooperation are needed to develop the tools, facilities and ideas to study these
problem efficiently and effectively. This workshop will help these planning and
coordination efforts.
