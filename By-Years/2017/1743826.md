This National Science Foundation award supports a 5-day CBMS conference on
"Computational Methods in Optimal Control", to be held at the Jackson State
University, Jackson, Mississippi, during July, 2018. The principal lecturer will
be Dr. William W. Hager from the University of Florida. As one of the largest
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the United States,
Jackson State University is a good location for hosting this conference, which
will have a direct impact on training and attracting African-American students
in the computational mathematics and statistical sciences doctoral programs and
professions. The anticipated participants include senior and junior faculty,
postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. Some travel support will be
provided to selected participants based on several criteria, such as relevance
of research background, academic preparation, potential of long-term
collaboration, and broader impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the growing
complexity of optimal control applications, approximate solutions are often
obtained by numerical algorithms, which requires deep understanding of numerical
discretization and solution techniques. Dr. Hager will deliver ten main lectures
on state-of-the-art computational methods on optimal control during the morning
sessions, which are accompanied with guided computer lab sessions in the
afternoon focusing on computer implementations of the discussed algorithms. The
presented lectures and the corresponding monograph will provide both the
background needed to analyze convergence of discrete approximations and solution
techniques in optimal control, and practical experience in solving real-world
problems. To complement the content of the main lectures, a few invited speakers
will give additional introductory talks that focus on efficient numerical
methods for solving optimal control problems whose dynamics are described by a
partial differential equation. More information can be found at the conference

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
