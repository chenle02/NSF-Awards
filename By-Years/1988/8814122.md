The Florida State Museum has recently acquired two important collections of
Recent mollusks: the Thomas McGinty Collection and the Beal-Maltbie Collection.
Both contain numerous sets of specimens that are rare or come from
environmentally disturbed areas which are threatened with further biological
deterioration. The collections have strong representation of specimens from the
United States and many tropical regions around the world and encompass all
habitats from marine to freshwater to land. In addition, they contain many type
specimens that have been unavailable to science for the last forty years. This
project will fund the curation of the two new collections and their
incorporation into the mollusk collection of the Museum, thus making the
specimens available to researchers, students and other interested persons.
Contemporary curatorial standards will be followed, and data about the specimens
will be entered into the museum's electronic cataloguing system. The newly
acquired specimens are an important addition to the research and educational
resources of the United States.
