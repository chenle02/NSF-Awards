This engineering education research project involves an interview study designed
to better measure innovativeness in engineering students. The project explores
multiple factors that contribute to innovation in engineering and more
specifically to student innovativeness. The study seeks to determine which
factors are innate (linked to cognitive style) and which can be changed or
enhanced in a well designed degree program.

The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the
currently recognized importance of innovation in engineering on the prosperity
of the United States. The project involves multiple stakeholders from different
sections of the economy, and plans effective outreach strategies to disseminate
results to these stakeholders. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals
of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce
with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society
by informing educational policy and practices.
