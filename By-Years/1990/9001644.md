Northwestern University will purchase an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer
in order to carry out analyses of chemical elements in the fields of
anthropology, biophysics, and bioinorganic chemistry. The instrument is needed
by the faculties of the Department of Chemistry and the Department of
Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology for research in the following
areas: 1. Diet and the inorganic analysis of excavated human bone 2. Heavy
metals in biological systems 3. Long-range electron transfer and hemoglobin
function 4. Polynucleotide coordination chemistry of metallocene antitumor
agents At present, the institution does not have an inductively coupled plasma
spectrometer, so its acquisition will be a significant addition, enhancing both
current and future research efforts.
