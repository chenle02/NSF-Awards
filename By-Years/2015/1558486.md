The PIs will carry out data collection work that will shed new light on the
Chinese economy as a whole. They will use publicly available detailed
information on regular and off-balance-sheet intermediation activities by
Chinese banks. From this information, they plan to create a longitudinal data
set of economic aggregate measures that can be used to study the Chinese
macroeconomy. Understanding China's financial markets and macroeconomy is
crucial for the design of U.S. monetary and fiscal policy, with the overall goal
of enhancing the competitiveness of the US economy in the global
marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will make their data set publicly
available. Their analysis will also employ structural models to study
interactions between bank lending activities, macroeconomic policy, and the
aggregate economy. Because China's economy has a number of structural
differences from advanced economies, the PIs will adapt models used to study the
U.S. and Europe to build these structural models. The PIs will also compare the
various results of the structural models and use parameters from these models to
estimate transitional dynamics in the economy.
