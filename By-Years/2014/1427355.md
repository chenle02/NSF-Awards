Since the introduction of Expected Utility (EU) the theory of preferences over
risk has been an unsettled matter. At the same meeting in 1952 at which Savage
presented his proof of EU, introducing the Independence Axiom (IA), Allais was
gathering data from the audience on his famous counter-examples to IA. Since
then, countless more rejections of IA have appeared, and many alternative models
have gained attention. Using two contributions from my prior NSF support, Convex
Risk Budgets and Uncertainty Equivalents, I show that EU actually performs
better than popular alternatives when all outcomes are sufficiently risky, and
that the independence axiom is most at peril when some outcomes involve
certainty. We are, of course, not the first to notice this, but both of the
experiments we have conducted demonstrate this in non-parametric tests, and are
not confounded by other model or measurement restrictions. These findings
suggest researchers may have "under-sampled" certainty, that is, we have spent
too little effort exploring how IA breaks down at the edges of the probability
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a series of experiments
designed to measure how preferences shift as the environment becomes less risky.
The objective is to collect data necessary to characterize the restrictions on
preferences throughout the choice space, and to do so in a completely non-
parametric way such that the data are not confounded with framing or modelling
assumptions. I will use these results to fit a new model of preferences which I
call a model of Expecting the Unexpected.
