Ferry plans to study problems in several areas of geometric topology. The
problems are concerned with constructing closed manifolds containing a given
open manifold as a codimension-zero submanifold, characterizing open subsets of
Euclidean space, studying which open manifolds may be deformed into each other
via Hurewicz fibrations, and finding when a map with acyclic homotopy fiber is
homotopic to a map with acyclic point-inverses. Understanding 3-manifolds is
particularly valuable, since they are the natural setting for studying many
questions about our physical habitat.
