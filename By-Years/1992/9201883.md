This project provides a high-resolution 300kV transmission electron microscope
(HRTEM) for fundamental studies of microstructures in a variety of materials
systems. The HRTEM will be used in applications of high-resolution imaging and
image simulations, and fine-probe energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to
problems including seeding of ceramic precursors, composite interfaces,
nanocrystalline solids, diamond films, and ferroelectric materials. Both
fundamental questions and application-oriented issues concerning the processing-
microstructure-properties links will be addressed. The HRTEM facility will also
serve an educational purpose in supplying graduate students with hands-on
experience in state-of-the-art microstructural analysis. Furthermore, it will
provide opportunities for technique development that will go beyond the
boundaries of these specific projects. The HRTEM will be organized as a user
facility with administrative and staff support provided by the Materials
Characterization Laboratory at Penn State, which currently manages operation and
maintenance of the existing electron microscopes, x-ray diffraction equipment,
ion and electron microprobes, and other user-oriented instruments use for
characterization of advanced materials. This will be one of three instruments of
it's kind in the US.
