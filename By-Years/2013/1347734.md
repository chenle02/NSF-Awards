What is good research? How can it be encouraged and promoted? While these are
fundamental questions for any discipline they are also clearly questions that
are very very difficult question to answer. How their efforts are measured and
rewarded is fundamental to individuals and their actions. Wide distribution of
best practices for evaluating research productivity will have significant impact
on researchers and, hence, on the research undertaken. Given computing's impact
on the entire nation, improving computing research will significantly impact the
nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Computing Research Association has established
a committee to explore the meaning of scholarship within the computing fields
and to bring best practices for evaluating and promoting high quality
scholarship to departments and individuals. This project will bring together
leaders of the computing research community to explore answers to these
questions and to provide advice to the community on how best to foster research
that has high impact. CRA Best Practices papers have traditionally had high
impact on how the community proceeds it is highly likely that this activity will
make a significant contribution to improving both the quality and impact of
computing research in the future.
