The purpose of this project is to determine how signals from nerve cells
control the degradation of cellular proteins in muscle. The experimental subject
is a small roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, that has a relatively simple
system of nerves and muscles. This organism is also conducive to simple and
rapid genetic experiments. To observe protein degradation, we have introduced a
foreign gene from a bacterium (E. coli) into the worm so that the fate of this
protein can be easily followed by biochemical and immunochemical methods. Our
objective is to use mutants that affect the function of nerves or muscles to
determine how direct nerve-to-muscle connections and/or chemical signaling
between nerves and muscles affects the rate of protein breakdown inside muscle
cells.
