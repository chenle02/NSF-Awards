Intermediate wavelength seasurface height (SSH) undulations over the Pacific
plate appear to represent the platform of secondary mantle convection. Several
aspects of these intermediate SSH undulations will be addressed, including: 1)
analyze the SSH data in the Pacific to determine the presence and nature of the
undulations; 2) verify the robustness of the phenomenon by establishing whether
the SSh undulations exist on other plates; 3) test the possible mechanisms
capable of causing these undulations (e.g. mantle convection).
