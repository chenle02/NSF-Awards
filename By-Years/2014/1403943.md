Recent observations have been able to detect remnants of physical processes that
occurred a tiny fraction of second after the so-called big bang. On the
theoretical side our understanding of the cosmic evolution although quite
sophisticated is still incomplete. A deep understanding of how to make
Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics consistent is needed to
describe the very early universe, and such a theory is not fully developed yet.
This project seeks to contribute to filling this gap by incorporating ideas and
techniques of quantum gravity to cosmology with the goal of overcoming
limitations of current models. The objective of this project is therefore
twofold: to extend our understanding of the origin and fate of the universe, and
to confront new quantum-gravity ideas with the last generation of
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims at developing
approximate methods to incorporate quantum gravity physics in models of the
early universe. Investigations will focus on theoretical as well as
phenomenological aspects of quantum cosmology, with special emphasis on
techniques coming from loop quantum gravity. From the theoretical point of view,
it will be explored how matter fields propagate on regimes in which the quantum
aspects of gravity are important, and the way in which the familiar quantum
field theory in curved space-times emerges from the more fundamental theory.
From the phenomenological viewpoint, the resulting theoretical framework will be
applied to extend cosmological models to include Planck scale physics.
Investigations will cover scalar perturbations that are responsible for the
temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy
distribution, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, and particular
attention will be paid to gravitational waves generated in the early universe.
