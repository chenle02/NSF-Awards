Silicon-based integrated circuit technologies, both at the cutting edge today
and those that are predicted to emerge in the future, are based on the use of
three-dimensional transistor structures with multiple gates, such as finFETs,
trigate transistors, or gate-all-around devices. The semiconductor industry
faces a new set of challenges with these structures, particularly in relation to
reliability and failures. This project will research effective solutions to
overcome these challenges so as to facilitate the design of the next generation
of high-performance integrated circuits. In addition to research, the project
has an educational component that includes the development of instructional
material for the undergraduate and graduate curriculum on reliability in mixed-
signal circuits, and in training future scientists/engineers to learn creative
problem solving skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project
addresses the use of multigate transistor technologies in the design of mixed-
signal integrated circuits with both digital and analog parts, using the case of
input/output (I/O) circuits as a testbed for evaluating a set of proposed
approaches that proactively model and mitigate circuit aging in transistors and
interconnect wires. Specific aging mechanisms that will be investigated include
bias temperature instability, hot carrier injection, gate oxide breakdown, and
electromigration. These effects are accentuated by the increased thermal effects
and thermal nonuniformities seen in multigate transistor technologies, and it is
important to develop methods that tightly integrate reliability computations
with thermal analysis. The work will link the impact of such effects at the
transistor level to the mixed-signal block level, and then up to the system
level. The proposed techniques will act in conjunction with on-chip compensation
techniques that make circuits more robust to aging-induced performance drifts.
