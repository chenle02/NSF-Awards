The broader impact of this I-Corps project involves the rapid, simultaneous
detection of multiple foodborne pathogens. This team's technology may have use
in a broad range of applications in areas such as: food processing and
distribution facilities, primary care clinics, clinical labs, contract labs,
veterinary labs, pharmaceutical development markets, crop protection systems,
and possible prevention of bioterrorism threats through contamination of water
and food supplies. If successful, this technology will benefit USA market
competitiveness in biosensor technology and will impact the economy though the
protection of human health, food and water supplies, and prevention of product
recalls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information gathered through the I-Corps
experience will enable refinement of the biosensing technology to address
customers' needs. In addition, the entrepreneurial skills and knowledge gained
through I-Corps will assist the project team to explore the commercial potential
of this technology: an accurate, low cost, portable, user-friendly biosensor for
onsite detection of multiple common Salmonella enterica serogroups that also
captures samples for additional lab testing. The same device can be used for
testing other pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and
Vibrio. A noteworthy innovation of this team's prototype biosensor includes its
ability to concentrate samples by removing over 70% of the volume of the testing
media, and trapping and simultaneously detecting three to five pathogens within
an hour. The biosensor has high selectivity and sensitivity of 10 CFU/ml.
