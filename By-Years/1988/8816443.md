In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in particle
physics between Svjetlana Fajfer of the Institute of Physics, Sarajevo, and
Robert J. Oakes at Nothwestern University, the investigators will extend their
research in theoretical elementary particles. They will focus on composite
models of quarks and leptons and study the unification of fundamental forces
among these particles. Their work will advance our knowledge in the general area
of high energy physics. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint
Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint
fund consisting of matching contributions from the governments of the United
States and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants are made to the principal
scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include dollar funds for U.S.
scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in
the U.S.
