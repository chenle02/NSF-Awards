The goal of this project is to explore some applications and potential
applications of homotopy algebras. In algebraic topology, E-infinity
differential graded algebras and related homotopy algebras can be used to study
the homotopy theory of spaces. Other versions of this same kind of structure can
potentially be applied in algebraic geometry to put ``motivic structures'' on
homotopy invariants. There is a close relationship between E_2 algebras and
monoidal categories. There should be an analogously close relationship between
E_3 algebras and braided monoidal categories. The project also studies the
algebraic K-theory of permutative categories and the close ties between
permutative categories and stable homotopy theory.

Homotopy theory studies those properties of mathematical objects that do not
change under small deformations. These mathematical objects are often of a
geometric nature but the methods of homotopy theory have been increasingly
applied to algebraic ones as well. Homotopy theoretic properties tend to be
accessible to computation by taking advantage of the invariance under small
changes. Since they also generally retain important information about the
original mathematical objects, homotopy theory is an effective tool for a wide
range of mathematical problems.
