ABSTRACT EEC-9712750 Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) is presently employed as
a structural material in surface micro-machined sensors and actuators. The
design and fabrication of micromechanical structures can often be constrained by
the deposition conditions and properties of poly-Si, therefore, the development
of an alternative structural material which relieves these constraints would
have a significant impact on MEMS technology. Polycrystalline silicon-germanium
(poly-SiGe) can be conformally deposited and doped at much lower temperatures
(less than 500 lm1 (C) than poly-Si, and is readily etched by conventional wet
or dry processes. Low tensile stress can be achieved in as-deposited poly-SiGe
films without high-temperature annealing. These properties make poly-SiGe a
promising structural material for surface-micromachined structures, particularly
in integrated microsystems. Because SiGe has only been investigated as an
electronic material, its mechanical properties are note yet well known. A
comprehensive study of the mechanical properties of low-pressure chemical vapor
deposited (LPCVD) poly-SiGe films, will be conducted to assess their potential
for MEMS application. The effects of deposition, doping and annealing conditions
on film microstructure and mechanical properties will be determined for films of
various Ge contents. Established methodologies for evaluating poly-Si films will
be employed to characterize stress and stress-gradients in poly-SiGe films. The
electrical conductivity and etching behavior of these films will also be
studied. The development of an integrated SiGe MEMS technology is a goal of this
work.
