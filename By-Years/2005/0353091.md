With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support for the work of Professor Charles L. Perrin of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California at San Diego. The
research will continue the PI's investigations of hydrogen bonding, acidity, and
solvation in organic molecules. The hydrogen bond, in which a hydrogen is shared
between two electronegative atoms, is a dominant motif in chemistry and
biochemistry. A major objective of the proposed research is to determine the
symmetry of a variety of hydrogen bonds. Although symmetric hydrogen bonds have
been proposed to be involved in enzyme-catalyzed reactions, there is little
experimental evidence for them. A sophisticated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
technique, the method of isotopic perturbation of equilibrium, will be used to
search for symmetric hydrogen bonds. NMR investigations will also be used to
probe molecular stabilizations resulting from the interactions of electron pairs
and the energetics of solvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies are expected
to have broad impact upon the biological sciences. In particular, they will
contribute to our knowledge of factors responsible for DNA and protein three-
dimensional structure. In addition these experiments will provide significant
basic knowledge in the increasingly important area of non-covalent interactions
between molecules. The research will also provide valuable training for
students.&lt;br/&gt;
