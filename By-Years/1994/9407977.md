9407977 Magnus The focus of this research is the development of new synthetic
methodology using hypervalent iodine chemistry. The potential of the chemistry
for the beta-functionalization of carbonyl groups and for the oxidation of amine
derivatives will be tested. In particular, the preparation of highly
functionalized ring systems and the oxidation of proline-like compounds will be
attempted. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Philip D. Magnus of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Texas, Austin. Professor Magnus will focus his work on
developing new synthetic organic transformations by using hypervalent iodine
chemistry. ***
