The Clemson Calculus Challenge (CCC) is a one-day calculus competition for high
school students that has been organized and hosted by the Department of
Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University annually since the spring of 2003.
The CCC provides a venue for mathematically talented high school students to
compete and receive recognition in an individual exam and a team competition.
Students are tested on their knowledge of the topics found in the College Board
Advanced Placement Calculus AB syllabus.

The CCC seeks to attract a diverse audience of at least 250 high school students
from the southeastern United States to compete each year. Through competition,
the CCC strives to (1) motivate high school students to obtain a more profound
understanding of calculus; (2) raise expectations for knowledge, skill levels
and performance for high school calculus programs; (3) recognize those students
who perform well during the competition; (4) expose high school students to
research in the sciences that requires calculus competency; and (5) provide a
forum for high school teachers to interact with each other. Funding is primarily
used to support participant travel so that more high schools can compete, and,
in particular, so that more schools from economically depressed school districts
or who serve a large percentage of financially disadvantaged or first generation
students may attend.
