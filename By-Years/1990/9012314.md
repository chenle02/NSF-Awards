Campanian and Maestrichtian interval is characterized by a general global
cooling trend and an evolutionary radiation of planktonic foraminifera. The
long-term cooling trend and an evolutionary radiation of planktonic
foraminifera. The long-term cooling trend had an impact on latitudinal thermal
gradients, on the formation of oceanic water masses, on rates and patterns of
renewal of deep-water masses and attendant dissolved oxygen. This study will use
planktonic foraminifera to: (i) construct a uniform integrated
biomagnetostratigraphy for the Campanian-Maestrichtian; (ii) quantitative
analysis of faunas, assessment of relative preservation and interpretation in
terms of paleoecologic variables; and (iii) stable isotopic studies of
relatively unaltered fine-fraction, planktonic and benthic foraminiferal samples
for inferences about variations in paleotemperature/ paleosalinity and carbon
cycling. The study will focus on about 8 important DSDP/ODP Sites in which the
Campanian-Maestrichtian to unravel the palesceanographic trends of this
interval.
