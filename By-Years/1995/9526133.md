9526133 Thorpe The International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR) has
consistently maintained an extremely high standard and has drawn the most
outstanding researchers in autonomous vehicle disciplines. This years conference
promises to continue this high standard while covering the subjects of interest
to the Ocean Engineering community. In addition, the Conference will cover
subjects of interest to the other programs in the Division. These include
computer controlled surgery, telemedicine, environmental monitoring and control,
and teleoperations. It is important to have participants from the United States.
Professor Thorpe has been active in the field of autonomous undersea vehicles
and is considered an outstanding researcher. He has participated in several
activities sponsored by the Ocean Engineering Program and can glean relevant
information as well as contribute to the Conference. His paper on the future of
Mobile Robotics will be an important part of the Conference ***
