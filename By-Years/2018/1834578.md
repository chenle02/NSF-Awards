This award supports participation in the international conference "Pure and
Applied Model Theory" taking place October 25-28, 2018 at the University of
Illinois at Chicago. The subject of the conference is model theory, with an
emphasis on connections between deep results in pure model theory and
applications. Several talks will also touch on connections to algebra, analysis,
combinatorics, number theory, infinitary logic, and descriptive set theory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature more than twenty talks by
leaders in the field. This meeting provides an opportunity for interactions
among U.S. and European model theorists, with multiple benefits for both. In
addition to the talks, graduate students and junior researchers in attendance
will have the opportunity to disseminate their research through a poster
session. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given
to graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and junior faculty who may not
otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
