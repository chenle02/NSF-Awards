In this Career project, the investigator studies problems&lt;br/&gt;that
involve an interplay between algebraic geometry, number&lt;br/&gt;theory, and
complexity theory. Specific projects include:&lt;br/&gt; (1) A new generation of
fast randomized algorithms for real root&lt;br/&gt; counting, allowing analytic
as well as algebraic equations,&lt;br/&gt; (2) Further explorations into
algorithmic fewnomial theory over&lt;br/&gt; the real and p-adic
numbers,&lt;br/&gt; (3) A deeper analysis of numerical conditioning of random
sparse&lt;br/&gt; polynomial systems,&lt;br/&gt; (4) Sharpened quantitative
results for rational solutions of&lt;br/&gt; straight-line programs,&lt;br/&gt;
(5) Further exploration of number-theoretic approaches to the P&lt;br/&gt; vs.
NP question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Solving equations is ubiquitous in
applications, cutting&lt;br/&gt;across many areas of engineering and science: A
brief list&lt;br/&gt;includes drug design, faster and more reliable methods for
radar&lt;br/&gt;imaging and geometric modelling, and more reliable and
efficient&lt;br/&gt;approaches to robotics and autonomous vehicles. The
investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops methods for problems related to the solution
of&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations, with an eye toward these applications.
He&lt;br/&gt;also actively recruits students from schools in poorer areas
of&lt;br/&gt;Texas (with large African-American and Hispanic populations)
to&lt;br/&gt;help disadvantaged students and channel more bright young
people&lt;br/&gt;into the computational sciences. He also continues work
on&lt;br/&gt;related software, so that the broader public can benefit from
the&lt;br/&gt;discoveries of this project.&lt;br/&gt;
