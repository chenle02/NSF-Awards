We will bring together top researchers, as well as graduate students and post-
docs, in both geometry and nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations for
a conference at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, on October 27,
28, and 29 in 2006. The rich connections between geometry and non-linear
elliptic partial differential equations have historically led to many
breakthroughs in each. In bringing together top people in both areas, we hope
both to stimulate further interaction and to introduce post-docs and graduate
students to some of the key ideas and connections. The organizers hope that the
meeting will stimulate the interaction between geometry and pde, especially to
introduce younger mathematicians to the techniques from both. The following have
accepted our invitation to speak: Luis Caffarelli, Daniela Desilva, L. Craig
Evans, David Jerison, Fanghua Lin, William H. Meeks III, and Richard M. Schoen.
Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a key role in many areas of science
and mathematics and many powerful techniques have been developed to study them.
Partial differential equations have also played an important role in some key
advances in differential geometry, where one studies curved (i.e., not flat)
spaces. In fact, some important PDEs cannot be properly stated without the
language of differential geometry (Einstein's equations in general relativity
give one such example). The PDEs that arise in geometry are often highly
nonlinear and require new techniques to solve, posing new challenges to both
geometers and to analysts. Some of these new techniques developed for geometric
PDEs have led to important developments for other PDEs. By bringing together top
experts in both areas, we hope to encourage the exchange of ideas between these
closely related fields and to expose younger mathematicians to techniques in
both.
