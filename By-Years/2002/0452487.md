This research is based on a comprehensive multi-scaled, &lt;br/&gt;multi-
disciplinary approach to study complex information age issues that
&lt;br/&gt;involve the combination of people and the information and
communication &lt;br/&gt;technologies they use. This study extends work on
social actors, &lt;br/&gt;developed through prior NSF-funded research. The
social actor is an &lt;br/&gt;empirically derived model of people+ information
and communication &lt;br/&gt;technologies (ICTs). To make this model useable for
a wider community of &lt;br/&gt;researchers and policy- makers, who need robust
models with solid &lt;br/&gt;measures of attributes and behaviors that conflate
people and their &lt;br/&gt;technologies, some formalization of the social actor
is required. Using &lt;br/&gt;metrics derived from institutional theory,
appropriate measures based on &lt;br/&gt;social actor concepts will be developed
and related to formal models and &lt;br/&gt;theories of cognitive understanding
and collaborative decision making to &lt;br/&gt;establish a better basis for
reasoning about ICT-infused environments. A &lt;br/&gt;theoretically supported,
empirically grounded, social actor model will &lt;br/&gt;then be used to
simulate dynamic agents, with scenarios developed in &lt;br/&gt;collaboration
with RAND organization researchers. The empirical work &lt;br/&gt;will involve
modeling social actors as people + IC in organizational and
&lt;br/&gt;institutional settings using agent-based systems (ABS). Agent-based
&lt;br/&gt;modeling allows a researcher to examine complex adaptive systems with
&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated computational models that integrate empirical research
and &lt;br/&gt;formal modeling. These systems help researchers and policy-makers
&lt;br/&gt;explore the dynamic issues that attend the complex interactions of
&lt;br/&gt;collaborative and competitive social units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
