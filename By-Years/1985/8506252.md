The environment for circuits and systems research oriented toward special
purpose computer architectures for digital signal and image processing
applications is improved. A comprehensive research program involving algorithm
decomposition, circuits and systems design, and simulation of multiprocessor
systems for digital signal and image processing applications is undertaken.
Emphasis is placed upon the development of a systematic procedure for the design
of high performance multiprocessor systems from mathematical specifications of
the digital signal and image processing algorithms. The equipment will be used
in all phases of the research from algorithm decomposition to prototype
development. The research program will involve the development of two prototype
systems for real-time or near real-time digital signal and image processing and
the development of CAD tools for high level simulation and hierarchical design
of VLSI circuits and systems.
