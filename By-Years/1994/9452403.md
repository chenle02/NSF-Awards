9452403 Murray Powerbooks and desktop computer workstations are used for field
and laboratory studies in ecology. This project is also part of a departmental
effort to improve science learning experiences for our ethnically-diverse
undergraduates and provides more opportunities for projects, discussion,
cooperative learning, and oral and written communication work. Another goal is
to insure that our students gain skills in collecting, analyzing, and
interpreting data and presenting their results by using modern computing
instrumentation and application software. Powerbooks are used to collect and
analyze data in the lab and at several remote field sites in support of 1) a
weekly lab being added to a required majors ecology course, and 2) selected
elective courses in our ecology and organismic biology program. The Powerbooks
are equipped with modems and Ethernet connections to allow remote and lab access
to a custom File Server, the campus mainframe, and other electronic resources.
