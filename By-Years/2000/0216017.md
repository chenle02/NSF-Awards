This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will provide partial support for
the acquisition and installation of a gas-source isotope-ratio mass spectrometer
in the Department of Geological Sciences at California State University, Long
Beach (CSULB).. This mass spectrometer will enable research projects to be
implemented by a consortium of stable isotope researchers at CSULB and
California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). Areas of research to be carried
out using this instrumentation include hydrogeology, the fluid evolution of the
crust of the Earth, the origin of magmas, ore deposits, diagenetic processes in
sedimentary basins, and the effect of water on deformational processes. Research
opportunities involving stable isotopes will now be available to undergraduate
students and this technology will be incorporated into the curriculum of many
courses offered in geochemistry, petrology, and hydrology both at CSULB and
CSUF. Thus, this instrument is expected to have immediate impact by servicing
the teaching and research needs of the California State University, the largest
educational establishment in the United States, as well as the most populous and
ethnically diverse metropolitan area on the West Coast. ***
