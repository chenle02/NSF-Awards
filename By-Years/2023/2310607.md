The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technology for state-of-the-art, mixed-signal semiconductor chips
or integrated circuits. Applications range from wireless and wired communication
to driverless cars, smart cities, and biomedical devices. The software is able
to reduce the layout design time by 90 times compared to manual/human design
time, while ensuring that the output quality is comparable. Changes in the
design process are crucial for the analog integrated circuit market to keep up
with the demand for chips and new applications. This technology can provide
faster speeds over current processes while reducing user input and effort. This
software also opens doors to faster chip design turnaround times and reduces
chip design costs, both of which are critical in todayâ€™s chip design companies.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology addressing the
bottlenecks in computer chip design turnaround time. The demand for
semiconductor chips or integrated circuits has increased significantly over the
years due to their use in applications such as wireless communication, smart
cities, and smarter cars. These integrated circuits are composed of digital and
analog blocks. While the implementation of digital blocks is automated and takes
comparatively less effort, analog block implementation is still a manual task
that takes months in the industry. This technology is an electronic design
automation software that aims to reduce the time and effort required in analog
integrated circuits block implementation. The software targets the physical
implementation or layout design phase of production where the designed circuit
is placed and routed with physical wires as it would be on the silicon chip.
This technology automatically generates analog layouts using conventional
techniques as well as machine learning.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
