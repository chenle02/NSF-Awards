The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of a series of
earthquakes in the South Island of New Zealand (Christchurch) on the electricity
infrastructure. Furthermore, this research study will make projections on what
the impacts would look like if smart-grid technologies were integrated into the
existing power network. Would the result be better, worse, or a combination of
both? In what areas is further research needed? The approach is to carry out a
real-time simulation of the New Zealand?s power system with intelligent sensing,
monitoring and control technologies in collaboration with New Zealand?s
university and utility experts in power systems and smart grids.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;During natural
disasters and malicious attacks, intelligent monitoring and controlling power
systems with new algorithms will increase real-time responsiveness to changing
power loads and component failures, improve the dynamic and transient behavior
of the power network, improve grid reliability, ensure local and wide area
stability, and assist human experts in control
rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Energy security is very
important to United States, and thus it is critical to protect our electric grid
from different forms of disturbances including natural disasters and malicious
attacks by using advanced sensing, monitoring and control technologies.
