Since 2003, the PIs have been administering an REU site in the Svalbard
archipelago for motivated geoscience undergraduate students, directly involving
them in important climate change research and exposing them to the challenges
and rewards of conducting high latitude research. Funds are provided to continue
the Svalbard REU program for another year, based on the success of the program.
Student research focuses on the climatic and surficial processes that operate in
rapidly changing glacial, lacustrine, and fjord systems that may, in turn,
archive the signature of anthropogenic changes in the high Arctic. Students
define their research questions and design specific testable hypotheses
throughout the program, complete their research projects at their home
institutions during the following academic year and present their results at a
professional conference. Most alumni of the program have gone into graduate
programs better prepared for fundamental research.
