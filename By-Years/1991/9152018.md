The project aims to improve the quality of undergraduate education in
statistical methods, experimental psychology, and honors research by providing
high-quality research and analysis tools for student lab exercises and projects.
Nine microcomputers, one laser printer, 12 copies of a statistical software
package, 10 copies of a run version of experimental psychology software, and
three copies of a meta-analysis software package will be added to existing
equipment and organized into four types of units: (a) 12 statistical analysis
stations for sophisticated univariate and multivariate analyses; (b) one
experiment development unit with 26 prepared experiments and the capacity to
create a wide range of experiments; (c) 12 experiment run stations for
collecting data from experiments created on the development unit; and (d) three
meta-analysis units for quantitative literature reviews. The equipment would
raise the quality of student activity in several courses, improve students'
graduate training prospects, and compensate for meager institutional computing
resources. The department's success in attracting a large number of majors (9%)
and preparing almost half of them for graduate school (45%), in addition to the
university's substantial percentages of women (64%) and minorities (30%;
hispanics 17%), make this project very valuable.
