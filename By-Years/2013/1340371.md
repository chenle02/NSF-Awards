This project seeks to further develop the Animal Diversity Web (ADW), which is a
highly structured database of biological information about organisms,
accumulated through the efforts of students in university classes across the
country. Its structure allows researchers to build tools and services to support
active inquiry and other educational resources. The structure of the database,
its rich content, and its versatility in working in combination with other data
sources has enabled the ADW team to provide high quality data in accessible
formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADW has demonstrated success in teaching
students how to think like scientists at both K-12 and undergraduate levels for
over 15 years. As a result, the research team has a broad set of resources that
are widely used. The ADW is one of the largest and most widely used biological
databases worldwide, with over 2 million pages served to over 300,000 users
monthly, as well as connections to a large network of K-12 and undergraduate
educators involved in ADW projects. This large user base represents a tremendous
asset as the research team explores further development of ADW products. Further
development of the ADW has the potential to expand both science-education as
well as public understanding of science.
