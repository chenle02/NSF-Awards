With Capacity Building funds from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship
Program, the University of Hawaii Manoa (UHM), in conjunction with faculty
across colleges in the UH System and with outside experts, will establish and
strengthen the infrastructure and collaborations that will ultimately lead to
increasing the number and diversity of highly-qualified mathematics and science
teachers in high-need schools across Hawaii. In Hawaii, the attrition rate for
licensed teachers who come from out of state or who start teaching prior to
completion of a teacher preparation program is significantly higher (50%) than
for those who complete teacher preparation programs in Hawaii. Working toward
solutions, project partners will include the UHM College of Education, STEM
faculty from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and College of Engineering, as
well as Kapiolani Community College (KCC) and the Hawaii State Department of
Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These partners will work collaboratively to
create pathways for undergraduates majoring across STEM fields (specifically,
mathematics, science, and engineering) to pursue a double major with secondary
education. In consultation with an expert on the effective UTeach model, the
project partners will (1) design course sequences allowing STEM and education
double majors; (2) design new courses to introduce teaching to students early in
their college careers thus enabling them to concurrently complete STEM degrees
and College of Education coursework; and (3) develop recruitment plans involving
awareness-raising, advising, scholarships, and articulation agreements with UH
system community colleges.
