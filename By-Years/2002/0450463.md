This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will reduce
mechanical external-cavity diode lasers to a centimeter-sized waveguide chip
using a novel giant electro-optic effect. The device, a &lt;br/&gt;waveguide
external-cavity semiconductor laser (WECSL), will be environmentally robust,
compact, entirely electro-optic and capable of continuous, mode-hop-free tuning
over 100 nm in fewer than 5 milliseconds. The laser will also exhibit a side-
mode-suppression ratio of 40 dB and a (fast) linewidth of ~200 kHz. In Phase II
we will demonstrate advanced prototype WECSLs, develop critical manufacturing
processes, and perform basic environmental qualifications. We will also conduct
research allowing the laser to sweep over a 50 nm band at a rate of 5 kHz.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The low-cost technology platform of WECSLs, and their
precision performance specifications could enable laser-based sensors to assume
a prominent role in commercial applications. In biophotonics, tunable lasers can
replace broadband light sources and enhance the performance of optical coherence
tomography instruments that measure the tissue layers in the human retina and
the vascular system. Distributed fiber sensing arrays greatly benefit from
tunable lasers that probe Bragg sensors spaced along the fiber. Distributed
fiber sensors needing low-cost tunable lasers are being developed for chemical
and biological sensing, pressure sensing, and vibration, strain and temperature
sensing for a wide variety of monitoring applications such as homeland security;
civil structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams; oil wells and pipelines;
electrical power lines; aircraft and spacecraft; and all-optical shipboard
sensing. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
