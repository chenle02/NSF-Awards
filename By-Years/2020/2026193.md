NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project explores and expands a new class of
compositionally -complex oxides in the fluorite-based crystal structure, which
resemble the cubic zirconia gemstone but often contain five or more metal
cations. These new materials can exhibit exceptional properties, such as having
thermal insulation while being mechanically stiff and hard. This fundamental
research delves into a new research field to create new classes of ceramics.
Potential applications as new classes of thermal barrier coatings to protect gas
turbine engines used in airplanes, ships, and land-based power plants are
envisioned. Moreover, creating new thermally insulating ceramics can have
impacts in other fields. For example, these materials may be used to increase
the efficiency and reduce the cost of solar thermal energy generation in
concentrated solar power plants. This project trains and mentors diverse
students in a manufacturing-related critical area of ceramic science and
technology for the aerospace, defense, and energy industries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research project broadens the
emerging field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) to compositionally complex
ceramics (CCCs) using the fluorite-based oxides as model systems. This research
provides opportunities to tailor and improve properties in a vast compositional
space via the interplay between disorder and order. A central scientific
hypothesis is that the disorder versus order in CCCs can be utilized to tailor
the phase stability, nanoscale heterogeneity, and thermal and mechanical
properties, where medium-entropy compositions can outperform their high-entropy
counterparts. The fundamental understandings of disorders, short- and long-range
orders, oxygen vacancies, and heterogeneity have broad scientific implications.
Graduate and undergraduate students are mentored and trained in a critically
important mainstay area of ceramic science and technology. Hispanic high school
and college students are inspired and trained through summer research
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
