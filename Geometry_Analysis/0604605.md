This project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus, treating the
behavior of singularities and energy concentration for various optimal or
stationary functions, fields, measures, or geometric structures, possibly
subject to constraints. The first specific class of projects involves continuing
work with T. Riviere, on relations between the p energy of a map between
Riemannian manifolds and its homotopy class. In case of nontorsion homotopy, our
previous results on the geometric and topological structure of bubbles allows
attack on open questions about the weak smooth approximability of Sobolev maps
as well as refined questions about bubbling in p stationary maps and heat flows.
We also are attacking higher order Sobolev spaces which seem more natural for
certain homotopy classes, but for which basic approximation results and
constructions have not been previously studied, A second class of projects
involves continuing work with Thierry De Pauw on extending notions from
geometric measure theory and solutions of Plateau-type problems in the context
of chains in a metric space with coefficients in a general group. We consider a
variety of mass-type functionals and the notion of a scan which generalizes the
finite mass metric-space currents of Ambrosio-Kirchheim and the rectifiable and
flat Euclidean-space G-chains of White. In the Euclidean space context we
approximate the size functional of Almgren and prove optimal regularity for the
minimizers of such approximate functionals.

Solutions to many variational problems in both pure and applied mathematics
often are forced to have singularities, that is, to involve regions where large
oscillations occur. For example a nematic liquid crystal material in a spherical
container whose optical axis is forced to point outward on the container
necessarily will have singularities inside (observable through cross-polarizers
or x-ray diffraction). In this example the optical axis has an energy density,
which measures its local rate of change and whose integral tends to have a
minimum value among all possible configurations. Our research proposes to
understand the relationship between energies in such variational problems and
the topological barriers imposed by the physics of these problems. We have
derived new notions which allow the treatment and precise description of a wide
variety of problems from soap films and their higher dimensional generalizations
to optimal transport paths in various complex media. Geometric constraints which
occur naturally in many physical problems have led to new mathematical and
computational issues. In particular, two that we are studying are the constant
cross-sectional area constraint exhibited in plant structure and gradient
constraints in the microstructure formation in certain crystalline materials.
