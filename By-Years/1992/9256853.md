20 faculty from 3 Departments (Cell Biology, Physiology and Biophysics,
Psychology) are collaborating to provide a training program in cellular and
molecular neuroscience. Over its course, this award will provide support for
about 12 students. A major innovation in the training program is an intensive,
12 week summer laboratory course for students at the end of their first year of
graduate school. The course consists of six 2-week modules in electrophysiology,
developmental neurobiology, microscopy and imaging, second messengers and
neurotransmitters, protein biochemistry, and molecular biology.
