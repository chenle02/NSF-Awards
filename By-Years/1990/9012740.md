A major question confronting management in U.S. industry is whether the
anticipated economic benefits of investments in information technologies are
being realized. the results from prior reported empirical research on this
question are at best mixed. The researchers consider this problem to be a
measurement related issue, and they develop a theory and methodology for
determining the economic impacts of "business value" of information technology.
The focus of the research is on the firm and its profit centers as the unit of
analysis. The research is planned in three phases. The first phase involves a
statistical analysis of manufacturing industry data acquired by the
investigators to test several conjectures on prior discrepancies and estimate a
theoretical model. Based on these results, the model is refined in phase two and
further tested (validated) with two new data sets from banking and insurance
industry firms. The third phase synthesizes management implications of the
research for information technology investment decisions.
