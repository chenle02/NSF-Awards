Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) gives the chemist a powerful tool
for analyzing mixtures of compounds and monitoring reactions as they progress.
The use of GC/MS in the undergraduate laboratory gives students experience with
current instrumental methods for molecular analysis and demonstrates, by
experiment, the concepts of sample preparation, data acquisition, and data
manipulation. This ILI award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth University to
acquire GC/MS instrumentation that will be used to enhance undergraduate
laboratory instruction.
