Students use a diiode array spectrometer to analyze; the kinetics of enzyme and
organic reactions, DNA melting curves and DNA-drug interactions, and the spectra
of pharmaceuticals. In addition the instrument is used for analysis of materials
collected during an interdepartmental (biology, geography, chemistry) study of
pollutants in the Pike River. Students also use this instrument for independent
research projects.
