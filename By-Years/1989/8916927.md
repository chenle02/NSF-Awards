For vertebrate animals living in as aqueous environment mucus plays an
important role in their survival. Studies with the hagfish (eptatretus stoutii),
a primitive vertebrate and a copious secretor of mucus, suggest an intermingling
of mucins synthesized by one cell-type (mucous cells) with aggregates of unusual
keratin-like intermediate filaments (IFs) from another cell-type (thread cells).
Interaction of these components results in a change in rheological properties
and a cohesiveness which we hypothesize serves to facilitate the multifaceted
functions of mucus, including its biological activity. The overall aim of the
proposal is to expand these observations in selected teleost species (e.g.
intertidal fish, parrotfish) in which mucus exerts notable protective roles.
Major objectives to be achieved by immunological and biochemical procedures are
(1) identify and characterize cytoskeletal components, particularly IF
aggregates,released from specific epidermal cell types: (2) determine if these
aggregates can modulate the rheological properties of mucus or provide binding
sites for secretable biologically active substances such as the
hemagglutinins/lectins; (3) determine the cellular origin of thel atter
compounds and their specificity for some microorganisms; (4) determine the
sequence (cDNA methodology) of the a,B and y polypeptides from hagfish thread
cells as a means to understand thread assembly in which IFs attain parallel
alignment and a change in polypeptide composition occurs during differentiation
and terminal maturation; (5) establish whether the hagfish IFs possess unique
keratin like sequences or if they represent a prototype for filamentous
aggregates synthesized and released by specific epidermal cells of teleosts.
These studies have great significance with respect to the biochemistry and
structural features of intermediate filaments, as well as the biochemical
evolution of intermediate filaments. The studies also have major significance
with respect to material defense mechanisms of teleost fish. Finally, these
studies may lead to practical applications, such as the development of novel
biomaterials for lubrication or extiles.
