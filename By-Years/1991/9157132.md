This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to study the cellular basis of
neurulation. Dr. Cooper will examine the cellular dynamics involved in neural
tube morphogenesis employing fluorescence video and laser confocal microscopy
examining how cytoplasmic-calcium dynamics, membrane turnover, and cytoskeletal
activity coordinate cellular movements and shape changes during neurulation.
