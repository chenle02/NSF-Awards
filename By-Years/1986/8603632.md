This project focuses on understanding the dynamics of three fundamental
mechanism elements -- silent and roller chains drives, ball-type shaft
couplings, and band and tape drives. The dynamic and vibratory characteristics
of the chain are modeled with load amplification and chain wear being studied.
Ball-type couplings are used as connections between non-parallel intersecting
shafts. The basic joint mechanics are investigated in this study. This research
is concerned with the kinematic and dynamic analysis of band drives.
