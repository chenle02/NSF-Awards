AST-9619438 Real-Time Studies of Young Supernova Remnants: Inhomogeneities,
Dynamics, and the Relativistic Plasma. Young supernova remnants (SNRs) provide
valuable laboratories for studying hydrodynamic and nonthermal processes in
astrophysical plasmas. Drs. Lawrence Rudnick and Thomas Jones at the University
of Minnesota, have formed a powerful team to investigate young SNRs both
observationally and theoretically. The focus is on inhomogeneities,
instabilities, and the coupling of cosmic rays and magnetic fields. Prior work
has concentrated on the Cas A supernova remnant and its asymmetric dynamics.
These investigators will now obtain velocity as a function of radius in various
sectors of the remnant. They will explore the relation between thermal and
nonthermal plasmas, by looking for connections in the flow structures.
