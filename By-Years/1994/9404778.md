9404778 Fukushima The potential use of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI)
for measuring fluctuating parameters in two-phase flow will be explored. The
two-phase parameters include solids and liquid velocity fluctuations, mixture
density fluctuations, diffusion coefficients and velocity cross-correlations.
The key issue is the reduction of the time necessary for each imaging. Other
objective is developing techniques necessary to interpret the fluctuations and
their correlations determined by NMRI, and to define the limits of the method.
Current optical methods are not suitable for most liquid-solid mixture systems
which are opaque, particularly in industrial applications. The Lovelace
Institutes will provide new equipment for the reduction of eddy currents in the
magnets, which is the main hardware requirement of the project. The gradient
switching speed for individual measurements in the preliminary tests has been
increased by three orders of magnitude by controlling the eddy currents. It is
expected that velocity imaging in a two-dimensional domain could be performed in
0.05 seconds for a 64X64 mesh, which would be qualitatively superior to previous
results and would be sufficiently fast to be used for velocity fluctuations in
turbulent flows with relatively low Reynolds number. The experiments will be
performed in a relatively simple geometry for which there are reference data on
two-phase fluctuating parameters. The budget covers educational type of
expenses, in collaboration with the University of Washington in Seattle.
Advanced NMRI has application as a versatile non-destructive measuring technique
to control multiphase flow systems in chemical manufacturing and other
processing industries. If successful, the present project will demonstrate the
feasibility of using NMRI to a large group of two-phase flow measurements, with
important impact on advancing the science (new instrumentation, reference sets
of data for opaque multiphase system s) and technology (nonintrusive in-situ
sensors) of multiphase flow. ***
