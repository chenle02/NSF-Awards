Maxdem proposes to prepare a new type of rigid-rod polymer designed to be
soluble in common organic solvents. The new polymers are intended to be high
performance materials which are especially easy to process. Variation of the
microstructural morphology of the polymers will permit optimum solubility,
processing and mechanical properties. Potential applications include components
for aircraft and aerospace needs, robotics, and automotive applications. These
novel polymers offer a unique alternative to the preparation of composite
materials, and will obviate the need for cumbersome fiber lay-up followed by
repetitive resin impregnations to obtain the desired structural components.
Thus, their use will facilitate manufacturing, allowing the use of conventional
injection molding or extrusion techniques.
