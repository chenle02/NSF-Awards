In black cherry (Prunus serotina) seeds, large-scale catabolism of the
cyanogenic glycoside (R)-amygdalin to HCN occurs only upon tissue disruption.
Antibodies will be raised against three glycoproteins (amygdalin hydrolase,
prunasin hydrolase, and mandelonitrile lyase) catalyzing amygdalin degradation
to determine their tissue and subcellular localizations by immunohistochemical
techniques. Together with the localization of amygdalin by subcellular
fractionation or immunochemical means, this will reveal the mode of
compartmentation preventing cyanogenesis in intact seeds. Preliminary to future
research on the genetic regulation of cyanogenesis, the phenomenon of
cyanogensis will be followed during fruit development from flowering to maturity
by measuring the levels of cyanogenic glycosides and of the above catabolic
enzymes. The levels of mRNAs encoding these proteins will also be assessed by in
vitro translation studies with methionine labeled with a radioisotope of sulfur.
Many commercially important crops cause acute and chronic cyanide poisoning in
humans and livestock due to the release of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from
cyanogenic glycosides by endogenous enzymes. This research will investigate the
metabolism of cyanogenic glycosides in black cheryy. Detailed knowledge of the
biosynthesis, sequestration, and degradation of these glycosides will greatly
facilitate efforts to reduce the toxicity of such plants and clarify the role of
cyanogenesis in plant-animal interactions.
