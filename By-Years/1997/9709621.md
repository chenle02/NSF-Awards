This award supports research in the laboratory of Professor Kenneth N. Raymond
of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.
Using biological examples as models, this research endeavors to develop
symmetry-driven supramolecular assemblies. It is the goal of the research to
precisely define what can be programmed into a ligand in terms of predetermined
symmetry based linkages and to exploit this to develop new chemistry based on
supramolecular self-assembly. Large, supramolecular structures of tetrahedra,
cubes and dodecahedra will be synthesized with metal ions at the vertices and
organic linkers along the edges. Symmetry-based principles developed in this
work will be generally applicable to the preparation of other nanostructures.
