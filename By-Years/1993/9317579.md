9317579 O'Connell Under the direction of Drs. James O'Connell and Thomas
Stafford, Ms. Joan Coltrain will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She
will determine the carbon isotopic ratios of amino acids extracted from the bone
collagen of seven Native American skeletons. All are well dated and derive from
secure archaeological contexts. For 6, it is known whether or not corn formed
part of the diet and these will serve as partial controls. The seventh is an
unknown of archaeological interest. For some time paleoanthropologists have
realized that the diet of an individual is reflected in the chemical composition
of the skeleton and this archaeological tool has been used to great advantage.
Attention has focussed on the introduction of corn into prehistoric Native
American diet in part because it is amenable to such analysis but also because
archaeologists have postulated that the growth of complexity in such societies
may be directly tied to corn cultivation. In the Midwest, where corn has a
distinctive carbon isotope signature this approach has worked relatively well.
In the drier West however other plants also have cornlike carbon isotope ratios
and the procedure has proven more difficult to apply. Ms. Coltrain will deal
with this by analyzing the isotopic ratios of individual amino acids rather than
use bulk collagen as is normally done. She believes that on this micro-level it
should be possible to a pattern which is unique to corn. This research is
important for several reasons. The technique being developed should be useable
in a wide range or archaeological situations. It will also shed new light on the
prehistory of the U.S. West and contribute to the training of a promising young
scientist. ***
