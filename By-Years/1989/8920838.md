The concept of a very large floating offshore platform has become the object of
attention for uses such as a floating city, an airport for a heavily populated
coastal city, an isolated locale for a nuclear facility, and a platform for
waste disposal. For design of such a very large platform, it appears most
logical and practical to consider the platform to consist of many elemental
units of relatively small size which are joined at their edges. Hence, the
significance of estimation of forces and moments (including extreme values
expected in the lifetime) working on the boundary between units cannot be
overemphasized for design of the very large platform. Furthermore, the problem
implicated in this type of platform is that of minimizing the hydrodynamic
forces and moments necessary to connect the units. Since forces and moments
exerted on a body oscillating in waves are significantly influenced by its
underwater configuration, selection of an appropriate underwater configuration
of the units will provide extremely important information for the design of the
platform.
