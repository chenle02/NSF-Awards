9317746 Howes This project funds the University of Connecticut's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Grinding Research. This
funding is being provided by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to
support a research activity to design, build, and test a prototype high-speed
Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) grinding machine for the rolling element bearing
industry. This project will establish a teaming arrangement with a bearing
manufacturing company, a machine tool builder, and Center's researchers to
conduct the following tasks: 1) modelling of the high-speed CBN grinding
process; 2) development of high-speed wheel and dressing capability; 3)
development of sensors and adaptive control techniques; and 4) design, build,
and test the new developed CBN grinding machine. This research project builds on
the research results in CBN grinding technology which the Center developed in
the past three years. The P.I. and his colleagues have demonstrated competency
in their research performance in this area and have the knowledge and facilities
to conduct this research project. The Program Manager recommends the University
of Connecticut be awarded $3,325,000 for three years with funds provided by the
ARPA.
