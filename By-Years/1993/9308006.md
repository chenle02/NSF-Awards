The focus of this research is efficient synthetic methodology based on the use
of novel carbanions mainly produced by reduction of either small-ring oxygen
heterocycles or of functionalized molecules containing the phenylthio group. A
major emphasis is the production and use of lithioalkenes, but oxygenated
organolithiums will also be used. Most of the methods involve the synthesis or
modification of ring compounds with an emphasis being on ring compounds found in
natural products. A highly novel investigation involves the copolymerization of
butadiene and isoprene to a living polymer. %%% With this award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Theodore Cohen of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Cohen will
focus his work on the use of novel carbanions as intermediates in organic
synthesis, mainly for the preparation or modification of cyclic compounds.
