9320219 Merchant Ms. Debora Hammond, working on her doctoral dissertation under
the direction of Professor Carolyn Merchant, is examining the emergence of
general systems theory by focusing specifically on the four individuals (Ludwig
von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, Ralph Gerard and Anatol Rapoport) who
established the Society for General Systems Research. Ms. Hammond's is studying
the events leading to the formation of the Society as well as influences which
the Society's activities and publications had on developments in various
disciplines, particularly in terms of the relationship between biological,
psychological, and sociological sciences during the period from 1950-1979. The
Society is representative of several general trends which characterize this
period, including efforts to overcome the increasing fragmentation of
disciplinary specialization through interdisciplinary approaches to problem
solving and a belief that the social sciences could benefit from the same kind
of intensive research effort that had proven so successful in the physical
sciences during World War II. Ms. Hammond is evaluating the contributions of
this particular group in the context of similar and parallel developments in
other fields. ***
