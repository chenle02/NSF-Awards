95-26314 Nicholson As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Nicholson will investigate
three related topics: (1) The sequence of events and principal phenomena that
resulted from the impacts, via comparative modeling of the light curves obtained
from ground-based, Hubble Space Telescope, and Galileo observations; (2) the
thermal and compositional response of the Jovian stratosphere to the larger
impacts, using IR imaging spectroscopy; and (3) determination of the vertical
distribution of the prominent impact-produced aerosols clouds, based on near-IR
spectrophotometry. The basis of this investigation will be data sets obtained at
Palomar Observatory, Cal., and the Siding Spring Observatory, Australia. **
