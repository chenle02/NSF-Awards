This award will enable this group to continue to study whether the mass of the
neutrino is of a Majorana or Dirac nature. This question is of fundamental
importance for our understanding of matter at the smallest scales, and the
answer is likely to shed light on physics beyond the standard model. The group's
investigations will take place within the context of the EXO-200 double beta
decay experiment, the world's most sensitive search for Majorana neutrino
masses. The award will provide support for their involvement in EXO-200 through
its data taking and analysis phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This support will
create additional broader impacts outside the field of neutrino physics,
primarily by training a graduate student in the methods of experimental science,
and by demonstrating experimental techniques and technologies which have
applications in other areas of pure and applied science.
