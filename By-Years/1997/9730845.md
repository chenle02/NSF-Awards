This project will extend previous work on ion orbit tracing to examine the
condition and stability for thin current sheets. The calculations are fully
three dimensional and realistic geomagnetic field models are used. A realistic
electric field model will be added in this further development. The focus will
be on the current sheet in the geomagnetic tail. Specific topics for
investigation will include the transfer of kinetic energy between thermal and
bulk flow forms, the possibility of defining and equation of state, heat fluxes,
and the work done by particle and electromagnetic forces. Detailed comparison of
calculated distribution functions with satellite observations from several
satellite missions is proposed.
