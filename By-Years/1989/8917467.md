Understanding what controls the location of the channel head in a valley network
is crucial to predicting drainage density, and the response of landscapes to
changes in climate, landuse, and base level. Recent studies of channel head
locations in semi-arid to humid landscapes have suggested that for a given area,
channel heads are found progressively farther downslope, hence draining a larger
area, in gentler valleys. Theories for channel initiation are few and are
severely limited by a lack of detailed field observations on runoff and erosion
processes that can be used to motivate and test physics-based equations. We
propose to conduct field experiments by monitoring runoff and erosion during
natural and artificial rainstorms in gentle and steep gradient unchanneled
valleys. We will use results from these experiments to test and extend available
models for runoff generation and we will couple with these models with erosion
theories to predict channel head locations. Work will be carried out at sites in
California and Oregon where we have active research field programs in hydrologic
and geomorphic processes. The work proposed here is also an essential stepping
stone toward formulating a theory for landscape evolution by valley development.
