The International Seismological Centre (ISC) has been supported in the past
year by NSF Grant EAR8618639 issued to the University of Reading with which the
ISC has been academically associated since 1976. The University administers the
salary component of ISC finances. This application is for an extension to the
present Grant to run from 1988 January for a period of one year. The sum of
$84,000 is applied for: this is sixty units of subscription, the unit being
declared by the ISC Governing Council. This is an increase of 3.7% from the
previous year and is to provide additional resources for authorized salary
increases based on new academically related pay scales. The total budget of the
Centre is $448,510.
