The Langlands program aims at establishing deep relations between number theory
(arithmetic information about integers, for example their factorization into
products of primes) and harmonic analysis (for example, harmonic functions on
certain space with additional symmetry). Such relations are often established
through the understanding of certain spaces, called the modular varieties. In
particular, the geometry of these spaces encodes fruitful arithmetic data that
will help solve problems in both number theory and analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, one main objective is to give an explicit
characterization of certain Newton strata of the special fiber of the modular
varieties, including the basic stratum (in some cases). For one application, the
Principal Investigator will seek to verify the Tate conjecture for the special
fiber of modular varieties under some genericity condition. The explicit
description is tied to the Taylor-Wiles modularity lifting technique for
coherent cohomology of Hilbert modular varieties of low weight. It is also tied
to the Euler system method that gives rise to results relating Selmer groups and
the vanishing of p-adic L-functions.
