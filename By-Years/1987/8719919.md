Matching funds are requested for the renovation of the x-ray diffraction
analysis system in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University
of California in Los Angeles. Renovation will include installation of a modern
x-ray generator, goniometer, detector and recorder units. The UCLA Department of
Earth and Space Sciences has several research groups active in mineralogy,
crystallography, igneous and metamorphic petrology, and experimental
geochemistry who rely on x-ray diffraction as a standard technique. The cost of
the renovation will be shared equally by the institution.
