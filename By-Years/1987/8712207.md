Political participation has long been a topic of interest to students of
political behavior. While it is through citizen involvement in government that
political leaders are held accountable for their behavior, few Americans are
politically active. Although participation has been investigated widely, one
aspect of participation, individuals' beliefs about their role as American
citizens, has been neglected. This doctoral dissertation research has as its
focus an investigation of how individuals conceptualize their citizen roles. The
research will also examine individuals' explanations of their own and others'
participatory behavior. These explanations, along with the citizen
conceptualizations, are expected to provide key insights into how the American
political system functions. Two research methods will be employed to investigate
the topic. First, Q-methodology, a sorting and prioritizing technique, will be
used to uncover the perspectives individuals have about the role of citizens in
a democracy. Drawing on these findings, a survey questionnaire will be developed
and administered in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, area. It is expected
that the combination of these two methodologies will expand our understanding of
citizen perceptions of political participation.
