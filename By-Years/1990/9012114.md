In this project, the P.I.'s will continue numerical and analytical studies of
strongly nonlinear interactions of eddies and their environment. Specific focus
will be on eddy splitting, thick eddies in an ocean at rest and interacting with
shear, rings and western boundaries, and convection and internal waves in Gulf
Stream rings.
