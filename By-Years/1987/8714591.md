The proposal covers three areas of exprimental physics. The first is critical
and tricritical phenomena in water-surfactant- oil systems, and the relationship
of these systems to the theory of critical phenomena. The second is spinodal
decomposition in mixtures of nitroethane and 3-methylpentane, with particular
attention to the effect of finite quench rates. The third is the use of silica
gels. grown by aggregation of colloidal silica particles, to study random field
effects in binary fluid mixtures, as well as diffusion of spheres in such media.
