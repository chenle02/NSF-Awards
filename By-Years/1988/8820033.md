The long-term objective of this project is to fathom the processes by which the
segmentally iterated, identified neurons of the nervous system of the leech
Theromyzon rude acquire their identity in embryonic development. Experiments are
designed to reveal whether the determination of the exact number of segments to
be formed (32), and if the specific identity of each segment and its set of
neurons, is attributable to information intrinsic to the segmental founder cell
clones or to topographically fixed external cues. Other experiments will examine
the extent to which the developmental decision between a neuronal and an
epidermal fate among members of the segmental founder cell clones resembles the
corresponding decision process known to occur in insects. Experimental methods
will include intracellularly injected cell lineage tracers, indirect
immunofluorescence, and specific cell ablations. This project addresses the
mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal embryonic development in an animal
whose relative simplicity, high degree of order and ready experimental
accessibility make it an unusually favorable experimental material. Dr. Stent
expects to obtain insights of general relevance for the understanding of
developmental processes, including those governing human development, by
studying the determination of cell fate in the leech embryo.
