Recently, there has been increased interest in growing anchorage-dependent
animal cells for the production of medically important biochemicals as well as
for the possible use of these cells in artificial organs. The interaction of
these cells with the in-vitro environment is poorly understood. The objective of
this study is to examine the response of anchorage-dependent animal cells to
fluid shear stresses. A parallel plate flow channel will be constructed and
tested to expose the cells to a well-defined laminar flow field. Cell detachment
from the surface as well as nonlethal changes in cell behavior and metabolism
(such as increased permeability and morphological changes) and protein secretion
will be examined as a function of the magnitude and duration of the applied
shear stress. The effect of the surface on cell detachment and other changes in
cell behavior will be examined by studying the response to shear stress of cells
grown on a variety of natural and synthetic surfaces.
