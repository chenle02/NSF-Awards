9421319 Andrew H. Bass Verbal and non-verbal communication skills are widely
used throughout the animal kingdom for mate selection and reproduction, food
collection and formation of social structures. However, the brain mechanisms
involved in communication are frequently complex and difficult to study. Dr.
Bass, a highly regarded behavioral neuroendocrinologist, has identified and
characterized a unique neural system of vocal communication in a simple
vertebrate species during his previous investigations. This system is unique in
that a single muscle is responsible for the generation of sound. In the present
study, Dr. Bass will use a highly creative and integrative approach to study the
brain mechanisms involved in generating rhythmical vocal behaviors and the role
of androgens in gender-specific differentiation of that circuitry and behavior.
Previous studies identified a brain command center for vocal behavior and
electrical recordings will be used to determine the anatomical connections of
the system. Additional studies will investigate the ability of androgenic
hormones to act within this command center to facilitate the development of
vocal behaviors in these animals. These studies have the potential to define the
actions of hormones on neural pathways leading to behavior changes, which may be
applicable to other species including man.
