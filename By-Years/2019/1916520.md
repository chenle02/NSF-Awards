Kahler manifolds are of fundamental importance in the study of modern geometry
and physics. In particular, they provide framework to finding solutions of
Einstein's equation and its generalizations. In this project the PI plans to
investigate the deep connection between various points of view on degenerations
and moduli spaces of Kahler manifolds satisfying suitable assumptions. The
problems are of foundational nature, and answers to these will lead to new
techniques and interactions among different fields of mathematics, and will have
potential applications in string theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent
development in Kahler geometry, in particular, the proof of the Kahler-Einstein
result on Fano manifolds, involve the understanding of limits of Kahler
manifolds under natural curvature assumptions, from many different angles,
including differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and several complex
variables. This project aims to extend this further and to build more bridges
among various subjects. The main focus will be on two topics. Firstly the PI
would like to investigate the algebro-geometric meaning of Gromov-Hausdorff
compactifications of Kahler manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature; Secondly,
the PI will study a parabolic evolution equation - the Calabi flow, and
understand the relationship with algebraic degenerations. The technical tools
will be based on previous work of the PI and his collaborators, but essentially
new ideas will have to be explored to tackle these questions.
