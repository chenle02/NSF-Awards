Title: The optics of avian cone oil droplets

The brilliantly colored oil droplets within the cone photoreceptors of birds
have fascinated biologists since the dawn of microscopy, yet a conclusive
understanding of their function has remained elusive. Located between the inner
and outer segments, oil droplets are perfectly situated to filter and focus the
light onto the photoreceptive visual pigment. Thus avian cone oil droplets may
function as sophisticated photonic devices: (1) enhancing behavioral color
discrimination by acting as long-pass spectral filters to modify the spectrum of
light reaching the outer segment and (2) as focusing elements with a self-
assembled liquid crystalline order optimized for light transmission within each
different cone type. To test these hypotheses, the project will span the
intersection of biology and physics combining molecular genetic manipulations of
oil droplet pigmentation (via RNA interference) with behavioral tests of color
vision, and advanced optical measurements (digital holographic microscopy) of
the oil droplet molecular structure and light transmission. This project has
broad implications because colorful cone oil droplets are an evolutionarily
ancient adaptation to bright terrestrial environments shared by a diversity of
animals. Understanding of the optical and behavioral function cone oil droplets
has the potential to reveal previously unknown visual capabilities and adaptive
mechanisms.

The training goals are to develop an understanding in, and technical competency
with, molecular biological and optical physics approaches that will allow the
fellow to build a research program at the intersection of biology, chemistry,
and physics. Additionally, the fellow will receiving training in the
communication of science to various audiences through written materials and
formal and informal presentations.
