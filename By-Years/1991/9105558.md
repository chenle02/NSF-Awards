Cores and outcrop sections of Late Triassic, cycle platform carbonates in
Hungary will be studied to determine why some cycles record a transgressive
(Lofer-type) succession, whereas other cycles record a regressive succession of
facies. Fischer plots will be used to define relative, long-term (3rd order) sea
level curves, which will be compared to published Late Triassic curves. Cyclic
sections will be examined using spectral analysis to define if any dominant
periodicities occur, and if so, what were likely causes. Computer modeling will
simulate facies successions, cycle stacking patterns, possible subsidence rates,
likely amplitude and periods of 3rd to 5th order sea level fluctuations,
possible ranges of sedimentation rates, and likely emergence times of cycles
during sea level lowstands. The diagenesis of the succession will be studied to
determine the relationship, if any, of high and low frequency sea level
fluctuations to the diagenetic record preserved the rocks, and the relationship
of the numerous cycle-capping disconformities, and Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic
unconformities. The work will define how faithfully a shallow carbonate
platform's sedimentary diagenetic record records its sea level and tectonic
history.
