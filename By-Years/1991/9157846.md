A unified framework of controlled experiments, characterization, and
micromechanical modeling will be developed to predict the dynamic response of
brittle material under stress wave loading. Experimental measurements and
observations will be used to understand the micromechanisms of deformation and
failure and to develop physically based constitutive models, including criteria
for nucleation and growth of damage.
