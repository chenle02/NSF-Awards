This proposal is to assemble a new archive of data on gender attitudes of
American men and women from opinion polls taken between 1936 and 1989. The
research will focus on the sources and causes of long-term trends in attitudes.
The approach to be taken is that of a "life history" analysis of attitude
formation. The purpose of the analyses is (1) to identify the major historical
events shaping the life-history of attitude items, (2) to determine whether the
"liberalizing trend" of past decades has stalled in recent years, (3) to measure
the relative strength of period and cohort-replacement processes in generating
long-term trends, (4) to monitor the changing pattern of intergroup cleavages in
attitudes, and (5) to assess whether changes in individual level variables can
account for the year-by-year trends. The analyses should provide important
baseline measurements of the sources and structure of gender attitudes in
America.
