This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department,
University of Wyoming, directed by Dr. Robert C. Corcoran. Ten students will
participate each year over the next three years in a ten-week summer program.
The students will be selected from non-Ph. D. granting colleges and universities
in the West with emphasis on recruiting Native American students. Participants
will be able to choose from a variety of research topics across the fields of
modern chemistry. Research-oriented instruction will include training in topics
such as safety, library search methods, report preparation, and techniques for
effective public presentation of research results. Other aspects of the program
include career-oriented instruction and a field trip to a chemical company.
Students will be required to report research results in both written reports and
an oral presentation at an Undergraduate Research Symposium to which a mentor
from each student's parent institution will be invited
