The PI requests funding to develop and test a new kind of "float" called the
?Bottom Drifter?. It is like an Argo-like profiling float but with a small ADCP
that can operate in bottom track mode. With the float close to the bottom the
PI?s can record velocity and thus track it without an acoustic network. . The
Bottom Drifter is expected to be of use for boundary currents, topographically
enhanced flow, deep mid-ocean ridge circulation, and circulation in coastal
regions. In the near-shore environment applications to water quality studies in
lakes and estuaries is possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bottom Drifter will provide a new view of
bottom-intensified processes thought to be important for a variety of ocean
problems. It will bring together scientists in several disciplines to match
sensors to the type of application desired. Graduate students from three
disciplines (biology, chemistry, and physical oceanography) will be involved in
testing and using the instruments proposed here.&lt;br/&gt;
