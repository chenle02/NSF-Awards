This proposal plans to extend the theory of how people make economic decisions
in two ways. The first project focuses on the preference for variety, which is
usually ignored. We plan to study this preference by investigating the way in
which preferences depend on the underlying characteristic of the goods. We will
devise a choice structure from which characteristics are derived as subjective
elements in the representation of individual choices. This will allow empirical
testing and estimation of the theory. We also plan to identify the class of
preferences over goods that can be generated by preferences over characteristics
that satisfy conditions like concavity. Such class is larger than the set of
neoclassical utilities, but still a restricted set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
second project further develops the theory of preference for flexibility and
commitment, and will model unforeseen actions. In this way, we will try to
explain things such as multiple temptations, compromise and guilt. The fact that
some actions are unforeseen is a natural extension of the dual idea that events
are unforeseen. This second project will provide a complete analysis of a
crucial and so far relatively unexplored source of uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;
