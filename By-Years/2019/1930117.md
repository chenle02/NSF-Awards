Cryptography is essential to ensure confidentiality and integrity of
information. Due to their practicality, symmetric algorithms ­­ where the same
secret key is used by the sender and the recipient ­­ underlie most practical
deployments of cryptographic techniques. However, also as a result of this,
symmetric cryptography suffers from an inherent tension between real ­world
efficiency demands and provable security guarantees. This project investigates
new technical advances aimed at narrowing the gap between provable security and
the practical demands of symmetric cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project develops new cryptographic algorithms and proof techniques, drawing from
techniques in theoretical computer science, applied mathematics, and information
theory. This involves the study of combinatorial problems whose solutions yield
security proofs for existing and new encryption paradigms, and the development
of new provably secure methods to encrypt data from arbitrary domains. The
project identifies widely deployed cryptographic methods without provable
security guarantees, introduces new assumptions on their components and new
frameworks to validate their security with proofs, and explores the trade­off
between efficiency and security of symmetric cryptographic algorithms. The
project will organize an annual cryptography academy targeted at economically
disadvantaged high-school students, to increase their interest and
representation in computing.
