0425668 Yarema The goal of this research is to produce Metabolic Control
Analysis (MCA) and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) models of the sialic acid
biosynthetic system in order to identify control points that govern the
production of specific forms of sialic acid that modulate particular cellular
behaviors. The project will utilize an integrative approach where a model will
be constructed, experimental data will be obtained to test the robustness of the
model, and the model will be further fine-tuned to test its response to external
stimuli. More specifically, the MCA model will be constructed based on known, or
estimated, enzyme kinetic parameters. Metabolic flux through the sialic acid
pathway will then be controlled through the use of deuterium-labeled metabolic
substrate, which will allow small-molecule metabolite production, expression of
the biosynthetic genes, and product formation to be measured quantitatively by
mass spectroscopy, real-time PCR, and immunological methods, respectively. These
data will be used to refine the models. Finally, the models will be validated by
subjecting them to stimuli known to perturb sialic acid metabolism; the results
of the experimentally-obtained and modeled data will be compared to test the
robustness of the models.
