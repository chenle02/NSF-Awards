In many large engineering systems it is important to maintain the system state
at an acceptable operating point in the face of random disturbances. For power
system analyses, evaluation of the effect of small random load variations has
relied on examining the behavior of the linearized system about the operating
point of interest. However, results on large deviation phenomena in stochastic
differential equations indicate that under certain conditions, such linearized
analysis may not be adequate. While the linearized system (without the random
disturbance) may be asymptotically stable, the presence of the disturbance
causes the state to behave as a diffusion process, "wandering" about the
equilibrium. If the region of attraction for the stable equilibrium in the
nonlinear system has a portion of its boundary sufficiently close to the
equilibrium, the state may eventually leave the attracting set. The
deterministic dynamics then dominate, pushing the state away from the desired
operating point, resulting in a "large deviation." This research will apply
recent theoretical results on large deviations in randomly perturbed dynamical
systems to the power system security assessment problem. A primary goal will be
to develop a measure which indicates vulnerability to voltage collapse, an
observed large deviation effect for which standard small disturbance stability
analyses are inadequate.
