9627856 Umhoefer The Puget Lowland, Washington, is in the fore-arc region of the
Cascadia convergent margin, where the Juanda Fuca plate is obliquely converging
beneath the North American plate. Associated deformation occurs along the
subducting plate boundary or Benioff zone and also in a wide, complex region of
the upper (North American) plate extending across Northern California, Oregon,
Washington and Southwestern British Columbia. Several models have been proposed
to explain Quaternary deformation in the Cascadia margin, but present field data
is inadequate to evaluate these models. This project will examine how slip on an
active fault in the vicinity of Seattle continues to the South. The work is a
pilot project to determine if surface exposures and seismic data will be
adequate to test a model that suggests that the Seattle fault is part of an
integrated, regional thrust system under the entire Puget-Lowland. If
successful, the results will provide a much needed model framework for
understanding this transtensional tectonic environment, which will also provide
a focus for risk assessment.
