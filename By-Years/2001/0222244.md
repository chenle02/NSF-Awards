This project is an application of modern Bayesian hierarchical methods of
statistical analysis to the problem of ocean state estimation. The goal is to
use this statistical technique to combine hydrographic data, dynamical
constraints, and knowledge about the uncertainties in both observations and
dynamical assumptions, to arrive at: (a) slowly varying maps of oceanic property
fields on a selection of isopycnals in the North Atlantic, (b) an estimate of
the probability distribution function for possible states of the North Atlantic
circulation consistent with the available data. The project unites statisticians
and ocean scientists and provides training in interdisciplinary research for a
graduate student and two post-doctoral researchers.
