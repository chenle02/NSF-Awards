Although size and stage-structured populations are ubiquitous in natural
communities few studies have examined their ecological consequences. Bluegill,
the most common fish species in many small lakes throughout North America, have
populations that are functionally stage-structured, with juveniles feeding on
soft-bodied littoral invertebrates and adults feeding on limnetic zooplankton.
The proposed research will test the hypothesis that bluegill populations link
dynamics of littoral and limnetic habitats via their stage-structured habitat
use and thus provide a central focus about which the rest of the fish community
is organized. The research will examine processes responsible for among-lake
variation in the production of large Daphnia, the primary resource of adult
bluegill and the factor that explains among-lake variation in bluegill density
and growth. Competition between juvenile bluegill and a suite of littoral fish
species, including largemouth bass, will be examined using a combination of
comparative lake surveys and experimental tests. The research will provide
general understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of stage-structured
interactions, and can help guide the development of specific management
strategies for warm-water fisheries.
