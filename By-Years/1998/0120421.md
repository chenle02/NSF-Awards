Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0120421&lt;br/&gt;Russel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is
important to understand and quantitatively model the linear and nonlinear
rheology of highly concentrated micellar and colloidal systems. The goal of the
proposed research is to reproducibly formulate two types of systems with
prescribed rheology. These are the highly viscous and viscoelastic micellar
solutions of telechetic polymers, as well as nanosize particles bearing
terminally grafted chains that form brushes. Although considerable work has been
done to understand the behavior of associative polymers, this study will provide
the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure of the micelles. There
is little information on the rheology of the nanosized brush-like particles.
Therefore, this study should provide new and exciting insight in the rheology of
soft particles with the potential for unusual variations with concentration and
the stress field.&lt;br/&gt;
