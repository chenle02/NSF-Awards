Management in most practical settings involves a series of decisions that must
be made repeatedly under uncertainty over a long period of time. Many of these
decisions involve yes/no decisions, as well as decisions regarding appropriate
levels of various factors. For many such problems, stochastic mixed-integer
programming (SMIP) provides a powerful modeling framework. Unfortunately, state-
of-the-art SMIP algorithms cannot solve realistic-sized problems that arise in
real-world contexts. This award supports fundamental research aimed at
investigating novel approaches that can form a framework for a general-purpose
multistage SMIP solver. The broader impacts of this work will be felt in
multiple domains. Should this approach prove successful, a much richer set of
models can be solved in a variety of applications arising in healthcare, energy,
manufacturing, and so on. The educational impacts will be felt by graduate and
undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, which is known as
scenario-tree decomposition, a novel method will be developed for decomposing
the scenario tree of a multistage SMIP, rather than its extensive form. One
major advantage of such approach is that it will not require any particular
structure. Based on preliminary results and prior work on establishing bounds
for two-stage SMIPs, it will be shown that cuts of the scenario tree can
generate lower and upper bounds on a multistage SMIP. Moreover, it is
hypothesized that a hierarchy among such bounds can be established. These bounds
will be incorporated into a global branch-and-bound framework. Furthermore, this
approach may be generalized beyond the standard stochastic programming paradigm.
For example, it may be amenable to certain classes of nonlinear SMIPs. This
method is highly amenable to high-performance computing, and will provide users
with an explicit tradeoff between the quality of the bounds and the requisite
computational effort.
