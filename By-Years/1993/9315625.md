9315625 Patchett This project will measure Nd isotopes, REE and other trace
elements in sandstone from the miogeocline of the Canadian Rocky Mountains in
order to quantify the amount of continental material supplied during the
lifetime of the Canadian Cordillera. Detrital zircon data will also be used to
determine the relative amounts of far-traveled versus near-travelled detritus.
The results will give a useful baseline for future provenance studies in the
region. Results will also have implications for the existence of a large, 340 Ma
terrane in the region and the movement of individual terranes within the orogen.
These findings will have broad application to the study of tectonic terranes in
other orogenic belts.
