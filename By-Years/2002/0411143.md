Chemistry (12) We employ two ion chromatography (IC) systems to introduce
inquiry and discovery-based experimental projects in water analysis at both the
college freshman and sophomore levels, as well as through outreach to gifted
middle school students. Accurate analysis of cations and anions by ion
chromatography in various water samples improves the laboratory experience of
students, since it surpasses conventional titration methods that are difficult
to control, exhaustive and tedious. The impact of the new modules on the
laboratory curricula is evaluated by comparing motivation and learning with
results from traditional experiments.
