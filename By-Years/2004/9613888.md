The PI will perform collaborative observations of the Sun with the Russian RATAN
600 and the Very Large Array (VLA) in the US. He will combine the high spatial
and temporal resolution of the VLA with the broad spectral coverage and accurate
polarization data of RATAN one- or two-dimensional scans for information on the
magnetic fields' structure and strength in the corona, as well as the
temperature and electron density in different plasma structures. He will also
localize regions of thermal and nonthermal energy release with these combined
data sets. Finally, he will determine the three-dimensional temperature, density
and magnetic structure of intense, slowly-varying coronal regions controlled by
coronal magnetic fields and electric currents. These developments will all
provide new insights to the emission, heating and acceleration mechanisms of
particles trapped within the magnetospheres of solar active regions.
