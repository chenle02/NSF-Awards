This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Detecting natural
selection from the structure of genealogies" for Brendan O'Fallon. The host
institution for this research is the University of Washington - Seattle, and the
sponsoring scientist is Mary Kuhner.

Genetic sequences sampled from a population contain a wealth of information
about the population's demographic and evolutionary history. Extracting this
information requires accurate models of how evolutionary forces like natural
selection combine with demographic processes to create patterns of variation in
genetic sequences. One of the most common forms of selection is the continual
purging of slightly deleterious mutations from functionally important regions of
the genome. This research characterizes how 'purifying' selection affects the
genealogical relationships among sequences sampled from a population. These
techniques can then be used to identify genetic regions that are being conserved
by natural selection, thus aiding empirical biologists in locating functionally
important elements in genomes.

An important part of this work involves the development of accurate and
efficient software to implement the mathematical theory and allow its
application to real genetic data. The program will allow researchers with little
mathematical background to estimate important population parameters in any
population from which a sample of genetic sequences can be extracted. Training
goals include analytical mathematics, computational statistics, and use and
development of informatics tools associated with analysis of large data sets.
