9700004 Noakes This grant provides funds for the purchase of a multi- dispersive
x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer that will be incorporated into a CAIS-
designed shipboard system for rapid data collection, analysis, and mapping in
aquatic environments. The Continuous Sediment Sampling and Analysis System, or
CS, uses a submersible pump mounted on a towed sled to deliver a continuous
stream of surface sediments to a shipboard processor. Samples can be immediately
analyzed for elemental constituents using XRF spectroscopy. The multi-dispersive
instrument incorporates both wavelength- dispersive and energy-dispersive
systems in one unit, providing superior analytical results for sediment
elemental constituents by improving reliability and reducing the minimum
detection levels that can be measured. ***
