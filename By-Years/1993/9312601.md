9312601 Stupp Over the past sixty years polymer science has focused on synthesis
and physical properties of materials containing the classical linear chain
macromolecules. In this research program we depart from the concept of one-
dimensional linear polymers and explore the transformation of polymer molecules
to two-dimensional objects using bulk chemical reactions. The two-dimensional
polymers of interest are shaped as sheets with thicknesses in the scale of
nanometers and variable surface areas one to three orders of magnitude greater.
The basic approach is to synthesize self ordering molecules that can form
"reactive" liquid crystals, organized internally according to the thermodynamic
principles of microphase separation. Research in the program is organized as a
concerted effort in which the essential synthetic work is closely coupled to
both computer modeling and experiments on the physical properties of these novel
materials. %%% The scientific importance of the program includes learning about
molecular self assembly and the physical behavior of molecular objects having
specific shape. In a technological context, two- dimensional macromolecules
could lead to materials that generate spontaneously a molecularly defined
surface or that undergo unusual phase transitions as their constituent molecular
objects change shape reversibly. These materials would open opportunities so far
unknown in areas such as adhesion, sensor and membrane technologies, as well as
the use of materials for the controlled release of chemicals to the environment
or the human body. ***
