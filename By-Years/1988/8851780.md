The purpose of this project is to establish laboratory instruction in
bioseparations within the chemical engineering undergraduate curriculum. The
laboratory includes bench-scale bioseparation and supporting equipment,
including a microcomputer-based data acquisition and control system. This
collection of equipment permits students to apply their theoretical knowledge of
bioseparation techniques and integrated downstream processing through laboratory
experimentation, exposes them to analytical methods and techniques in
biochemistry, automates the control and data acquisition of the experiments and
familiarizes students with modern computer control and data logging equipment
and techniques. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
