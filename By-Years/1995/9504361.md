9504361 Hyatt This proposal requests funds for Maryland Institute College of Art
to establish its own Internet node under the NSFNET program. These connections
will provide operations management and information services and it will give the
college a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
(1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The benefits of
this NSFNET connection include e-mail between local and remote researchers and
educators, file transfer capability and the ability to use remote computer
resources. Also the college will have the ability to investigate innovation in
educational resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
