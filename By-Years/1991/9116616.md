This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor V. Ralph Algazi, Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, University of California, Davis, and Professor Yasuhiko Yasuda,
Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. Other scientists involved
in this collaboration are Professors Gary Ford and Todd Reed of the University
of California, Davis, and two scientists from the Nagaoka University of
Technology, Niigata (Professor Makoto Miyahara and Kazumori Kotani) and two
scientists from the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Professors Shigeo Tsujii and
Yoshinori Sakai). The research focuses on areas pertinent to high quality image
and video analysis, processing, transmission, recording, storage, and display
for natural and computer generated images, and the use of high speed multimedia
networks in an integrated digital system environment. The commercial growth of
High Definition Television (HDTV) will support this development by providing
components and subsystems at new levels of quality and performance and at
decreasing costs. As a result of this project, researchers at UC Davis and the
two Japanese universities hope to develop a framework for future interaction,
using network communications with specialized equipment, and to pursue other
research topics in high quality imaging and coding.
