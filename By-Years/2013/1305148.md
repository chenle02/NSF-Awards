Computing power consumption is the most difficult and pervasive challenge
towards improving the performance of computing systems. This project seeks the
acquisition of a new class of cluster computing systems based on low-power
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) processor nodes. Compared to traditional servers, this
new class of servers promises large improvements in throughput per Watt. Using
the acquired infrastructure, the project explores the ramifications of this new
class of servers on the performance, energy consumption and thermal
characteristics of application workloads. The results from different types of
parallel workloads are analyzed to understand the interactions between
application characteristics and system architecture and the impact of these
interactions on performance and power consumption. The project also investigates
the impact of this new class of servers on the effectiveness of power and
thermal management techniques.

The proposed infrastructure enables the pursuit of new research directions in
energy-efficiency of computing systems. The results of this project will be
disseminated in premier research venues, enabling the computing community to
better understand the impact of emerging low-power SoC-based systems on the
energy efficiency of computing clusters. The broader impacts of this project
include outreach to local high school students in Providence, RI, and research
experiences for undergraduate students at Brown University.
