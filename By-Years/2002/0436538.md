This research project is in the Undergraduate Design Projects Program category,
and supports undergraduate student engineers in providing prototype "custom
designed" devices and software to aid persons with disabilities.

The primary goal of the activity is to provide meaningful design experiences for
the engineering student that will directly aid a specific disabled individual. A
formal program is in place at SUNY Buffalo, which will ensure satisfactory
progress is attained on these projects. A group of students and the Principal
Investigator will work with Aspire, Inc., a collaborating agency, and
individuals with disabilities on the projects. Seventy-five projects are
expected to be completed during the five-year duration of this award. A written
report on the completed projects will be submitted for an annual publication.
When completed, each project will be given to the person for whom it is
designed. The hope is that this "real world" experience will give engineering
students a sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools serve the
community, attract new students into engineering, and raise student interest in
graduate education.

This type of undertaking is important since it provides a meaningful experience
for engineering students as part of their undergraduate design requirements, and
will also benefit a population where customization is often needed for
rehabilitation devices.
