This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the
chemical transformations of phosphorus in a natural environment: the hindgut of
termites Phosphorus is one of the key elements of life; and . in biological
systems exists in the highly oxidized form as phosphate. The investigator has
discovered what is believed to be a rare form of reduced phosphorus in the
hindgut of the Pacific dampwood termite. If this finding is confirmed, it would
be the first report of such compounds in an organism. The goals of this project
are (1) to confirm this discovery and quantify these reduced phosphorus
compounds through the use of chemical analytical methods, and (2) to determine
if its presence is linked to the activity of microorganisms that inhabit this
environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the
development of scientists from traditionally underrepresented groups, since it
will be conducted at Cal State L.A., a federally designated Title III and
Hispanic Serving Institution. Cal State LA has a track record of preparing
minority students for graduate research. In a broader context, the project has
the potential to make a profound impact on the way phosphorus is characterized
and viewed in diverse fields of scientific research, including microbiology,
zoology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and geochemistry. A more complete
description of the termite hindgut environment could lead to the discovery and
cultivation of novel microbes with potentially important capabilities, such as
the use of reduced phosphorus compounds as energy sources. Microbes are often
exploited for the unique compounds that they can produce, such as antibiotics,
and microbes associated with the termite gut could be a source of new bioactive
compounds. &lt;br/&gt;
