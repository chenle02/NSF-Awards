Professor Balaban will conduct research on low temperature classical and quantum
spin systems with continuous symmetry groups, in particular on the classical and
quantum Heisenberg models and the Hubbard model. For these models he will
construct a low temperature expansion using the renormalization group approach.
He will use this expansion to prove basic facts about the models such as the
existence of a continuum of pure phases with spontaneous magnetization and power
law decay of correlations. The models which Professor Balaban will investigate
are mathematical models of magnetic materials. The ultimate goal is to provide
the basic understanding of magnetism in materials which is lacking at the
present time. The method is to tackle models which are closer and closer to
reality.
