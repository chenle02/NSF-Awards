Howard Patterson, University of Maine, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for photochemical studies of
metal-metal bonded excimers and exciplexes. In solution or in the solid state,
dicyanoaurate(I) and dicyanoargentate(I) ions oligomerize. The oligomers show
complex photochemistry, including luminescence caused by metallophilic
interactions. These systems can be tuned over 18,000 wavenumbers by doping or by
adding various donor ions. This research project will look in detail at lifetime
and time-resolved studies, vibrational analysis by Raman scattering and
infrared, structural studies by x-ray and neutron diffraction, and theoretical
analyses. The research will provide insight into metallophilic interactions and
inorganic luminescent exciplexes.

Inorganic complexes with this unusual photochemical behavior can be used to
build solid state photonic systems. There are also applications in sensors and
clinical assays using luminescence detection. Students will be trained in a
variety of instruments and techniques that will be important in nanoscale
science and engineering.
