9619413 Stone This project will establish a Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site at Utah State University with the theme being the Principles
and applications of nonlinear dynamics. The site will run through the 8 week
summer sessions of 1997, 1998, and 1999. The primary objective is to show young
scholars the power of mathematical thinking in understanding their surroundings
by taking advantage of the broad spectrum of problems of interest to the
interdisciplinary community of researchers in nonlinear dynamics at Utah State
University. The site will also make available a very unusual research
opportunity for students of the Western region of the United States.
