This is a proposal to purchase a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer. The spectrometer will be used to study fundamental questions in
protein folding and structure. Excellent water suppression, as obtained with
modern pulse shaping capabilities, and very good resolution, are necessities.
The projects include investigations of the structure of protease inhibitor-
protease complexes, the interaction of nucleic acids, and the relationship
between protein motions and the rate constants of biological electron transfer.
