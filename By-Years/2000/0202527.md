Faculty of Florida Community College in Jacksonville (FCCJ) and Gulf Coast
Community College (GCCC) are adapting and implementing curricula developed by
the Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Center in Dayton, Ohio (AIM Center). The
project enables students to have virtual work experiences, and provides faculty
development for regional college instructors and high school teachers. The new
curricula, adapted to the Florida Community College System, features a modular
design that allows students to complete their education in a compressed time
while gaining real world experiences in new laboratories. Existing
collaborations with industry groups, state universities, public schools, and
workforce development organizations are helping to recruit and retain students,
particularly those from underrepresented groups. Faculty professional
development opportunities are being provided through the new Advanced Technology
Center developed at the Downtown Campus of the College and with partner
universities and the AIM Center at Sinclair Community College. Follow-up
activities at FCCJ and GCCC involve both academic and technical faculty in
collaborative curriculum development and implementation of supportive learning
opportunities, such as integrated problem-based learning and learning
communities congruent with the AIM Center's modular, competency-based approach.
