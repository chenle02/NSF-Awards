Turning to Digital Government in a Crisis: Coordinating Government Business &
Non-Profit Services in Response to the World Trade Center Attacks of September
11, 2001

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will examine what government agencies
did in the midst of and immediately after the attacks on the World Trace Center,
and the role of information technologies in the events. Starting at Pier 92,
where New York City's Emergency Operation Center was re-established, this work
will document the network of relationships, information flow, and actions
through interfiews with key participants. Research topics and policy questions
will be identified.
