The annual summer activities of the Center for Game Theory in Economics are
designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in research on game theory
and its applications. This award funds a series of research-oriented conferences
and workshops combined with informal research activities and learning
opportunities for scholars new to game theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer
conference and workshops bring together a large and international group of
researchers including many junior faculty and graduate students. Their interests
represent a diverse array of theoretical and applied game theory. Specific
topics include Predictive and Descriptive Game Theory, Auctions, Innovations,
Adaptive Learning, Game Theoretic Approaches to Electoral Laws, Large Games,
Game Theory for Counterterrorism, Cooperative Game Theory, Macroeconomic
Applications of Game Theory, Reputations, Correlated Equilibrium, and Game
Theory in Computer Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include
training graduate students in state-of-the-art approaches to game theory and
facilitating the development of game theory concepts that are useful for a wide
range of disciplines.
