Simmons College EnviroNet: Telecommunications Across the Curriculum This 36
month project provides training, networking and support for K-12 educators
enabling them to work on cross-discipline projects. A total of 150 teachers for
30-40 New England school systems participate in a series of training activities
including introductory workshops, two-weeks of summer workshops, two-days of
academic year follow-up, one week of summer workshops during the following year,
and other activities. The project is built on the expanded EnviroNet network
located the college. The school projects generally deal with monitoring the
environment and have in the past included AcidRain, Ozone, BirdWatch, RoadKill,
WhaleNet and others. Each project has a leader and a scientist/agency that
provides expertise. Each participating teacher is responsible for at least one
monitoring project for EnviroNet, participating in EnviroQuest, providing local
contacts, and increased telecommunications activities in the school.
Participating teachers are also expected to conduct a half-day workshop for
colleagues. Five graduate students in education visit and work with the teachers
during the academic year. Cost sharing is 56%.
