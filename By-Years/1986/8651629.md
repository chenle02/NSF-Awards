Perhaps the most important changes that ought to be made in traditional
mathematics textbooks in order to prepare learners for a technological world
have to do with the way mathematical concepts are taught in the first place, how
they are practiced, and the kinds of applications that are presented. Many of
these changes are not dependent on the use of calculators and computers, and
some are currently finding their way into commercial textbooks. Others, which
depend on activities in which calculators and computers play an important role,
are slower to appear significantly in commercial texts because of the unlikely
commercial success of a text series that requires access to calculators and
computers throughout. This project will focus on materials that model changes of
the latter type. The project will develop supplementary mathematics materials
for grades K-6 that will assume universal access to calculators and easy access
to computers in the classroom. The materials will encourage problem solving,
mathematical thinking, and intelligent use of technology. The final product will
be a series of pamphlets (teacher materials and student materials) that can be
used with any existing K-6 mathematics textbooks. A bibliography of appropriate
calculator and computer books, software, and other materials will be provided in
the pamphlets and referred to where appropriate.
