This research addresses the problems of detection and recognition of deformable
articulated shapes, such as people and animals, from real images. The aim is to
develop a Top-down and Bottom-up recognition strategy, where the Bottom-up
detects features, group them, and access the object model, while the Top-down
uses the object model to search for features. Objects are represented in a tree-
graph structure derived from a shape axis model. The information stored in the
nodes include probabilities, used to specify likely geometric deformations of
the object and of the imaging function. The tree-graph structure allows for a
description of occlusions and articulations in terms of tree matching
operations. To further reduce the computational complexity of the task, an
information theory criteria is studied to determine features which convey
information about the objects in the image. The PI will also develop and teach
two courses, one of them new to NYU, to support a focused program in computer
vision; these course will be``Introduction to Vision'', and a specialized course
in ``Grouping and Recognition''.
