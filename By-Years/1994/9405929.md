9405929 Wanner This proposal is to continue studies on "cross regulation" in
central metabolic pathways of Escherichia coli. Cross regulation refers to the
control of a response regulator of one two-component regulatory system by a
different regulatory system. Two such controls act on the phosphate (PHO)
regulon. One involves the CreC sensor kinase (which is encoded together with its
partner response regulator CreB by catabolite regulatory creABCD operon); the
other involves acetyl phosphate. Both of these controls appear to be important,
for each provides a way to couple control of the PHO regulon (by the level of
extracellular Pi) to pathways of central metabolism for the incorporation of
intracellular Pi into ATP (the primary phosphoryl donor in metabolism). Specific
aims of this proposal are: (i) to identify genes regulated by the CreB-CreC two-
component regulatory system; (ii) to examine acetyl phosphate synthesis in
normal and mutant cells; and (iii) to conduct gene regulation studies to assess
the importance of cross regulation in cell physiology. %%% Cells undergo
numerous adjustments of central pathways of metabolism in response to the carbon
and energy sources. These adjustments require a high degree of regulatory
interactions between and among different cellular functions in order to permit
the cell to grow. Cross regulation provides a means for the coordinate
regulation among these different pathways. This study will focus on cross
regulation in the control of genes closely related to phosphorus metabolism (an
essential nutrient whose assimilation is closely connected to central metabolic
pathways.) Although these studies will be carried out entirely in the model
bacterium Escherichia coli, the results are likely to pertain to all types of
cells. This is because of the unity among central pathways. Two mechanisms of
cross regulation will be explored. One involves protein phosphorylation, an
important process for the control of regulatory proteins (in all cells). The
other involves a small molecule (acetyl phosphate) which appears to act as an
effector molecule in the control of (certain) regulatory proteins known to be
affected by protein phosphorylation. ***
