This project is focused on understanding important aspects of synthesis of
tetrapyrrole pigments that are essential components in the processes of
photosynthesis and respiration and are cofactors in other important cellular
reactions. A key point in the biosynthetic pathway involves the intermediate,
5-amino levulinic acid, and it is the enzymes involved in synthesis of this
compound that will be chacterized in terms of physical and kinetic properties,
cofactor requirements, reaction mechanisms, possible interactions, and factors
affecting their syntheses and actvities. Molecular probes will be generated and
used to study regulation of expression of the relevant genes during adaptation
of the organisms to light and developmental changes.
