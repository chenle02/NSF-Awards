The Exploratorium in San Francisco will develop a new series of more than 30
permanent exhibit units on topics in sound, hearing, and music. Researchers,
educators, musicians and artists will collaborate in the process, developing
exhibits that provide direct involvement with science and technology using the
interactive techniques for which the Exploratorium is internationally
recognized. A number of the units will be using new technologies in sound and
acoustics and will reflect recent research results in physiology resulting from
their use. The new exhibits, augmented by refurbished and modified existing
sound exhibits and accompanied by fresh graphics and explanatory text, will
constitute a new theme area on sound perception, hearing and music within the
Exploratorium. They will be used by more than 500,000 annual visitors to the
museum and by the thousands of teachers that benefit from teacher education
activities. In addition, exhibit units will be replicated in other museums
through exhibit "cookbooks", workshops and sale of exhibit copies; the project
will generate more than $200,000 in support from private sources.
