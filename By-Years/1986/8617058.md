Charged-Couple Device (CCD) image sensors are the detectors of choice in
astronomy for reasons of quantum efficiency, linearity, dynamic range, spectral
response, precise image registration, and suitability for digital image
processing. Due to their small size, current CCDs cover approximately 1-4% of
typical telescope focal-plane images, and are thus not individually suitable for
statistical astronomy. Lee et al propose to construct a wide-field CCD camera
suitable for statistical astronomy through the use of an array of CCD sensors. A
mosaic of four Tektronix 2048x2048 pixel CCDs will be used in an array of
4096x4096 pixels over an area of approximately 110x110 mm. Multiple dis-
registered exposures of a given field will be digitally filtered, corrected, and
merged to create a complete image (approximately 4500x4500 pixels) without
defects or inter-CCD blind spots. A fast special-purpose image processor will
perform this operation in real time. Special attention will be given to
providing this processor with the capability for full image analysis, since the
large volumes of data generated by the CCD array would quickly overwhelm
ordinary computing facilities. Such a system can greatly improve the scientific
capabilities and productivity of existing ground-based telescopes at a modest
cost. This proposal is a cost-sharing collaboration between AT&T Bell
Laboratories, Tektronix, and Lassen Research.
