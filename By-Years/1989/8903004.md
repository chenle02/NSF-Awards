This award supports the interdisciplinary research in piecewise polynomial
approximation, combinatorics, and algebra of Professor Louis Billera of Rutgers
University. Dr. Billera's work will involve the use of algebraic and
combinatorial methods to attack fundamental questions in the two areas of
multivariate splines and convex polytopes. His previous work has shown that the
methods of algebraic combinatorics developed for the study of enumeration
questions for convex polytopes are also useful in the study of dimension
questions for multivariate splines. The present research will build on these
previous discoveries. A spline is a thin strip of wood or metal that one may
manipulate from the ends, to produce a smooth curve. In the simplest (one-
dimensional) case, a mathematical spline is a curved graph segment for which one
may specify the way in which the endpoints are held, to produce a smooth curve.
Multivariate splines belong to functions of several variables in the way that
the splines mentioned above belong to functions of one variable. They furnish
excellent and efficient tools for drawing or describing curved surfaces, and are
of great importance not only in theoretical applied mathematics, but also in
such fast- developing areas as computer-aided design.
