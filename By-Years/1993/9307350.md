9307350 Moses The goal of this project is to use evanescent-wave ellipsometry to
measure the degree of order and thickness of the interfacial region in liquid
crystals as functions of temperature of both sides of the isotropic-nematic
transition. The results will allow a critical evaluation of current theories of
liquid crystal surface phenomena near the isotropic-nematic transition, as well
as providing insight into the microscopic mechanism of surface ordering in
liquid crystals. Also, experiments will be undertaken to explore the connection
between the surface anchoring energy and the presence of surface ordering or
disordering. The temperature dependence of the anchoring energy will be measured
in the vicinity of the isotropic- nematic transition using a high-magnetic-field
Freedericksz transition technique in conjunction with a phase-sensitive optical
detection method. Combining results from surface ordering experiments and
anchoring energy measurements should lead to a better understanding of
interfacial phenomena in liquid crystals. The proposed investigation also will
provide undergraduate students an opportunity to become familiar with research
on liquid crystals and modern theories of phase transitions. ***
