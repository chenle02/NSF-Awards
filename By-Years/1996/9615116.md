This research will focus on a comprehensive program which probes the fluxional
dynamics of unsolvated (RLi)n hyperaggregates, Li spin counting in (RLi)n
clusters, modes of ion-ion reorientation within ion pairs, variable
delocalization resulting from stereochemistry of internal solvation of Li,
steric effects of structure, conjugated dianion salts, Li-C,C double bond
coordination and chemistry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) properties of
ion pairs in liquid crystal medium. The experimental work will also be
complemented by calculations. With this renewal award, the Organic Dynamics
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gideon A. Fraenkel of the Department
of Chemistry at Ohio State University. Professor Fraenkel will focus his work on
determining the solution structures of organolithium compounds using Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques. The versatile and useful synthetic
chemistry shown by this class of compounds makes this structural work even more
important.
