The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in developing techniques to
understand formation of instabilities for abstract and concrete nearly
integrable Hamiltonian systems. This includes the classical 3 body problem from
celestial mechanics, which in particular describes the 3 body problem modeling
the Sun-Jupiter-Asteroid system. So far mathematical description of
instabilities for these and many other nearly integrable systems is limited. On
the contrary stability for large measure of initial conditions is described by
the famous KAM theory.

The main goal of the project is analysis of the stability of motion of complex
mechanical systems over long periods of time, focusing on the motion of planets.
The behavior of such complex systems can be seen either as regular, as in the
motion of planets, or chaotic, as in the motion of a hurricane. We shall analyze
the interplay between regular and chaotic behavior to determine the length of
stability of various systems, including the complicated three-body problem in
classical mechanics, which involves determining the motion of three celestial
bodies moving under no influence other than that of their mutual gravitation.
Knowledge of instabilities of this system is fairly limited. The object is to
develop techniques to investigate the stability time of these systems. The
project will also involve graduate student training. Students will become expert
celestial mechanics and will have first-hand experience in working on classical
problems using relatively new mathematical tools.
