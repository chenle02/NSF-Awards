This project is a fundamental experimental study of waves, transport,
nonequilibrium fluctuations, and viscoelastic behavior in strongly coupled dusty
plasmas. Strongly coupled plasmas are ionized gases in which the interparticle
potential energy is greater than the particle kinetic energy. They behave like a
crystal or liquid, unlike the more familiar weakly coupled plasmas, which behave
like a gas. A dusty plasma is a four-component mixture of micron-size particles
of solid matter, electrons, ions, and neutral gas. The solid particles become
charged due to collecting electrons and ions. The electric field in a plasma
sheath can levitate these charged particles against gravity, allowing the
confinement of 1D, 2D or 3D clouds of particles. A particle's charge is large,
typically Q = -10,000 electronic charges, so that pairs of particles have a
large interparticle repulsion. The large potential energy of this repulsion,
together with a cooling of particles by gas drag, lead to strong coupling among
the particles. By tailoring the manipulation and confinement of the particles,
experiments are performed to study a variety of physical phenomena in
statistical mechanics, transport and nonlinear waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of this project includes: cross-cutting research topics of
interest to a wide range of physics disciplines, outreach, training of graduate
and undergraduate students, and broad dissemination of results.
