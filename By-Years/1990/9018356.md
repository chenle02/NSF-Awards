This grant supports travel for U.S. scientists to attend a symposium and field
trip related to the Xianshuihe fault in Chengdu, China. The symposium and field
trip are a part of the Protocol for Earthquake Studies between the PRC and the
USGS/NSF. The symposium was motivated by the importance of the Xianshuihe fault
both as a hazard and as the best analog in the world to the most active
coterminous US fault, the San Andreas. Because slip rates on the Xianshuihe may
be up to 4 times those on the San Andreas, research results could be available
in a much shorter time for fulfilling goals of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program (NEHRP) of which NSF is a lead agency. The Xianshuihe would
serve as a highly desirable testing ground for theories developed in San Andreas
studies. One of the objectives of the trip is to develop joint US/PRC
investigations of the Xianshuihe under the Protocol. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
