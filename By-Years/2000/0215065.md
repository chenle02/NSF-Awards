This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
surface coating technology that will be used to create improved materials for
regulating cell behavior for research, tissue engineering and cell therapy
applications. For these applications, advanced materials are needed that display
multiple types of active proteins, while preventing nonspecific protein
adsorption. Current methods of protein immobilization do not meet these
requirements. This project will use a previously developed technology, based on
an end group activated Pluronic (EGAP), that tethers proteins to materials while
preserving protein activity. In the proposed Phase I research, this technology
will be further developed to facilitate coimmobilization of multiple proteins in
predetermined proportions. The specific objectives of this project are (1) to
develop a new form of EGAP that contains a versatile protein binding tag, (2) to
evaluate the feasibility of using this new coating to coimmobilize multiple
biomolecules on a substrate, in controlled ratios, and (3)to create materials
that display two important regulators of cell growth and differentiation, namely
fibronectin and epidermal growth factor.

The commercial applications of this project are in a number of areas, including
proteomics, drug development, toxicology, environmental testing, tissue
engineered devices and medical implants.
