Under this funding, the PIs propose to carry out geophysical and photographic
surveys of the submarine features of Santorini volcano using side-scan sonar,
single channel air-gun seismics, sparker lines, and an ROV. The objectives will
be to refine the seismic stratigraphy around the volcano and relate it to
sedimentary processes, identify current depositional and erosional processes on
the flank of Santorini and adjacent basins, search for the formation of mineral
deposits in the submarine caldera, attempt to identify the Minoan coast line and
configuration of the island prior to the 1628 BC eruption and caldera collapse,
sample volcanic products of Kolumbo submarine volcano and examine the growth
processes of Kolumbo. The work will be conducted as a 7-day add-on to a survey
cruise already planned in the area between Crete and Santorini by Dr. Robert
Ballard of the University of Rhode Island. The study involves a number of
important broader impacts including education (although graduate student time is
limited), volcanic hazards, international cooperation, involvement with the
Jason Program of Ballard, and others.
