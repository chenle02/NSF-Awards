North American chorus frogs (Pseudacris) represent an excellent group to study
speciation, and particularly how reproductive behaviors of populations differ in
areas where species come into contact with one another. We will study how the
calls of chorus frog species evolve in areas where three species co-occur.
Differences in reproductive behavior (calling patterns) will be quantified in
areas of interspecific contact. Laboratory experiments will determine the
consequences of hybridization among species, and field experiments will be
initiated to determine calling preferences of female frogs as evidence for
reinforcement of species discrimination. The proposed research combines theory
and techniques from several subdisciplines in ecology and evolutionary biology,
and this combination should yield novel insights and results into role that
reproductive isolation plays in speciation.
