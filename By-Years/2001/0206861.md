0206861 Gurol This research is proposed to consider ozone technology as an
alternative to combat bioterrorism through decontamination of enclosed spaces.
As a "Small Grant for Exploratory Research", the inactivation rate of simulants
of anthrax spores exposed to gaseous ozone will be investigated under various
possible scenarios. The results will enable the industry to ready the technology
within a short period of time for full-scale applications. ***
