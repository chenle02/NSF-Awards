Wave motion is one of the most common phenomena of the natural world and a
subject central to Applied Mathematics. This proposal focuses on two areas in
fluid mechanics: internal gravity waves, as encountered in the ocean and
atmosphere, and waves at the interface between two phases dominated by a large
viscosity contrast, a setup that occurs in the lung airways. While situated far
apart in their relevant scales, these two areas nonetheless share common
mathematical tools for devising models able to describe and predict their main
dynamical behaviors. Within the first theme, a long term goal is to provide a
model of internal waves in layered stratification that correctly accounts for
dispersion and high nonlinearity. The motivation comes from the growing body of
evidence, experimental and in the field, that large amplitude internal waves are
easily attainable and a common feature of ocean dynamics. The focus of the
second theme is to develop the proper model capable of detecting and following
the evolution of instabilities in a class of core-annular flows in a pipe. The
motivation comes from understanding the hydrodynamic feedback mechanisms that
govern mucus-air flow coupling in respiratory systems. Careful asymptotic
analysis taking advantage of the long wave nature of the dynamics can be brought
to bear on both problems, with emphasis on strongly nonlinear motion. Field and
laboratory data test the resulting models and their predictive capabilities.

The overall aim of this project is to isolate, understand, and integrate into
working models particular mechanisms of wave dynamics that experiments, field
observations, and analysis suggest are important for an accurate mathematical
description of certain fluid flow problems. The outcome of this approach informs
and benchmarks experiments as well as more elaborate numerical simulations. The
understanding made available through the new models has an impact in
environmental and health sciences, e.g., by enhancing the accuracy of
simulations of nutrient and pollutant dispersion in the environment, or, for the
second part of this project, by helping devise improved strategies of drug
delivery in human airways.
