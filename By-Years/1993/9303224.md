Zierau will investigate the realization of singular unitary representation
associated to elliptic coadjoint orbits of a semisimple Lie group, i. e.
representations on Dolbeault cohomology. He will unitarize these representations
using square integrable harmonic forms and the invariant indefinite metric on
the orbit. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent
in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact
upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics.
