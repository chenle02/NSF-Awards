In this project, Dr. Liu and his research group will conduct a deep, sensitive
search of the coldest known brown dwarfs to identify new substellar binaries
suitable for dynamical mass determinations and to search for free-floating
objects colder than anything currently known. They will attempt to uncover more
examples of these objects through a major observational program employing near-
diffraction limited infrared imaging and spectroscopy from the Keck laser guide
star adaptive optics system, and will expand the sample of dynamical mass
measurements for substellar binaries. While there has been great progress in
studying the bulk properties of brown dwarfs, theoretical predictions of low-
mass, ultracool objects are largely untested even though such models are widely
used to characterize the known substellar and exoplanetary population.

The research goals of this proposal will be accomplished in tandem with the
broader impact of training junior colleagues. This next generation of
astronomers will receive training in the rapidly growing fields of substellar
astrophysics and science with adaptive optics. In particular, development of
observational techniques and expertise with laser guide star adaptive optics
systems is an important step toward future high angular resolution ground-based
astronomy.
