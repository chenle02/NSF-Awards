The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase
the applications of wearable sensory modality (vision, vestibular, and/or
proprioception) specific devices to encourage mobility and optimize movement for
patients suffering from increased disequilibrium symptoms, such as vertigo or
dizziness, and other fall risk comorbidity factors. This project will
potentially enhance the delivery of rehabilitative care by clinical providers to
their patients by simultaneously improving their patients' health outcomes and
quantitatively demonstrating value in their treatment plans. Similarly, by
serving as a channel to implement balance interventions to mitigate the high
rates of falls among older adults, this project will support efforts by health
care providers, senior advocacy groups, and hospital facility administrators to
reduce the associated treatment costs.

This I-Corps project enables the ameliorating effects of low random vestibular
stimulation on balance coordination during stance and locomotion to be extended
during an individual's daily routine in a non-research or clinical setting. The
basis for the technique is a wearable device capable of delivering low
electrical currents non-invasively to the individual's vestibular system through
the mastoids. Sensory reweighting and integration are paramount to sustaining
balance control in dynamic environments and deficits in those processes are
frequently associated with balance impairments during gait and stance.
Therefore, by leveraging the apparent postural responses induced in an
individual, the technology has the potential to support a variety of motor
adaption or retraining paradigms for balancing training and fall prevention.
