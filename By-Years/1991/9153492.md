The objective of this project is to increase access to science careers for
student with disabilities. The project staff is disseminating information in the
Eastern North Carolina region to science teachers on the teaching of students
with disabilities and about the career opportunities in science and technology
for students with disabilities. They are actively recruiting students in the
area for careers in science and technology, and are providing science teachers
in the region consultation on problems encountered by students with disabilities
in science courses and laboratories. A lending library of adaptive technologies
is being established and will serve the region's junior and senior high schools
as well Eastern North Carolina's community colleges. The institution's track
record speaks well for the success of this current project. In the Fall of 1986,
East Carolina University established the Science Institute for the Disabled, and
has made extraordinary efforts to provide higher education for students with
disabilities.
