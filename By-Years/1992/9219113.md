PIs will conduct an interdisciplinary investigation, employing sedimentology,
stratigraphy, paleontology, paleoecology, and geochemistry, all designed to
determine the causes and effects of high-frequency sea-level changes in the
Cenomanian-Turonian Western Interior Seaway of North America. Objectives are: 1)
to confirm hypothesis that parasequences in the fine-grained, offshore facies
record processes of at least regional extent, 2) to determine how spatial
changes in accommodation space and rate of sediment influx influenced
development of sequences and parasequences during high-frequency relative sea-
level changes, 3) to evaluate how, and by what mechanisms, benthic oxygenation
levels at offshore sites varied in concert with high- frequency sea-level
changes, and 4) to determine how water column characteristics varied over the
course of such changes.
