This planning grant is a collaboration between George Washington University,
Montgomery County Pubic Schools, AAAS Project 2061, and the Center for Applied
Linguistics. The project's goal is to study how science curriculum materials and
their implementation can be improved. The project will conduct a pilot study of
student achievement, motivation, and engagement for a highly rated 8th grade
curriculum unit (Chemistry that Applies-CTA). This unit was one of the few that
rated highly in the evaluation procedure developed by AAAS' Project 2061. The
study's purpose is to determine if there are different effects of highly rated
curriculum materials and to identify the modifications that can be made for the
highly rated materials to be more effective for subgroups of diverse
learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
