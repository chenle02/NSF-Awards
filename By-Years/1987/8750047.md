A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer is being used by the Chemistsry
Department at the University of Puget Sound to demonstrate state-of-the-art
analytical techniques in six upper division courses: Physical Chemistry
Laboratory, Spectroscopic Identification of Compounds, Inorganic Chemistry,
Instrumental Analysis, Group Theory and Molecular Spectroscopy, and Forensic
Chemistry. The inherent sensitivity, reliability, expanded wavelength capability
and flexibility of this instrument affords students an expanded range of
undergraduate educational experiences.
