&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support travel for participants to attend
and give presentations at a national symposium entitled Advances in Antarctic
Marine Biology that will review current and future directions of research in the
field. This full day, society-wide symposium is scheduled to take place at the
Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meetings on January 3-7,
2010 in Seattle, Washington. The speakers will cover a broad spectrum of topics
that emphasize cutting edge science, novel techniques, and future directions.
Topical areas will include, among others, the recent dramatic ecological impacts
of climate changes across multiple trophic levels in Antarctic seas, advances in
molecular and physiological aspects of cold adaptation in marine invertebrates
(including larvae) and fish, the role of chemical ecology in structuring
nearshore marine benthic communities of the Antarctic Peninsula, new
understanding of marine invertebrate biogeography and phylogenetics based on
novel molecular approaches, and the use of recently engineered instrumentation
to elucidate foraging habitats of Antarctic marine mammals. The broader impacts
of this proposal also include publication of the proceedings of this symposium
in the international journal Integrative and Comparative Biology. These papers
will provide an important and timely reference source for those interested in
advances in polar marine biology. The symposium is anticipated to be of broad
interest and among the most well attended by the approximately 1500 participants
anticipated to attend the 2010 SICB meetings.
