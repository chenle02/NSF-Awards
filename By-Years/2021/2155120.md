With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanisms-B (CSDM-B)
Program of the Chemistry Division, Kyle Lancaster of the Department of Chemistry
and Chemical Biology at Cornell University is developing new classes of two- and
pseudo-one-coordinate transition metal complexes with interesting electronic and
structural properties. The goal of this research is to exploit the
characteristics of these ultra-low-coordinate transition metal complexes for the
discovery of new catalysts for group transfer reactions, as well as the
development of new storage technologies, namely those based on single molecule
magnets (SMMs), to meet the challenge of increasing data storage capacity in
progressively smaller form factors. The project synergizes concepts of inorganic
synthesis, materials chemistry, and physical chemistry, and is well suited as
educational training for chemistry graduate students. Outreach activities
involving K-12 students as well as the general public will also be supported by
this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent studies have showcased the potential
of open-shell, low-coordinate transition metal complexes as inexpensive
catalysts for several important reactions and have demonstrated encouraging SMM
behavior. In this project, the following questions will be addressed: 1) can
bulky 1,8-diarylsubstituted carbazoles be used to generally synthesize
heteroleptic, two-coordinate transition metal complexes? 2) Can these ligands
support reduced metal centers in pseudo-one-coordinate environments? 3) To what
extent do secondary interactions stabilize reactive metal ligand linkages? 4) To
what extent can heterolepticity and metal identity be used to tune the
electronic structures of the complexes and influence their magnetic
properties?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
