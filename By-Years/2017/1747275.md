The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes a new, low-cost
approach to 3D millimeter wave image sensors enabling non-destructive evaluation
in construction, as well as other fields such as robotics, security, and quality
control. Millimeter wave imaging uses human-safe, radio frequency signals to
make high resolution images of objects that cannot be seen with conventional
optical sensors. Because of their long wavelength, millimeter waves pass through
many materials that are opaque to visible light, including common construction
materials such as drywall, brick, tile, cement, and wood. For example, in the
construction market, dramatic cost savings and faster, safer, and more accurate
construction work could be achieved using millimeter wave imaging for structural
evaluation as well as observing hidden utilities such as wiring and plumbing
that should be avoided while drilling, and detecting hazards such as water leaks
behind wall surfaces. This project will also provide entrepreneurial opportunity
to a new generation of scholars/innovators as the technology matures toward
commercial practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the state of the art in
millimeter wave imaging and enable low-cost, standalone 3D millimeter wave
imagers. Prior work in a laboratory environment has demonstrated the promise of
millimeter wave imaging for applications such as structural analysis in
construction, however commercialization requires an image sensor that is fast,
portable, low power, and low cost. This project will enable low cost
hardware/software platforms for millimeter wave imaging using commercial
chipsets with novel general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)-accelerated
image reconstruction algorithms.
