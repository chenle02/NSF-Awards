9352584 Ciardullo Experimental astronomy provides a unique platform for
laboratory instruction. The nature of modern astronomical observations requires
sophisticated technology applied at its limits. In addition, the field itself is
perceived as exciting by many students. These facts have led the Pennsylvania
State University's Eberly College of Science to upgrade its under- graduate
facilities in astronomy by renovating its telescopes, providing new
instrumentation for its laboratories, and improving the quality of its
undergraduate laboratory instruction. The work will be continued by acquiring a
science grade CCD system to go on an existing 24-in telescope located on the
roof of Davey Lab, the home of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.
This CCD gives undergraduate students hands-on experience in observational
astronomy and helps provide them with a sense of participation in a scientific
enterprise. In addition, this new CCD allows the small CCD now on the telescope
to be moved to the classroom, and thus upgrades the quality of instrument labs.
By providing access to the very latest astronomical instrumentation and data
analysis techniques, these improvements serve to encourage students to pursue
careers in science and engineering. ***
