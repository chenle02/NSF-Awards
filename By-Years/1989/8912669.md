The treatment of satellite fields-of-view in the International Satellite Cloud
Climatology Project (ISCCP) permits only two descriptive categories: either free
of or contaminated by clouds. For the cloud-contaminated cases, a single-layer
"effective" cloud model is then used to derive the radiative properties of the
cloud, which is presumed to be spatially homogeneous plane-parallel with fixed
scattering properties. An ability to distinguish either broken or uniform clouds
has profound consequences for computing radiative fluxes at the surface and top
of the atmosphere. The "spatial coherence method" (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982)
is designed to address this problem by taking advantage of the "structure"
amongst the pixels to retrieve percentage cloud cover. Using the 4 km AVHRR
data, Dr. Coakley will derive empirical estimates of cloud cover and radiative
properties for the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins from 50 degrees South to 50
degrees North. He will determine the effect of cloud geometry on its
reflectivity, and assess the opacity of clouds at IR wavelengths and possible
bias of the spatial coherence method. Dr. Coakley will also collaborate with
ISCCP scientists to compare and contrast the results from two different
approaches.
