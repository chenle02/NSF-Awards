Most birds have feather lice that are passed from parents to offspring, such
that louse species are often restricted to particular hosts with which they
share a long co-evolutionary history. The African indigobirds (genus Vidua) are
host-specific brood parasites, reproducing only by laying eggs in the nests of
certain estrildid finch host species. These parasitic birds and their hosts are
members of two distinct families (Viduidae and Estrildidae) that diverged from a
common ancestor millions of years ago, yet they have continue to have intimate
contact in the host nest. This presents an excellent opportunity to examine
evolutionary interactions between birds and parasitic lice. With support from
the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, this research will test
whether indigobirds carry the lice of their respective host species, suggesting
that associations between lice and birds are determined primarily by the ecology
of louse transmission. If so, patterns of lice infestation may lend insight into
the diversification of indigobirds, in which rapid speciation has apparently
followed the colonization of new host species. On the other hand, if indigobirds
and hosts each have their own unique lice, then associations between lice and
birds may be constrained by the adaptation of lice to specific host lineages.
