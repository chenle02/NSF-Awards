Tamas Gombosi AST-9618795 Dynamics of Cometary Environments. Dr. Gombosi will
apply recent advances in computational methods to develop and apply new modeling
tools for cometary science. He expects to develop a multiscale, self- consistent
model of a cometary atmosphere. He will use a 3 dimensional model of the plasma
and the gas about a 3 dimensional nucleus. The model of the cometary coma will
incorporate the solar wind interaction, the neutral gas and dust transport, and
the formation and chemistry of pick-up ions. =================================
