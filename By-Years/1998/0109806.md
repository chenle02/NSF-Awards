This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the
need for relative humidity (RH) sensors that operate at high-temperature with
good stability. The research objective of this project is the fabrication of
composite RH sensors. The morphological stability mandated by the composite
coupled with the documented excellent humidity response of the sensing material
should result in enhanced durability and drift stability. Owing to the thermal
stability of the composite sensing layer, these RH sensors should function at
temperatures up to 300 C. If successful, the technology proposed will enable a
new high temperature regime of RH sensing.

The composite materials science and engineering proposed is straightforward but
innovative. If successfully developed, the research project proposed is quite
amenable to large-scale production and will make a significant contribution in
this field.
