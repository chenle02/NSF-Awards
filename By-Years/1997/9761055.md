*** 9761055 Sekino This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
evaluate a new class of nonlinear optical organic compounds, bichromophores,
containing both heterocyclic donors and acceptors in the same molecule. These
materials have high second order optical nonlinearities, are less toxic and/or
carcinogenic and have higher thermal stability than many of the chromophores
conventionally studied. Numerical simulations will be used to assist in the
materials design. Time Dependent Hartree Fock will be used to obtain the
frequency dependent density matrix in order to calculate the dynamic
hyperpolarizabilities for large molecules such as bichromophores. Modern
theoretical and software engineering techniques make feasible large scale
simulations by addressing issues of CPU time and data storage. Synthesis and
laser characterization validation will result in selecting a particular type of
heterocyclic bichromophore material having the most potential use in
optoelectronic devices. The resulting optical materials will have commercial
applications in photonics. Photonics is a critical technology finding
applications in communications, 3-D data storage, optical computing and also
medical applications. The resulting software will satisfy present market demand
for large molecular systems simulation software. ***
