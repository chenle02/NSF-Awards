9321167 German It is proposed to organize a meeting with about 30 participants
on small powder sintering on November 3-4, at Pennsylvania State University.
Travel support will be provided for about 15 participants, who will have
presentations. The size scale of emphasis will be below 1 micrometer and will
include nanoscale powders, for which the research methods and data bases are in
development. Critical technical issues related to basic phenomena and sintering
techniques will be reviewed,a nd research trends will be identified. The factors
affecting the quality of the resulted nanoscale and micron-size microstructure
will be reviewed. The meeting will foster interaction between different research
disciplines, and between university and industry. A report will be prepared to
identify the current state-of-the-art and future research directions.
Applications of small powder sintering are advanced materials with controlled
microstructure and properties, including submicron metallic, ceramic,
intermetallic and composite structures. ***
