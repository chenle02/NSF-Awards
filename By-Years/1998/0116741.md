ACQUISITION OF A CIRCULAR DICHROISM SPECTROPOLARIMETER&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal
#0116741&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A grant has been
awarded to Dr. Lisa Hibbard at Spelman College to fund the acquisition of a
circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimeter to be used for the following
purposes: (1) The PIs current project involves a study of the structure and
function of the eye lens protein a-crystallin using spectroscopy techniques. (2)
The Chemistry Department will perform protein structure determination
experiments in the teaching biochemistry laboratory course. (3) It will be used
in a spectroscopy laboratory-based course that is proposed as a bridging course
between the departments of Chemistry and Physics at the College. (4) There will
be occasional use by researchers at Clark-Atlanta University who are
collaborators with faculty at Spelman College.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The
research project is of significance as there is still a great deal to be learned
regarding the relationship between a-crystallin structure and chaperone
function. Little information is currently available on the tertiary structure of
the protein and no one has studied the effects of the presence of salt in
conjunction with exposure to UV radiation on structure and function. In
addition, as Spelman College prides itself on producing excellent African-
American women scientists, these projects will serve as a training ground for
undergraduate students to perform biochemical research. The CD instrument will
also be available for use in teaching lab experiments in the Chemistry and
Physics Departments at Spelman and by other researchers in the Atlanta area.
Students from underrepresented groups will be exposed to new technologies
through courses, laboratories, and research projects utilizing this new
instrument.&lt;br/&gt;
