The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Yves F. Rubin of the Department
of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles for
his studies of novel tetrathiafulvalene-based two- and three-dimensional charge-
transfer materials. Alkyne groups are used to link tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)
derivatives into two- and three-dimensional arrays in which both increased side-
by-side contacts between molecules and conjugation through the alkyne pi bonds
are expected to alter the charge-transfer properties of the TTF moieties. The
potential conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism of these materials
will be examined. With support from the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor
Yves F. Rubin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University
of California, Los Angeles is exploring the synthesis and properties of
molecules designed to display unusual physical properties. Working from a basic
structural motif in which two adjacent molecules undergo the partial transfer of
charge from one molecule to the other, Professor Rubin links the two interacting
molecules into a variety of two- and three-dimensional structures. Use of a
carbon-carbon triple bond as the linking group facilitates the interaction
between the two molecules. The resulting materials are expected to display
unusual electrical conductivity and/or superconductivity as well as magnetic
properties, offering to shed light on these important phenomena.
