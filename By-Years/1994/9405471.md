9405471 Kienle Thousands of people around the world live at the bases of active
silicic domes and dome complexes. This project is to develop a quantitative
three-dimensional interior view of an actively growing endogenous dome complex.
The PIs plan to tomographically image P-wave velocities through the central dome
complex of Augustine Volcano. The volume to be sampled with some 7,000 seismic
rays is about 1km3 (500 m radius) around the vent. The experimental design
afforded by working near the summit of a volcano is unique in the world of
geotomography, and the suite of illumination angles to be acquired is more
similar to those employed in medical tomography than those generally used in
geophysics. Expected resolution will less than fifty meters. This is a first
attempt in the U.S. to gain detailed knowledge of the interior structure and
growth processes of a readily accessible and active endogenous dome complex.
