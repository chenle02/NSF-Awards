The main goal of this project is to develop methods from topology and apply
them to representation theory of groups and automorphic forms. The first part is
a program to study perverse sheaves from the micro-local point of view. This
includes an extension of the category of perverse sheaves to arbitrary
homogeneous symplectic manifolds as well as the study of the mixed and irregular
versions of the theory. The second part attempts applications to representation
theory, in particular, geometric constructions of representations and micro-
local study of characters of representations. The third part is work on the
geometric Langlands conjecture from various points of view. Groups are the
natural algebraic structures to describe symmetry. It is a classical method of
understanding a group to realize (or represent) it as a collection of
transformations of a vector space. The theory of representations has become
highly evolved and even made itself indispensable in the study of quantum
mechanics, but it is by no means a completed theory and a closed book. The
investigator is bringing to bear some of the latest topological and geometric
methods in answering outstanding questions of representation theory. Connections
with other topics in algebra and analysis are to be expected.
