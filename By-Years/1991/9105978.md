This is a cooperative program involving the U.S. Geological Survey and Russian
scientists from the Institute of Oceanology, Institute of Limnology, Institute
of Geology and Geophysics, and Institute of the Earth's Crust. The program is
aimed at developing a detailed structural and stratigraphic history of the
Baikal Rift system. Elements of the program include the processing and
interpretation of multichannel seismic data already collected by Russian
colleagues, the collection of new, higher resolution and more accurately
navigated MCS data from Lake Baikal, the processing and interpretation of these
new data, and the integration of all available data sets into a comprehensive
model of continental rift development. Objectives of the program include: o
Reconstruction of the structural and stratigraphic evolution of that portion of
the Baikal Rift that underlies Lake Baikal; o Development of models for the
evolution of the lake basins; and o Location of appropriate drilling sites that
would address the problems of timing of structural events and shifts in patterns
of deposition, and that would provide the most continuous sections for studies
of climate change and biologic evolution.
