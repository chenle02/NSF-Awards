This is a pilot for a half-hour, weekly children's science education series
produced for broadcast on PBS by McKenna/Gottlied Productions, Inc. and KCTS
Television in Seattle, Washington. One half-hour program and prototype ancillary
material will be produced and tested with children, parents, and teachers. The
series is designed to make science accessible and interesting to children ages 9
to 12 by relating science to their interests and everyday activities and by
presenting basic concepts from elementary science curricula in a humorous and
exciting format. The host is Bill Nye, a popular television entertainer and
science aficionado. In each program, Nye is assisted by children, well-known
science experts, and celebrity guests. Experiments and demonstrations will use
inexpensive, safe household items to enable viewers to follow along at home or
in the classroom. Ancillary material will consist of a parent's guide to assist
parents in encouraging their children to participate in science activities and
develop problem-solving skills, activity cards for children to encourage self-
directed learning, and a teacher's guide to support classroom use.
