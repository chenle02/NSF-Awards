This award will support a cooperative research project in medium energy physics
between Professor Robert P. Redwine of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and Professor Osamu Hashimoto of the Institute for Nuclear Study, University of
Tokyo. The scientists will cooperate in investigating the interactions of pions
with nuclei in the energy range around and above the delta resonance. This
project is based on a great amount of work that has been carried out in the past
15 years on interactions in the delta resonance region, especially at LAMPF in
Los Alamos. This experimental and theoretical work has increased considerably
the understanding of the interaction mechanism itself and specific nuclear
structure issues as well. As expected, many aspects of the pion-nucleus
interaction in this region are dominated by the formation of the delta resonance
in the nucleus. This has proved to be both an advantage and a disadvantage. As
the delta does appear to be so dominant, use of this dominance in descriptions
of the interaction have been reasonably successful. On the other hand, this
dominance can mask other interesting physics issues. In this project, the
investigators will involve scientists from several other leading U.S. and
Japanese research institutions who have been conducting experiments of this
type. In particular, scientists from the Brookhaven National Laboratory and the
Japanese Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) will be involved. With the
commissioning of new spectrometers at the KEK laboratory in Japan, studies with
higher energy pions will enter a new phase and U.S. scientists will have the
opportunity to play an important role in this opening field.
