This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Professors James
Carlson and Domingo Toledo of the University of Utah. Their work is in Hodge
theory, and their aim is to attack the problem of classifying harmonic mappings
from compact Kaehler manifolds to locally symmetric spaces of noncompact type,
with particular attention to rigidity and factorization theorems. This is
research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and Topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in theoretical
Computer Science and in Robotics.
