This action funds Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating focus
sentences in the endangered Atayal language of Taiwan," during the summer of
2012 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Professor Henry
Chang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate focus
constructions in the endangered Austronesian language of Atayal. "Focus" refers
to sentences like "I only like chicken... not beef" where the additional
emphasis on "chicken" produces a very different meaning than the similar "I only
like chicken... not love." The careful study of these sentences illuminates how
focus works across different languages, as well as describing Atayal language's
different structural strategies for expressing meaning, that is, its syntax-
semantics mapping.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
