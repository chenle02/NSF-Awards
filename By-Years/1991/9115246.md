The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) is a consortium of 46 U.S. and 6
Costa Rican organizations that operates several field stations in the tropical
forests of Costa Rica. The PI, Executive Director of OTS, proposes to acquire
additional basic laboratory equipment for the La Selva Field Station and the
recently established facility at Las Cruces. In addition, Dr. Stone has planned
the construction of family housing for visiting scientists at Las Cruces (one
duplex housing unit) and La Selva (two duplex units). The proposed housing
construction will greatly expand the number of investigators who can initiate
research at the Stations, and will accommodate younger scientists with small
children as well as investigators with physical disabilities. More basic
research equipment will allow the use of the Station by students and researchers
to continue to expand. Continued growth and improvement in OTS is critical to
the involvement of U.S. scientists and policy makers in tropical regions.
