Dr. Christopher M. Hadad has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Hadad's doctoral degree was from Yale with Professor Kenneth
Wiberg. Dr. Hadad intends to continue his research with Professor Charles DePuy
at the University of Colorado. He will learn the techniques of studying
reactions by the flowing afterglow method and strengthen his understanding of
theoretical as well as experimental approaches to the elucidation of gas phase
mechanistic studies. This will help him in his career goal of studying how
condensed media affects chemical reaction dynamics. %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
