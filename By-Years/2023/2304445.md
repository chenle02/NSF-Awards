The project aims at studying various aspects of the Einstein equations, which
govern the dynamics of spacetime geometry in general relativity. The PI is
particularly interested in studying the solution regimes where gravity is very
strong, including in the presence of spacetime singularities, as well as
settings where there is a strong interaction between matter fields (such as
stars and gases) and gravity. Broader impacts include work with students, and
the project presents some questions that are believed to be ready for research
by graduate students.

THe PI seeks to answer a series of questions in this project. What does the
singular boundary of generic black holes look like? What happens to the singular
boundary when matter fields are present, and what happens to the matter fields
themselves near the singular boundary? How do self-gravitating "null shells of
matter fields propagate and interact? How does shock form in self-gravitating
gas? While solving these problems, the PI will develop mathematical tools useful
for hyperbolic partial differential equations beyond the application in general
relativity.
