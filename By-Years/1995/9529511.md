95-29511 Muhleman Dr. Muhleman will carry out a 3-year project of millimeter and
submillimeter wavelength observations of planetary atmospheres. The observatory
for this work will be the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) of the
California Institute of Technology. The principal instrument to be used will be
the OVRO 6-Element Millimeter Wavelength Array. This work constitutes a
continuation of research that the Principal Investigator carried out previously
with NSF Grant AST 93-21602. By focusing on a range of simple molecules (such as
water, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide) as trace species, Dr.
Muhleman will investigate the temperature, pressure, winds, and chemical
structures of the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, Neptune, Titan, and Io. The
spatial resolution of the observations will be one arc second. The PI expects to
add asteroid observations in the near future to the bodies to be investigated.
