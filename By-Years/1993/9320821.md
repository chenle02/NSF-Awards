This proposal has two main parts. The first is an investigation of gedanken
experiments associated with interpretations of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
program, including issues such as the failure of locality. The second is aimed
at providing new insight into our understanding of special relativity, through a
series of gedanken experiments. ***
