Agents must reason and act in an uncertain world. The standard approach to
representing this uncertainty is to use probability. While probability has many
advantages, there are situations where it seems inappropriate or unnecessary.
The long-term goal of this project is to understand to what extent we can
maintain the benefits of probability while using more qualitative approaches.
The focus is on one measure of belief, called a plausibility measure, where the
plausibility of an event is just an element in some partially-ordered space.
Plausibility measures generalize the bestknown approaches in the literature,
including probability, possibility (based on fuzzy logic), and Dempster-Shafer
belief functions. Four main lines of investigation are being pursued: (1)
Default reasoning---using plausibility to give semantics to defaults such
``birds typically (or normally) fly''. (2) Belief dynamics---using plausibility
to capture an agent's beliefs, and defining an appropriate notion of
conditioning to capture how these beliefs change over time. (3) Qualitative
decision theory---using plausibility as a basis for a qualitative approach to
decision making. (4) Complexity issues---investigating whether qualitative
reasoning using plausibility is easier than more quantitative reasoning. This
research should help provide tools for a powerful, yet easy-touse, framework for
representing uncertainty. It is hoped that a combination of qualitative and
quantitative reasoning under uncertainty will be more effective in providing
reasoning ability to intelligent agents than either approach used alone. ***
