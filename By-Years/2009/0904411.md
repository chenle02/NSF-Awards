The research objective of this SGER proposal is to test the hypothesis that the
atmospheric response to daily Arctic sea ice forcing is notably different than
the response to monthly forcing that is smoothly interpolated to daily values.
It is expected that the atmospheric response is enhanced when daily sea ice
variations are considered. A set of Global Climate Model (GCM) experiments
forced with observed passive microwave sea ice concentrations at the monthly and
daily time scales are proposed to test this hypothesis.
