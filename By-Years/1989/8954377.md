Twenty-five college teachers of mathematics are being brought together for three
weeks to share a common interest in exploring discrete mathematics as it is
applied to a variety of topics. The conference covers selected fundamental
topics from contemporary discrete mathematics and its applications with the goal
of modernizing undergraduate courses related to this area. To this end, emphasis
is placed on basic new theoretical results and their uses, as well as
fundamental geometrical concepts, modeling methodologies and problem solving
techniques. The application to other areas other than mathematics are also
discussed. The mornings are devoted to lectures by the main speakers and the
afternoons to the group discussions, problem solving, participant talks,
classroom applications/improvements, and the use of computer facilities. The
participants are requested to submit a report indicating how these ideas were
incorporated into, or affected their courses and/or research during the 1990-91
school year. These reports are then distributed to all of the participants. The
home institutions of the participants are sharing in the support of the program,
by providing transportation costs for the participants to attend the meeting.
