This project is to investigate aspects of the Caribbean "plate buffer zone"
which is a complex area of small plates wedged between the much larger North and
South American plates. The island of Cuba experienced compression and
development of a fold and thrust belt during late Cretaceous to late Eocene, an
interval of rifting and marine sedimentation in the Yucatan Basin, the Cayman
Trough and along the Nicaragua Rise. This project will analyze samples collected
in Cuba in order to test a model of paired zones of divergence and convergence
in the Cuban orogenic belt -- the field aspects being supported by non-federal
sources. Results should help clarify to what extent synchronous plate divergence
and convergence has occurred in the Caribbean.
