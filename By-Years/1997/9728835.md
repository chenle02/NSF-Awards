ABSTRACT OPP-9728835 BOYD, TIMOTHY OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY The project will
utilize a U.S. Navy submarine to conduct a study of the temperature and salinity
structure of the upper 1000m at sites in the Arctic Ocean where significant
changes in ocean circulation have been observed this decade. The boundary
between warm/salty Atlantic currents and cold/fresh Pacific water has moved
significantly farther north than observed prior to the 1990s. The displacement
of cold Pacific water by the warm Atlantic water could lead to greater melting
of the Arctic ice pack if the intervening layer below the ice pack shrinks and
warms due to a further vertical extension of the warm Atlantic water. This study
will be one component of a multi-year study involving the dual use of Navy
submarines to examine the changing temperature structure of the Arctic Ocean.
The study will provide a basis for an examination of the role of global change
on the Arctic Ocean.
