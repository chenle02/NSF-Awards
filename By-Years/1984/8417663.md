Research is conducted to obtain a better understanding than now exists of
conditions which disrupt the operation of wastewater treatment processes. Under
conditions which are not presently completely understood, excessive growth of
filamentous microorganisms disrupts the separation of biologically active
organisms from wastewater being treated and thus interfers with the need to
return these organisms to the process for reuse.
