Self-assembly is a ubiquitous, natural, robust process in many living organisms
and occurs through coordinated action of independent objects/entities leading to
the formation of well-defined patterns. For instance, microtubules form a
framework for structures such as the spindle apparatus that appears during cell
division. A goal of this project is to develop an algorithmic framework to
identify the intelligence of encoded patterns in self-assembly systems. Insights
gained from this project are important to computational science and engineering
in order to develop novel engineered self-assembly systems. The novelty of the
algorithmic framework lies in the combination of stochastic discrete event
simulations and molecular/cellular level models in cellular automata. This
approach will enable the cooperation of multiple discrete events at multiple
temporal levels of the self-assembly process to provide precise control of such
events that exhibits specific behaviors observed in such systems. A discrete
dynamical cellular automata model will be developed to represent the local
behavior of interacting tubulin dimers in forming a microtubules
lattice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide a hybrid algorithmic
framework for the wider algorithmic community. Other broader Impacts include
multidisciplinary training for students, and integration of research into
undergraduate/graduate courses in computer science and mechanical engineering
curricula. Outreach activities involve developing and organizing workshops
related to self-assembly algorithms and framework. The proposed MTetris game is
intended to attract middle and high school students to STEM fields. The results
will be disseminated through journal and conference publications and freely
available online.
