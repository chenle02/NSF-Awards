This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes research and
development efforts for a novel environmental electrochemical sensor based on
unique nonaqueous electrolyte with a three electrode structure in the sensor
cell. The nonaqueous electrolyte is nontoxic and noncorrosive it has large
voltage window, low vapor pressure and high solubility for gases and vapors. The
sensors have the potential for high selectivity, sensitivity, long life and
multi-gas sensing capability. They can detect and monitor low concentrations of
toxic gases such as nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and volatile
organic compounds like trichloroethylene, dichloromethane, tetrachloroethane,
and carbon tetrachloride whose exposure can affect the health and safety of
workers. Phase I efforts will investigate the properties of nonaqueous
electrolyte solutions, using the electrolyte in the cell and scanning
voltammetry. will conduct experiments on laboratory and prototype cells for the
detection of toxic gases and vapors and multi-gas sensing capability.
