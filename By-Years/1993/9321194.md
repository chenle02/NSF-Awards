LBP:\A9321194 Park This project supports the dissertation research of an
anthropology student from the University of Arizona, studying the impact of
ethnicity and state intervention on small-scale, intensive irrigated agriculture
in Morocco. Using a combination of archival and ethnographic research, the
student will study two villages, one with a sure source of irrigation water from
a water control project, and one with the traditional insecure sources of water.
The student will interview members of the three dominant ethnic groups in these
villages to investigate how social class, ethnicity, and access to development
programs interact to affect the productivity of small-holder farming. This
research is important because traditional farmers in many parts of the world are
involved with state irrigation programs. Increased understanding of local cases
such as this one, of how ethnic differences and social-economic class position
within the village affect the farmers' ability to take advantage of state-
sponsored programs, and whether these programs actually increase productivity,
will provide valuable information to economic development planners. ***
