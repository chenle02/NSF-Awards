This research project is designed to investigate experimentally the interaction
of a shock wave first with homogeneous/isotropic flow and second with a
longitudinal or traverse vortex in the so called vorticity mode. Specifically,
the research will focus on the phenomenon of turbulence and vorticity
amplification across an unsteady shock propagating inside the flow and the
distortion/deformation of the shock by turbulence or vortex. A shock wave which
is formed inside a shock tube, passes through a grid and the induced flow behind
the shock has the features of a compressible flow with free stream turbulence.
The decaying turbulence is subjected to interaction with the reflected shock and
travelling in the opposite direction. In the vortex/shock wave interaction, the
induced flow over a transverse circular cylinder or a small delta wing at
incident will generate the required vortices with transverse or longitudinal
vorticity respectively. Preliminary results indicate that turbulence
amplification is not the same for all investigated turbulence intensities and
length scales during interactions with the shock waves of the same strength. The
proposed program with its unique characteristics will provide the opportunity to
a number of minority students in Mechanical Engineering to participate in an
advanced research project aimed at a better understanding of compressible
turbulence. Minority students will be exposed to the-state-of-the-art in
experimental and computational techniques and, therefore, will be encouraged to
enter research careers.
