This Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant will provide support for
the investigator to conduct a literature search, attend professional
conferences, confer with experts in Nuclear Science, consider a location for a
possible sabbatical, and select an appropriate computer system, to calculate
sets of phase shifts for analyzing the two-nucleon problems. These activities
will lead to the development of a competitive NSF proposal to examine the use of
interacting bosons as carriers of the nuclear force. In addition, the work will
eventually lead to the theortical derivation of a realistic expression that
represents the strong nuclear force that is crucial for a guantitative
understanding of nuclear and subnuclear phenomena.
