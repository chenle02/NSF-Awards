A central focus in the future development of biotechnology will be the
application of modern molecular genetics, ecology, biochemistry, immunology, and
computer science to developing the resources of underdeveloped nations.
Successful development will require the interrelated application of these
technologies to agriculture and to the alleviation of hunger and disease. The
nation that pioneers these applications will emerge preeminent in 21st century
biotechnology. Washington University is establishing a multidisciplinary Center
for Resource Biotechnology that will concentrate on producing this next
generation of biological knowledge. The Center will involve faculty in the
Departments of Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Medicine and Chemical
Engineering and researchers at the Missouri Botanical Garden and in private
industry, derive technical and financial support from companies with active
biotechnology research endeavors, and use many existing facilities at Washington
University, including excellent Fermentation, Microscopy, Protein Chemistry and
Monoclonal Antibody Facilities and A VAX Computer Network. This application
requests funds to equip two additional facilities required for the Center: a
Plant Growth Facility to provide controlled growth environments and an
Integrated DNA Chemistry Facility to provide oligonucleotide synthesis and
automated DNA sequencing capabilities. With the completion of these two
facilities, the Center for Resource Biotechnology will be a strong force for
continued U.S. prominence in biotechnology.
