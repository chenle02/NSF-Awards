This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Thomas Frost of the
University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Dr. Clive Wilkinson of the Australian
Institute of Marine Science, Townsville, Queensland. The investigators will
study the modeling of the interaction between autotrophy and heterotrophy in
symbiotic associations by measuring autotrophic and heterotrophic activities for
sponges, clams, and corals on the Great Barrier Reef and comparing measurements
with models that have been developed by the U.S. investigator. The project
combines the expertise of the U.S. investigator in the development of modeling
approaches, with that of his Australian collaborator in the field of symbiotic
effects in sponges. In addition to the light it can shed on the basic ecology of
algal- invertebrate symbiosis, results of this research can be expanded to
include a variety of mixotrophic organisms, thus increasing our understanding of
the ecological effects of symbiosis in general.
