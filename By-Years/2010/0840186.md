The New England Wild Flower Society, in collaboration with the Yale Peabody
Museum, Montshire Museum of Science, and the Chewonki Foundation, is
implementing the Go-Botany project, a multi-faceted, web-based botany user
interface. "Go-Botany: Integrated Tools to Advance Botanical Learning," improves
botanical education by opening plant study to a larger and more diverse segment
of the population including novices, citizen scientists, and informal science
educators. The project is designed to integrate a variety of web tools and
mobile communication devices to facilitate learning about botany and plant
conservation with a focus on native and naturalized plants in New England.
Project deliverables include an online database of New England plants; online
keys to over 4,000 species of New England flora; a customizable user interface;
My Plants personal webpages; an outdoor exhibit that incorporates mobile
resources; training programs for informal science educators and educational
programs for the public. Projected impacts include increased attraction to and
engagement in botanical learning for public audiences and improved teaching
abilities by informal science education professionals through the application of
user friendly, digital resources on mobile communication devices. Go-Botany
significantly impacts the field of informal science education by changing the
way that informal learners learn about plants by removing barriers through the
use of free online materials, mentoring, and user created resources. This
project is projected to reach over 46,000 youth, adults, and informal educators
in workshops and via the Go-Botany website.
