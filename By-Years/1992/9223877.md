Tlingit and Haida Indians of Southeast Alaska, together with other Alaska
Natives, attended the Sheldon Jackson School in Sitka between 1881 and 1940.
This school was run by Presbyterian missionaries and their work produced
numerous social and cultural changes. This dissertation study, which
incorporates historical case studies and ethnographic interviews, is designed to
analyze educational history against the backdrop of the experiences and
aspirations of former students and their families.
