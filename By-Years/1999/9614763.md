9614763 Yuen and Vasilyev The PIs propose to introduce newly developed wavelet
techniques to the modeling of geophysical flow processes in multiple dimensions.
The project will include both algorithmic development and geophysical
applications in convective mixing, viscoelastic flows in stratified media,
viscous heating, and thermal and thermal-chemical convection. Results will help
further the use of wavelet techniques in the geosciences, as well as other
scientific and engineering disciplines in the area of large-scale numerical
simulations. ***
