9318979 Dixon This project connects four sites to NSFNET through THEnet over a
56 kbps line. They are Baylor College of Dentistry, Dallas Baptist University,
LeTourneau University System, and the Alliance for Higher Education office.
Faculty and students will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet,
including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able to
communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of
research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of the
project for two years.
