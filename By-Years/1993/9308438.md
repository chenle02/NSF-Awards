Current nonlinear models of transformers (the EMTP model for example) are
inadequate to accurately predict the effects of physical phenomena such as
ferroresonance, inrush currents, saturation due to geomagnetically- induced
currents, and transformer deration due to power quality problems. Better
modeling of complex flux - current relationships is needed. Techniques from
nonlinear dynamics and the newly emerging field of chaotic systems are proposed
to validate the improved models and gain more insight into the observed
phenomena.
