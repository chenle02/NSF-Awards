A two-week intensive workshop for college teachers of introductory astronomy
will offer a hands-on approach to laboratory work, both indoors and with night-
time observations. We will review currently available laboratory resources and
their adaption to the needs of the participant's institutions, offer observing
experience with small telescopes, and bring in speakers to discuss topics
currently at the forefront of astronomical research. The resources of Sommers-
Bausch Observatory and Fiske Planetarium, both on the campus, will be fully
utilized.
