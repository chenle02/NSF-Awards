This proposal is for analyzing new and old data on the North Pacific to
determine water masses and the circulation in the intermediate and deep water.
This will be the subject of Ms. Ilse Hamann Ph.D. thesis. Two new zonal sections
were run across the North Pacific in 1985, at 24 and 47 N. The measured
properties will be compared with historical data, and a multitracer analysis
technique will be used to quantify the water mass distributions.
