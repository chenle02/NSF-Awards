The PI will pursue several lines of research in algebraic geometry involving the
application of combinatorial and nonarchimedean methods to study algebraic
curves and their moduli, plus intersection theory. In particular, he will
investigate nonarchimedean approaches to the Gieseker-Petri Theorem and Maximal
Rank Conjectures, the weight filtration on cohomology of moduli of curves, and
the development of a functorial tropicalization of intersection theory. Into
this research program, the PI will integrate an educational program that will
include supporting undergraduates as research assistants on carefully selected
projects in tropical geometry and working to increase the participation of
graduate students and recent PhDs from US institutions in the annual GAeL
conference for early career algebraic geometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic
geometry studies solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Over a
nonarchimedean field, one can split the problem of understanding such a solution
set into two parts. What are the possible valuations of solutions? And what are
the solutions with a given valuation? The set of valuations of solutions has a
rich combinatorial and polyhedral structure, and is the primary object of study
in tropical geometry. Recent developments in this field make it possible to
resolve subtle questions about the geometry of the actual solution set using the
geometry of these sets of valuations. This award supports efforts to refine
these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic
geometry.
