This award will support a six month visit by Dr. Michael J. Marcus, Office of
Plans and Policy, U.S. Federal Communications Commission to carry out a
collaborative project with Professor Takeshi Hiromatsu, Chair of the Laboratory
on Correlation of Information Technology and Society at the University of
Tokyo's Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST). The project
will also involve cooperation with Professor Tadao Saito of the University's
Electrical Engineering Department at the Hongo campus and also the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications' (MPT) Communication Research Laboratory in
Koganei-shi, Tokyo. Dr. Marcus' research will include a study of Japanese radio
spectrum management policy as it relates to technical innovation. His joint
research at MPT will include the application of digital signal processing
technology to transmitter identification. All countries, including the U.S., are
faced with the common problem of how to regulate radio technology to further
public interests and control interference between radio systems users. The
Japanese have developed a unique system of governmental and nongovernmental
organizations to accomplish this task which has never been documented in detail
in the English literature. This project will document the interrelationships
between these organizations and the impact that these have on technical
innovation. Meetings will be held with the various individuals involved from
industry, academia and government. The knowledge acquired on the Japanese
regulation of radio technology will facilitate U.S. consideration of whether
certain aspects might be of benefit in the U.S. Such knowledge will also be
helpful to U.S. firms which are considering whether to market new technology in
the Japanese market. Additionally, it will be helpful to the U.S. Government in
support of negotiations seeking equity in international trade. All of the
individuals named above as collaborators are well-known and respected in their
area of digital signal processing. It is believed that collaboration between
these individuals will continue well past the formal termination of this award.
