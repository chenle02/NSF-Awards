Researchers aim to develop cost-effective, accurate system to get everyday
people to be more active. This technology is a behavioral monitoring and
analytics platform that uses the sensors on a smartphone to detect, characterize
and quantify human movement irrespective of where the sensor is placed on a
person. The team uses just-in-time nudging and "big-data" similarity metrics to
induce behavioral changes and entice people to be more active. The mission of
this project is to create a cellphone-based service to measure and aggregate
parameters of personal activity and provide analytic tools for personal
awareness. The team plans to further develop the user interface and user
experience with designs that characterize, analyze and report daily movement in
anticipation of increasing daily activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing an
intelligent system that develops big-data models of daily activity and linking
it to social circles, this technology has the potential to assist people in
becoming more active. Widespread use of this technology could lead to the design
and deployment of an ecosystem to monitor movement behavior in daily living
conditions. The final version of this technology is designed to provide a cost-
effective and accurate method to track caloric intake and expenditure in the
palm of an individual's hand. From a healthcare perspective, quantifying and
analyzing behaviors could help develop insight into the links between daily
behaviors and lifestyle-based diseases.
