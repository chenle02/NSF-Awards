The PIs have discovered a remarkable new propulsion mechanisms that operates in
density-stratified environments. The underlying mechanism is a little-studied
phenomenon, diffusion-driven flow, first identified within the context of salt
transport in rock fissures and ocean boundary-mixing; although its origins date
back to Prandtl's study of thermal winds. Diffusion-driven flow spontaneously
arises due to an interaction between diffusion and gravity on sloping surfaces,
which are the rule rather than the exception for floating, neutrally-buoyant
objects. If a floating object is asymmetric, diffusion-driven flow produces an
unbalanced force that propels it. The PIs have demonstrated this concept in
salt-stratified water, using a carefully designed triangular wedge. At first
sight, the effect is highly counterintuitive, requiring no moving parts and
therefore seemingly generating propulsion from nowhere; when in fact, the
kinetic energy of motion is drawn from the underlying molecular diffusion
process. Many fundamental questions remain to be answered, including: How does
the propulsion speed scale with the governing parameters? Does suppression of
vertical fluid motion by stratification dictate that confinement is always an
influence? And is this effect exploited to transport particles and organisms in
natural settings, such as lakes and oceans? This study will develop
understanding of a new physical effect in fluid dynamics: propulsion through
diffusion. The planned studies center on a carefully coordinated program of
laboratory experiments, designed to investigate the interdependency of the
dimensionless groups that govern the propulsion speed as affected by, three-
dimensionality, shape, stratification, diffusivity, viscosity and inertia.. The
planned Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is difficult for such small-scale, low-
speed flows. This data will reveal the underlying flow structure, to help
develop analytical and numerical models. Undergraduate research students will be
involved in the experiments through the MIT UROP program and through a flow-
visualization research project coordinated with Dr. Jim Bales at the MIT
Edgerton Lab. Visualizations will be posted to repositories of fluid mechanics,
and benchmark data for testing numerical simulations of stratified flow will be
posted on the PI's website.
