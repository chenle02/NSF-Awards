Anthropologists tend to overlook the New World monkeys because they are not on
the main line of relationship to humans. Nevertheless, they comprise an exciting
side branch which provides anthropologists with examples parallel to changes
which have taken place in the catarrhine fossil record. The history of New World
monkeys is still poorly known, compared with that of other major radiations of
higher primates in the eastern hemisphere, and phylogenetic relationships among
the relatively distinct groups of platyrrhine fossils are largely unresolved.
Until very recently, the entire fossil record for platyrrhines consisted of
remains of fewer than thirty individuals. During the past four years,
paleontological research in Colombia and Argentina has yielded an abundance of
new fossils that may be very important in sorting out these relationships.
Further systematic and functional studies of new Argentine fossils will help
clarify relationships among modern platyrrhines, and provide additional
documentation about their adaptive diversity. The fossils from Argentina have
come from two roughly contemporaneous formations, the Santa Cruz and the
Pinturas, yet the two formations have different species of monkeys. This project
will investigate the extent to which these morphological differences are the
result of differences in time, environment, and/or geographical position of the
two formations, and the PI will reconstruct the paleoenvironments of these
formations. The project will contribute to our understanding of the phylogeny
and diversification of New World primates, and permit broader comparisons
between those in South America and those on other continents.
