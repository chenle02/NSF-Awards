This project will support the participation of researchers from the United
States at the Fifth International Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Fluid and
Plasma Dynamics to be held in Wailea, Hawaii from June 28 - July 3, 1998. The
objective of the workshop is to give researchers in the mathematics of fluids,
plasmas, stellar systems, and rarefied gas dynamics the opportunity to present
recent progress and learn about new directions and tools. The conference will
focus on the following main areas of research: magnetohydrodynamics, kinetic
theory of gases and granular flow, compressible and incompressible fluid
mechanics, semi- conductor dynamics, and numerical methods for resolution of
these problems. The workshop will bring together researchers from the U.S.,
Japan, Canada, Australia, India, and Europe.
