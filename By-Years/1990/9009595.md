This award extends for one year the American Statistical Association project
entitled "On-Site Research to Improve the Quality of Education Statistics". The
plan for subsequent years is to effect a merger with similar on-site research
programs conducted at the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The program, which was initiated at the National Center of Education
Statistics in 1986, brings senior research fellows and associates to the Center
for periods of up to one year. Its broadbased goal is to help bridge the gap
between academic scholars and governmental scientists by exposing the fellows
and associates to methodological problems and policy issues likely to be
encountered only in a large scale Federal statistical agency and by exposing
government social scientists to new theoretical developments which might have
application to their work. Residence at the Center allows fellows and associates
to carry out research that would be difficult if not impossible to do without
ready access to its data resources which the program provides.
