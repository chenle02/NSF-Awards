&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Heaven will conduct research in the field of
elementary reaction dynamics to investigate how long-range interaction forces
between reactants influence the reaction probability and the partitioning of the
energy between the products. High-resolution spectroscopy will be used to map
out the long-range potentials for select reaction pairs and associated van der
Waals complexes. The project includes a study of the effects of reactant
orientation on the unimolecular decay dynamics and the solvation of open-shell
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with fundamental issues of
molecular reaction dynamics, i.e., how molecules react with one another in time
and as function of separation. Experiments will be performed on select prototype
systems to obtain data that will assist in the development of advanced
theoretical models that describe reaction chemistry. The work is done in
collaboration with theorists. Students and postdoctoral research associates
participate in this research and thereby obtain knowledge and skills that
prepare them for employment in industry, government laboratories or
academia.&lt;br/&gt;
