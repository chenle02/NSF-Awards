9350513 Rossman The Midwest Public Garden Collaborative (MPGC), a consortium of
5 public garden and arboreta, recognized for their leadership and contributions
in public science education, seeks support to develop a series of instructional
materials entitled Discovery Units. These Units will link classrooms to public
gardens with investigations and study that will occur before, during and after a
public garden field trip. Field trips will be planned as an integral part of the
overall science instruction program. This cooperative partnership project has
the potential of reaching 100,000 elementary students and 4,000 of their
teachers each year. ***
