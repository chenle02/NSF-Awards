The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was designed to
increase the participation of minorities in scientific and engineering research
by providing support to strengthen the research environment and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions. Institutions eligible to participate in
this program must have in addition to a substantial enrollment of minority
students, graduate programs in science or programs in engineering. Researchers
at the University of Texas at El Paso will use a RIMI planning grant to explore
surface science research possibilities in several areas. Explorations will focus
on the effect of oxygen on carbon-hydrogen bond activation in methane, co-
adsorption of alkalis and carbon monoxide on transition metal surfaces, and the
chemical activation of silicon-based materials on clean metal surfaces. This
planning grant will increase the investigator's capability to perform surface
analysis experiments and will contribute to the institution's long-term goal to
establish a strong materials science program. The principal investigator has
experience in surface science studies and continues to publish extensively in
refereed journals. This RIMI planning grant will lead to activities that will
encourage more minority students to choose careers in materials science.
