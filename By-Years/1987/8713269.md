The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
The University of Maryland - Eastern Shore will evaluate its marine science area
with the goal of establishing a minority-based program in this field. This
institution has the facilities and personnel to initate plans to study the
feasibility of becoming a Minority Research Center of Excellence in the marine
sciences. The Foundation has supported this project since minorities are grossly
underrepresented in the marine sciences and this planning project can help
overcome this problem.
