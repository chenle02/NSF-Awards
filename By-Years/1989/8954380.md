The project is bringing recent significant developments in computational number
theory to the attention of the faculty. Twenty- five faculty are participating,
primarily from four year and graduate institutions in the upper Midwest.The
activities include a five-day workshop. A June 1990 and a one-day follow-up
meeting in the spring of 1991 are being held at the University of Wisconsin-
Whitewater. Dr. Carl Pomerance is speaking at the workshop and presenting ten
one-hour expository lectures on various topics. The topics have applications in
number theory, public key cryptosystems and situations where primarily testing
or the factorization of large numbers are important. Participants are expected
and encouraged to incorporate the topics into their classes and will report on
their experiences at the spring 1991 follow-up meeting.
