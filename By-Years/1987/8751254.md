This project will improve the science education of students in the Richland
County schools, South Carolina by enhancing the science background and teaching
strategies of 5th and 6th grade teachers. Thirty teachers will participate in a
two year program involving 2 five week summer workshops and intensive activity
and follow-up during the ensuing academic years. The summer workshops will
emphasize science and mathematics content, teaching techniques and laboratory
skills. Participant teachers will develop and implement "hands-on" science units
within their classrooms and provide inservice programs for their peers. The
administration of the schools has guaranteed support for both materials
acquisition and the remuneration of teachers for conducting inservice programs.
The participating teachers will have access to students during the summer to
field test the units being developed. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
will provide materials and consultant service to the project teachers. A unique
aspect of this program is the involvement of parents and sharing the goals and
objectives of the program with them. This proposal is deserving of funding since
it focuses on science and mathematics at the upper elementary level, serves an
underrepresented population, provides excellent followup activities to the
participating teachers, and involves a commitment of the school districts being
served.
