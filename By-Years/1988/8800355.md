This research is in the area of locally symmetric spaces and the transcendental
methods of algebraic geometry. More specifically it will concentrate on the
Hodge theory for the intersection homology of varieties. These structures should
be given simpler descriptions and they should be related to the Hodge structures
provided by L2 harmonic forms with respect to good Kahler metrics. A related
development along these themes is the appearance of two proofs of the principal
investigator's 1980 conjecture equating the usual L2-cohomology of a locally
symmetric variety with the intersection homology of its Baily- Borel-Satake
compactification. This problem will receive more work for the nature of the
result will be elucidated by generalizing it to its natural setting, which is
probably to Satake compactifications with only equal-rank boundary components.
The nature of this work is in the geometrical end of studying the sets of
solutions of polynomial equations. Various invariants are studied which give
deep understanding of these geometric objects. These in turn should give
applications to many areas of mathematics, most especially in geometry and
analysis.
