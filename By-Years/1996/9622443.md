McKernan The area of the planned research is in higher dimensional algebraic
geometry, more especially the minimal model program and Mori theory. Building on
previous work, some questions centered around the log category (projective
varieties with boundaries), especially work on log del Pezzo surfaces and
deformation theory. Some more general problems in higher dimensional algebraic
geometry are also proposed. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.
Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
