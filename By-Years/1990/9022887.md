This activity will result in production of an implementation strategy document
for the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) of the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). This strategy document will outline how
ICSU intends to develop and implement the core scientific projects of the IGBP.
The strategy is the result of a substantial planning effort undertaken by the
international scientific community under the leadership of ICSU's Special
Committee for Geosphere- Biosphere (SCGB) with substantial input and support
from U.S. scientists.
