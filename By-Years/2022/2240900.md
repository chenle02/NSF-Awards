This research delves into the history of the legal and social regulation of, and
the production of knowledge, around human bodies and sexuality. The goal is to
uncover the ways in which modern state institutions, legal frameworks, shifting
material relations, and the reception and translation of medical knowledge,
transformed conceptions of sexuality during the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. Hegemonic narratives have sought to obfuscate not only the
contemporary existence of non-normative sexual experiences in certain national
contexts, but also aimed to bury any historical traces of non-normative forms of
gender and sexuality. This dissertation project documents the history and
shifting perceptions of sexual diversity and explores how and why attitudes
toward this diversity were historically transformed in different national
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By conducting archival research to examine the
pre-colonial to post-colonial periods, the project aims to answer the following
questions: (1) How did the historical ‘otherizing’ of non-normative sexuality
take shape and contributed to the marginalization of those “others”? (2) How did
the ‘otherizing’ depend (or not) on the widely accepted thesis surrounding the
emergence and translation of ‘medicalized’ understandings of sexuality in the
nineteenth century? (3) In a colonial and post-colonial context, how did certain
forms of sexual expression become criminalized? (4) How did the structural
marginalization of certain types of sexuality manifest itself and impact public
health of e.g., populations impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic? Project findings
will contribute toward a doctoral dissertation, a book manuscript, and the data
generated will be archived to facilitate future research on these
topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
