9119575 Dill This proposal would provide primarily provide postdoctoral support
to this group of researchers to work on the development of potential function of
intermediate and variable resolution and the interfacing of high-resolution
force-fields with low resolution statistical mechanics methods. Four specific
subprojects are planned: the integrating of the Poisson- Boltzmann
electrostatics with microscopic models, the development of intermediate
resolution force-field in conjunction with atomic resolution and fast lattice
models, the determination of local minima of low-resolution structures via
atomic resolution force- fields, the integration of polymer statistical
mechanics with force-fields. In addition this group will attract postdocs with
backgrounds in nonbiological areas such as mathematics or computer sciences,
thus providing a broad, interdisciplinary training environment. ***
