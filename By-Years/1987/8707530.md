The extracellular matrix has long been recognized as a scaffold for developing
and regenerating tissues. Recently the matrix has been shown to have more
specific effects on cellular differentiation. In the case of regenerating
muscle, studies demonstrate that molecules associated with the synaptic portion
of the matrix direct the accumulation of specific components on myofibers and
nerve terminals. Although the functional components of nerve and muscle have
been identified, little is known about how they are brought together into the
orderly arrangement necessary for synaptic transmission. Dr. Nitkin will examine
the role of extracellular matrix factors in the development of synaptic
structure at the neuromuscular junction. During regeneration, factors associated
with the matrix direct the differentiation of both pre- and postsynaptic
elements. Dr. Nitkin and his colleagues will focus on agrin, a matrix molecule
that induces discrete synapse-like patches on myotubes grown in culture. They
will use cellular and molecular approaches in culture to examine the following
aspects of synapse formation: (1) What is the biochemical nature of the active
molecule? (2) How is agrin integrated into the extracellular matrix at the
neuromuscular junction? (3) How does agrin interact with myotubes to bring about
synaptic differentiation? The results of these experiments will increase our
understanding of the mechanisms of synapric organization, and may eventually
contribute to the design of clinical strategies for facilitating regeneration of
nervous tissue.
