9321604 Stephan/Glenn The whooping crane is a well known endangered species that
is successfully recovering from a severe reduction in population size (a
population size bottleneck). Whooping cranes were reduced to one wild population
with 14 adults in 1941, but now number more than 300 individuals. Additionally
there are large numbers of whooping cranes in museum collections from previous
historical populations. Because it is now possible to obtain genetic information
from museum specimens, whooping cranes represent an opportunity to measure
directly the loss of genetic variation in an uniquely well studied species that
has experienced a population bottleneck. Stephan and Glenn propose to sequence
and analyze mitochondrial and nuclear DNA loci of the whooping cranes. By
obtaining genetic information from individuals that lived prior to, during, and
following the most severe portion of the bottleneck, they will be able to
compare the level of the genetic variation in whooping cranes with that
predicted by population genetic models. Based on these comparisons, they will
have the opportunity to assess the accuracy of theoretical models and to suggest
the reintroduction strategy that most closely mimics the historical pattern of
genetic variation among the populations of whooping cranes.
