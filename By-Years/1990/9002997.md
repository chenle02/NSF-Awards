The principal investigator will continue to develop the theory of stochastic
partial differential equations (SPDE's). Random fields governed by SPDE's have
been used intensively in physics, biology, chemistry, and electrical engineering
as models for various random phenomena. Substantial progress in this field has
been made in the last decade, but still the theory is in its infancy. The
investigator plans to continue his research in several related areas of linear
and non-linear SPDE's.
