The ultimate objectives of this research are to understand and analyze the
nature of heuristic information and to develop heuristic techniques for improved
problem solving strategies. This project seeks to extend and assess the
efficiency of constraint-solving algorithms by identifying classes of tractable
problems on one hand and improving general backtrack schemes on the other. Our
approach is to relate the tractability of the problem to its topological
structure. In addition we will extend the constraint-network model to represent
non-monotonic knowledge and guide Truth-maintenance algorithms. This extension
will be applied to the domains of diagnosis and temporal reasoning.
