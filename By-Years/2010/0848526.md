This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a
shortwavelength, narrow-bandwidth, high-brightness photo-ionization laser; that
can be used for used for ultra-high energy-resolution, angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and for single-photon-ionization (SPI) in
order to improve mass spectroscopy-based detection capabilities of complex
organic molecules, especially low-vapor-pressure explosive compounds and trace
residues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The compact size, efficient optical conversion,
and high brightness of the proposed laser source will enable integration into
"field-ready", on-line mass spectrometry tools. The capabilities of the proposed
single-photon-ionization light source will also complement a broad array of
established mass-spectral analysis techniques to enable the development of
instruments capable of analyzing heterogeneous samples with no a-priori
knowledge of the sample composition. This capability is urgently needed for a
variety of homeland security and non-proliferation applications.
