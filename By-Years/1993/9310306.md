9310306 Dennis Multidisiciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) involves coupling
numerical optimization with analysis simulations to optimize an overall design
subject to the constraints imposed by its components. Efficient methods for
achieving reliable solutions to this class of problems will be examined,
focusing on key MDO challenges such as: determining the type of feasibility to
be maintained at each optimization iteration, mixing discrete and continuous
variables, decomposing complex systems, and handling multiple (competing)
objective functions robustly.
