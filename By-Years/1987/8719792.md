This work will consist of experiments on melting in silicate- carbonate-CO2-H2O
systems with applications to the origin of kimberlites and carbonatites, which
relate directly to mantle processes. The project is to trace the reduced
volatile components and their metasomatic and magmatic effects from deep mantle
through oxidation to their consolidation in or evolution from near-surface
magmas. Comprehensive petrogenetic schemes developed recently for the origin of
kimerlites, nephelinites and carbonatites will be tested in experiments using
natural minerals recombined in proportions suitable for rock reaction studies.
