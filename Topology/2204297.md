In the 1980s, mathematics received an incredible influx of ideas coming from
physics that had tremendous mathematical interest and applications. Topology is
a field of mathematics that studies properties of shapes which are preserved
under deformations such as stretching, crumpling, and bending, but not tearing
or gluing. Quantum field theories that only depend on topological properties of
space, and not geometric ones such as length and angle, became a field of
mathematics, known as topological field theory (TFT). This project constitutes a
multifaceted investigation of TFTs in dimensions three, four, and higher, using
new techniques which have only been fully developed in the past decade. The
problems considered are of a foundational nature, and answers to these are
expected to lead to new techniques and interactions among different fields of
mathematics and have potential applications in physics. Graduate students are an
important part of this research program; graduate education, mentoring as well
as dissemination of the results to the broader community of scientists via
lectures and workshops is a key broader impact of the project.

The PI's program will initially focus on recent advances relating TFT to the
classification of smooth manifolds up to stable diffeomorphism. Special emphasis
will be placed on 4-dimensional aspects and obtaining new examples of TFTs that
distinguish homotopy equivalent manifolds. Another goal is to construct non-
semisimple TFTs. Unlike the currently known examples, these have the potential
to distinguish exotic smooth structures. A long-term goal of the program is to
give a proof of the relative tangle hypothesis. This is the main missing part of
Lurie?s proof of the cobordism hypothesis and fills a major gap in the proof of
this important result.
