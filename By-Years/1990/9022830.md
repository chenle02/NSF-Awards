This project conducts an experimental investigation of the effects of program
trading in stock indices on the volatility of stock prices and on the
informational efficiency of stock markets. In addition, it determines how these
effects vary with the rules which govern trade in the markets. The research is
conducted in a sequence of experimental markets. The initial studies examine
volatility and efficiency in a market with multiple stocks but without any
derivative securities. The project then introduces stock index futures. Finally,
program traders are introduced. These studies are conducted in both the standard
double auction market and also in an open outcry market. Experimental analysis
of program trading is important and timely. Currently, at least four major
exchanges (including the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Options Exchange) are investigating the role of program trading. The issues of
concern seem ideally suited to an experimental analysis. The controlled
conditions allow precise measurement of the way program trading affects the
price volatility and informational efficiency of experimental markets. The
research should also enhance our understanding of the role of trading rules in
the effects of program trading.
