In a real-time, Time-Of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography medical imaging
system, the execution time of the reconstruction algorithm is an important
factor in the overall image reconstruction time. In this research, the
performance of a sine transform reconstruction algorithm, which was shown to
require fewer operations than the existing algorithm, will be evaluated in terms
of the image resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed
image. The objective of this research is to confirm the assertion that this fast
reconstruction algorithm does not impair the quality of a reconstructed image.
Mathematical analysis on simple images and computer simulation of three-
dimensional models of both a heart and a portion of a brain will be done. The
effects of accidental coincidence events, the intrinsic resolution of detectors,
and the physical arrangement of detectors will also be examined in the
simulation. A fast, real-time system can make possible the transient study of
biochemical and physiological processes in living organs and may open new
frontiers in medical research.
