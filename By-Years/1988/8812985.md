This research is aimed at understanding phosphorus fluxes in the mixed layer of
the ocean. Radioisotopes of phosphorus (P-32 and P-33) will be used as short-
lived tracers of the biodynamics of this nutrient. Data have been obtained to
show the technique is feasible and methods to measure dissolved inorganic
phosphorus (DIP), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and particulate organic
phosphorus (POP) are fully developed. This is a two-year study in the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans at places and times to be determined on an opportunity
basis. Biologists have long attempted to define phosphorus cycling in the mixed
layer of the ocean and have faced the difficulties of multiple rates of exchange
among several compartments, such as dissolved inorganic phosphorus, dissolved
organic phosphorus and particulate organic phosphorus. Through new techniques
using short-lived radioactive isotopes of phosphorus as tracers, the movement of
this nutrient through the various compartments can be defined. This is a two-
year study involving ships of opportunity to sample and analyze the upper layer
of open ocean water in the Pacific and the Atlantic.
