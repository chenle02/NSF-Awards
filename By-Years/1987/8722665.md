This project examines the organization and ceremonial use of space within a
Middle Woodland enclosure in order to document the presence of activity areas
and develop rigorous sequences of architectural development. The student will
excavate a circular enclosure at Pinson Mounds Site, in western Tennessee. This
is one of the largest Middle Woodland earthwork centers. Since the beginning of
archaeological inquiries about prehistoric remains in the eastern United States,
scholars have sought to assign earthen enclosures to the religious and
ceremonial realm of culture. Recently, scholars have suggested that enclosures
were major foci for inter- and intra-group interaction. This proposal will test
these two models in order to discover how Middle Woodland groups planned and
structured enclosures and used space. This research will extend our knowledge
about the cultural occupation in Middle Woodland sites and help test models of
group interaction patterns. It will also provide new information about the use
of space in tribal societies and architecture's relation to social dynamics.
