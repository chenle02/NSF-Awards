An award is made to South Dakota State University (SDSU) to acquire a state-of-
the-art, high resolution, analytical, transmission electron microscope (TEM).
The TEM will be housed in a shared facility to enable and encourage
interdisciplinary collaboration of faculty and students from colleges and
universities across South Dakota and the region. The TEM will be incorporated
into SDSU outreach activities to help high school science teachers stimulate
student interest in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and
math.

The TEM will allow researchers to examine many different materials on the
molecular level and nano-scale, which will immediately benefit a broad research
portfolio. The TEM will be used in several projects to aid energy independence
including developing better photovoltaic materials, developing better
electrochemical energy storage devices, and developing better catalysts for
converting biomass to gasoline. The TEM will also be used in projects to
increase sustainable food production by allowing researchers to focus in on the
mechanics of emerging viral infectious diseases and examining the resource
exchange processes in mycorrhizal-plant interactions.
