9400774 HAHN This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment
for the research vessel ENDEAVOR, an NSF-owned ship operated by the University
of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography and dedicated to use in support
of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items
as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, William B. Hahn is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to
replace a power pack for a portable winch, upgrade and integrate the ship's
winch readout system, obtain an attitudinal GPS system, an INMARSAT C
communications unit, and a NAVTEX weather warning unit, replace an unserviceable
ship monitoring and alarm system and recondition the ship's galley. ***
