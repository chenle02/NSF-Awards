This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase the hardware for
constructing a piston-cylinder type system for high-pressure research. The
equipment will be constructed and operated in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of Oregon. The University and Department are
committed to providing the remaining half of the funding required for hardware
acquisition and the expenses associated with building the apparatus. The new
high-pressure system will be an end-loaded press capable of extended (up to six
weeks) duration runs in the pressure-temperature region of 60 kilobars and 1600K
with temperature stability of +/- 0.5K. Its capabilities will be employed in
research on the melting of crustal rocks, the origin of magmatism in subduction
zones, and the storage and migration patterns of melts at depth in the Earth.
