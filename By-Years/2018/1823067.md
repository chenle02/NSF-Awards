This proposal supports six students for their travel to attend the 11th
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Security and Privacy in
Wireless and Mobile Networks (WiSec 2018) to be held at the KTH Royal Institute
of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, from June 18 to June 20, 2018. WiSec is one
of the leading international conferences on the security and privacy of wireless
communications and mobile networks, attracting students, researchers and
industry specialists from all over the world. Participation in conferences such
as WiSec is an extremely important part of graduate students' research and
career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own
work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers and senior
researchers, and exposure to leading edge work in the fields of wireless
networks security and mobile privacy.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
