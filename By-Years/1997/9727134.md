9727134 Lasaga This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading
computer facilities for the geochemistry research group at Yale University. New
hardware purchases will include 2 DEC alpha workstations with 64 bit RISC
architectures, X-terminals to provide additional access to these new
workstations, PC's, a Macintosh compatible workstation, a laptop computer,
EXABYTE tape drives and a high performance video card for graphics-intensive
applications. The geochemistry group at Yale is at the forefront of geochemical
model development. Research on dissolution kinetics of aluminosilicates and the
effects of water on the kinetics of silicate melt crystallization utilize ab
initio quantum mechanical models and Monte Carlo methods to model reactions and
are highly computationally intensive. Future research will be aimed at modeling
mass transport in hydrothermal systems. Code will be developed to model,
isotopic exchange between moving fluids and mineral grains, growth and
dissolution of framework silicates and metasomatic reactions. Existing
computational facilities are now out-of-date given the rapidity of obsolescence
in the computer industry and the capabilities of new workstations will be
immediately beneficial to this group and their students. ***
