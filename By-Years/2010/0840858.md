The NSDL Center for Sustaining Broader Impacts combines intra-community support
structures for NSDL grantees with well-defined mechanisms for effective outreach
and dissemination in a Web 2.0 world to organizations and coalitions that
provide K-12 teachers and/or higher education faculty with educational materials
or professional development. Four primary goals guide the work of the center:

1) Mobilization: to facilitate the flow of information and communications across
NSDL projects to build community capacity, set priorities, and identify emerging
issues so that the community can exploit its opportunities and address its
challenges collectively. 2) Synthesis: to mine the collective knowledge and
experience of the community and synthesize the work of NSDL projects to inform
community best practices. 3) Dissemination: to place resources and research into
the hands of educators through targeted outreach activities, by bundling
specific products and services to meet users' needs, and by distributing NSDL
products and services through trusted dissemination channels. 4) Analysis and
Evaluation: to create and foster a culture of data gathering and interpretation
to support the analysis of needs and trends so that NSDL can create more
effective products and services that meet the demands of STEM learners.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in its core strategies of: i)
brokering partnerships and opportunities on behalf of the community; ii)
monitoring trends and practices; iii) promoting and advocating for NSDL; iv)
customizing and contextualizing NSDL resources; v) putting NSDL in the path of
users; and vi) systematic data gathering to inform short-term decision-making
and long-term sustainability planning. Taken together these can serve as a model
for Web 2.0 educational organizations. The project is exerting broader impacts
through its dedication to the integration of research with education, the
provision of services and support for teacher training, professional
development, and STEM workforce growth. By advocating for STEM education through
partnership and capacity-building activities, across multiple disciplines and
audiences, the center is extending NSDL's reach and effectiveness and creating
new channels for reaching audiences and for understanding impact. This effort is
essential to the realization of the NSDL community vision of transforming many
distinct and important initiatives into an increasingly coherent whole, all in
the service of STEM education.
