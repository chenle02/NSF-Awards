The award is to develop a general framework for knowledge- based computer tools
that aid simultaneous engineering in mechanical design. Design Compatibility
Analysis (DCA) will serve as the underlying concept for these knowledge-based
systems. DCA focuses on the compatibility between the design requirements
(specification) and the proposed design, evaluates the design based on the
compatibility knowledge of experts, gives justification for the evaluation and
suggests improvements. DCA accommodates a product's various life-cycle issues
(e.g., functionality, manufacturability, reliability) with a unified focus,
i.e., compatibility, and thus helps designers to incorporate these issues at the
early stages of design representation. The second focus is the linkage between
DCA and analytical computer programs such as performance simulators. The
resulting framework will not only serve as the basis for various design expert
systems, but will also enhance our understanding of the life-cycle design
issues.
