9616468 Stebbins This grant provides $31,100 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences' nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, originally purchased in 1987, with a
super high speed, high pulse, power magic-angle spinning (MAS) probe with a low
27-Al background signal, an MAS spin rate controller and an MAS rotor
synchronization system. These upgrades will allow researchers at Stanford to
continue their cutting edge research on the structure and dynamics of silicate
glasses and inorganic solids using in situ, high temperature NMR spectroscopy.
The PI is recognized as one of the leading international researchers in the
field of molecular inorganic geochemistry using NMR spectroscopy as a primary
tool to elucidate the atomic level structure of minerals and glasses. Recent
developments in NMR spectroscopy, namely, multiple-quantum magic-angle- spinning
(MQMAS) and satellite transition (SATRAS) MAS NMR will now be possible at
Stanford with these upgrades and will allow unprecedented characterization of
quadrupolar nuclei in a much wider range of inorganic solids. ***
