Modular forms are spectacular functions that are highly symmetric. They occur in
abundance throughout mathematics and physics. For more than one century, the
theory of modular forms has being playing a central role in number theory, as
witnessed in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The symmetries of modular forms
are captured by the elements of the special linear group of degree 2 over the
ring of integers. Among all modular forms, majority of them are noncongruence in
the sense that their symmetries cannot be described by congruences. The study of
noncongruence modular forms has been fallen behind its congruence counterpart
due to the lack of a satisfactory Hecke theory. However, recent progresses on
noncongruence modular forms have revealed their rich connections with several
fruitful research frontiers: p-adic modular forms, automorphic forms, and Galois
representations. The theory of noncongruence modular forms has far reaching
impacts on other areas like the conformal field theory and combinatorics. The
project aims at a further theoretic development of noncongruence modular forms
with applications to problems like supercongruences, which are special
congruences satisfied by many interesting combinatorial or arithmetic sequences.
The scientific objectives are: study when Galois representations attached to
noncongruence modular forms are related to automorphic forms via Langlands
correspondence; understand a fundamental conjecture that characterizes genuine
noncongruence modular forms; explore supercongruences using the perspective of
Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences that were originated in the study of
noncongruence modular forms. Currently, the proofs of supercongruences often
require the finding of auxiliary identities, which procedure often involves
intriguing guesses. A more conceptual understanding of supercongruences may shed
lights on how to search for these identities
systematically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research outcomes will be published by
high quality journals and disseminated at various conferences and seminars. The
PI will continue to widen the impacts of the her research program by mentoring
undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs, as well as organizing
scientific conferences. In recent years, the PI has been seriously involved in
activities to promote the advancement of women in mathematics. She was a group
co-leader for Banff International Research Station workshops on Women in Numbers
(WIN) in 2008 and WIN2 in 2011 and is one of the organizers for a coming WIN 3
conference in 2014.
