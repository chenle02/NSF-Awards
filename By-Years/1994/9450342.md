9450342 The proposed research would apply statistical mechanics methods to
analyze various properties of diffusive motion in disordered systems. Properties
such as reaction rates, displacement moments, mobilities and distances between
mobile reactants and fixed traps will be evaluated. The overall goal is to
create a strong condensed matter theory group, which would provide solid
research experience and motivation to students,furnish support to
experimentalists in material sciences, and strengthen the cooperation with other
institutions.
