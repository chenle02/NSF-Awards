EIA-032355&lt;br/&gt;Yaoyun Shi&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan Ann
Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Directions in Quantum Computation and
Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, it has been demonstrated
that quantum information behaves fundamentally different from classical
information, and, it appears that computers based on exact quantum mechanical
principles can be dramatically more powerful than those currently deployed. This
project investigates several fundamental issues in a wide range of aspects of
quantum information science. The topics include searching for fast quantum
algorithms, systematic classical simulations of quantum circuits, quantum
intractability, restricted quantum computations, and quantum communication
protocols, among others. The techniques employed are drawn from many branches of
mathematics such as probability theory, combinatorics, matrix analysis, and
group theory, as well as from the rich subject of classical complexity
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the most exciting scientific developments
in recent years, quantum information science promises far-reaching impacts on
the efficiency and the security of information processing. This project could
significantly advance our understanding on the inherent power and limitations of
quantum computation and quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
