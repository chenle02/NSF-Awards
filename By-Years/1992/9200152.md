This project will bring twelve undergraduate students to work at the Cornell
Theory Center for a ten week period in the summer of 1992. Recruiting will be
national in scope, and there will be special efforts to bring in women,
minorities, and students from institutions without rich computing resources.
Participants will work under the joint guidance of a faculty member from Cornell
University, and a member of the scientific and technical staff of the Theory
Center. Problems in the area of computational science research will be
investigated.
