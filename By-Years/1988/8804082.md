This award contributes funds to the Hope College Biology Department to continue
their Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. The program provides support
for the meaningful involvement of ten undergraduate students in full time
biology research during the summer of 1988. Hope College is committed to
continuing its program of educating tomorrow's scientists through a combination
of course work and serious undergraduate work in the research laboratory.
Involving undergraduates in professional level research is important in the
training of scientists. Five students from Hope College and five students from
other schools will be selected on the basis of academic record, research ability
or potential, professional objectives, independence and self-reliance, and
initiative. Students will be able to choose form 18 different research projects
supervised by 10 Ph.D. faculty members. Students will be matched to research
areas by discussions between students and research supervisors. Research
opportunities will range from the regulation of histidine utilization genes to
the physiology of thirst to effects of seed dispersal patterns on survival of
tropical forest plants. Students will be required to prepare a paper and present
a seminar based on their research and encouraged to publish their findings.
