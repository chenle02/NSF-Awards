Tuskegee University, in this Noyce Capacity Building project, focuses on
preparing the institution to establish a future Noyce Teaching Fellowship (TF)
project to recruit Tuskegee graduates, career changers and retired STEM
professionals into STEM teaching. The goals of the Capacity Building phase are
to: 1) Seek partnerships with high needs school districts as placement sites for
future teaching fellows; 2) Conduct a needs assessment to determine areas of
shortages in teacher quality, quantity,and diversity in the partnering
districts; 3) Estimate the number of Noyce Teaching Fellows that can be
adequately supported, trained, and placed in a high needs school district by a
prospective Noyce TF project; 4) Develop effective recruitment strategies for
Noyce Teaching Fellows; 5) Make programmatic revisions (e.g. the creation of an
Alternative Master's Program in General Science Education) so that the current
teacher preparation program fully complies with the Noyce program requirements
for TF projects; 6) Identify sources for matching of funds including
industry,foundations, and non-profits; 7) Develop evaluation protocols to
objectively assess the outcomes of this TF proposal; 8) Devise and implement a
sustainability plan to continue the efforts of the future Noyce TF project
beyond its grant cycle; 9) Write and submit a comprehensive TF proposal to the
Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. The ultimate goal is to enhance the
quality of STEM teaching in this high-need region.
