The University of Michigan's Center for Great Lakes &amp; Aquatic Sciences will
acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of
shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association
with the R/V LAURENTIAN, a research vessel owned and operated by the University.
A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Side-scan sonar system
for mapping details of bottom morphology that are useful in studies of
sedimentation and the distribution of various objects and structures, and
-Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at various depths in
the water column, The instrumentation described above will increase the
capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering
projects.
