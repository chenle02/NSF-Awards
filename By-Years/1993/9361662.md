Proposal Number: 9361662 PI Last Name: Lagnese Computer architecture courses may
use a lab-based approach to emphasize the design process. However, such an
approach is severely limited by the time available for the course. DASYS
proposes to provide a tool that will abstract away tedious details of the design
process and allow the students to spend more time on the more creative aspects
of design. DASYS' architectural partitioning/high level synthesis tool allows
the user to begin the design process with an abstract behavioral description of
the architecture to be designed, and produces an RTL description of the design
which can be passed on to lower level tools for realization. During its design
process, DASYS' tools allow for designer control through constraint
specification and direct interaction. DASYS proposes to determine how this tool
could best be used in an electrical/computer engineering curriculum by exploring
how the tool can aid in one or more courses that are currently part of the
computer engineering curriculum at Carnegie Mellon University. Such a tool
currently is not available, either commercially or pedagogically. ***y
