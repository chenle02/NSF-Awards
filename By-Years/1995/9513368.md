This award supports Professors Lane and Edith Hemaspaandra, of the University of
Rochester and Le Moyne College, respectively, to collaborate in computer science
with Professor Gerd Wechsung of the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,
Germany. Together they will study several topics of current interest in
computational complexity theory These include (1) rigorous studies of the effect
of query order on complexity (i.e., whether and when the order of access to
multiple information sources matters) and (2) certificate complexity
(calculating the conditions that control the size of classes of sets which
always have acceptance certificates that can be easily computed.) The U.S. and
German participants in this collaboration bring to bear complementary strengths
in the creative theoretical aspects and the rigorous mathematical aspects of
computational complexity. The joint effort of these talented and prolific
researchers should produce significant contributions to the study of structural
aspects of complexity theory. Results will have implications in many aspects of
computer and information science.
