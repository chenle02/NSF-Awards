As large-scale, distributed systems are used in safety-critical applications,
the fault tolerance of these systems becomes a crucial issue. This research
focuses on the fundamental problems of diagnosis and fault-tolerant routing.
This work will, for the first time, consider the coordination of these important
tasks, by making use of diagnostic information to increase routing efficiency
and system throughput. The work will target systems possessing a relatively
sparse interconnection structure such as grids, meshes, and hypercubes which
constitute a large fraction of existing systems and are expected to dominate
future applications. The proposed research will involve the integrated design of
algorithms for diagnosis and routing, along with evaluations of algorithm
performance that are both theoretical and experimental in nature. The
theoretical work will utilize probabilistic analysis techniques in order to
evaluate performance under recently proposed probabilistic models as well as to
examine performance limits for these systems. The experimental work will involve
the implementation and testing of the proposed algorithms on 32-node Intel
IPSC/2 hypercube. A product of this research should be efficient algorithms for
these fundamental problems in distributed fault tolerance that can be used in a
wide range of multiprocessor/multicomputer systems.
