This program will investigate continuous wave UV/VUV lasers operating in the
150-300 nm region, where presently no such lasers exist. A new discharge will be
used, the low pressure cyclindrical magnetron, to pump rare gas metal vapor
lasers: Ag+, Cu+, Pb+, Mg+ and Ga+. The magnetron discharge is considered to be
especially well suited to rare gas-metal vapor lasers. Running on their own the
magnetron lasers are expected to provide milliwatts of single transverse mode
UV, while the use of auxillary low energy 0.1 KeV - 1 KeV electron beam pumping
should enable UV/VUV operation at the watt level. Cold cathode, grided cold
cathode, and plasma cathode electron guns will be used for low voltage 0.1 KeV -
1 KeV electron beam generation. Detailed plasma diagnostic studies will be made
of both the independent magentron discharge and the electron beam pumped
magnetron plasma. The energy spectrum of the longitudinal electron beam will be
measured along the length of the magnetron discharge using newly developed
Faraday probes with apertures and grids. Laser spectroscopy will measure sheath
electric fields and excited state densities versus operating conditions. Plasma
data will be compared to Boltzmann computer models developed especially for the
magnetron plasma. Rate equation laser models will be constructed and results
compared to experimental optimization of these same lasers excited in the
cyclindrical magnetron configuration.
