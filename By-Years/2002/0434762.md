This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Using kernel
methods to discover alternatively spliced exons and their regulatory domains."
Alternative splicing adds flexibility and complexity to eukaryotic proteomes,
however which splice sites are alternative and how they are regulated is poorly
understood. Using three sources of data including cDNA sequences, full genomic
sequences and splicing specific microarrays this research is identifying
regulatory elements important in alternative splicing using available genome
sequences. Key to this approach are the algorithms that integrate these
different sources of data such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

Training goals for this fellowship include specifically gaining experience with
SVMs and complementary algorithms for identifying alternatively spliced exons
and their regulatory domains. Other, more general, goals include learning
recruiting and mentoring skills necessary to achieve and manage a diverse lab
where an interdisciplinary approach can successfully be used to study biological
systems.
