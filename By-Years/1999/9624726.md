The goal of this research is to investigate the factors responsible for
curvature in the phalanges (the bones of the fingers and toes) in higher
primates. Primates that regularly grip branches during movement appear to have
more curved phalanges than those that walk on the ground. As such, finger bones
have historically been very useful for interpreting behavior in fossil species,
including early human ancestors. However, we do not understand 1) what aspects
of the mechanics of arboreal locomotion lead to phalangeal curvature and 2) how
curvature develops. This research will incorporate new analytical (i.e., finite
element analysis) and data acquisition (i.e., pressure sensor pads, strain
gauges on cadavers) techniques to test existing hypotheses regarding phalangeal
curvature by comparing how living arboreal and terrestrial primates use their
hands during locomotion. Finally, the debate over how to interpret primitive
morphology, important to all paleontologists interested in the reconstruction of
behavior from fossil morphology, will be addressed by examining whether or not
phalangeal curvature develops in response to loads experienced during growth or
whether curvature is merely `phylogenetic baggage`.
