The polymer industry is one of the most dynamic and expanding industries of our
time. It is one of the few industries in which the U.S. still holds a strong
leadership in an extremely competitive global market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
focused collaboration between industry and academia has been underway for nearly
five years through the activities of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering (CAPCE) at the
Ohio State University. CAPCE offers comprehensive and well-organized
collaboration between application-oriented researchers in industry and
fundamental-oriented researchers in universities, enhancing commercialization of
advanced polymer and composites materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will
continue to emphasize the needs of the more traditional manufacturing sector of
the polymer and composite industry, since these members dominate the industrial
support base. In addition, their efforts will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-
Cooperating with industry members to translate basic research results from NSF
supported research into commercial products and processes;&lt;br/&gt;-
Incorporating environmentally-friendly technologies in product manufacturing by
reducing energy consumption and toxic chemicals; reducing the amount of volatile
solvents and manufacturing waste; and increasing sustainability; and&lt;br/&gt;-
Enabling efficient, low-cost mass production of parts for bio-MEMS, sensors, and
other applications, using micro and nanno-fabrication techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
