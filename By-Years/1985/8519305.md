Studying the kinetics of important solvent extraction reactions and identifying
the rate limiting step has led to system modifications to achieve dramatically
improved results. This work served to verify that chemical reactions and not
mass transfer were the system bottlenecks for important systems already studied.
Future research will produce rate data for additional systems and lead to
general development to point to general methods to improve other systems in the
difficult platinum group. In addition to quantitative measurements with a series
of complex extraction agents, hollow fiber membrane filter assemblies will be
studied to achieve alternative methods for separation.
