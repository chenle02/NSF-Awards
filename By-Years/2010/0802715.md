This project will add important new features to the PI's model for entry of
magnetosheath ions and electrons into the magnetosphere in the cusp. The
improved model will have more realistic magnetic and electric field parameters.
It will also utilize recent magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the
magnetosheath to more accurately characterize the sheath. The third major
improvement will be to incorporate wave-particle interactions that result in
energization of the particles. The project will utilize data from the Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites and the Polar satellite (NASA
International Solar Terrestrial Program mission). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After
the model improvements have been implemented, the model will be used in
conjunction with the satellite data to investigate two important topics
concerning the cusp. The first topic is the understanding of the processes that
limit the spatial size of the cusp, both in latitude and longitude. The second
topic is to determine to what extent wave-particle interactions heat the
particles and alter their distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
relevant to the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Focus Group on cusp physics.
The results are expected to also have impacts in other areas of space physics
where particle energization by waves is thought to be important.
