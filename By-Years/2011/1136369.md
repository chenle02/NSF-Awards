The Education Studies Program and the Physical Sciences Division of the
University of California San Diego have established a Master Teacher Fellowship
(MTF) program as part of their California Teach (CalTeach) Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program. This effort is a partnership with local high-needs school
districts, mentor teachers, and local community
colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is realized through the
professional development offered to 42 local STEM teachers to serve as mentors
and education leaders in high-needa school districts. Throughout the academic
school year, Fellows participate in targeted online courses to further develop
specific content and pedagogical skills. During the summer, Fellows join UCSD
faculty for institutes in either mathematics or science instructional topics.
UCSD has also established a Master Teacher in Residence program that recruits an
MTF to join the university faculty each year, engaging them in teaching
university coursework and supervising Noyce
Scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expectation for Broader Impacts result from the
project's further understanding of four vital components of learning and
expertise development for teachers: the importance of mentorship, expertise
development through experience, social networks, and blended learning. Finally,
by enhancing the quality of mentorship that UCSD prospective teachers in the
STEM fields receive, the project helps support the recruitment of highly
qualified teachers in high need schools.
