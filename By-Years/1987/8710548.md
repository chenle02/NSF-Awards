The research is centered on a microstructural theory of creep deformation and
fracture. This theory should be able to capture such critical mechanisms of
creep as grain-boundary sliding, cavitation, and the formation of the
macroscopic crack. Methods to be employed present a balanced synthesis of latest
metallurgical observations and continuum damage mechanics.
