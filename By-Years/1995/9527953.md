9527953 Ling This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will investigate a new
view of process equipment maintenance and reliability as part of the life cycle
modeling of manufactured products. The path to accomplish this is to move
maintenance of equipment and processes from responsive corrective repairs, to
intelligent prevention using experience and scheduled service, finally to the
goal of a science based and sensor enhanced way of doing predictive maintenance.
The focus area is the electronics industry, where these investigators have
established the contacts needed to get empirical data to back up their theory
and methodology. The exploratory research objectives are: to judiciously
assemble operating and maintenance data, to identify promising methods for
modeling equipment degradation that use both stochastic and mechanistic methods,
and to include degradation modeling of process equipment in the life cycle
modeling of manufactured products. The models, backed up by data, will lead to a
methodology that can identify equipment components that are critical because
either they have precursors that give long range predictions of their
degradation or they deteriorate so quickly they need sensor based monitoring.
This grant will attempt to establish a science and engineering base for
maintenance, that will lead greater availability and productivity, lower costs
for energy and maintenance, and improved product quality and safety. ***
