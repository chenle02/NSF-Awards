This study will test the hypothesis that some seamounts form as a result of
preferential, off-axis melting within small, low melting temperature
heterogeneities embedded within the mantle upwelling beneath spreading centers
that migrate in the absolute reference frame. The hypothesis predicts that a
systematic variation will be exhibited along the chain which reflects the
temporally varying interaction between the seamount and ridge axis sources. The
data will be obtained on rock samples dredged during a fourteen day field
program on the Heckle seamount and adjacent abyssal hills. Laboratory analysis
of the samples for major, trace, rare earth element concentrations and Sr, Nd
and Pb isotope ratios. Ar-Ar age dating of selected samples will help constrain
the chronology of compositional variations in seamount lavas. %%% Geometry and
dimensions of the melt segregation zone beneath spreading centers is a
fundamental scientific problem. Direct observation is difficult, but inferences
can be made by examining interactions between small seamounts forming near
spreading centers and the adjacent ridge axis. The study of one such interaction
is being carried out in this project.
