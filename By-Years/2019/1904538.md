Commutative Algebra is a ubiquitous mathematical subject whose techniques and
results are utilized in Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, and Representation
Theory. Morgantown Algebra Days is a Commutative Algebra conference which is to
take place at West Virginia University on the weekend of April 13-14, 2019. The
main objective of the conference is to showcase new mathematical trends to a
large group of mathematicians specializing in the subject of Commutative
Algebra. Morgantown Algebra Days will feature eight research talks and poster
session allowing for younger mathematicians to present their
research.&lt;br/&gt;The website for the conference is

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
