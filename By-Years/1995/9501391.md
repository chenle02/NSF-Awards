Mo 9501391 The proposed research aims to develop a general theory of geometric
transformations using Lie groups and Cartan's method of moving frames. The
motivation comes from the modern study of Sine-Gordon equation and KdV equation
on the one hand, and the classical study of Lie on the transformation of
surfaces on the other. It has been observed by a number of differential
geometers that there is a somewhat mysterious connection between these two
apparently disparate fields of study. If successful, the proposed research may
result in a geometric theory laying a mathematical foundation for such things as
solitary wave (soliton) phenomena.
