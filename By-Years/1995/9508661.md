9508661 Isaacson The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
mathematical sciences. The University-Based Graduate Research Assistantships
provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend part of their time in the
classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting. These awards are a
means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the
nation. Three problems in nonlinear dynamics, acoustic seismology and medical
tomography will be studied by two graduate students under the supervision of
faculty and industrial scientists. The first problem is to use chaos theory to
detect the presence of a weak signal generated by a nonlinear mechanism in the
presence of noise. The second problem is to use acoustic detectors on the ocean
floor to improve the localization of earthquake sources. The third problem is to
improve the localization and prediction of epileptic seizures in children.
