9722919 Wang This award supports cooperative research in symbolic computation
algorithms and systems for polynomial computations between Paul Wang, Kent State
University, Institute for Computational Mathematics, and Liu Zhuojun,
Mathematics Mechanization Research Center, Institute of Systems Science, Chinese
Academy of Sciences. The cooperation brings together the knowledge, expertise,
and experience in parallel symbolic computing of the mathematical computation
group at Kent State and the sophisticated knowledge of Groebner bases and
characteristic sets of the Chinese Academy of Sciences group. Given the
strengths of the research teams in both the US and China, there is good
potential for significant advances from the research. Such advances could be
useful to applications ranging from operations research to airline scheduling.
