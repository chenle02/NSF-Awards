9315372 Leggett Low mass, very cool stars and cool white dwarf stars are
extremely common but are poorly understood. With the support of this Planning
Grant, spectral and photometric observations of such stars will be made. These
data will improve our understanding of the physics of the atmospheres of these
stars. ***
