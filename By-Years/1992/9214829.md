The project is intended to investigate the inhibiting effects of iron and other
metal cations on the growth of scale forming minerals; to determine the specific
mechanisms of crystal growth inhibition by metal cations and construct a
predictive model; and to examine how temperature influences the effectiveness as
well as the mechanism of calcite growth inhibition; and to examine whether metal
cations can outperform chemical inhibitors currently in use. How iron and other
metal cations affect growth of calcium sulphate, another scale forming mineral,
will also be investigated.
