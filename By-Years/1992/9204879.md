Several problems in atomic collision physics are addressed. These include state
to state interactions of excited Ca and N atoms with rare gas partners and
collisional ionization. The research encompasses the calculation of appropriate
interaction potentials using a combination of ab- initio and semi-empirical
approaches and quantum mechanical close coupling calculations. The calculations
are strongly coupled to experiments in the US and West Germany.
