The observation and study of Earth surface and atmospheric processes using
remote sensing is an area of scientific and technological innovation as well as
workforce growth. One of the primary ways to analyze and synthesize the complex
processes and impacts on the atmosphere and Earth's surface is to utilize a
multi-sensor framework with multiple partners and organizations. From event-
based studies of natural disasters to long-term ecological and hydrological
forecasting, this systems research topic spans time horizons and thematic areas
with a focus on remote sensing using ground-based radar platforms as well as
active and passive satellite sensors. This project will bring ten undergraduate
students together each year for a ten-week summer research experience on remote
sensing of atmospheric and land surface processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of the program will be to introduce a diverse student cohort to the
wide range of research topics and applications surrounding remote sensing of the
Earth surface and atmosphere. Participants will be paired with scientists and
their research teams from collaborating organizations: UAH Earth System Science
Center, NASA MSFC Earth Science Branch, NOAA NWS Weather Forecast Office, and
private industry partners. Throughout the summer, students will join other
interns in professional and research development workshops at UAH and will take
part in tours, discussions, and lectures from local organizations, private
industry, and federal agencies related to Earth, atmospheric, and geospatial
sciences. Students will be selected from a national pool of applicants, but
targeted recruitment efforts will take place at regional and under-served
institutions in the Southeast and Ohio River Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
