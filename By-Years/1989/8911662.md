This project concentrates on computational problems of a number theoretic nature
in order to develop new efficient algorithms or when this is not possible to
provide evidence of intractability. A major component of this research will be
the further development of new methods arising from algebraic geometry, class
field theory, and the geometry of numbers. Whenever possible, results of this
research will be applied to the areas of computer security and parallel
processing. In particular, an efficient checker' algorithm (see selection 3.2)
for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption and decryption will be sought. Also work
will continue on the development of parallel algorithms for integer GCD and
modular exponentiation. Finally, work will continue on the theory of computer
viruses. It is hoped that these efforts will play a role in combatting this
growing security threat.
