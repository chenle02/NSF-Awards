The University of Mary Washington (UMW) is conducting The Jepson Scholars
Program, providing four- year scholarships and integrated support to 20
academically talented students majoring in biology, chemistry, physics, and
earth/environmental science. The Jepson Scholars Program will recruit and serve
a diverse low-income student population to develop skills needed for success in
STEM graduate programs and careers. The program will therefore help meet the
high demand for STEM workers throughout the region including Virginia and
Washington, D.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This S-STEM project continues best
practices of previous projects at UMW while implementing and assessing new
activities including: (1) an early, 5-week summer research experience prior to
freshman year with strong faculty mentoring; (2) an integrated first-year
experience including a STEM-based first-year seminar, advising, and peer-
assisted study sessions for gateway science classes; (3) continuing intensive
research experiences with faculty mentorship; and (4) robust career preparation
through an intensive series of workshops and cohort activities to educate
students about STEM career and graduate school opportunities. The impact of
these activities on enrollment and retention, graduation, and post-graduate
placement rates are being investigated. Formative and summative project
evaluation and assessment will employ mixed methods including collection of
student data, surveys, interviews, and focus groups. The intellectual merit of
this project is enhanced by the results of this study, which will be used to
support sustained programming at UMW and inform similar institutions of
effective practices to support low-income students and improve the numbers,
quality, and diversity of STEM graduates.
