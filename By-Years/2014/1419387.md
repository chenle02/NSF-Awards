This award provides partial funding for the Board on Earth Sciences and
Resources (BESR), the locus for earth science activities at the National
Research Council (NRC). BESR guides a range of projects and initiatives that
provide independent, unbiased, scientific and engineering advice to the Nation
on a broad spectrum of earth science issues in response to needs expressed by
Congress, federal and state agencies, the science community, the private sector,
and others. The proposed activities at the broadest level will encompass
questions about the environment, natural hazards, energy, and natural resources
and include analysis of fundamental and applied research at various scales;
technology development and impacts; data provision and management (including
monitoring, and geospatial data and infrastructure); and education, training,
and workforce development. The proposed activities will be conducted by ad hoc
committees under the Board and its five standing committees and will result in
published consensus reports, short briefs, press releases, newsletters,
congressional and federal agency briefings, webinars, and other products
intended for public dissemination.
