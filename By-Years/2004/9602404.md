The need for innovative, technology education curricula for students at all
school levels is now well documented. While the calls for reform in the science
and mathematics communities have resulted in widespread changes in the way these
subjects are taught. similar calls in the field of technology education are just
beginning to take effect. The Science Education Department (SED) proposes to
develop, over a two-year period, a pilot unit on light communication for
students in grades seven through ten. The goal of Project ComTech is to improve
the quality of education for students taking either a required or elective
course in technology. Specific learning objectives include having students:
learn and master a limited number of powerful technology and science themes;
sense the excitement, challenge. and career potential of technology; and develop
critical thinking and reasoning skills. Our alliance--technology educators,
community and four-year colleges, public school administrators, private-sector
partners, and state and national technology education advocates--represents a
continuum of stake-holders in technology education. Our advisory panel and
development team will include representatives from all partners. We will draw
upon the experiences of our partners and the SED's success in curriculum
development to complete a discovery-based curriculum unit built on contemporary
learning theory. When completed, the unit will include activities that can be
used in classrooms for four to six weeks. A teacher resource guide will be
prepared for publication and kits of optical and electronic parts will be
readied for commercial distribution. We have three primary objectives for our
evaluation plan: to develop a profile of an `ideal` technology activity; to
assess changes in students' critical thinking and conceptual growth; and to
assess changes in classroom teaching strategies of field-test teachers.
