Title: Minority Access to Graduate Education and Careers in STEM

Savannah State University

HRD - 0310328

PI: Joseph H. Silver

Savannah State University (SSU) will implement a five-year comprehensive
approach to strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research infrastructure. The
University will use a combination of NSF and intramural resources to increase
STEM enrollment, attain a STEM undergraduate student retention rate of 80% and
transition 30% of STEM graduates to graduate study. The project will cut across
biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, engineering and technology.

Physical infrastructure improvements and expansions will accommodate new STEM
programs and improve the quality of instructional delivery in existing STEM
programs. Project objectives include the following: STEM graduation rate will
increase to 40% by 2008 30% of STEM graduates will pursue graduate study by 2008
80% of STEM graduate students will complete their graduate degrees STEM student
enrollment at SSU will increase by 20% annually STEM retention through
graduation will be no less than 80% 40% of computer science, electronics
engineering technology and electrical engineering students will be Yamacraw
certified by 2008 Equal number of GTREP students will graduate from SSU campus
as from the other two GTREP satellite campuses by 2008; and 80% of STEM
graduates will join the STEM workforce by 2008.
