Unbiased Determination of Genome Wide Mutations Rates in Single Bacterial
Replication Events

From Darwin's theory of natural selection to Mendelian inheritance and
variation, many theories have preceded experimental evidence explaining
evolution and population genetics. Specifically, the relationship between
mutation rate and its effect on a strain?s fitness in a population of competing
strains remains elusive, despite it being absolutely essential for understanding
the mechanism of evolution and speciation. Current methods that assay mutations
suffer from outputting information free of clonal interference, and insufficient
resolution to probe rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur in
the single-cell level. Thus, these approaches are not neutral, and select
against deleterious mutations. An innovative cell sorting and culture
microfluidic system will deliver unbiased genome wide microbial mutation rates
that include neutral, synonymous, and deleterious mutations. Using this
technology, the relationship between fitness and genome wide mutation rates can
be directly examined.

The Fellow will receive interdisciplinary training in the physics and
engineering of microfluidics (Dr. Paul Blainey), biology, and informatics (Dr.
Eric Alm). All data will be open to use for development of educational material
and for aiding phylogenic reconstruction. Additionally, an automated DNA
sequencing library preparation device design and operational knowledge will be
made public for reduced library preparation cost for the entire sequencing
community. The Fellow will also mentor undergraduate students to teach the power
of bringing engineering approaches to answer basic science questions in
evolutionary biology.
