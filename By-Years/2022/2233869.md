This grant is to provide travel support for 15 United States-based graduate
students to attend the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine
Learning. This conference represents the first stand-alone conference that will
expand on the theoretical and practical understandings of the vulnerabilities
inherent to machine learning (ML) systems, explore the robustness of ML
algorithms and systems, and aid in developing a unified scientific community
aimed at creating trustworthy ML systems. The organizers will reserve at least
25% of this travel award for underrepresented groups, particularly women,
minorities, and for first-time conference attendees. Participation in such
conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience,
providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be
exposed to leading edge work in the field. The support will enable the
participation of students who might otherwise be unable to attend the IEEE SaTML
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
