The investigator's project is dedicated to a study of random matrix theory. It
is a very active field, since many questions in other fields can be represented
mathematically as matrix problems. For example: the spectra of heavy atoms in
physics, statistical estimation of covariance matrices in statistics, capacity
of quantum channels in quantum communication, conducting properties of
semiconductors (Anderson models). This project aims to study the basic
properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the
nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for
understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered
systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project
in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar
(conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some
problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate
students who have an interest in probability theory. The investigator will also
run workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate
and undergraduate students working in fields related to random matrix theory as
well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.

The investigator will focus on the identification of the eigenvalue densities,
the local eigenvalue statistics and the eigenvector distributions of many
different classes of random matrix ensembles. The ensembles considered in this
project include anisotropic matrices, band matrices, i.i.d. random matrices, and
general non-Hermitian matrices. One main project will be focused on the
localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very
similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems
(i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from
regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type
ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-
body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure.
Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random
matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on
random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied.
The investigator will apply some new ideas on these type of matrices. In this
proposal, some projects are also designed for training graduate and
undergraduate students, which include proving the universality phenomenon for
more general random matrix ensembles.
