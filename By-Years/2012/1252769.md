The cerebral cortex contains maps that represent various features of the sensory
world. For example, the visual cortex contains a map of an animal's visual space
and the auditory cortex contains a map of the animal's frequency hearing range.
In addition to these basic brain maps, there are also maps of features that are
behaviorally important to the animal. Typically these brain maps arise through
complex integrations performed by neurons, but the mechanisms of these
computations are not understood. Through the experiments described here, the
investigator will provide fundamental insights into the construction and
modulation of such computational maps and will determine how neural connections
in the brain shape computational maps. The specific focus of this project is to
determine how maps that underlie an animal's ability to localize a sound are
formed in the auditory cortex. The investigator and his students will use
electrophysiological methods to record from neurons to determine 2-D spatial
sensitivity. The input/output connections of these neurons will be identified
using neuro-anatomical tracing. The neurotransmitters involved in shaping
responses will be determined using pharmacology. Finally, the behavioral role of
these computations will be examined with behavioral testing. This research will
provide insights on how cortical maps are shaped in normal brains and how brain
computations may be disrupted in mental disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this project will include training of undergraduate and
graduate students, including underrepresented minorities. The research training
will be integrated with undergraduate education at the University of California,
Riverside and community outreach will occur through collaborations with the
California Science Center (serving inner city schools in Los Angeles) and a
desert research station (educating federal and state park employees). In
addition, novel neural computations discovered here will guide construction of
new electronic devices with potentially wide applications.
