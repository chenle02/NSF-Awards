9631021 Crosby The Missouri Botanical Garden, with funding from a partnership
among a variety of governmental and non-governmental agencies, foundations, and
private donations, is building a new Research Facility. The building will
provide state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly, earthquake-proof, climate-
controlled space for its collections and research library, as well as offices
for researchers. The herbarium room in this new building will provide
compactorized storage for approximately one-half of the Garden's 4.3 million
specimens (the remainder will continue to occupy the current herbarium
building). This award represents 50% of the purchase price of the compactor
carriages and shelving for the herbarium room; the other 50% will be matched by
the Garden in partnership with NSF. The building will be completed in 1998, and
the compactors installed and filled shortly thereafter.
