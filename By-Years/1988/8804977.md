This study is directed towards elucidating the genetic, molecular, and
biochemical basis of clonal variation of gene expression and its relationship to
metabolism in enteric bacteria. Clonal variation of bacterial alkaline
phosphatase will be examined in >phoR> mutants, in which this novel form of gene
regulation is observed. The genetic basis will be examined by identifying
transposon.induced mutations that alter clonal variation. Representative
mutations will be molecularly cloned, mapped, and analyzed by direct DNA
sequencing of the flanking DNA's. The immediate goal will be to identify genes
that affect the variation to allow making models that could explain the
molecular and biochemical basis of the variation. Such models will form the
basis for continuing this study.
