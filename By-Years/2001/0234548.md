This is a study of plasma parameters generated in the gliding-arc discharge
propagating in both plane and coaxial geometries , especially near the
equilibrium-to-nonequilibrium transition point. The gliding air in the plane
parallel to the gas flow is the base case; a cylindrical gliding-arc
configuration adds tangential velocity independently controlled by external
magnetic fields. Arc propagation velocities, geometry, electric fields, and
power inputs are determined by optical imaging synchronized with voltage-current
measurements. Additional information on plasma conditions is obtained by
spectrally resolved imaging, microwave interferometry, and infrared
spectroscopy. A concomitant theoretical study focuses on kinetic mechanisms of
the equilibrium-to-nonequilibrium transition. Kinetics of excited and charged
particles are modeled under conditions when both thermal ionization and
nonequilibrium ionization mechanisms are important. Critical values of the
electric field and gas temperature in the transition plasmas are identified and
compared to experimental findings.

The gliding arc is a hybrid type of atmospheric-pressure air discharge that
provides relatively high levels of electron density, current, and power (typical
of thermal plasmas) along with relatively low temperature and high electric
field (typical of cold nonequilibrium plasmas). The gliding-arc discharge,
moving in a gas flow between divergent electrodes, contains periodic self-
triggered transitions of atmospheric-pressure thermal arc into a nonequilibrium
discharge. In this transition, the plasma cools rapidly while electron density
remains on the thermal-plasma level.
