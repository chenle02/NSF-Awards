The main aim of this collaborative project is an in-depth study of the
homological mirror symmetry conjecture. Auroux, Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Orlov and
Seidel will lead a concerted effort to formulate and understand homological
mirror symmetry in systematic manner, and extend it to varieties of general type
and to noncommutative varieties. This will require some foundational work in
homological algebra, noncommutative geometry, and symplectic geometry. Another
goal is to investigate applications of mirror symmetry to classical problems in
algebraic geometry (for example studying the rationality of certain algebraic
varieties) and symplectic topology (in particular, Lagrangian submanifolds).

From a wider perspective, the project aims to provide a mathematical
counterpart to some recent advances in theoretical physics. The contribution
that mathematics can make is to verify the soundness and consistency of physical
intuition, and to prepare the general ground on which further development can
occur. This is particularly important in those situations where developments in
physics suggest the presence of deep and complex structures, which are difficult
to detect by direct experiment. At the same time, this effort will make it
possible to answer some purely mathematical (geometric) questions, some of which
have been open for a long time. The collaborative effort will be carried out
through regular meetings and workshops, and by fostering interaction between
leading experts in the field and younger mathematicians (graduate students and
postdocs); dissemination of knowledge in this rapidly evolving area of
mathematics will be facilitated by regularly held winter and summer schools and
conferences.
