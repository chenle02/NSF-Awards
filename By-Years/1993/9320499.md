9320499 Price Under the direction of Dr. Douglas Price, Mr. Michael Kimball will
collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Working with a team of volunteers,
he will conduct systematic survey of the Lough Swilly region of County Donegal,
Ireland. Researchers will walk over large areas of exposed ground and note stone
tool scatters and other archaeological occurrences. On the basis of artifact
types, many of these can then be dated to time period. The data will be plotted
and analyzed by Geographic Information System. In this way it will be possible
to reconstruct settlement patterns in different time periods and relate these to
geographic features. The work will reveal the shifting interaction between
landscape and human society and relate changes to subsistence technique. Mr.
Kimball will focus on the period of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. The
former, which follows immediately on the end of the last glaciation marks the
end of a hunting and gathering way of life in Northern Europe. In the succeeding
Neolithic period, populations adopted a lifestyle based on domesticated plants
and animals. Archaeologists wish to understand how this change took place and
how it affected human use of the landscape. It is unclear whether population
replacement occurred or whether Mesolithic inhabitants gradually incorporated
agriculture and pastoralism into a hunting and gathering way of life. Mr.
Kimball's work will help to answer this question. This research is important for
several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It
will shed new light on human change and adaptability and how humans interact
with the natural environment. It will also assist in the training of a promising
young scientist.
