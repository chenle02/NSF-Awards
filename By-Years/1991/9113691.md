We are requesting for a differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC) equipped with
extended temperature range (220C), an external cooling unit, data collection and
analysis system and software and reusable cells. This is the only DSC with the
requisite sensitivity and temperature range offered. The acquisition of this
instrument will permit the P.I.'s to analyze the thermal denaturation
characteristics of enzymes from thermophilic and superthermophillic organisms,
to study the molecular mechanism of thermal denaturation of small proteins of
know structure, to analyze thermodynamic basis of action of a protease inhibitor
of physiological significance and to explore the significance of subunit and
domain interactions in producing activity in an enzyme. These studies will
extend our knowledge of the structural basis of thermal stability in proteins
and activity in enzymes.
