The polymer industry is one of the most dynamic and expanding industries of our
time. It is one of the few industries in which the U.S. still holds a strong
leadership in an extremely competitive global market.

A focused collaboration between industry and academia has been underway for
nearly five years through the activities of the NSF Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering
(CAPCE) at the Ohio State University. CAPCE offers comprehensive and well-
organized collaboration between application-oriented researchers in industry and
fundamental-oriented researchers in universities, enhancing commercialization of
advanced polymer and composites materials.

The Center will continue to emphasize the needs of the more traditional
manufacturing sector of the polymer and composite industry, since these members
dominate the industrial support base. In addition, their efforts will include:

- Cooperating with industry members to translate basic research results from NSF
supported research into commercial products and processes; - Incorporating
environmentally-friendly technologies in product manufacturing by reducing
energy consumption and toxic chemicals; reducing the amount of volatile solvents
and manufacturing waste; and increasing sustainability; and - Enabling
efficient, low-cost mass production of parts for bio-MEMS, sensors, and other
applications, using micro and nanno-fabrication techniques.
