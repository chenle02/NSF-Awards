In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Hyunsoo Han of the University of Texas at San Antonio is
developing new bifunctional reagents for the synthesis of complex organic
compounds. These bifunctional reagents work without relying on functional group
adjustments or on the use of protecting groups (two chief culprits of synthetic
inefficiency), while maintaining high selectivity. Consequently, the prospective
bifunctional reagents and accompanying synthetic strategies provide a versatile
tool box for efficient asymmetric synthesis of many chemically and biologically
important compounds, including natural products and pharmaceuticals. This occurs
within the context of an emerging program for the training of young scientists
in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

The development of methods for carrying out two fundamental organic reactions,
asymmetric aldehyde allylation/crotylation and allylic substitution/Michael
addition, without functional group manipulations and protection groups is a main
focus of this project. These targets include: (1) concise synthetic routes for
bifunctional reagents; (2) extension of bifunctional reagents in the aldehyde
allylation/crotylation reactions to a diverse array of aliphatic and aromatic
aldehydes; (3) demonstration of the power and versatility of the synthetic
strategies in the efficient asymmetric syntheses of
2-alkyl-1,3-diols/aminoalcohols as well as more complex and heretofore
inaccessible ring systems. In contrast to more traditional B-, Si-, and/or Sn-
based reagents, these bifunctional reagents operate through [3,3]-sigmatropic
rearrangement under either acidic or oxidative conditions, and are totally
"organic" (all C-based), making them environmentally benign and air-stable.
