DDIG: Cooperation and Conflict within Reproductive Coalitions of Wild Turkeys

Males wild turkeys form stable coalitions during the breeding season that
cooperatively court females. This cooperative behavior is puzzling because of
the intense competition among males for females. The project will determine
genetic relatedness among coalitions of male turkeys and provide a comprehensive
view of the benefits keeping subordinate males in groups. The theoretical
framework used will be reproductive skew theory, a rapidly evolving field that
seeks to explain how reproduction is partitioned within social groups. Low
status males may profit through direct reproduction, through indirect
reproduction by helping a related group member, or by inheriting the dominant
position at some time in the future. Reproductive skew models provide
quantitative predictions to determine what combination of these three benefits
are important for the formation and maintenance of male coalitions. These
predictions will be tested by combining behavioral and genetic data on a free-
ranging wild turkey population in central coastal California.
