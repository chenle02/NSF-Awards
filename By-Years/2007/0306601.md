The Chedd-Angier Production Company is requesting support for the long-standing,
highly acclaimed PBS series, "Scientific American Frontiers," now in its 13th
season. Alan Alda hosts the program. NSF funds will leverage existing PBS
support and expand the series from five to six programs and increase the scope
and depth of the science covered in each program. Topics in the new season cover
a broad range of disciplines including cutting edge scientific efforts in
cosmology, anthropology, global warming, brain research, obesity and weight
loss, and hydrogen fuel cell research. The funds will also be used to expand the
"Frontiers" web site and raise the visibility of the program by enhancing the
promotional campaign. These efforts will aim to improve the value of the series
to science teachers as well as to the general audience. Formative evaluation
will be undertaken by Multimedia Research; summative evaluation, by Knight-
Williams Research Communications.
