This research program investigates inelastic deformation processes in metals.
Research in the program examines microstructural changes occurring in a solid
during deformation under a range of operating environments (primarily elevated
temperatures) and stress/strain rate conditions. Model alloy systems being
studied include aluminum, copper, type 304 stainless steel, and a series of
nickel-cobalt alloys. The selected systems allow important deformation
parameters such as stacking fault energy to be investigated. Primary objectives
of this research are (1) to develop a quantitative description of the kinetics
of deformation and the evolution of microstructure and (2) to formulate
constitutive models of deformation for engineering applications.
