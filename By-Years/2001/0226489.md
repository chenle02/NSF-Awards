The "NSF Highlights" column is published monthly in The Journal of Chemical
Education and serves to disseminate information about projects funded by the
Division of Undergraduate Education of the National Science Foundation, improve
the understanding of programs at the National Science Foundation, and encourage
submission of proposals to programs at the National Science Foundation. This
project involves the editing of the "NSF Highlights" column, and travel by the
co-editor to the American Chemical Society national meetings to allow him to
interact with the chemistry community and to note changes in the state of
undergraduate education in chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
