This project involves a theoretical and numerical investigation of
differential, integral and functional equations that arise in models of cell and
other biological applications. A model of normal and malignant cell populations
with periodic loss functions corresponding to periodic chemotherapeutic
treatment will be analyzed with thew goal of optimizing the period of treatment.
A general nonlinear functional equation model of structured population dynamics
will be analyzed with the objective of establishing the stability of equilibrium
states. A model of multispecies populations dispersing in spatial habitats will
also be considered, comparing various dispersal strategies.
