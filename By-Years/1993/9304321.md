9304321 Crawford The Coast Mts. Orogen of the North American Cordillera,
comprises several important tectonic features, including one of the largest
batholiths in the world, a major suture zone, regionally extensive upper
amphibolite granulite facies rocks and a major thrust belt. This research will
determine the detailed geochronology of the major structures and integrate the
findings with interpreted plate motions. The results will provide tight
constraints on timing and style of plate-margin processes, especially at the
cessation of subduction and onset of orogen-parallel transform motion.
