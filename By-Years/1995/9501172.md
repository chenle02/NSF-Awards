9501172 Kaeli, David This research is investigating the inherent performance
problems associated with object-oriented code execution. Traces are being
captured from a number of object-oriented programming environments. A workload
characterization is being performed to identify the underlying problems
presented by this new programming model. Architectural changes are then proposed
to improve the execution performance of object-oriented code. This research is
investigating architectural changes to the hardware that will improve
performance across all programming environments. As more and more software is
developed using object- oriented languages, this research will have a direct
impact on acceleration the performance of future applications. The educational
part of this project is concerned with making improvements in the Computer
Engineering curriculum, student advising tools, classroom computer aids, and
undergraduate research courses.
