The Colorado College will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Mathematics which will offer enrichment activities for 22 precollege
students entering grade 12. Participants will study and solve for themselves
three of the classical "great problems" of mathematics using original sources --
Area and the Definite Integral, Solution of Algebraic Equations, and Fermat's
Last Theorem. Daily colloquia will include discussions of the history,
philosophy and ethics of mathematics as well as presentations by mathematicians
and computer scientists from local research facilities.
