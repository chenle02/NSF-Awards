The emphasis of this exploratory project is to conduct an experimental study of
the partitioning of boron between muscovite and aqueous fluids. The experiments
will involve the use of double-capsule techniques, with the run products being
analyzed by isotope dilution. Run conditions for the study are 600, 800, and
1000oC at 2 GPa and at 800oC at 1,2 and 3 GPa. The techniques developed in this
research and the partitioning results will ultimately find application in
research related to the use of boron and its isotopes as geochemical tracers in
subduction zone processes.
