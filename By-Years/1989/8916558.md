The long term objective of the proposed research is to identify the sperm
receptor(s) on the surface of the mouse oocyte, characterize it biochemically
and study its functional role in fertilization. although the sperm receptor(s)
in the zona pellucida continue to be the focus of important research on
mammalian fertilization, evidence argues that there must be an oocyte surface
protein that mediates fertilization proper between egg and sperm. Research
proposed in this application will identify the sperm receptor and raise antisera
against it. Dr. Calarco's preliminary work identifies a limited number of
candidate proteins and also shows that the known cell adhesion protein,
uvomorulin, is not preset on unfertilized eggs. The specific aims are: 1) To
determine which surface proteins(s) on the zona free unfertilized egg are
required for the egg to bind sperm and undergo fertilization. Initially, Dr.
Calarco will compare, by gel electrophoresis, labeled oocyte surface proteins
before and after protease treatment (which renders eggs infertile), and before
and after fertilization; and 2) To demonstrate which of the putative sperm
receptors from unfertilized eggs function in an in vitro assay as a sperm
receptor. This will involve blocking fertilization of zona free eggs with
polyclonal antisera made against proteins identified on 1-D gels. After
initially using polyclonal antisera to isolate receptor(s), she will prepare
monospecific antisera for all subsequent studies. %%% Information gained from
the proposed research is relevant to problems of infertility, normal and
abnormal development as well as contraception.
