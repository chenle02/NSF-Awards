Higher education offerings in entrepreneurship education (EE) at the
undergraduate and graduate levels have outpaced efforts to inventory them, let
alone outpaced agreement on objectives and development of evidence-based
curriculum content and teaching and student evaluation methods. The project will
convene faculty and administrators, innovation and education scholars, and
entrepreneurs and investors to review the variety of contemporary approaches,
develop a greater consensus concerning the functions of entrepreneurship
education, identify opportunities for evaluation, and recommend methods for
research, including cross-institution research. Although the project does not
itself entail empirical research and data collection, a clearer articulation of
objectives will enable the statement of testable hypotheses regarding the
elements of curriculum, teaching methods, and performance evaluation that do and
do not contribute to various student outcomes. The project also has the
potential to inform student expectations and choices among institutions,
programs, concentrations, and courses as well as institutional decisions about
academic offerings, staffing, and provision of ancillary services such as
prototype development, enterprise incubation, and start-up financing. Evidence-
based individual and institutional decisions should contribute to policies to
promote more vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-
stage project will begin with the formation of a Task Force on Entrepreneurship
Education and Research comprised of innovation and higher education scholars who
will review current offerings, examine any evidence of the effectiveness of
curriculum elements and teaching methods, and recommend research approaches. The
Task Force will develop a set of conclusions and proposals for consideration by
a conference whose participants include administrators, entrepreneurs,
investors, selected students, and a few principals from non-US
institutions&lt;br/&gt;
