In this project, a number of outstanding issues related to the OH/HO2 chemistry
in the upper stratosphere and lower mesophere will be investigated. Current
understanding of the HOx chemistry in this region of the atmosphere is
complicated because standard photochemical models or any modifications of them
are unable to consistently account for the odd hydrogen abundance above and
below the stratopause. This is due, in part, to uncertainties in the rate
coefficients of the reactions that determine the OH/HO2 ratio in the
stratosphere and mesosphere, and or due to the lack of full understanding of the
HOx chemistry. The key reactions that partition the OH/HO2 abundance in the
stratosphere and mesosphere whose rate coefficients have come under increased
scrutiny in recent years will be investigated. Rate coefficients for the
reaction between vibrationally excited H2 and O(3P) atoms which has recently
been proposed as a novel source of OH in the mesosphere will be evaluated using
explicit quantum mechanical calculations. Nonthermal energy distribution
functions of O(3P) atoms in the mesosphere and their contributions to OH
formation in O(3P)+H2 collisions will be determined. Further, quenching of
vibrationally excited OH produced by the reaction between hydrogen atoms and
ozone will be investigated.
