The goal of this project is to broaden our understanding of high-energy
astrophysical phenomena, such as particle acceleration and radiation emission,
in application to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which are among the most energetic
events known in the universe. The physical processes involved are closely
related and Dr. Medvedev will investigate their connections using first
principles of theoretical analysis, dedicated numerical simulation, and
comparison with observational data.

Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate and undergraduate
students, and outreach via development of an internet resource which will
explain to non-experts the ideas and the current status of the physics of
collisionless shocks and relevant processes such as radiation emission and
particle acceleration in application to gamma-ray bursts.
