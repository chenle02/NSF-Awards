This grant will support the publication by AGU of the U.S. National Report to
the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. This collection of critical
reviews in all areas of geophysical research is an important tool for
specialists, for non-specialists seeking an overview, and for students. The four
divisions of GEO will share the cost. Funding at the revised level is
recommended.
