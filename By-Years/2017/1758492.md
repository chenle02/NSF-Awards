Cultivating STEM Teaching Identity in Noyce Teacher Scholars is a Noyce Track 1
project at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM). The project will
encourage highly qualified mathematics and science students to pursue secondary
teaching careers at high-need schools. The project team includes the CSUSM
School of Education and College of Science and Mathematics, Palomar and
MiraCosta Community Colleges, and Vista Unified, Escondido Union High School,
and San Marcos Unified school districts. The project aims to recruit 40 CSUSM
mathematics and science undergraduates to the CSUSM teaching credential program,
which includes acquisition of an Authorization to Teach English Learners. In
addition to scholarships, the project will offer early STEM teaching experiences
to Noyce Scholars, as well as provide them with early career
mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Noyce Track project includes a focus on
developing a teaching community using Wenger's Community of Practice Framework
and will implement evidence-based approaches such as internships and induction
activities and will leverage existing activities and partnerships. The program
will also build on model programs implemented at CSUSM by the PIs. The embedded
training on teaching English Language Learners has important value, as area
schools have a high enrollment of ELL students. Additionally, the project will
include efforts to recruit scholars from partnering community colleges, with an
emphasis on recruitment of underrepresented minorities. The models implemented
for faculty teamwork, collaboration with community colleges, and partnerships
with school districts have the potential to provide insights for teacher
preparation efforts at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
