Dr. Buss' work deals with studies of competition among the colonial marine
invertebrates such as anemones and corals. Under previous NSF-funded research,
he has investigated the genetics, developmental biology, and
population/community ecology of sessile organism competition, contributing,
respectively, to our understanding of the mechanisms of competition, the sources
of variation in competitive ability, and the consequences of this variation on
the organization of natural communities. Over the past five years, he has
concentrated on competition in the hydractiniid hydroids. Our understanding of
this system has now progressed to the point where we are prepared to: 1) Utilize
techniques of single copy DNA-DNA hybridization to determine whether niche
differentiation in hydractiniid hydroids arose via evolutionary divergence in
resource utilization. 2) Utilize monoclonal antibody technology to isolate
molecules used by these hydroids to recognize and overcome competitors. This
work may lead to the first isolation of molecules, and ultimately genes,
controlling competition in any animal. Award for this Accomplishment-Based
Renewal program is strongly recommended.
