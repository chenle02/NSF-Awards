This project continues the work initiated earlier on analysis and modeling of
storms observed on the STEPS program (Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and
Precipitation Study) conducted in Kansas in the early summer of 2000. It
includes the analysis of cloud electrical and microphysical data collected by
the storm-penetrating T-28 aircraft and modeling the production of charge and
precipitation with a three-dimensional numerical cloud model. The research is
carried out in collaboration with other STEPS investigators, who will provide
data including polarimetric radar measurements to identify precipitation type,
dual-Doppler radar measurements to define the kinematic structure of
thunderstorms, balloon-borne electrical field measurements, and three-
dimensional maps of lightning strokes measured by a VHF lightning mapper.
Attention will focus on the storms of 11 June and 29 June 2000. A major
objective is to explain why some storms produce predominantly positive cloud-to-
ground lightning discharges while others produce negative discharges. A
synthesis of the electrical, microphysical, and storm-structure data will lead
to a better understanding of the mechanism of lightning formation in
thunderstorms and the relations between electrical properties of storms and the
precipitation they produce.
