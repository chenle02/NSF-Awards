9617623 Webb This grant provides funds to complete development and improve
performance of a broad band seafloor hydrophone system for measurements in a
band from 1 mHz to 64 Hz. The sensor is designed for observations of Rayleigh
waves and short and long period body waves. Presently, the noise level of the
sensor does not reach ambient noise levels at frequencies between 0.03 and 0.1
Hz. Proposed work should provide improvements in noise level of up to 40 dB with
new components that have become available. This improvement in noise level will
allow the detection of long period body waves from smaller earthquakes, and
improve the signal to noise for seafloor observations of Rayleigh waves. The
enhanced capability will make the new sensor an important tool for future
deployments of portable seafloor arrays or of a permanent ocean seismic
observatory.
