This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination Theory and
Collaboration Technology. This is one of eleven winners under that competition.
The goal of this project is to develop a conceptual framework and a prototype
system for collaboration in an asynchronous mode among members of design teams.
The proposed design environments include knowledge-based and graphic
construction components with issue-based hypermedia systems designed to support
collaboration. The application domain for the prototype system is the design of
communications networks within buildings. The complexity of such projects forces
large and heterogeneous groups to work together over long periods of time. The
large and growing discrepancy between in amount of potentially relevant
knowledge for the design task and the amount any one designer can know and
remember puts limits on progress in design. Overcoming this limit is a central
challenge for developers of systems that support both individual and
collaborative design efforts. The work in this project builds on previous
developments embodied in the FRAMER system for the design of human-computer
interfaces and the JANUS system for architectural design.
