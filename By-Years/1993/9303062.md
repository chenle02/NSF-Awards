The diffusion of molecular species on solid surfaces is an important step in
most heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. The detailed investigation of surface
diffusion is the subject of this research project supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program. A pulsed molecular beam-surface infrared
spectrometer system has been constructed to investigate the transport of CO, NO,
and substituted isonitriles on stepped palladium and nickel surfaces. Step and
terrace populations will be characterized, low and high coverage diffusion
measurements made, and transient mobility studies carried out during the course
of this project. This work will provide a very comprehensive picture of
molecular transport on well characterized surfaces. %%% The transport of
molecules across surfaces is an important step in reactions which are mediated
by these surfaces. In order to develop a detailed understanding of surface
reactions such as corrosion and catalysis, information about the mechanism and
rate of surface diffusion must be obtained. This research project combines
molecular beam dosing methods with surface infrared spectroscopy to directly
measure the diffusion of small molecules on catalytically important surfaces.
