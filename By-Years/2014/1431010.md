This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable
unprecedented freedom for architectural photovoltaic adoption by maintaining the
aesthetics of existing building materials and the quality of natural indoor
lighting. This unique approach offers to achieve levelized photovoltaic energy
costs of 0.05-0.1 $/kWhr by (1) producing 10-40% of DC building electricity at
the point of utilization, eliminating the need for DC-AC-DC power electronics,
(2) simultaneously reducing building cooling demands 10-30% through rejection of
infrared solar heat, increasing the effective PV efficiency by over 5%
(absolute), and (3) piggybacking on the materials, installation, framing,
customer acquisition, and maintenance of the existing building envelope,
reducing non-module costs by over 50%. This project will also result in a core
knowledge from which future generations of transparent photovoltaic devices and
materials will be designed. Visibly transparent photovoltaics are also amenable
to seamless energy harvesting within non-window surfaces such as electronic
displays and mobile electronic accessories, enhancing the functionality of those
products without impacting aesthetics or functionality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
develops a transformational visibly transparent photovoltaic device. Building-
integrated photovoltaics are a promising energy pathway to capturing large areas
of solar energy and increasing US building efficiency at the point of
utilization. However, the widespread adoption of such technologies is severely
hampered by the cost and aesthetics associated with mounting traditional
photovoltaic cells on siding and windows. In this project, these challenges are
overcome by exploiting the excitonic character of molecular and organic
semiconductors that lead to oscillator bunching to produce photovoltaic
architectures with selective absorption, i.e. exhibiting visible minima and
ultra-violet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) maxima, uniquely distinct from the
band-absorption of traditional inorganic semiconductors. By using excitonic
molecular semiconductors with structured absorption in the UV/NIR these devices
are simultaneously optimized for high power conversion efficiency, visible light
transmission, and color rendering index.
