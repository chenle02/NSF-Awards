This research program is centered on experiments addressing fundamental issues
of nuclear physics. An experiment is being designed to search for a non-zero
electric dipole moment of the neutron, whose possible existence is of
fundamental interest and would significantly challenge the theoretical
extensions of the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. Another
experiment under analysis measured second order effects in electron-proton
scattering to address a present puzzle on the proton structure data. And there
are on-going experiments with cold neutrons measuring the strength of the weak
interaction among quarks to be followed by precise new measurements of the
parameters governing the neutron decay, which can have an important impact on
our understanding of both nuclear physics and astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D.
level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate
students, will continue to produce partnerships within the field to develop new
detector technologies, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state
university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of
women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore,
the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the ASU research support
services and the technical workforce of the society at large.
