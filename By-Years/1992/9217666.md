This research program will exploit a newly developing methodology to resolve a
controversy regarding the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen at the
sediment-water interface. These studies will serve as an indicator of pelagic-
benthic coupling and the availability and fate of fixed carbon on the extensive
shallow- water shelves in the Arctic. This study will also provide cross
comparison between shipboard sediment incubations and in-situ benthic flux
studies to monitor fluxes of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients with
overlying bottom water. This program will be conducted in conjunction with
previously funded research to evaluate the role of the Arctic shelves in global
biogeochemical cycling. These complimentary programs will take place on-board
the R.V. Alpha Helix in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas during the summer of 1992.
