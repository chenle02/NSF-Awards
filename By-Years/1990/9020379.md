This research proposal focuses on the emergence of Post-secondary educational
institutions on rural Alaska during the period 1970-1988. The Ph.D candidate is
an Alaskan Native and his study focuses on the role played by Native Alaskan
legislators in the creation of these institutions. Key questions are "Why were
these institutions established, and what determined localization to Bethel,
Kotzebue and Nome? Further, was the primary purpose to serve the educational
needs of the Native population or to provide an infrastructure for economic
development? Native leaders, including lobbyists and bureaucrats will be
interviewed in order to elucidate the Alaskan political process, and the way the
process is perceived by the Native "actors". This is compared with the dominant
culture's "Rules of the Game" politics. Documentary sources from the Alaska
state legislature, the Alaska Federation of Natives, the Alaska Native
Foundation, The University of the Alaska, and regional corporations provide the
official record of events. The methodology of the study incorporates
anthropological interview techniques and draws upon political science "Rules of
the Game" theory. The educational historical analysis will focus on policy
matters. The proposed grant is intended to cover travel to numerous Native
communities, consultant fees and transcription costs. The preliminary
dissertation title is "Post Secondary Education Institutions in Rural Alaska,
1970-1988: resistance, accommodations, abundonment." The thesis is expected to
be completed in late spring 1991.
