In human and non-human animals, behavior influences the risk of encountering and
becoming infected by parasites. For example, the types of food one eats, places
one travels, and risky behaviors one engages in are all important in determining
parasite risk. Another important, but less well studied, aspect of the
interaction between behavior and parasitism explores how parasites change host
behavior after infection. Parasites of people (for example, Toxoplasma gondii)
and non-human animals can change the behavior of their hosts, and appear to do
so by changing the host's brain chemistry or hormone levels. For example, two
trematode parasites infecting California killifish increase the frequency of
risky behaviors in the fish, and one of these parasites is associated with
changes in the fish's brain chemistry. This study will explore how killifish
behavior and hormone levels influence encounter and infection rates with
parasites, and how infection changes the fish's behavior and hormone levels.
Laboratory behavioral experiments, field experiments in the killifish's natural
habitat, and molecular techniques will be used to explore these questions. The
researchers predict that less social, more active killifish encounter parasites
more often, and that infection changes host levels of androgens, estrogens, and
glucocorticoids (types of hormones) and makes the fish more bold, asocial, and
active. This project is important because parasites are commonly overlooked in
behavioral studies, yet are likely to have very important implications for host
behavior and physiology across the animal kingdom. Additionally, the PhD student
running this project has a strong history of outreach. She will involve
undergraduate and high school students in this project, and this grant will
allow her to teach the students molecular techniques for measuring hormone
levels, in addition to ecological and behavioral techniques.
