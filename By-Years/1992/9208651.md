Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will focus on studies of
the decays of "charmed" or "beauty" particles, which contain one heavy quark and
one light one. A promising mix of theoretical tools will be brought to bear on
these decays, which are complicated phenomena because of the interplay between
strong and weak nuclear forces. The decays are very important, however, as
probes of the nature of matter - antimatter asymmetry and of the weak
interactions of the quarks. Hence, this theoretical study can help to improve
our understanding of the latter issues.
