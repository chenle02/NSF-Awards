This award provides travel support and local expenses for 25 participants of a
two-day public workshop on Statistics and information technology (IT), to be
held on September 16-17, 1999, at the NISS building in Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina. The purpose of the workshop is to expose statisticians to
researchers and to research problems in information technology. Several
important problem areas in information technology will be presented from the
perspectives of both IT and Statistics, with ample opportunity for questions and
discussion. The topic areas to be discussed are: digital government, Internet
traffic measurement and analysis, software development, data/model integration,
and human-computer interaction. A workshop report will be prepared and made
available over the World Wide Web shortly after the conference.
