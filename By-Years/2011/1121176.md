Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Centrioles are conserved microtubule-based
organelles that play essential roles in numerous cellular functions and in an
organism's development. A cell requires exactly two centrioles in order to
normally divide and function. Thus, it is important that centriole number is
precisely regulated. However, in many animals, it appears that the unfertilized
oocyte lacks any centrioles and it inherits only one centriole from the sperm.
As a fertilized oocyte has two centrioles, it acquires the second centriole via
an unidentified mechanism. The goal of this project is to better understand how
the second centriole is acquired using Drosophila melanogaster as a model
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;As well as answering
basic Developmental and Cell Biology questions, this project will provide many
developing and novice scientists (e.g., undergraduate and high school students)
an opportunity to experience laboratory research at a top tier institution. Over
the past five years, the Avidor-Reiss laboratory has developed and executed a
student outreach program that provides students from Boston-area high schools
and colleges with short term (2 - 3 month) or long-term (2 - 3 year) laboratory
internships where they can gain direct training and exposure to research in the
biological sciences. This is an exceptional and ideal opportunity for a young
person who is considering a career in science. In conclusion, the proposed
research will help educate and inspire the next generation of researchers.
