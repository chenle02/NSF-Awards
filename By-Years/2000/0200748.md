This award renews support for maintenance of a collection of prosimian primates
housed at the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC). Study of the biology and
behavior of Prosimians continues to increase in scope, intensity, and
sophistication, and it is now one of the most active and exciting fields of
primatology. The DUPC houses the largest and most diverse collection of
prosimian primates in the world, most of whom are native to Madagascar. The
Center is recognized as the focal point for prosimian research and conservation
activities outside Madagascar. As part of its research mission, the DUPC
provides on-site access to animals, and ships tissues and blood samples to
faculty and students from diverse local, regional, national, and foreign
institutions for off-site use. Users are charged a fee scaled to the kind and
quantity of usage. This award insures the continued availability of animals and
tissues for use by outside researchers at relatively modest cost.
