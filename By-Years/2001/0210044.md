ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: CTS-0210044 Principal Investigator: Prosperetti, Andrea
Affiliation: Johns Hopkins U Title: Finite-size particle in homogeneous
turbulence

An effective computational approach has been developed by the PI for direct
simulation of finite size particles suspended in incompressible fluid. The
proposed project investigates the feasibility of using this method for direct
simulation of many finite size particles in homogeneous turbulent flow. If
successful, this approach would provide a powerful tool to analyze the
challenging problems associated with the impact of particulate turbulent flow.
