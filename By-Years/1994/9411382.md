9411382 Paikowsky The objective of this US/Taiwan Workshop is to nurture
cooperation in geotechnical issues between the engineering /research communities
in both countries.. Focus will be on three themes of mutual interest associated
with infrastructure development. The selected themes include Tunneling, Deep
Foundations, and Ground Modification. State of the art methods of topics that
contribute to the main themes' advancement will be emphasized, such as in situ
testing, risk assessment, physical, analytical and computational modeling and
advanced technologies. This proposal is a collaborative effort between
University of Massachusetts-Lowell and Georgia Institute of Technology. It is
expected that the Workshop will lead to involvement of industry, government
agencies and universities in :1. technology transfer, 2. cooperation of
infrastructure development, 3. research projects associated with respective
research agencies of both countries. ***
