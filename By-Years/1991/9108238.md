This project is concerned with infinite dimensional Lie algebras, their
representations and their connections with mathematical physics. The principal
investigator will formulate recent work of Macdonald and Stanley on symmetry
polynomials in terms of vertex operators in an effort to obtain the local theory
needed for formulating quantum field theory on an arithmetic surface. He will
also study the cohomology of the mapping class group. The research supported
concerns an important focus of current mathematical activity, where group
representation theory, quantum field theory, and algebraic geometry all come
together. This work has important implications for theoretical physics as well
as several areas of mathematics.
