A laboratory is being developed for use in an upper level mathematical modeling
course designed for mathematics majors and minors who have completed the
calculus sequence and one differential equations course. As these students enter
the workforce or pursue graduate studies, many will have access to high-
performance workstations equipped with sophisticated mathematical software. The
goal of the course is to improve the education of undergraduates by teaching
them how to use this technology as a source of input into the process of
mathematics rather than as a tool which simply provides a quicker answer to a
problem.
