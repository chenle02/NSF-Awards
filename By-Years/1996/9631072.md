9631072 Terns RNA transport and localization are required steps in the gene
expression pathway essential for the growth, differentiation and development of
all eukaryotic cells. This research will determine how specific cellular RNA
molecule is targeted to the distinct subcellular compartments by testing to
hypothesis that the intranuclear maturation and targeting of U3 small nucleolar
RNA to nucleoli is the result of specific interactions between discrete sequence
domains of the U3 RNA and specific proteins and other intranuclear structures.
Important U3 RNA nucleotide sequences will be identified by microinjecting
"tagged" variant U3 RNAs and hybrid RNAs into Xenopus oocytes and assaying the
ability of these RNAs to become localized to nucleoli. The intranuclear
distribution of radioactive or fluorescent-tagged U3 RNAs in oocyte nuclei will
be determined by both subnuclear fractionation and light microscopy. The general
significance of observations of U3 RNA will be tested by similar analysis of the
closely related U8 small nucleolar RNA. RNA transport and localization are
required steps in the gene expression pathway essential for the growth,

determine how a specific cellular RNA molecule is targeted to the distinct
subcellular compartments by testing the hypothesis that the intranuclear
maturation and targeting of U3 small nucleolar RNA to nucleoli is the result of
specific interactions between discrete sequence domains of the U3 RNA and
specific proteins an other intranuclear structures. U3 RNA is required for the
processing of pre-ribosomal RNA into mature ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus;
failure localize U3 RNA in the nucleolus will prevent ribosome production and
result in cell death. This research will provide general insight into the
mechanisms that direct trafficking of RNA to subcellular sites of function.
