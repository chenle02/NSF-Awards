The coupling of coherent (laser based) optical systems to micromechanical
devices, combined with breakthroughs in nanofabrication and in ultracold
science, has opened up an exciting new field of research, cavity optomechanics.
Several groups have now demonstrated very significant cooling of the vibrational
motion of a broad range of moving mirrors, from nanoscale cantilevers to LIGO-
class mirrors, and there is every reason to believe that their quantum
mechanical ground state of motion of these systems will soon be achieved. In a
parallel development, ultracold gases as well as Bose-Einstein condensates
placed inside optical resonators have been shown to behave under appropriate
conditions much like moving mirrors. Cavity optomechanics is rapidly becoming a
very active sub-field or fundamental and applied research at the boundary
between AMO physics, condensed matter physics, and nanoscience. With these
breakthrough developments in mind, the main goal of this research is to develop
a detailed theoretical understanding of key aspects of cavity optomechanics,
including in particular the dynamics of mirror cooling, and to study a number of
applications that include novel quantum sensors as well as the quantum and
coherent control of ultracold atomic and molecular
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavity optomechanics presents considerable promise
both in opening the way to address fundamental questions related to pushing
quantum mechanics toward increasingly macroscopic systems, but also in
applications that span a variety of areas from quantum detection to the coherent
control of microscopic systems and/or of nanoscale devices. On the applied side
it will enable the development of ultrasensitive force sensors and may find
applications in quantum information processing technology. In addition, the
study of these problems is an excellent training ground for students in view of
their interdisciplinary nature at the interface of several subfields of
considerable fundamental and practical interest.
