Abstract&lt;br/&gt;IIS 0410409&lt;br/&gt;PI Olivia R. Sheng and Paul Hu,
University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory
Research will support a collaboration with the State of Utah's Electronic
Resource and Eligibility Product governance board, in the development of an
electronic system for temporary assistance for needy families (Utah Cares). The
PI's, from the University's School of Business, will develop a framework for
investigating the inter-relationships among system quality, cost, benefit,
usability, usage, and user acceptance. The collection of data will be
accomplished through web log analysis and data-mining, supplemented by
questionnaires as needed. As changes are made to improve Utah Cares, the impact
should be discernible through the framework which has been developed and the
data which is continually collected.&lt;br/&gt;
