This project exploits mobile sensing and vehicle localization to identify fine-
grained abnormal driving behaviors, such as weaving, swerving, and fast U-turns,
and further to infer location-aware dangerous vehicular status. Several existing
works have tried to detect abnormal driving behaviors by focusing on detecting
drivers' status based on pre-deployed infrastructure, such as alcohol sensors,
infrared sensors, and cameras. Such approaches incur extra installation cost and
are thus difficult to be widely adopted. In order to build pervasive location-
aware driving safety systems, this project tries to deploy low power consumption
sensing (utilizing mobile devices carried by users in vehicles) and learning
techniques based on statistical analysis to localize vehicles and identify fine-
grained abnormal driving behaviors. More importantly, the proposed system keeps
tracking the drivers' behaviors and determines fine-grained location-related
dangerous vehicular status, such as driving on the center line of two-way roads
or occupying left lanes for a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks
to conduct a comprehensive study to understand to what extent the current mobile
devices can model various real-world driving behaviors and corresponding vehicle
dynamics. A new real-time mobile sensing system, which combines real-time mobile
sensing and heterogeneous driving environments, is developed to address driving
safety concerns. The final results will be the abiding principles of cyber-
physical architecture that resolve dynamic impacts of complex environments and
provide clear guidelines over Internet of Things (IoTs). Specifically, effective
features are investigated from mobile sensor readings that are able to depict
each type of abnormal driving behaviors. These features can thus be extracted to
localize the vehicles and derive the patterns of abnormal driving behaviors
(e.g., weaving, swerving, fast U-turn, and sudden breaks) with the consideration
of generic driving scenarios and heterogeneous mobile devices. Techniques based
on machine learning are developed to generate a classifier model that could
clearly identify fine-grained abnormal driving behaviors. The classifier model
will be further utilized as a foundation to devise the location-aware driving
safety system, which can track users' driving behaviors and realize location-
related dangerous vehicular status in real-time using low-computing-capability
mobile devices.
