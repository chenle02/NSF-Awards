The objective of this project is to improve the materials testing laboratory for
the Engineering Technology and Construction Management and Technology programs
at a primarily minority institution. A new strength of materials course will be
developed to support the general engineering program. An IBM PC/XT will be
interfaced to a tensile tester to provide experience in automated data
acquisition. In addition, an impact tester, polariscope, polisher/grinders, and
a materials microscope will be obtained.
