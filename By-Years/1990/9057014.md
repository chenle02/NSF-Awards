The PI intends to continue research into the evolution of complex fault systems.
Prime field site is the San Andreas fault at two very different physical and
temporal scales. During faulting, evolution in the structural style, and the
magnitude of nonbrittle deformation associated with each earthquake, changes to
reflect the control exerted by growth of the fault surface into unfaulted
strata, and the geometry of the older deformed strata. On a regional scale,
mapping, structural analysis and paleomagnetic studies are coupled to provide an
understanding of how transtensive and transpressive systems change with time,
and how the earliest geometry exerts control on the distribution of stress
orientation and structural styles.
