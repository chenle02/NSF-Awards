Thunderstorms are high-energy environments consisting of electric fields and
radiation sources. Gamma-ray emissions from thunderstorms are known as gamma-ray
glows and are often terminated by lightning. However, there have been few
observations of gamma-ray glows, and little is known about how and where they
are created and how they may relate to the initiation of lightning. This project
will combine new observations and computer modeling to better understand this
phenomena. The main aspect of the project will be the deployment of gamma-ray
sensors on balloons that will be flown into thunderstorms to collect data. A
potential impact of the project is through the improved understanding of
lightning initiation, which may eventually lead to better warnings and lightning
safety. Multiple students would be involved in the project, thereby training the
next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will
conduct balloon-based observations of gamma-ray glows. The work will improve
upon a prior design of a balloon-borne instrument that detects gamma-ray glows
using Geiger counters by incorporating an inorganic scintillator and a slow
electric field measurement. Thirty flights are planned over the course of the
proposal period from central Florida. The data, along with Monte Carlo
simulations of gamma-ray propagation, would be used to: 1) Determine the
frequency of gamma-ray glows and their relationship to thunderstorm meteorology
and lightning, 2) Determine source mechanism(s) for gamma-ray glows, 3)
Determine discharge currents produced by gamma-ray glows in the source regions,
4) Constrain electric fields present in glow source regions/lightning initiation
regions and determine durations of high fields occurring before lightning, 5)
Determine relationship between glows, lightning and TGFs.
