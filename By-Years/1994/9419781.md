9419781 Crawford Metabolism in the heart utilizes glucose as a source of energy.
Glucose metabolism is affected by the concentrations of the enzymes that break
down this nutrient (i.e., enzymes in the glycolytic pathway). Dr. Crawford
intends to measure the rate of glucose utilization, the variation in enzyme
concentration for all enzymes in the glycolytic pathway and determine the
molecular mechanisms responsible for the change in enzyme concentration. To
explore these processes, the teleost fish (Fundulus heteroclitus), a cold-
blooded organism that lives in different thermal environments, will be utilized.
Populations of this species should modify heart metabolism to adapt to these
different environments. These modifications should reveal mechanisms that
regulate glucose use. He intends to empirically verify these results by altering
the concentration of one or more glycolytic enzymes in cardiac muscle cells and
quantify the effect on glucose utilization. The data from this approach will
contribute to knowing the role of gene expression in metabolic processes as well
as provide empirical evidence addressing questions concerning metabolic control.
