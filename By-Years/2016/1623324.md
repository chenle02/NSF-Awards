This EAGER project will create an innovative system to allow medical
professionals to use their sense of touch to explore data obtained from
ultrasound imaging scans. Physicians routinely rely on palpation during physical
examination, exploring the size, location, and mechanical response of organs or
body parts with their hands and fingers. The high-resolution, three-dimensional
images produced by sophisticated imaging systems are essential tools in modern
medicine; the results of this project will enable diagnosticians to
interactively touch, feel, and manipulate objects in these images. The project
entails the integration of a recently developed ultrasonic imaging methods with
a glove-like interface that will use pneumatic actuators to accurately simulate
the mechanical response of the imaged tissue. The project will benefit public
health through early and accurate detection of cancerous tumors, and reduction
of unnecessary, invasive biopsies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanical
properties of an abnormal growth may be important in determining whether it is
cancerous. Combining speed-of-sound measurement, which correlates to bulk
modulus, and elastography, which correlates to shear modulus, allows estimation
of the local elasticity tensor at each point in the imaged region. This project
will create a pneumatically actuated haptic device for the hands and fingers,
that uses this data to accurately simulate the feel of physical palpation. This
mode of data display emulates the process of physical examination, and is
thereby naturally leverages basic medical training, rather than requiring new,
counter-intuitive, skills to interpret an artificial visualization. The project
will establish whether adding this haptic feedback to existing diagnostic scans
will lead to better diagnostic outcomes. The EAGER project will include
extensive evaluation of the ability of the device to convey subtle and
diagnostically relevant differences in the mechanical properties of soft tissue.
