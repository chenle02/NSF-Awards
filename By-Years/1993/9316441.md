9316441 Helmberger This research is to determine the detailed nature of the
lateral variation in the D" layer of the earth's mantle, the portion just above
the earth's core. Most of the present methods that image this deep structure
must correct for the intervening mantle structure. Since there is poor
consistency in derived mantle structure, most 3-D global models predict
discordant differential times for core-phases, branches of PKP and SKS. This
work will use differential times and waveform information to assess lateral
variation in the deep mantle structure from the bottom-up, as opposed to the
normal procedure of top-down. However, this requires a great deal of study of
the inner and outer core to establish their uniformity so that variation in
differential times are mapped properly. ***
