The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program and the
Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM) program of the Division of
Chemistry will support the collaborative research program of Prof. Patricia
Thiel and Prof. James Evans of Iowa State University. Profs. Thiel and Evans and
their students will study both the formation and stability of metal
nanostructures supported on surfaces. They will consider both the effect of
chemical additives of behavior, and also the additional complexity and
functionality provided by multi-component systems. Detailed analysis and
elucidation of these systems will be achieved by a closely integrated
combination of experiment (scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with
other surface analysis techniques) together with theory and simulation (from ab-
initio DFT and semi-empirical analysis of energetics, to atomistic modeling
using Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation and coarse-grained continuum modeling of
the self-assembly and coarsening of epitaxial nanostructures).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will provide the basic scientific
underpinnings for a range of nanotechnologies based on thin film deposition. The
work will provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate
students and postdoctoral trainees in cutting-edge areas of nanoscale science
and technology, nanostructure imaging and analysis, and predictive theory and
multiscale modeling.
