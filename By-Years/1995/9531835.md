9531835 Ray The emphasis of this analytical and experimental research project is
to enhance the science and technology base for on- line monitoring of material
damage and prediction of residual service life in complex mechanical structures.
Potential application areas include automotive and aircraft related mechanical
systems, electric power plants, and pulp and paper mills, and discrete
production processes such as manufacture of ceramics and semiconductors, where
structural durability of plant components and operational reliability are
critical. Based on the understanding of physical phenomena and the data
available, analytical deterministic models of damage dynamics are formulated for
selected materials in a continuous time-setting as opposed to the commonly used
cycle-based models of fatigue damage. Stochastic modeling of fatigue dynamics is
advanced based on an ensemble of experimentally generated statistical data. An
on-line damage monitoring system is built using the stochastic model with series
inputs from basic sensing elements. Experimental validation of the concept is
accomplished via a test apparatus fabricated in the laboratory with equipment
and test samples provided by NASA Lewis and Sikorsky Aircraft Company
respectively.***
