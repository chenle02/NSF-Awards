9458376 Rojstaczer This research project will examine the interaction between
subsurface fluid flow and crustal deformation in areas of active volcanism and
faulting. The work is designed to aid in understanding the episodic nature of
permeability and to use hydrology as a tool to define the earthquake and
geothermal cycle in a region. Teaching goals include: 1) developing an
outstanding graduate program in hydrogeology, 2) organizing an interdisciplinary
program in hydrology, and 3) teaching undergraduates that science, and earth
science in particular, is an exciting field of study that has real world
applications.
