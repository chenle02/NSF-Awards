Abstract Hu

This proposed research addresses ergodic properties of "almost hyperbolic"
dynamical systems. Here "almost hyperbolic" systems means a smooth dynamical
systems that is hyperbolic everywhere except for a finite set of points. These
systems include "almost Anosov" diffeomorphisms, "almost hyperbolic" invariant
sets, piecewise expanding maps on the unit interval with indifferent fixed
points, and invariant sets of expanding maps with indifferent fixed points.
"Almost hyperbolic" systems lie on the boundary of the set of uniformly
hyperbolic systems in the space of smooth dynamical systems. By the results
obtained from "almost Anosov" diffeomorphisms on the surface, the ergodic
properties of such systems may be quite different from that of uniformly
hyperbolic systems, though the topological properties are similar. For example,
these systems may or may not admit SRB measures, and even when they do,
correlation decay may change from exponential to polynomial. This project
stresses existence and properties of SRB measures, rate of decay of
correlations, and stochastic stability under small perturbations for general
"almost hyperbolic" systems.

Uniformly hyperbolic systems are the main research subjects in smooth dynamical
systems since late 60's. These systems display many types of complex dynamic
behavior, and whose behavoir are often regarded as chaotic. Ergodic theory
concerns understanding the long-term behavior of systems. Now ergodic properties
for uniformly hyperbolic systems are understood very well, and people are
interested in such properties for nonuniformly hyperbolic systems. "Almost
hyperbolic" means that hyperbolic conditions fail at a finite set of points.
These systems lie on the boundary of the set of uniformly hyperbolic systems,
and are the simplest nonuniformly hyperbolic systems. Results obtained earlier
for some particular systems, "almost Anosov" systems in the two-dimensional
torus, show that such systems may-and sometimes do-exhibit totally different
long term behavior. In this project we will study ergodic properties of more
general "almost hyperbolic" systems. We are particular interested in orbit
distrubitions, rate of mixing, and stochastic stability under small perturbation
for such systems.
