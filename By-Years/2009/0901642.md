Richter and Sundberg will continue their research in Function-Theoretic Operator
Theory and Model Theory based on Agler's idea of extremals in families of
operators. One particular emphasis in their work will be a study of Hilbert
modules based on the Drury-Arveson space of analytic functions in several
complex variables.

The study of spaces of analytic functions has a long and rich history as a
meeting ground and source of ideas from a wide range of areas in both Pure and
Applied Mathematics such as Complex Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, Operator
Theory, Functional Analysis, Control theory, and Partial Differential Equations.
Operator theory has its roots in the work on Partial Differential Equations of
Fredholm and Hilbert in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The
study of spaces of analytic functions has its origins in the work on the
classical Hardy spaces by Hardy, Fischer, and the Riesz brothers, among others,
in the first half of the twentieth century. The two areas met in the 1940's in
the work of A. Beurling on the unilateral shift, which yielded a complete
structure theory of an important infinite dimensional operator using Hardy-space
techniques. The generalization of Beurling's results to arbitrary multiplicity
shifts together with the Sz.Nagy dilation theorem is the basis for a model
theory for contraction operators on Hilbert spaces. Thus, up to scaling, every
bounded linear operator on a separable Hilbert space can be modeled using a
semi-invariant subspace of a vector-valued Hardy space. As many naturally
occurring processes can be modeled by use of such linear operators, this has
applications that can be felt throughout science. More research is needed and is
being done to clarify the model theory. In particular, there has been a large
effort devoted to extending the ideas developed in the study of the Hardy spaces
to other spaces of analytic functions, and in particular to the multivariable
setting. The current work of Richter and Sundberg is in this area.
