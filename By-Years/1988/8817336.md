Basic and applied aspects of NSF grant BSR-8817336, entitled "Evolution of Bill
Polymorphism in the African Finch Pyrenestes." What produces and maintains
variation in natural populations is one of the most fundamental and important
questions in biology, of the types of variation found in species perhaps none
has generated as much debate as the occurrence of polymorphism. Polymorphism
occur when two or more distinct interbreeding forms co-occur within a single
population. Despite decades of research there are few instances where the
mechanisms producing polymorphism are understood. The African estrildid finch
Pyrenestes ostrinus represents one of the few known species where a polymorphism
is associated with differential resource use. Building on three years of prior
research in the tropical forests of Africa proposed research endeavors to
determine the genetic and ecological basis of the polymorphism. In so doing the
research should provide an empirical foundation for testing current theoretical
models for maintaining polymorphism and greatly improve our understanding of how
variation is maintained in animals species. While only seven percent of the
world's land surface is covered by tropical forests they contain over half of
all known species. Tropical forests play a critical role in regulating the
earth's climate, provide important storehouses of genetic material for
agriculture, are the source of many important pharmaceuticals and provide
valuable renewable economic resources. Despite their importance they are
disappearing at an accelerating rate. For conservation efforts to be successful
there is a critical need for basic biological information tropical rainforests.
As part of the proposed research on Pyrenestes critical information important
for rainforest conservation will also be collected.
