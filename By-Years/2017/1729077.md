A substantial proportion of Americans come into contact with a criminal trial
court at some point in their lives. The process of adjudicating criminal cases
asserts significant personal, financial, and social costs. This study will
investigate the dynamic multi-stage process of the criminal case and what role
courtroom professionals have in its development. Specifically, this study
examines what influence judges, defense attorneys, and prosecutors have on the
outcomes faced by the accused. In so doing, it hopes to offer findings that may
improve the administration of justice in America.

This project will collect original data on the processing of federal criminal
cases. It uses a stratified random sample of 9,200 cases of sentenced defendants
from 23 federal district courts for 2006 to 2013. Specific areas of inquiry in
the subsequent statistical analysis include whether a defendant is released or
held in a detention facility pending trial, the amount of time it takes for each
case to be adjudicated, and the severity of sentence imposed upon the convicted
defendant. The study will consider how the backgrounds and preferences of
judges, defense attorneys, and prosecutors impact these essential stages. The
results will give key insights into trial court decision-making, which remains
underexplored by much of the current research.
