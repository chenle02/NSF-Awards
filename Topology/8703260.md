Professor Geoghegan's areas of interest are topology and related group theory.
He will investigate problems in geometric and homological group theory for which
topological methods, coming from shape theory, fixed point theory and infinite-
dimensional topology, are appropriate. More specifically he will investigate
various questions involving finiteness properties and cohomological properties
of groups which can be interpreted as questions about "ends" of covering spaces.
He will continue his collaboration with Professor K.S. Brown of Cornell
University on infinite-dimensional finitely presented discrete groups. On his
own he will continue his investigation of the topological meaning of a well
known conjecture of H. Bass about the Hattori-Stallings trace of an idempotent
matrix with group ring entries. Groups are ubiquitous in mathematics and the
natural sciences as codifiers of symmetry, and one can never have too many
approaches to discovering their properties.
