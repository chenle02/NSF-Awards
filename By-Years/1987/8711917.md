The Taut Batu are a little studied, pre-literate tribal group of the
Phillipines. Living in a restricted mountainous area, they have an unusual
settlement pattern: some local groups live in specially designed "tree houses"
which are seasonally abandoned for dwellings in caves. This project is designed
to understand the relationship of this special type of settlement pattern and
dwelling with regards to environment, social structure, religion, and daily
interaction patterns. This study will extend our understanding about the
relationship between material culture and the non-material aspects of culture in
a social context. It will benefit both ethnology and archaeology with regards to
the inferences about behavior, values, and symbols that can be made from
physical objects such as houses. This study will have practical as well as
theoretical benefits. It will provide development agencies with an interest in
cultural minority resettlement with information on housing and the people's
point of view on the quality of life of their housing.
