This research consists of several projects that are designed to address two
puzzles concerning corporate dividend policy. The first is why do companies pay
dividends at all. Most of the previous research falls into two categories. One
explains dividends as a consequence of information asymmetries, while the other
emphasizes the consequences of investor heterogeneity. Objections have been
raised to both types of explanations. This project is aimed at modifying and
testing these two theories, taking into account the current criticisms. The
second puzzle is why are dividend payments so smooth. It is suggested that
dividend smoothing can be explained within the context of signaling models. The
premise that bunching arises naturally in signaling contexts and explains the
microeconomic, time-series properties of dividends will be explored. This part
of the research will focus on refinements of signaling equilibria and
applications of these refinements to models of dividends. This project is
important because it will improve our understanding of corporate policies
regarding cash distributions to shareholders. On the basis of this work, it
should be possible to make more reliable judgments about the likelihood that
dividend payouts will decline over time. The analysis should also shed
considerable light on the extent to which dividend policy is used to communicate
information to shareholders. In addition, the effect of dividend taxation on the
informativeness of corporate financial policy will be measured. Attention will
also be focused on analyzing the desirability of various tax proposals that
alter the tax treatment of dividends and the repurchase of stock by
corporations.
