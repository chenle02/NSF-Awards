The Principal Investigator plans to compute and apply Legendrian contact
homology to study Legendrian submanifolds in one-jet spaces. This homology is
based on holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds. In the special case when
the Legendrian submanifold is the conormal lift of a smooth submanifold, the
Principal Investigator plans to relate the contact homology with an under-
construction A-infinity-structure on the open string topology of the smooth
submanifold. The next step in the project will be to translate more general
structures from open string topology to contact geometry, thereby formulating a
relative version of symplectic field theory as a generalization of Legendrian
contact homology. Via this conormal construction, the investigator plans to use
the homology to study smooth submanifolds, such as knots, in Euclidean or
projective space. The Principal Investigator will also apply Legendrian contact
homology to study higher homotopy groups of Legendrian submanifolds. The
relationship between holomorphic curves and gradient flow trees should
facilitate many of the project's computations.

Contact geometry makes many appearances in physics, from optics to
thermodynamics to classical mechanics. For example, particles obeying the Least
Action Principal from mechanics translate into objects in contact geometry (or
its closely related field, symplectic geometry) known as holomorphic curves.
Some of these connections to physics have been known for centuries; however,
only recently has contact geometry benefited from significant advances within
the mathematical community. Specifically, studying these holomorphic curves have
led to some powerful and sometimes surprising discoveries about contact rigidity
and contact dynamics. In the last couple of years, an active area of research
has evolved around applying these holomorphic curves towards studying unresolved
problems in three and four-dimensional topology. As stated, these problems in
low-dimensional topology seem to have nothing to do with holomorphic curves.
Yet, the techniques from recent results have firmly established a connection.
The Principal Investigator plans to further study the effectiveness of
holomorphic curves, with an emphasis on connecting it to the theory of
topological knots in three dimensions.
