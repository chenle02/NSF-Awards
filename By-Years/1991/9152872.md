This award creates a multi-user and multi-tool computing environment that will
enhance the teaching of computer science. The equipment purchased is used to: 1)
improve instruction in the existing curriculum; 2) develop upper level courses;
such as computer graphics, database management and software engineering; 3)
initiate undergraduate research by providing accessibility to other computer
systems (on and off campus), scientific databases, and collaboration with
researchers on this campus as well as at other institutions; 4) provide linkage
to an existing computer science laboratory; and 5) provide a basis for network
linkage with other universities, government, and industry. The equipment is a
Dec MicroVax 3300 server with eight workstations and two DECstations 2100 ULTRIX
workstations networded together.
