This award supports fundamental research on the mechanics of cratered surfaces.
Reversible adhesives are designed to form temporary bonds, and ideally can be
reusable and capable of strong bonding. Such reversible adhesives can find wide
applications in vertical mounting and climbing, releasable wafer and chip
handling, as well as reusable bio-integrated electronics. It is well known that
reversible adhesion can be achieved through surface interactions such as van der
Waals (vdW), capillary, and electrostatic forces as well as volume effects such
as suction. Adhesion due to surface interactions has been well studied for
gecko-inspired microfibrils with different tip shapes including the concave
shape. But the contribution from suction has been widely neglected at
microscale. However, manufacturing microfibrils with large aspect ratio can be
expensive and time-consuming. If an array of meso-scale craters could provide
combined high adhesive strength and reversibility, they may become a practical
substitute for microfibrils. The results of this research will guide the design
and optimization of cratered surfaces and give a definitive answer to the debate
of the suction effect across a broad range of scales. It will also create a
pathway for developing a new class of superior adhesives for various
applications in engineering and medicine. Building upon the strong track record
of previous educational and outreach activities, the PIs will continue to
provide research opportunities specifically designed for undergraduate and high-
school students from minority institutes through NASCENT REU and women in
engineering programs (WEP) at UT Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that arrays of miniature
craters on polymer surfaces can lead to significantly improved reversible
adhesion with pressure-sensitive strengths. The premise of this research is that
cratered surfaces can be tailored for various applications, by choosing proper
geometric and mechanical properties, as well as the preloading program. Central
to this tailoring is a fundamental multi-scale understanding of the adhesion and
decohesion mechanisms. The research team plans to develop a fundamental
understanding of reversible adhesion of cratered polymeric surfaces in a broad
range of scales through the following three research thrusts: (i) Fabrication of
surface craters with sizes ranging from centimeters to micrometers. (ii)
Measurements of traction-separation relations and pull-off forces. (iii)
Modeling and simulation. The project will be carried out by a synergetic team
with complementary expertise in microfabrication, adhesion mechanics, modeling,
and simulation.
