The investigator studies study topics in enumerative combinatorics related to
continued fractions, differential operators, polytopes associated with bin-
packing algorithms, and identities for Bernoulli numbers and related sequences.
The work on continued fractions extends Flajolet's combinatorial approach in two
directions: first, to some well-known continued fractions, such as those
associated with the moments of Jacobi polynomials, and second, to a little-
studied generalization of continued fractions called "Lukasiewicz continued
fractions" or "multicontinued fractions". The work on differential operators
interprets their actions on monomials in terms of paths or directed graphs,
which may represent a very general class of combinatorial objects, which include
those arising from continued fractions. The work on bin-packing algorithms
applies methods from permutation enumeration to study the behavior of certain
bin-packing and dual bin-packing algorithms. The theory of hypergeometric series
gives a well-understood way of dealing with certain types of identities, but
there are many identies that are not of this form, of which the Bernoulli
numbers and related sequences are among the most interesting. The investigator
studies these identities, with a view to developing general ways to deal with
them.

The investigator studies topics in enumerative combinatorics, an area of
mathematics that involves counting the number of ways that various kinds of
operations can be performed, or the number of objects of a particular type that
can be constructed. This area of mathematics has many applications to the
analysis of computer programs, and also has applications to statistics, physics,
chemistry, and communications. This work extends techniques for solving several
different kinds of enumeration problems. One of the topics, for example, shows
that the analysis of a method for efficiently filling containers with objects of
various sizes is closely related to the enumeration of certain kinds of
permutations.
