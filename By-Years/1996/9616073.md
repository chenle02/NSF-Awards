9616073 Chandrasekaran This funding is requested in order to permit attendance
of up to ten U.S. participants at the Ninth National Power System Conference
(NPSC) to be held during the December 19-21, 1996 at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Kanpur, India. The U.S. participants, along with some Indian
researchers, will make presentations at a Workshop on Artificial Intelligence
Techniques Applied in Electric Distribution Systems. The primary purpose of the
U.S. participation is to share and exchange the latest research ideas in various
aspects such as planning, operation, and control of distribution systems. The
participants will be able to obtain useful data on research work in other theme
areas of the conference. Indian researchers have contributed heavily to the
proposed workshop theme area, and the U.S. contingent can benefit from the visit
by identifying fresh approaches to handling the problems at home in the
deregulated environment. Major public and private sector power companies sponsor
the biennial conference held under the aegis of leading educational institution
such as the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India. The conference had
been a major event in the power system area, and attended by well over 400
scientist, engineers, consultants, manufacturers, and utility personnel. ***
