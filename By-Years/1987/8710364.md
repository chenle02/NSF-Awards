The research is an investigation of dolphin boundary layer characteristics and
deals with the Gray's paradox. In the field of cetacean hydrodynamics, the
boundary layer of an actively propulsing dolphin is studied using flow
visualization techniques. By observing the flow and the skin surface motion and
contour, it may be possible to determine the precise nature of an interaction
between the fluid and the skin. It would also be possible to determine the
extent of a transition region and location of a point of separation. This
experimental approach is necessary due to the complexity of the flow field about
the dolphin--a flow field characterized by three- dimensional, unsteady motion.
Modelling of three-dimensional flows over a body with moving boundaries is done
to assist in the theoretical approach. This project is one supported under the
Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
