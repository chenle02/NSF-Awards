The focus of this project is on investigating entangled polymer rheology with a
multiscale computationally approach. The proposed research will pin down the
parameters needed to be calculated at the atomistic level, in order to provide
macroscopic scale predictions about the rheology of a wide class of soft
materials. Entangled polymers have tremendous economic impact in industrial
materials, and also influence the mechanics of biological tissue. Any
significant advance in the understanding of these dynamics will have substantial
impact on many branches of physics, materials science, biophysics, biology and
engineering. The co-PIs will produce a user-friendly graphical user interface
(GUI) and make their GPU code available for public consumption. This code would
allow any user with a simple desktop and graphics card (less than $1k) to
predict the linear or nonlinear rheology of any blend of linear, branched or
cross-linked entangled homopolymers in a homogeneous flow field.

It is proposed to achieve the first ab initio dynamic prediction for soft matter
that exhibits relaxation times of seconds or minutes. A hierarchical structure
of simulations is proposed, starting from ab initio type of calculations. The
goal is to make predictions possible for any entangled homopolymer chain
architecture, any molecular weight, any blend of architecture and molecular
weight, and for any flow field. The homopolymer model to be used is
thermodynamically based and in accordance to mean-field theory. While currently
available models require parameter fitting and empiricisms, the intellectual
achievement of this work, if successful, is to predict the rheology of entangled
homopolymers from atomistic knowledge only, without any parameter fitting. This
feat can be accomplished with the use of techniques to speed-up calculations by
about 12 orders of magnitude, allowing the bridging of the time scales between
atomistic and macroscale times.
