This research concerns the classification of admissible representations of
reductive p-adic groups in terms of their restrictions to compact-open
subgroups. One of the goals of this work is to gain a good understanding of
supercuspidal representations of these groups. The principal investigator
continues his collaboration with Moy on the theory of minimal K-types, which is
likely to play a fundamental role in representation theory of p-adic groups. The
principal investigator also continues to pursue arithmetic, geometric and group-
theoretic questions related to anisotropic semi-simple groups over global
fields. This research falls into the broad category of p-adic algebraic groups.
Historically, algebraic groups arose in an effort to describe all the
transformations or symmetries of an n-dimensional space. The spaces under
consideration here, however, are not the familiar real spaces like the line and
the plane, but related objects which ape important in number theory and pure
algebra.
