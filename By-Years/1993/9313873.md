CTS-9313873 University of Texas-Austin Douglas R. Lloyd ABSTRACT Development of
a homogeneous theoretical model to predict species rejection coefficients for
multicomponent electrolyte solutions during reverse osmosis comprises the main
thrust of this research. The new theory incorporates the calculation of fixed
charged density in the membrane during reverse osmosis and its dependence on ion
coefficients will be calculated as a function of electrolyte concentrations, pH,
and applied pressure and then compared to experimental measurements. The general
theory will be extended to accommodate concentration polarization and membranes
of different structures. Results could enhance the use of reverse osmosis to
develop water resources in parts of the country, contributing to civil
infrastructure, and facilitate hybrid methods for environmental treatment of
contamination sites.
