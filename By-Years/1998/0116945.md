Arabidopsis 2010: The Endgame for Reverse Genetics. The Arabidopsis 2010 Project
is focused on determining the function of each of the 26,000 genes found in the
genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. One of the most definitive
methods for determining gene function is to create an organism in which that
gene is missing and then ask the question: how does that simple genetic defect
change how the organism develops and functions? Such mutant organisms are
commonly called 'knockouts' and this project is focused on developing and using
new technologies to provide knockout plants to the research community. Funds
from this project will continue to support the University of Wisconsin Knockout
Plant Facility, established under a previous award, as well as support research
on using new high throughput methods for more easily identifying large numbers
of knockout plants. The research community and public can obtain information on
the procedures used to screen for mutants and to obtain seeds from this project
via the website already established and maintained at the University of
Wisconsin Biotechnology Center Knockout Plant Facility
(http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/). One new technology supported under
this project is the use of a recently developed method for creating 'DNA chips'
(i.e., small pieces of glass on which a very large number of different DNA
sequences are synthesized and displayed) to develop new methods of finding and
cataloging knockout organisms. Results from this research will be published in
the appropriate scientific journals and the methodology for high-throughput
screens to find new knockout plants will be described on the above website. More
broadly, results from this project may provide new methods for determining the
function of genes in any sequenced genome, information which is critical for
further advances in agriculture and medicine.
