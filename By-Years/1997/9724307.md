9724307 Beebe A time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) will
be acquired by the University of Utah. The instrument will support numerous
research projects that fall into four general categories: advanced materials and
processing, biotechnology of surfaces, environmental research on surfaces and
development of new methodologies related to all three of the above areas. The
instrument will be housed in a centralized facility where it will be used by
over 25 faculty researchers, 8 other industrial and university scientists, and
about 60 graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The instrument will also
be used in the education and research training of students, as an integral part
of a graduate course in surface chemistry and of an undergraduate course on
instrumental analysis. %%% The instrument will significantly enhance the
University's research capabilities in the area of surface science. It will have
a large impact on research and education due to the large number of
investigators and projects involved. Many existing industrial collaborations
will also benefit from use of the instrument. ***
