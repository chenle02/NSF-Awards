A study of mass transfer effects in extraction with supercritical fluids will
be undertaken. Rates of adsorption and desorption as well as equilibrium states
are to be determined with a high pressure gravimetric device. Supercritical
fluid extraction holds promise as an environmentally friendly approach to the
recovery of important chemical species. This project will provide important data
for the design and economic evaluation of prospective processes.
