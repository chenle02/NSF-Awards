This grant will support the work of Notre Dame University Professor Ani
Aprahamian, who will investigate the energy and lifetimes of levels in deformed
nuclei produced in the fission of 235U Her analysis will center on the possible
applicability of supersymmetry concepts in the description of multi-phonon
vibrational modes in the neutron-rich nuclei being studied. The research will
make use of the Notre Dame tandem accelerator, the ATLAS linear accelerator at
Argonne National Laboratory, and the research reactor at Brookhaven National
Laboratory.
