The frontier of sensitivity in high-resolution NMR of liquids has advanced
greatly during the past 35 years. But there are still many important problems
which cannot be solved by NMR because of sample concentrations falling below
practical detection limits. One as yet unexploited technique for increasing
sensitivity is that of electron - nuclear cross polarization in which the
simultaneous saturation of an electron resonance enhances a nuclear resonance
(in this case, a proton or carbon resonance). Such an experiment (essentially a
simultaneous electron spin resonance and a nuclear magnetic resonance
experiment) requires instrumental modifications not usually encountered in NMR
(or in EPR) experiments and careful and precise manipulation of experimental
conditions. Because of these extreme requirements the feasibility of such an
approach must be demonstrated. Dr. Bachovchin will carry out such experiments to
determine the possibility of success .
