The need for portable personal protection worldwide has increased dramatically
in recent years due to extreme events such as deadly school shootings, the
Boston Marathon explosion, and terrorist attacks. All the aforementioned events
highlight an urgent need: civilians especially students and travelers need
affordable personal protection. Therefore, developing multi-functional portable
shields for civilians is a very important task. However, current personal
protection products are not feasible options for civilians, because they cost
too much and therefore lack practicality.

The proposed I-Corps project will investigate the commercial potential and
viability of new hybrid material systems that offer reasonable protection in a
practical way ? low costs and multiple functions. This transformative research
is expected to yield a simple yet novel engineering material design (baseline
materials with embedded interfaces/adhesive layers) to reduce impact damage and
material costs. The proposed portable shields would not only provide enough
resistance against bullets, knives and fragments during explosion, but also
could be folded as temporary helmets during earthquakes and other unexpected
dangerous situations. The societal impact of the project is significant, because
numerous families will benefit from our proposed products when parents use them
as special laptop cases during travel, and children could bring them in
backpacks to schools. If successful, the outcome of this project will have
significant impact on personal safety worldwide.
