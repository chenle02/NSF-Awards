This grant supports participation by Dr. Zitzewitz and his students in a new
experiment being carried out at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, which
measures the decay rate of the positronium atom. Zitzewitz will introduce
modifications to the apparatus which will increase the precision of the
measurement from 250 ppm to the 100 ppm level.
