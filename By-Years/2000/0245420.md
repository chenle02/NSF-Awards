The interaction between noncommutative algebra and other subjects is one of the
main themes in modern noncommutative algebra. The categorical and homological
approaches to noncommutative algebras have been very successful. The Principal
Investigator is studying the structure of noncommutative algebras and associated
noncommutative schemes, in particular, the homological aspects of those objects.
One of the main projects of this proposal is the classification of Artin-
Schelter regular algebras of dimension four. A new approach to this question is
to use A-infinity algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical
phenomena have been explained by noncommutative equations. New topological
invariants have been discovered by using noncommutative Hopf algebras. Some de-
singularization problems in algebraic geometry have been interpreted as derived
equivalences induced by a Morita context in noncommutative algebra. Many
questions in string theory have been formulated by using noncommutative
algebras. One may also use noncommutative algebra to encode models for networks,
quantum computing and chemical molecules. Further and deeper understanding of
noncommutative algebras will be greatly beneficial to many areas in mathematics,
physics and other disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
