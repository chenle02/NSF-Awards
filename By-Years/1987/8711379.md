The emergence of social norms accompanied by effective sanctions is an important
social process, yet no social theory satisfactorily gives the conditions under
which norms will emerge, nor the process by which they emerge. This project aims
at developing such theory by means of mathematical modeling accompanied by
computer simulation. The work will build upon recent work in evolutionary
biology by Maynard Smith and others which has led to the idea of evolutionarily
stable strategies, as well as on the work of Axelrod and others in
experimentation and computer tournaments with an iterated prisoners dilemma. The
work will attempt especially to explore the effects of social structure on the
development of effective sanctions. The predictions of a mathematical model
about the effects of variations in social structure will be tested against
computer simulation of systems of mutually contingent strategies. The
significance of this work beyond the development of social theory lies in
practical questions of social control, such as, for example the question of the
conditions under which adults are able to establish an effective normative
system governing the behavior of adolescents.
