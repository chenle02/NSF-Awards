9610097 Ramonde The 1997 Aspen Winter Conference will devote one week to
condensed matter physics. The focus will be on mesoscopic physics, reduced
dimensionality systems, and correlated electrons. The conference will be
interdisciplinary, and will bring together leading scientists from academia and
industry to critically assess the current level knowledge and what remains to be
learned in the future. NSF support will provide financial assistance to graduate
students and young scientists. %%% The 1997 Aspen Winter Conference will devote
