Research is proposed on 1) visualization of the diffusion monte carlo algorithm
as it is applied to He clusters and 2) calculations of the excited electronic
states of He clusters using a new monte carlo development. The calculations will
be treating many-body systems of up to 300 degress of freedom and will examine
the computational issues associated with parallelization of the needed
algorithm.
