The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enhance scientific
and technological understanding in the power electronics industry and has the
potential to improve performance, electrical efficiency, and provide space and
cost savings. This control-based solution will provide a new option for the
power electronics community at a time when electronic devices are increasing in
complexity and experiencing greater performance demands. There are numerous
applications for this technology, including consumer electronics, smartphones,
portable computers, telecommunications equipment, servers and data centers,
electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and defense applications. The
technology is power level agnostic, and can be applied to chip (semiconductor)
devices as well as high voltage grid power systems. For these sectors, energy
consumption, cost and the physical size of the power circuitry are of paramount
concern. Even the smallest reduction in these areas is highly sought
after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
I project seeks to improve efficiency, save space, and lower the overall cost of
power circuitry by eliminating power architectures composed of multiple
converters and replacing them with high performance multiple-output converters,
converters that can do the job of 2-4 individual converters. Currently, power
architectures in electronic equipment use multiple individual converters,
sometimes as many as 60-100 depending on the application. Other attempts at
multiple-output converters have been extremely complicated designs with low
performance. This approach focuses on the mathematical fundamentals of power
conversion by creating a new power control methodology that simultaneously
controls each voltage output, while also providing high stability and
performance. This research is expected to produce a 3 output digitally
controlled buck converter that uses a single inductor and has better electrical
efficiency, requires less space, and costs less than 3 separate converters.
