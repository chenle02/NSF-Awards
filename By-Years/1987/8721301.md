It is proposed to continue theoretical and observational studies of relating to
very long period seismic data with emphasis on the following: (a) The
implementation of computer codes to generate synthetic seismograms (or spectra)
for coupled sets of multiplets; (b) The extension of such codes to calculate
partial derivative seismograms corresponding to generalized splitting function
coefficients; (c) Application of the (b) to the inverse problem of estimating
these coefficients from seismic data; (d) The continuation of theoretical
studies of asymptotic approximations to coupled splitting theory; (e) Systematic
testing of these approximations using codes developed in (a).
