The research will extend work on information processing in organizations
including (a) a model of real-time hierarchical resource allocation that
distinguishes between and exhibits decentralized information processing and
decentralized decisionmaking, (b) models of markets as systems for aggregating
information and calculating allocations, comparing the computational efficiency
of various market an bureaucratic mechanisms, (c) models of the relationships
between incentive constraints and information processing constraints, (d) models
of strategic interactions between autonomous organizations each of which is
controlled by multiple boundedly-rational agents, and (e) to provide foundations
for modeling bounded rationality and learning in dynamic settings. The primary
approach to be used in this project is modeling the process of multi-agent
decisionmaking in organizations as real-time decentralized control.
