This award provides renewed partial support for the continuing activities of the
Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the Commission on Physical
Sciences, Mathematics, and Resources. BCST is the principal vehicle of the
National Research Council for addressing issues specific to biochemistry,
chemistry, chemical engineering, and related disciplines. Chaired by Drs. George
M. Whitesides and Edward A. Mason, with twenty-one members broadly knowledgeable
in chemistry, chemical engineering, related sciences, and the administration of
research in academic, industrial, and government laboratories, BCST organizes
and provides oversight to a number of important study committees. These
activities produce reports of considerable importance to the Foundation and
which are made available to the public without restriction.
