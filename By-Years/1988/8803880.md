Southern University A&amp;M-Baton Rouge is being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
for outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced
research chemists. For the summer of 1988, the program will support 8 students
recruited from Southern University A&amp;M and other institutions. Research
activities will include studies in the following areas: o Dealkylation of amines
with sodium bisulfite o UV study of unsaturated amines o Kinetics of ester
hydrolysis o Synthesis of bridged annulenes o Effect of hydrogen bonding on the
viscosity of coal liquids o Platinum(II) hydrides in homogeneous catalysis o
Chitin and Chitosan derivatives o Synthesis of porphyrins
