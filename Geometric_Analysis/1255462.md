The PI is inspired by some ambitious rigidity conjectures, such as (1) the
Lorentzian Lichnerowicz Conjecture and its generalizations; (2) an "Open-Dense"
Conjecture for certain geometric structures; and (3) the Smooth Cannon
Conjecture. The PI and her collaborators have developed new dynamical techniques
in the setting of Cartan geometries that have been quite effective toward
proving results supporting conjectures (1) and (2). Recent results and some
current work of the PI, however, indicate that these conjectures do not hold in
the broad generality originally speculated. For many of these questions,
Lorentzian manifolds seem to be the borderline cases. The following additional
question has an affirmative answer in the Lorentzian case, but is open in higher
signatures: (4) is a compact, flat, pseudo-Riemannian manifold always complete?
The PI's plan is to work towards settling conjectures (1)-(4), by proof or
counterexample.

The PI works in pseudo-Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry, an area of
mathematics that that underlies general relativity and the physics of spacetime.
Isometries or conformal transformations of Lorentzian manifolds correspond to
conservation laws in physics, and they feature in most models of spacetime.
Conjectures (1) and (2) above arise from an ambitious program, initiated by
Zimmer and Gromov in the 1980s, to classify group actions on manifolds
preserving differential-geometric structures. Conjecture (3) appears in Gromov's
fundamental work on delta-hyperbolic groups, and (4) is an important case of the
Markus Conjecture on flat affine manifolds. The educational component of the
project comprises (a) further development of writing workshops for DC area math
graduate students; (b) involving undergraduates in summer research projects
related to topic (2) above; and (c) advising graduate and undergraduate students
in the Directed Reading Program at the University of Maryland.
