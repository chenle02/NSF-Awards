The study of algebraic number fields, mathematical objects obtained from the
solutions of polynomials with integer coefficients, is a very active area of
research in number theory. Associated to each algebraic number field, there is
an invariant, the class group, that measures the complexity of the number field
structure. While computation of the class group is hard in general, numerical
evidence suggests that the class group is "random" when ranging over a
reasonable family of number fields, and this randomness behavior is studied in a
recently active area ? arithmetic statistics. One way to study this random
invariant is to construct a random model which contains key parameters and use
the model to simulate the distributions of class groups. This project will
explore various questions about the constructions of such random models and
their applications. The project also provides support for an undergraduate
research experience.   The research in this project is at the intersection of
algebraic number theory, arithmetic statistics, group theory, and probability
theory. The PI and her collaborators have produced a series of works on the non-
abelian Cohen--Lenstra heuristics to give reasonable conjectures to predict the
distributions of the Galois groups of the maximal unramified extensions of
global fields (which are non-abelian generalizations of class groups). In
particular, the non-abelian random group models constructed in this work play an
important role in connecting the Galois objects with their arithmetic
statistics. The PI plans to continue working along this direction, which
includes: deeply studying the Galois structures of unramified extensions,
proving properties of the Galois structure that are implied by the new
arithmetical statistical heuristics, and studying how the random group models
are affected by removing some restrictions in previous work. Explicitly, this
project has three key goals: 1) modify the non-abelian Cohen?Lenstra heuristics
in the case when the base field contains roots of unity; 2) study how the
signature of the base field affects the distribution, and 3) generalize Gerth's
conjecture.
