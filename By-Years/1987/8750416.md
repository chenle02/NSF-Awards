A new astronomical observatory at Middlebury to be equipped through this project
will provide undergraduate students at all levels with an outstanding experience
in observational astronomy. A professional quality, computer-controlled 16-inch
reflecting telescope will be used to introduce beginning astronomy students to
planets, stars, and galaxies. More experienced students will use this telescope
for photometry and photography in conjunction with astronomy courses, while
undergraduate thesis students will use it for research projects studying
variable stars or developing new instrumentation. Three new 8-inch telescopes
will be used in lower-level astronomy courses to give students a far greater
opportunity for observational work than has previously been possible. The new
telescopes and associated instruments will enrich the entire astronomy
curriculum at Middlebury College. In addition, the new observatory will become a
community resource through public viewing nights and programs for students in
elementary and secondary schools.
