This is a group travel project in which twelve scientist, six from Europe and
six from the U.S. will participate in a workshop in the area of queueing
networks with finite capacity. This will be the first international workshop
ever to be held on this important topic, and it will take place at North
Carolina State University, on May 20-21, 1988. The subject matter of this
workshop deals with performance modelling of finite resources as used in
computer systems, computer communication networks, and flexible manufacturing
systems. There is a crying need for a workshop on this topic. This is because,
in the recent years there have been significant advances in the state- of-the
art in this area. However, not enough time is allocated to this topic at the
regular meetings of the relevant professional societies. The objectives of this
workshop are: a) to provide the opportunity to researchers who work in this area
to present their latest research. b) to foster co-operation between researchers,
minimize unnecessary duplication, and identify new long-term research
objectives. c) to educate or bring up-to-date other researchers who work in
other areas of computer and communication performance modelling. d) to provide a
comprehensive set of proceedings (the first ever in this research area).
Approximately 50 scientists will attend this workshop.
