This award supports the fundamental study of a new mode of operation for
internal combustion engines, made possible through the use of a free piston
engine. In a standard automobile engine, the piston positions are fixed by the
crankshaft angle. In a free piston engine the piston motions are independently
controlled. This control can be used to significantly improve engine efficiency
and to accommodate a large variety of alternative fuels. This project could
enable a modular, clean and highly efficient power source for hybrid vehicles,
and enable the wide use of renewable fuels. Because transportation accounts for
about thirty percent of the national energy consumption, these advances could
have a major beneficial impact on energy independence and environmental quality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to investigate the dynamics and
the optimization of a new combustion mode: trajectory-based homogeneous charge
compression ignition (HCCI) combustion enabled by the free piston engine. With a
free piston engine, the piston motion can be controlled in real-time to actively
regulate the cylinder volume, and thereby adjust the gas pressure-temperature
history prior, during, and after the combustion event. This extra degree of
freedom enables the in-cycle real-time optimization of the chemical reactivity
and heat transfer processes of the HCCI combustion. To achieve the above
objective, fundamental properties of the in-cylinder processes need to be
investigated to gain insights of the influence of the unconstrained gas
pressure-temperature history. Both chemical kinetics driven model and control
oriented model will be developed to predict the effect of the piston trajectory
on the efficiency and emissions of HCCI combustion. On this basis, optimization
methods will be developed to achieve the maximum attainable fuel efficiency and
emissions benefits by designing the optimal piston trajectory. Experimental work
on a prototype free piston engine and a rapid compression and expansion machine
will help to validate the modeling and optimization results.
