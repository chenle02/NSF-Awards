New rich data sets that include individual firm and household data have become
available to help central banks and researchers better monitor and analyze the
total economy. These data sets allow researchers to establish causal effects of
policy changes. These new data sources have brought increased power and
transparency to the analyses of business cycles and economic policy; however,
existing econometric methods do not allow researchers to take full advantage of
these improved data sets to fully analyze the aggregate economy. This research
project will develop new econometric methods that will allow researchers and
central banks to fully use these new types of data to explain how the larger
economy interacts with individual firms and households and how these
relationships change over time. The results of this research will improve
economic policy making and monitoring of the national economy and thus increase
economic growth and improve the livings standards of Americans.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal consists of three projects to
develop methods for analyzing new macroeconomic data. The first project
considers semi-structural identification of the importance of different economic
shocks using instrumental variables. The project shows that forecast variance
decompositions and historical decompositions are partially- or point-identified
under weaker conditions than the "invertibility" assumption required by existing
methods. The second project considers moment matching inference in structural
models. Researchers know the variances of matched moments, whereas the
correlation structure of moments arising from disparate sources is often
unknown. The project demonstrates that it is still possible to perform valid
inference and compute an optimal weighting of the moments. The third project
considers full-information estimation of heterogeneous agent models using both
micro and macro data. The project devises a general method for a fully efficient
Bayesian inference in the presence of unobserved aggregate states that affect
cross-sectional distributions. The results of this research will improve
economic policy making and thus increase economic growth and livings standards
of Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
