It is currently unknown when the Earth?s magnetic field originated. This timing
has major implications for the thermal evolution of the interior, the physics of
dynamo action, and the evolution of the terrestrial atmosphere. Paleomagnetic
studies of the oldest known unmetamorphosed rocks indicate that a field with
intensity similar to that of the present existed at least 3.5 billion years (Ga)
ago. Here we describe a project that could potentially determine its time of
origin and earliest evolution. Detrital zircon crystals found in sandstones from
the Jack Hills of Western Australia are the oldest known earthly materials.
Ranging from 3.0-4.38 Ga in age, they may preserve a record of the origin of
Earth?s geodynamo. Some of these zircons carry an extremely weak remanent
magnetization. Depending on their thermal and alteration histories, the Jack
Hills zircons may therefore provide the earliest known paleointensity records of
the Earth?s field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will conduct research that will
help determine the time when the Earth's magnetic field began. This is important
for understanding how the planet has evolved over time. The PIs plan to share
theirr results in public lectures at local science museums and as part of
podcasts and local science festivals. They also plan to share results at
multidisciplinary conferences. The PIs will train MIT undergraduates in research
techniques. Finally, this project will further stimulate the development of next
generation paleomagnetism techniques for the analysis of extremely weakly
magnetic materials.
