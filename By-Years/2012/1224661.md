Science education reforms are focusing on active learning strategies that engage
students in the process of science. Science (the journal) is offering a unique
approach to transforming the undergraduate STEM learning environment, one that
introduces undergraduates to important elements of science: reading primary
research articles, communicating science, and engaging in a peer review system.
Through reading and deconstructing carefully selected scientific papers,
students gain an understanding of how scientists design their experiments and
present their results, allowing students to actively experience the logic of
getting from a set of data to a new conclusion. In addition, in their
publications scientists discuss how they have incorporated and confirmed the
results of other scientists, as well as where they disagree with prior
conclusions. They also mention what steps might be taken next, showing students
that there are still many unanswered questions. The PIs are working with a team
of expert scientists and educational researchers to develop these resources,
with the goal of providing students a deep understanding of how scientists
design experiments, gather and analyze data, and present their conclusions.
Science is thereby translating scientific papers into tools for learning,
essentially helping students assume the persona of the scientist. The goal is to
enable students to truly understand the scientific enterprise: science as a
powerful "way of knowing" about the world. The PI team is accomplishing this
goal through the use of online annotations, detailed explanations of scientific
figures and methods, and additional activities allowing students to work with
actual scientific data.
