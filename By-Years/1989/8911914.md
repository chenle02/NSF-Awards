The purpose of this research is to focus on the problem of international or
sovereign debt, and to develop a better understanding of the implications of the
various ways for restructuring debt in order to resolve the international debt
crisis. The project consists of three parts. The first examines the economic
efficiency implications of attempts by countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Chili
to alleviate their debt burden by repurchasing part of their foreign debt at
discount, or engaging in the exchange of equity issues for debt issues. The
second part explores the feasibility and desirability of creating a senior class
of sovereign debt. In contrast to corporate debt, sovereign debt treats all
classes of debt equally. Debt restructuring by offering seniority structures
will be examined within a dynamic bargaining framework. The third part of this
project will focus on state and local debt, which in many ways is much more
similar to sovereign than to corporate debt. By comparing sovereign to state and
local debt, it will be possible to explore several important sovereign- debt
issues. This project is important because it will provide new insights into ways
of mitigating or resolving the international debt crisis.
