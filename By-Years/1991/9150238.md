This is a comprehensive plan to deliver elementary science instruction
throughout rural Minnesota schools. It is modeled on the MN Public School System
plan which provides teachers with a hands-on, inquiry-based science curriculum
package and a centralized materials distribution network. Over a period of three
years, two teams of Master Teachers will provide workshops at each of the
Minnesota Educational Cooperative Service Units for approximated 900 elementary
and middle school teachers. Most of the participants in the program will then
work as District Trainers with their administrators to provide inservice in
science education within their schools and/or districts. A number of the
participants will be Regional Trainers who will function as science resource
persons in their respective regions, and who will work with the District
Trainers in providing local inservices. This proposal is appropriate for the
Teacher Enhancement Program because of its systemic plan to enhance the science
teaching of rural teachers in the state of Minnesota. Non-NSF cost-sharing is
approximately 2% of the amount requested from NSF.
