1. The proposed project covers several topics in
Probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics. The first group of questions is about
graph colorings.&lt;br/&gt;It mainly deals with the study of chromatic and
choice numbers of&lt;br/&gt;graphs satisfying certain local conditions. One of
the open problem&lt;br/&gt;which investigators will study is bounding the
chromatic number of a&lt;br/&gt;graph G with maximum degree d, which contains no
copy of a fixed graph&lt;br/&gt;H. A variant of this problem was posed already
twenty years ago by&lt;br/&gt;Komlos and Szemeredi and so far it was solved only
for some special&lt;br/&gt;cases. Investigator also plans to work on a few
related questions&lt;br/&gt;about vertex list coloring and acyclic edge coloring
of graphs.&lt;br/&gt;Another set of questions is about asymptotic properties of
random graphs&lt;br/&gt;and random regular graphs. Here investigators goal is to
understand&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of independent sets of nearly optimal size
in sparse&lt;br/&gt;random graphs, and use this to determine the asymptotic
behavior of&lt;br/&gt;its choice number. It is sometimes the case that an
existence proof,&lt;br/&gt;supplied by the probabilistic method, is not
sufficient and it is&lt;br/&gt;better to have an explicit construction. One of
the major open&lt;br/&gt;problems in this field is to construct exponentially
large graphs,&lt;br/&gt;without a clique or an independent set of size k. In
this project&lt;br/&gt;investigator intends to consider this problem together
with its&lt;br/&gt;bipartite version. He also plans to study the properties
of&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-random graphs and their
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Leave nothing to chance. This cliche
embodies the common belief&lt;br/&gt;that randomness has no place in carefully
planned methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;In modern Combinatorics at least, nothing can
be further from the&lt;br/&gt;truth. Here the Probabilistic Method has been
developed intensively&lt;br/&gt;and become one of the most powerful and widely
used tools.&lt;br/&gt;Use of probability proved to be helpful in tackling many
long&lt;br/&gt;standing open problems. Another major reason for the development
of&lt;br/&gt;this method is the important role of randomness in
Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;Computer Science. Here algorithm which make random choices
during its&lt;br/&gt;execution proved to be simplest and fastest for many
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
