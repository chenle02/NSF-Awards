9311043 Tenore, K. The Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) will develop a
facility and associated instrumentation for a state-of-the-art laboratory
designed to study physiology, bioenergetics, ecology and behavior of fishes and
invertebrates. The facility, which will allow research on all life stages of
these organisms, focuses principally on critical temperature and salinity
controls and on systems that will allow precise measurements of consumption,
metabolism, growth and behavior. Respirometers, swimming chambers, controlled
environmental tanks, a dosing apparatus, and behavior observation systems are
the principal items of the laboratory. A dry lab preparation area and computer
monitoring and control center will also be provided. The laboratory will be a
multiuser, ecophysiology center available to scientists, graduate students, and
visiting scientists in several disciplines. The systems and instruments will
significantly enhance the range of research and training programs at CBL and
will be a unique facility in the region available to visiting/collaborating
investigators. The CBL will cost-share in the development of the proposed
facility and its specific systems, most of which will be constructed on site.
When completed, the ecophysiology laboratory will be a major contributor to the
success of CBL's mission in its three programmatic areas: Ecosystem Studies,
Fisheries Science/Ecology, and Environmental Chemistry/Toxicology. ***
