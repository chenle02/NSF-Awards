Professor David Farrelly of Utah State University is being supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program. The focus of this research is
to investigate ultrahigh molecular Rydberg states that are typically excited in
zero-electron kinetic-energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy. These Rydberg states might
also be used to probe the dynamics of superfluid clusters containing impurity
ions from seeding in beam experiments. Such states lie at the correspondence
principle limit of quantum mechanics. This research will develop semiclassical
theories to describe the coupling between molecular core and Rydberg electronic
degrees of freedom. New adiabatic approximations will be developed to describe
the dynamics of such systems as well as the interactions with external electric
and or magnetic fields using complex coordinate methods. Studies of atoms and
molecules in unusual situations, are of critical importance to the advancement
of the chemical and physical sciences. The superfluid state in particular
continues to have an enormous impact on technology and communications. Recently
emphasis has been directed to `nanotechnology` in which devices are constructed
that exploit the fact that the physics of very small structures can be dominated
by quantum effects not visible in the bulk. This research will advance the
understanding of such single (or few) electron spectroscopies in the context of
elucidating the superfluid transition in finite size samples.
