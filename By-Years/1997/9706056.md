9706056 Laske This research involves a new global and regional analysis of
seismic anisotropy using surface wave data. The results of this study are
expected to shed light on the nature of large-scale and medium-scale flow
patterns in the oceanic mantle. The compatibility of the data with anisotropy
models developed for the continental lithosphere using shear-wave splitting data
will also be studied. It has been several years since the last large-scale study
of anisotropy using surface waves and the potential datasets have expanded
tremendously in the intervening time. The critical feature which distinguishes
this study from previous studies is the use of particle motion information as
well as phase to discriminate anisotropic effects from those of lateral
heterogeneities. ***
