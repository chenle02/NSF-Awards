Mineralogy is the inaugural course in the geoscience curriculum, but typically
presents major obstacles to learning, and may not be relevant to the
contemporary needs of students or society-at-large. This training workshop is
designed to develop a variety of hands-on, discovery-oriented laboratory
exercises. The goals of the workshop are to develop new materials to make
mineralogy more accessible and relevant to our students, and to develop these
exercises in accord with modern learning theory. Five different types of
learning activities are included: field experiences, "dry labs" (mineral
identification, crystal structures), "wet labs" (experimental exercises such as
crystal growing), analytical exercises (using XRD and SEM), and computer-
assisted learning (modelling programs). Selected workers present model
activities at the workshop; the other participants rotate through 16-20 of these
new lab exercises at the workshop. All participants develop at least one new
exercise, and these are to be field tested at the home institutions during the
following semester. These exercises will be compiled and submitted for
publication by the Mineralogical Society of America. The product of this
workshop will be a core of instructors trained in new instructional methods and
materials, and a laboratory workbook of new exercises that may be used by all
students in the geosciences.
