This school maintains a well-equipped manufacturing laboratory containing both
manual and computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools. However, while
these machines are well suited for discrete production of parts, they do not
provide a continuous process that can be run, altered and monitored.
Consequently, laboratory efforts in statistical process control (SPC), process
monitoring, and design of experiments (DOE) are unfortunately artificial. In
light of today's increasingly competitive manufacturing environment, it is
essential that engineering students are well trained in the entire manufacturing
process and exposed to state-of-the-art process monitoring and control during
their education. Such exposure enables them to more effectively make the
transition from student to practicing engineer. This project has obtained some
important components to an existing CNC lathe in the manufacturing laboratory
that will allow a production run of process to be executed. These components
include a wire straightener/cut-off machine and a pneumatic bar feeder. These
two pieces of equipment allow the department's Cincinnati Milacron Talon CNC
Lathe to be run in a production mode. A simple part program for a rotational
element (e.g., a screw or an electrical terminal) can now be run for hundreds of
pieces without human intervention. Students have access to a "process" that can
be periodically sampled as part of an SPC exercise, disturbed as part of a DOE
exercise or continuously monitored as part of a metrology exercise.
