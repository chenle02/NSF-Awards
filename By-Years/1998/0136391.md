0136391 Banerjee This award provides support to a symposium on Sustainable
Industrial Development: Energy and Material Exchange and Optimization through
Eco-Industrial Networks to be hosted by the Center for Economic Development of
the University of Southern California. The purpose of the symposium is three
fold: (1) to bring together experts from the public and private sectors to
discuss by-product optimization through application of state-of-the-art benign
manufacturing, advanced environmental technologies and eco-industrial processes;
(2) to identify cutting-edge environmental technologies and benign manufacturing
processes that convert wastes into value-added products that will facilitate new
job creation and business development and (3) to facilitate inter-disciplinary
dialogue and information sharing leading to the development of a research agenda
that focuses on increasing industry's competitiveness in the global
market.&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Economic Development will post papers and
presentations from the Symposium on its website. In addition, the National
Association of Management and Technical Assistance Center (NAMTAC) will assist
by disseminating findings from the Symposium to a diverse group of member
organizations, including business, economic development and technical assistance
providers.&lt;br/&gt;Co-Chairs of this symposium are Dr. Tridib Banerjee,
Professor at the School of Policy, Planning and Development and Dr, Mansour
Rahimi, Associate Professor at the School of Engineering, both at USC.
