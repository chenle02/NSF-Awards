This proposal is to provide partial support for a Topical workshop in Miami
which will bring experimentalists and theorists together to discuss new
developments in LHC related physics, dark energy, dark matter as well as new
theoretical ideas in AdS/CFT and Gravity. The workshop will be held in Miami in
December and the funds requested will be for the support of students and young
post-docs who otherwise would not be able to attend. The experimental talks will
focus on Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Neutrino Physics and LHC detectors and
planned experiments. The Theory talks will be centered on the &lt;br/&gt;Anti-
deSitter Space- Conformal Field theory connection first suggested by Klebanov
and &lt;br/&gt;Maldacena (both are giving talks) and which has been very
fruitful in improving our understanding of strongly coupled QCD especially the
quark-gluon plasma as well as various properties the spectra of QCD. Recent
developments of this correspondence as well as more general talks on recent
advances in theoretical particle physics will be discussed at this
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
