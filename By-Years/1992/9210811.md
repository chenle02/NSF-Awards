In this research project, the module-theoretic approach applied to multi-
variable poles and zeros is used in the context of robotics and aircraft control
applications. The major emphasis is on developing a new unified approach to
intertwine module -theoretic research and modern control system theory. It
combines work in the area of commutative algebra with applications in feedback
theory. Utilizing this method avoids the necessity of imposing restrictive
assumptions on system minimality, causality and squareness. An intense software
study of specific examples relevant to the methodology is included in the
research project.*** //
