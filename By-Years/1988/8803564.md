The Board on Earth Sciences provides oversight of solid-earth activities within
the National Research Council. This action provides partial support of the core
activities of the Board and four of its principal continuing committees -- the
U.S. Geodynamics Committee, the Committee on Seismology, the Committee on
Geodesy and the U.S. National Committee. It is expected that the Board will
produce reports assessing the health of the science and identifying major
research opportunities and applications.
