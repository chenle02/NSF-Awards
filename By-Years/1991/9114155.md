A study of the climatology of the tropical oceans, focusing on the Atlantic and
the Indian oceans, will be continued using archived data from ships of
opportunity and satellites. It is hypothesized that the Sea Surface Temperature
(SST) dipole in the Equatorial Atlantic is responsible for the observed decadal
variability of rainfall in Africa and South America.
