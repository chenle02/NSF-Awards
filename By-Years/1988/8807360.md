This investigation will continue the study of cellular control models. There
are three main areas of study in this project. First, the principal investigator
will extend his analysis of compartmental models which include both time delays
and spatial effects. These models are studied to show the stability of the
differential equations describing the biological system. The second area of
study details a model for the initiation of replication at OriC in E. coli. The
model, which is based on biochemical kinetics, is being developed in conjunction
with ongoing experiments. The final problem is to examine a linear delay
differential equation with two time delays. For fixed delays the bifurcation
surface is examined with respect to the coefficient parameters. For all three
problems the project will be applicable to broad classes of equations that occur
in modeling certain biological and physical phenomena.
