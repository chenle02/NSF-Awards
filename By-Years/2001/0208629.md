The research in this proposal aims to advance fundamental&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of
routing methods that trade off optimality in return for&lt;br/&gt;space, time,
locality, fault-tolerance, and adaptability to changing&lt;br/&gt;network
topology. The study of multi-criteria routing problems is
also&lt;br/&gt;commenced, where for even the most natural and simply-stated
multi-criteria&lt;br/&gt;routing problems, there are typically only heuristics
known. The goal&lt;br/&gt;is to produce methods that trade off some optimality
of the solution&lt;br/&gt;in returned for lowered computational resurces, in a
quantifiable way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximate shortest-paths, compact
routing, and distance labeling&lt;br/&gt;problems will be studied, along with
their extensions to directed&lt;br/&gt;networks, dynamic networks, and multi-
criteria formulations &lt;br/&gt;incorporating different tradeoffs of time and
space with measures of&lt;br/&gt;risk and reliability.
