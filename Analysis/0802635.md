Diffusion (or inference) geometries , provide tools for organization of massive
digital data sets. Like differential calculus, they are used to build global
inference relations between objects by combining ``infinitesimal" (linear)
models. Harmonic analysis on such structures leads to multiscale folder building
paradigms leading to powerful tools for functional regression and analysis of
massive complex data. These geometric methods provide new insights in classical
differential geometry enabling explicit embedding theorems and coordinate
systems for Riemannian manifolds.

The multiscale analytic methods lead to a systematic analysis tool for seemingly
unstructured data bases, and enables the automatic generation of Ontologies and
data induced languages. These methods are broadly applicable in medical
diagnostics, in the organization and analysis of psychological questionnaires,
as well as in all aspects of machine learning from data mining to machine
vision.
