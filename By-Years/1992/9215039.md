The University of California at Davis is in the process of designing an
earthquake simulator for their National Geotechnical Centrifuge (NGC). The
purpose of this award is to support a three-person committee to oversee the
design of this simulator. The committee members consist of a geotechnical
engineer having expertise in the design, installation and operation of an
earthquake simulator having the same operational principle as the one being
designed; a structural engineer with expertise in the dynamics of structures,
especially with respect to statistical aspects of the analysis and performance;
and a mechanical engineer experienced in the design and analysis of rotating
devices, including motors and drive systems. The oversight involves technical
studies and selected experiments, some of which are performed by the committee,
and some by the University of California at Davis. The goals of this committee
are to: (a) Examine the operational conditions and capabilities of the NGC
through calculations of the modal shapes and frequencies of the entire system;
as well as through selected experiments using the instrumented centrifuge; (b)
Assess the capabilities of the proposed earthquake simulator, acting alone; (c)
Examine through experiment and numerical simulations the interaction of the
mounted simulator with the other centrifuge components; (d) Integrate the above
results to assess the expected shaking performance of the system with the
centrifuge rotating, the repeatability and reliability of the motions generated,
the safety of the facility, and the effect of the operation of the shaking
system on the fatigue life of the centrifuge.
