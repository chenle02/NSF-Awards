This proposal describes an interdisciplinary research project whose principal
objective is to extend the computational frontiers of control and system theory.
A hierarchy of computational considerations is outlined, ranging from small-
order problems to large-order problems. Recent analytic techniques which
demonstrate numerical limitations of standard algorithms for the former will be
improved and extended. However, the principal research thrust will be towards
high-order problems for which rather few dependable numerical techniques
presently exist, particularly for problems arising from models in so-called
second-order matrix form. Such models arise naturally throughout most branches
of engineering and the sciences. It is proposed to extend various control and
system theory algorithms to exploit the special matrix structures available in
the ubiquitous second-order equations. Parallel algorithms and specialized
computing architectures offer promising opportunities to meet the challenge of
advanced control strategies for both on-line and off-line computations. By
examining problems of fundamental and generic interest (especially those
generated by second-order models), this project will contribute parallel
algorithms and software to support computations arising in problems ranging from
active control for high performance aircraft engines to vibration control for
large space structures to control of interconnected power systems. Such
applications will require at least an order of magnitude improvement in speed
and the size of problems solvable. Close attention will be paid to basic
numerical issues such as conditioning and stability; and implementation of
algorithms into reliable and robust software will facilitate effective
technology transfer to industry, government, and academia.
