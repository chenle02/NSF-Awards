This Major Research Instrumentation award will support a significant upgrade to
Adaptive Optics [AO] system on the 10 meter Keck II telescope in Hawaii. Keck
Observatory pioneered a new era of ground-based astronomy with a natural guide
star system in 1999 and was last upgraded - to a laser guide star system - in
2007. Adaptive optics allows ground-based telescopes to overcome distortions
induced by Earth's atmosphere and thereby achieve nearly the same spatial
resolution as a space-based telescope of similar size. The upgraded Keck II AO
system will enable a wide range of scientific studies and could serve as a
springboard for future advanced AO instrumentation within the larger
astronomical community. Keck Observatory provides telescope access to the
astronomical community through an open-access agreement and through extensive
collaborations with astronomers at their partner institutions. It plays a major
role in training the next generation of graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers, and they participate with other observatories in Hawaii in the
Akamai workforce initiative, which provides scientific and technical internship
opportunities to native Hawaiians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgrade will include
modern wave front sensor camera and a faster real-time controller computer. This
proposal builds on considerable related progress with the Keck AO systems, which
will have an even larger impact with the bandwidth improvement. These include
the implementation of a sodium- wavelength fiber laser and the launch of this
laser from behind the Keck telescope secondary mirror (to reduce perspective
elongation), and the current implementations of a near-infrared pyramid
wavefront sensor and an AO-fed single mode fiber feed to NIRSPEC (to support
exoplanet detection and characterization). The new hardware will provide a 1
magnitude sensitivity gain and allow the telescope to perform near its
diffraction limit.
