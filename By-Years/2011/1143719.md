Globally, peatlands cover 3-4 % of the Earth?s land surface, yet they store
25-30% of the world?s soil carbon (C) and 9-16% of the world?s soil nitrogen (N)
in peat. The cycling of C, and in particular the strength of the bog C sink,
changes dramatically and predictably as a function of time since fire. However,
understanding of how N cycling changes in bogs as a function of time since fire
is unknown. This is a Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award to support a project
to study carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)cycling at Utikuma Bog, in western Alberta
Canada. The site represents an unique opportunity for research on linked bog N
and C cycling in light of the recent wildfire activity which decimated the site,
the historically low atmospheric N deposition (<1 kg/ha/yr), which anchors the
site as a global end-member in the spectrum of atmospheric N deposition, and
because of the large stores of C found in Canadian peatlands.

Peatlands of the boreal forest are vital to global terrestrial N and C balances,
and the vulnerability of the large amounts of N and C stored in peat deposits
has both science and policy implications. With RAPID funding to initiate
investigations at the burned Utikuma Bog, this project is expected to transform
current understanding of bog N cycling, which has largely ignored the potential
ramifications of fire in boreal bogs of western Canada. The project will also
support one M.S. student at Villanova University and one undergraduate lab/field
assistant.
