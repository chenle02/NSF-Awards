There is little systematic information available regarding the relation of young
children's facility with language and their ability to organize and remember
events that they personally experience. Previous research has indicated that
children learn from parents how to talk about remembered events, and that the
more `story-like` such talk is, the better remembered events are. This project
uses an entertaining game with preschool children to determine how language used
to talk about the event before, during, or after the experience affects the
child's memory for the experience, both in its general organization and specific
aspects, such as the particular objects and actions that were involved. The
studies will address general theoretical issues of memory processing and
specific issues of the development of memory in early childhood, the beginnings
of autobiographical memory (or a self-history), and the role language plays in
reinstating memory for an event. In one set of studies, preschool children (3-5
years) are engaged in an interesting episode of a treasure hunt game. Different
groups of these children have either a verbal or nonverbal reinstatement session
two weeks later, and memory for the original event is tested for all groups,
including controls who had no reinstatement session, in a recall session 8 weeks
later. Other studies will use a similar paradigm to test effects of narratives
during the episode (present talk) and narratives prior to the episode (future
talk). These studies are designed to determine the relation between children's
language competence, particularly their competence in extended discourse and
narrative production, to the organization of and their memory for personally
experienced events. The outcome of this investigation will have important
implications for such issues as the dependability of children's memory, for
educational programs, and for resolving basic questions in memory development
such as the beginnings of autobiographical memory and self history.
