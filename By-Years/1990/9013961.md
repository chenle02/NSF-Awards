The pressures of international economic competition and the changes in eastern
Europe increase the importance of planning for conversion of our defense economy
to civilian work. Engineers are among those who are most likely to be involved
in conversion issues and to affect the conversion process in a number of
industries, such as electronics, aerospace, transportation equipment, and
instruments. This workshop project will address the range of issues -- ethical,
social, economic, and technical - - which engineers confront as they consider
roles in the economic conversion process. A research team will guide this
project. The approach is to examine these issues through discussion of prepared
presentations by academic researchers and practicing engineers from the defense
industry in a workshop which includes representatives from a range of
engineering societies. The findings will be synthesized by means of discussion
in the workshop and by the work of the research team immediately following the
conference. The research team plans four products for dissemination: a synthesis
of papers in the proceedings and three monographs, one on research needs, one on
policy implications, and one on implications for engineering education. Members
of American Engineers for Social Responsibility and representatives of five
other engineering professional societies will play a leading role in
disseminating these products to appropriate members of congressional committees
and federal agencies, as well as to their members. This proposal is a reasonable
request for support to enable leading scholars and practitioners to begin to
address ethical issues as well as practical problems for engineers in the
conversion process. The principal investigator and research team are well
qualified; institutional support is very good; the workshop plans are careful
and appropriately meshed with related activities; dissemination is likely to be
broad and to reach a variety of audiences. Support is highly recommended.
