This Inter-American Materials Collaboration between the groups of A. Lachgar at
Wake Forest University and M. A. Munoz at the Autonomous University of Morelos,
Mexico, focuses on the synthesis of hybrid inorganic-organic materials involving
multifunctional ligands, octahedral and cubic metal or inorganic clusters. One
type of compounds investigated is molybdenum chalcogenide cluster compounds,
commonly referred to as "Chevrel phases", with extended frameworks based on
Mo6X8 -L -M -L -Mo6X8 bridges (L = conjugated bidentate ligands; M = transition
metal). Electronic and magnetic interactions between a redox active transition
metal centers such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Cu, and the polarizable molybdenum
cluster Mo6X8 are expected to lead to interesting physical and chemical
properties. A second system investigated is hybrid inorganic-organic materials
that have cubic cages with a central core M4O12P4 (M = Al, Ga) connected with
phosphorus-based ligands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US team will
prepare the precursors of the cluster units Mo6X8 and excise them in solution,
the Mexican team will focus on the preparation of existing cubic alumino and
galophosphonates, multidentate ligands and phosphonates, and the combination of
the inorganic and organic parts to form the hybrid products will be carried out
by the two groups. It is anticipated that this study will provide a framework
for the investigators to educate a number of graduate and undergraduate students
in the interdisciplinary field of solid-state hybrid inorganic-organic materials
that involves a number of synthesis and characterization methods necessary to
any well trained materials chemist. This award is supported by the Division of
Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
