With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University will acquire a set of ultrafast
lasers and associated instrumentation to build the experimental capability in a
new Center for Chemical Dynamics (CCD). This equipment will allow researchers to
pursue a large number of state-of-the-art experiments in photophysical and
photochemical research. Addition of the new instrumentation in the CCD is
expected to impact important research areas such as proteomics, photodynamic and
other therapeutic designs, chemical biology, molecular electronics and
computing, photo- and electroactive materials, and nanomaterials. The
instrumentation will be used in formal and informal laboratory settings to
engage undergraduate students at Case in research-quality, time-resolved
spectroscopy of photoactive systems. In the future, this undergraduate research
initiative will be expanded to bring students at other institutions to the CCD
for summer programs. These efforts will provide research experience at the
undergraduate level through senior capstone projects and traditional
undergraduate research (initially, 30-40 BS and BA Chemistry majors per year at
Case).

Ultrafast laser spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of molecular information.
Many chemical and biological processes occur on the femtosecond time scale,
including electron transfer, photochemical reactions, and molecular energy
dynamics. The CCD is a new effort at Case to foster world-class research into
chemical dynamics in its central applications to the physical sciences,
engineering and biomedical fields.
