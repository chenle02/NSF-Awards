This award establishes a new Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site in
Soft Materials at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of
Pennsylvania State University. The program aims to train undergraduate students
with knowledge, perspective, and teamwork experience to inspire them to pursue
advanced degrees and careers in Engineering and Science disciplines. Each year,
eleven undergraduate students are recruited nationally to work closely with
faculty mentors across Materials Science, Chemical Engineering and Chemistry
departments in computational and experimental research projects. Research is
organized around polymers, biological macromolecules and self-assembled bio-
structures which have potential use in pharmaceutical, agricultural and other
industries. In addition to student research projects, the program includes
seminars on research topics, guidance on career development, informal social
activities to promote interaction among peers and with mentors, and final
symposium where REU students present their research results. This REU site is
envisioned as nucleating a "center-of-excellence for undergraduate research" in
the field of soft materials while strengthening the education and research
experience of future science and engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site
is funded by the NSF Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;
