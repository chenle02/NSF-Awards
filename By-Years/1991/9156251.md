This project advances educational reform in undergraduate science by taking an
interdisciplinary approach in which students create their own scientific
community. The project plan emphasizes student participation in experimental
science and represents an extension of the principles of discovery- oriented
learning. The model of educational reform includes: instructor-generated
discovery laboratories, student-generated laboratories, the creation by students
of a Natural Science Database, a student-staffed Center for Science Discovery,
independent research and off-campus explorations. The project philosophy
complements that of the Ohio Mathematics/Science Discovery Project which deals
with K-12 educatiion and which is funded by the NSF under the Statewide Systemic
Initiative program. The project also embodies a detailed plan for assessment and
dissemination.
