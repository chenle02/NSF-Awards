This project concerns research in algebraic geometry, the study of polynomial
equations. The investigator works on the connections between the algebraic
properties of equations and the geometric properties of the spaces they define.
In particular, this research project uses syzygies to study fundamental
questions regarding Riemann surfaces, one of the most important classes of
geometric objects. The investigation of syzygies, or the relations amongst
equations, has long played a central role in algebra, with a history ranging
from 19th-century invariant theory to 21st-century theoretical physics.
Applications of this research include moduli spaces, matrix factorizations,
string theory, enumerative geometry, and mirror symmetry.

In more detail, the investigator is working on relating the algebraic invariants
associated to the extrinsic geometry of a Riemann surface embedded in projective
space to its intrinsic geometry. The relevant algebraic invariants are the Betti
numbers of the minimal free resolution of the coordinate ring, as defined by
Hilbert, whereas the intrinsic geometry is encoded in the invariants of Brill-
Noether theory. The investigator will explore longstanding fundamental
conjectures predicting precise relationships between these invariants. The
project investigates these conjectures and generalizations of them using several
new techniques such as intersection theory, the moduli space of curves, Hurwitz
space, and vector bundle techniques.
