The collaboration of Prof. Avignone in the International Germanium Experiment
(IGEX) is supported by this grant. The objective of IGEX is a determination of
the half-life for zero-neutrino double-beta decay in Ge-76 and, as a by-
product, measure precision spectra for two-neutrino double- beta decay which
will constitute a background for other exotic decays. The observation of zero-
neutrino double-beta decay would require the neutrino to have a finite mass and
the detectors in this experiment should be able to push the neutrino mass limit
well below 1 eV.
