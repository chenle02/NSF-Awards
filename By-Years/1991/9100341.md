The Machine Translation Summit is the third international meeting for exchange
of scientific, technological and user-oriented information on machine
translation. It is being held for the first time in the U.S. where there is
increasing research interest in the area. Further stimulation to the research
area will be achieved by including partial support for student participation
through scholarships. This meeting is jointly funded by the DARPA Speech and
Language effort.
