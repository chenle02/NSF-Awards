It is proposed to deploy a section of deep current meter moorings for two years
off Brazil near the Equatorto study the trans- equatorial flow of bottom in the
Western Atlantic as part of the World Oceans Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Deep
Basin Experiment. In addition to the current meter deployments, the PIs will
conduct a limited Hydrographic along the mooring line.
