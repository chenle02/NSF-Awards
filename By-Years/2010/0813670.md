How do societies change? This workshop brings together cultural and linguistic
anthropologists and sociolinguists to develop theoretical positions on the
causes and nature of linguistic and cultural change. In these fields, issues
having to do with contact and transformation have become central. Yet for all
the discussion of globalization, modernity, hybridity, syncretism and the like,
there is still little sustained theoretical work on the topic of change itself.

The workshop addresses this by bringing together scholars who in their
empirical research focus on different kinds of change processes and dynamics
(religious, political, economic, and linguistic), generating particular
theoretical explanations. Cultural anthropologists often attend to the endurance
of tradition or the nature of mixture. Linguistic anthropologists examine the
role played by language(s) and their ideologies in social and political change,
while sociolinguists focus on languages in contact and the role of variation in
change. This workshop aims to synthesize the strengths of these fields, and
contribute to the development of theories of the causes and types of cultural
and linguistic change. Another goal of the workshop is to produce an edited
volume on linguistic and cultural change that stimulates further work in this
area. Given the importance of the topic of change in the contemporary world, the
findings of this workshop will be of interest not only to anthropologists and
linguists, but also to other social scientists and those with a policy
background who are engaged in trying to understand social transformation.
