This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
interactive materials science/engineering laboratory kit for use in basic
materials courses which are a feature of all engineering programs, particularly
in Civil and Mechanical engineering. The kit will include test bars fabricated
from advanced polymeric composites which are an important group of new materials
of increasing interest. Specifically, the kit will allow students to compare
theoretical strength and actual strength of these different high technology
materials, and the ready-to-use test bars will help students better understand
the strength characteristics of linear elastic brittle materials such as
ceramics. The educational product of this project has a broad and sustainable
market particularly because the product is consumed in use and repeat sales will
be a necessity.
