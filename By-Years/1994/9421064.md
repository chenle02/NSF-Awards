921064 The purpose of this research is to reveal the lexical-recognition
competencies of normal human infants during the second six months of postnatal
development. The focus of the research is on the perceptual and memory abilities
required for the segmentation and extraction of words (or wordlength units) from
fluent maternal speech prior to the onset-age of vocal production. A new
familiarization-preference (F-Pref) technique has been developed to assess
infants' sensitivities to words. This technique involves a brief familiarization
period (30-45 seconds) during which infants are presented with target words (or
non-words) embedded in sentences and subsequently tested for recognition of
those words in isolation compared to non-familiar words. Postfamiliarization
recognition is revealed by longer listening times to familiar over non-familiar
words. This technique will be used to explore further the conditions under which
7 to 8 month old infants are able to extract words from fluent speech when the
surrounding acoustic, phonetic, and language-specific contexts are varied, when
speaking rate is altered, and when the frequency of pauses is manipulated during
the familiarization period. In addition to these primary questions, we will also
attempt to extend the F-Pref technique to infants in the first six months of
postnatal development (using simplified procedures), and to older infants in an
attempt to reveal the emergence of semantic priming in infancy. Because the
segmentation, extraction, and memory for words embedded in fluent speech is a
necessary precursor to the formation of a lexicon, these experiments should
reveal a fundamental capacity of infants in the early stage of language
acquisition when comprehension is thought to be superior to production.
