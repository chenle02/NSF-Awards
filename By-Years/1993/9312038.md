In an effort to gain the community's interest in and awareness of the need to
increase the participation of women in CISE disciplines, the Computing Research
Association (CRA) is being funded to present a one day and one evening symposium
for 200 undergraduate and graduate female students. The National Science
Foundation's CISE Directorate has established a goal that 45% of graduate
students in CISE disciplines will be women by the year 2000. The symposium,
which is one of a number of activities being recommended by CISE, is to be held
on May 22nd. and 23rd., 1993 in Washington, D.C. The students will be studying
in CISE areas and will be nominated by their institutions. The CRA is an
association of U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and
Computer Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing
research. The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research
community and to support and promote its interests. Dr. Weingarten is the
Executive Director of CRA.
