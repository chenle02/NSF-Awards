The investigator will conduct research on the problems lying on the interface
between continuum physics and the theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation
laws. One project will involve employing the method of generalized
characteristics to study regularity, large time behavior and propagation of
singularities in solutions of quasilinear hyperbolic systems that may or may not
be in conservative form. Another project will consist of a systematic study of
the admissibility of wave fans in systems of conservation laws, modeling
specific physical phenomena, in which the issue of admissibility is still
unresolved either due to the presence of phase boundaries or because strict
hyperbolicity fails. Finally, a third project will involve considering
hierarchies of systems of conservation laws, like those generated by the
Boltzmann equation or through "extended thermodynamics," and studying the
process by which simpler theories are embedded as special or limiting cases into
more complex ones. Continuum physics is founded on balance laws and constitutive
relations. The former determine the framework of the theory (for example,
mechanics, thermodynamics, electrodynamics) while the latter identify the type
of the continuous medium (for example, elastic, viscoelastic, solid, fluid). The
problems here concern media with "elastic" response in which case the
combination of balance laws and constitutive relations leads to quasilinear
hyperbolic systems, commonly known as hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.
Despite considerable progress in the study of such systems over the past 25
years, the basic goal of establishing existence, uniqueness, regularity and
large time behavior of admissible solutions has only been achieved partially in
the case of one space dimension and remains entirely unfulfilled in higher space
dimensions. Progress in the field requires understanding a combination of
continuum physics, mathematical analysis, and scientific computation.
