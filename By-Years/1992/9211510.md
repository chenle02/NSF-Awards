The discipline of timing management is the key to the effective design of any
large scale computer systems in this era of advanced technology. It has been
pointed out by Sutherland recently that the current design framework which
employs a globally clocked timing discipline has reached its limit. It was
demonstrated that there are many advantages if a different timing discipline,
namely, the transition-signal conceptual framework is used to design complex
computation systems. In this research, we take a bottom up approach to
accomplish the synthesis of micropipeline processing systems from a high-level
specification. The first milestone is to examine the design and building of
micropipeline structures using differential CMOS logic instead of static CMOS
logic. The second milestone is to implement an automatic synthesis system for a
particular micropipeline stage's logic processing block given a set of logic
equations. The third milestone is to implement all necessary token control
circuitry. The last milestone is to map a dataflow graph which specifies a
particular algorithm into hardware using the micropipeline design frame work.
