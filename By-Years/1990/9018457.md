The Marquette University Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering plans
to establish a Graduate Engineering Education (GEE) Program of study, research,
and academic support for students from underrepresented backgrounds. All aspects
of the program will be focused directly on the timely completion of a doctoral
degree in signal processing, and the preparation and motivation for a career in
university teaching and research in electrical and computer engineering. The
five year GEE program will provide financial, academic, professional, and
personal support for three GEE Fellows in each program year. It is anticipated
that students will complete their degrees in three to five years, allowing room
for new participants in year four.
