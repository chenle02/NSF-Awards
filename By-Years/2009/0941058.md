This grant provides support for travel, conference registration fees, and
accommodation costs for students selected to attend the Doctoral Symposium being
held at the 2009 International Conference on Requirements Engineering (RE?09) in
Atlanta, USA, 31 August ? 4 September 2009. The International Requirements
Engineering Conference is sponsored by the IEEE and is the premier academic and
industrial event in the field of Requirements Engineering. The Doctoral
Symposium at RE?09 provides a venue for young researchers to access worldwide
expertise in software engineering. The Symposium is a one-day closed RE?09 event
that provides a forum for Ph.D. students to publicly discuss their research
goals, methods, and results at an early stage in their research. The Symposium
aims to provide useful guidance to the students from a panel of experts, for
completion of the dissertation research and initiation of a research career.
