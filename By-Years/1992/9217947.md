This award supports a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Nonlinear Probnlems in Geometry and
Physics. The co-organizers are Professor Joel Spruck of the Johns Hopkins
University and Professor Hiroshi Matano of the University of Tokyo. The seminar
will be held at the conclusion of a two-year collaborative research project
between the two principal investigators, which will be undertaken at Johns
Hopkins University during 1993 and 1994. The research program will focus on
nonlinear evolution and free boundary problems arising in Differential Geometry
(Mean Curvature Flow, Anisotropic Crystal Growth, Ricci Flow) and in the
physical theories of phase transitions and interfacial dynamics (Ginsburg-Landau
theory, Allan-Cahn equation, Stefan problem, Hele-Shaw flow, reaction diffusion
equations and pattern formation). The primary focus will be interdisciplinary
research participation in an active research and training seminar. The week-long
seminar in spring 1994 will be open to the mathematical community, bringing
together the leading experts from Japan and the United States to report on the
major developments in these topics.
