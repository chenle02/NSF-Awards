Tekalp 9321144 This award will support collaborative research between the
University of Rochester and Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey. The
investigators will study novel techniques for model-based very low bit rate
digital video compression. They propose to concentrate on the model-based
paradigm of 3- D flexible object models and 3-D motion, using a flexible generic
wireframe model as a structural constraint for head and shoulder type scenes
which are common in videophone applications. Due to the ill-posed nature of 3-D
motion and structure estimation in the case of monocular imaging, they also
propose to investigate the feasibility of stereo imaging in videophone
applications where stereo imaging techniques can be used to estimate 3-D motion
and structure parameters for model-based coding. This project coincides with
international standardization activities. The proposed research project forms
part of the fabric of current scientific interest in video compression and the
successful completion of this international collaboration will benefit the
electrical engineering communities in both the U.S. and Turkey. ***
