Volcanic rocks recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling Project from the Philippine
Sea represent at least four stages of back- arc spreading and two episodes of
volcanic arc building. Major and trace element studies of these samples have
delineated important chemical differences between and among arc and basin lavas.
The objective of the present award is to examine the lead, strontium and
neodymium isotopes of these same samples. These data will be used to determine
the extent of isotope variation among older basin and arc lavas and to identify
geographic trends. Such information is important in defining the compositional
range of mantle sources that contribute to arc and basin volcanism over time and
in understanding the overall geochemical evolution of the arc-basin system. This
project will be undertaken at an undergraduate institution.
