This Doctoral Dissertation research details the relationship between national
level characteristics of states and their likelihood of engaging in conflict.
The primary concern is with the way in which states assess the current status
quo -- either in their bilateral relationship with other states or when
assessing a regional coalition of states. The primary finding is that the level
of satisfaction affects the likelihood of engaging in conflict. This finding is
borne out in empirical estimations on data drawn from a number of sources.
