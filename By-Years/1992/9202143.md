Fundamentals of boundary lubrication will be investigated by studying the
lubricating mechanisms which operate in extremely thin polymeric boundary
lubricant films. The equipment used is a modified surface force microscope.
Measurements of effective viscosity and elasticity and of limiting shear stress
will be made over a wide range of film thickness, from monomolecular layers to
bulk, and for strain rates up to 10*8/sec. Molecules to be tested include a
number of linear and branched alkanes and perfluoropolyethers as well as aqueous
media. The confining surfaces will include mica, bonded lubricants and
metallized surfaces.
