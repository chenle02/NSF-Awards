9523224 Lee This project will integrate two of the most significant devices for
analytical separation and detection: capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass
spectrometry (MS). Other attempts to couple these two have had limitations
because of insufficient sensitivity and scan speed. This system will be based on
an atmospheric pressure ionization (API) time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(TOFMS) system. A specially designed, CE/electrospray ion source will be added,
as well as an ion mirror to increase the resolution of the instrument and
minimize its limitations. If successful, this device will meet the industry's
expectation in situations where fast separations are desired or the number of
samples to be analyzed increases. This device will have applications in such
fields as biochemical analysis, pharmaceutical analysis, environmental analysis,
and process quality control.
