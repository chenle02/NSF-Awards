This project is concerned with the admissible representation theory of
reductive groups over p-adic fields and, in particular, the various
correspondences between the sets of irreducible representations of these groups.
The principal investigators will work on the classification of the admissible
dual via restriction to certain compact, open subgroups; relations with
parabolic induction; and compatibility with Langlands functoriality and Howe's
theory of the theta correspondence. This research falls into the broad category
of p-adic algebraic groups. Historically, algebraic groups arose in an effort to
describe all the transformations or symmetries of an n-dimensional space. The
spaces under consideration here, however, are not the familiar real spaces like
the line and the plane, but totally disconnected objects that are important in
number theory and pure algebra.
