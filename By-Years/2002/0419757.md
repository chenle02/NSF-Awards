This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage
recently-published research which indicates that new types of anode nanocarbons
can produce high reversible lithium (Li) storage capacity and stable cycle
capability. The work will use hollow carbon nanofibers to produce Li-ion
electrode performance which is close to or surpasses theoretical values (i.e.,
the electrical performance of LiC6). The unique morphology of these fibers,
i.e., a hollow core, stacked cup, structure and open, graphitic planes, is
expected to facilitate reversible Li-ion intercalation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade, lithium ion has developed into a
mainstream battery technology with considerable commercial impact. Safe,
rechargeable, inexpensive Li-ion batteries are enjoying a growing customer base
in diverse markets - from consumer electronics to space vehicles. As mature as
this industry is, there are still good prospects for achieving major performance
improvements through the use of advanced materials. The unique morphology of the
carbon nanofibers and the fact that these materials can readily be transitioned
into an existing client base of Li-ion battery producers and users holds great
promise for this cutting-edge research.
