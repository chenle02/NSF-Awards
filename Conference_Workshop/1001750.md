This project supports a 3-year sequence of regional conferences in Algebra,
Combinatorics & Number Theory. The goals of the conferences are to encourage and
stimulate research efforts of regional PhD students in mathematics and computer
science, to foster collaborations among senior researchers and students, and to
further strengthen the developing group of researchers in the Rocky Mountain
region in the focus areas. A tentative list of topics is: 2010 Topic: Expander
graphs, Speaker: H.A. Helfgott (University of Bristol); 2011 Topic: Finite
Geometry and its applications, Speakers: Gary Ebert (University of Delaware) and
William Kantor (University of Oregon); 2012 Topic: Algebraic Graph theory
applied to complex networks, Speakers: Sebi Ciaoba (University of Delaware).
Each conference will have two plenary speakers. Those listed have already
confirmed their participation. The remaining slots will be filled in
consultation with the speakers to support the chosen topic.

Graduate student involvement will be a high priority. Graduate students will be
encouraged to present their research, and the schedule will be designed with
break-outs and problem sessions so that faculty can offer suggestions and
direction to the students. Creating an environment to foster new collaborations
will be another priority, and the topics and speakers have been chosen because
of their timeliness and the high potential for collaborations with regional
faculty. The project provides funds to defray some of the travel expenses for
speakers and participants. Priority for travel funds will go to minority
applicants and graduate students. The project will (a) provide an encouraging
environment for young researchers and graduate students, (b) inform researchers
of some of the latest developments in Algebra, Combinatorics and Number Theory,
and (c) strengthen collaborative, and interdisciplinary research ties among
mathematicians in the Rocky Mountain region.
