This is a proposal for the continued development and application of a new
transmission electron diffraction method for accurately measuring the electron
density distribution of cations in various crystalline materials. Electron beam
techniques will enable the PIs to study the structure of micro-crystals and
"real" materials. Specifically, the PIs intend to: * determine the charge state
of Cu in various oxides including oxide superconductors * study the nature of
bonding and crystal properties of MgO * test theoretical calculations such as
structure factors and the role of ionicity in structural phase transitions *
further develop the electron diffraction technique The results of this research
will contribute to the understanding of the crystal structure of a number of
technologically important semiconductor and ceramic materials.
