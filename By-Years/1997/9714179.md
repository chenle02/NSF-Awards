This project will support improvements to the Coral Reef Research Foundation
Laboratory in Koror, Polau, Western Caroline Islands. The CRRF Laboratory is a
new facility which is rapidly developing a group of outside researchers and
education programs that use the facility. Palau is an area of high marine
diversity with a wide variety of marine habitats, including tropical marine
lakes which are extremely rare. The CRRF Laboratory is heavily committed to
assisting researchers and education programs, while maintaining an in-house
program of species-level marine diversity and other marine biological research.
The project will support the acquisition of laboratory equipment (microscopy,
general laboratory instrumentation, computer equipment) and materials for
construction of a small wet laboratory for use by education programs and outside
researchers.
