The Center for Bibliographical Studies at the University of California,
&lt;br/&gt;Riverside, is creating a union catalog of Latin American imprints to
&lt;br/&gt;1851. Existing printed bibliographies are for the most part old and
&lt;br/&gt;incomplete or non-existent. The Center has keyed all the extant
&lt;br/&gt;bibliographies and catalogs it can identify that are within scope,
&lt;br/&gt;producing some over 85,000 separate entries. Under this grant the
keyed &lt;br/&gt;entries will be modifed to fit MARC standards, duplicate
holdings &lt;br/&gt;eliminated and holdings records consolidated forming an
initial data base &lt;br/&gt;of 60-70,000 records. Uniform library symbols will
be created. The &lt;br/&gt;resulting file will be mounted in the Research
Libraries Information &lt;br/&gt;Network for public access. The process of
adding additional records from &lt;br/&gt;machine-readable files submitted by
participating libraries in North and &lt;br/&gt;South America will begin,
matching algorithms developed, and new holdings &lt;br/&gt;and records as well
as citations to microfilm facsimiles added. Scholars &lt;br/&gt;will have access
to a single source for identifying surviving imprints and &lt;br/&gt;where they
can be found. The file itself will be searchable across all &lt;br/&gt;fields
through Boolean searching. Libraries will be able to use the file &lt;br/&gt;for
copy cataloging and obtaining machine-readable records of their
&lt;br/&gt;holdings for loading into their online public
catalogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
