Conference on Statistical Climatology Abstract: This International Conference on
Statistical Climatology, the sixth that has been held since 1979, will be held
from May 25 to 29, 1998, in British Columbia. This series of international
conferences has brought together statisticians and climatologists for both
formal and informal discussions of problems and statistical methods for
addressing them. There are two invited lectures per day, each with discussions
by both statisticians and climatologists. This format promotes cross-
disciplinary interactions and collaborations. Many of the leading issues in
climatology are related to general circulation models. The major problem of
interest is in comparing model runs to historical data, which have varying
spatial and temporal coverage, varying instrumentation, and very different
precision. These models are used to assess the effect of various anthropogenic
influences on the climate, such as changing composition of various greenhouse
gasses. Important topics to be discussed at this conference are the statistical
techniques such as hiden Markov models, wavelet methods, and neural networks
that can be used in developing useful models. This award is in support of
expenses of participants from the United States. A large portion of the grant
will go towards expenses of graduate students, new researchers, and members of
underrepresented groups.
