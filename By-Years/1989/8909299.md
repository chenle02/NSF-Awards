This project is concerned with the application of intelligent system technology
for the rapid generation of animated films portraying human figures as they move
through a complex environment. This project is divided into three areas: the
major thrust is to develop sophisticated expert-system based animation tools
that automate much of the work of what traditional animators call
"inbetweening", that is, filling in missing action between the points that the
animation director specifies. The second objectives is to be able to render more
realistic looking human forms by modelling actual human muscle structures. The
third objectives is to study and develop new parallel algorithms and language
structures for real-time interactive control of the animation process.
