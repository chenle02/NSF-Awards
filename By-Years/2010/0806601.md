The wide-bandgap semiconductor ZnO has gained unprecedented attention due to its
potential applications in blue laser diodes and LEDs, optical detectors, high-
power amplifiers, and chemical/gas sensing. Progress, however, is still
challenged by the high concentration of point defects, problems with stability
of the surface, and the lack of reliable p-type doping. The bulk and surface-
related defects reduce efficiency of emitters, laser operation lifetimes, and
lead to earlier degradation of electronic devices. It is likely that the
irreproducible and unstable p-type conductivity of ZnO, which precludes its use
as an efficient emitter, is related to self-compensation with unknown defects
and peculiarities of the surface conductivity. Compared to the wealth of
information now available on exciton emission in ZnO, there is only a small
amount of useful and reliable information on surface properties and on point
defects responsible for broad luminescence bands. This planning grant supports
the development of a collaborative study of defects in ZnO between Virginia
Commonwealth University, the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, and
the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute, Russia. The investigators and their
students develop approaches that involves sample growth, characterization, and
modeling, as well as feedback between the activities. US graduate students learn
sample growth and preparation techniques and, more generally, experience working
at the foreign research laboratories.
