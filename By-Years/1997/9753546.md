&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Florida Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher
Education Program (FCETP)&lt;br/&gt; is building a state-wide model of
interdisciplinary and institutional&lt;br/&gt; cooperation for improving the
preparation of future K-12 teachers. The&lt;br/&gt; collaborative is centered at
Florida A&amp;M University and includes over twenty&lt;br/&gt; institutions
representing many of the state's research universities, four-year&lt;br/&gt;
colleges, and community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These institutions
include Florida State University, the University of&lt;br/&gt; Florida,
University of South Florida, University of North Florida. the&lt;br/&gt;
University of West Florida, the University of Central Florida,
Florida&lt;br/&gt; International University, Bethune-Cookman College,
Tallahassee Community&lt;br/&gt; College, Miami-Dade Community College, and
Florida Community College at&lt;br/&gt; Jacksonville. In addition, area school
districts and educational organizations&lt;br/&gt; which support the preparation
of mathematics and science teachers support&lt;br/&gt; the major components of
this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This inititative focuses on aggessive
recruitment of students to teaching&lt;br/&gt; careers, and improvements in pre-
service and in-service education. Program&lt;br/&gt; goals
are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; o increase significantly the number of high-achieving
high school graduates who&lt;br/&gt; enroll in and receive baccalaureate degrees
from science, or mathematics&lt;br/&gt; teacher education
program;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; o establish an effective community of SMET
faculty from participating&lt;br/&gt; institutions, and work towards increasing
the frequency and effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt; communication among these faculty
and participating teachers and students;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; o implement of
develop a core of mathematics and science courses for&lt;br/&gt; pre-service
teachers that are inquiry-based and taught in cooperative learning&lt;br/&gt;
environments; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; o create a model of teacher training
that also incorporates summer mentoring of&lt;br/&gt; FCETP students and early
sustained classroom experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The FCETP Project is
being evaluated by an external evaluator with assistance from FCETP
staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
