Imagine you're talking about a family vacation you went on, but you can't
remember every detail. Sometimes, someone chimes in during the conversation to
remind you of things that happened, helping you remember more. Could we develop
an automated way to select reminders and improve someone's memory? This research
aims to study how reminders affect memory by examining and modeling their
interaction in a 'memory space'. These models allow us to test different
theories and make predictions about the effect of reminders. The findings from
this research could be valuable in designing memory interventions for
individuals in educational settings or those with memory impairments.

Contrary to the intuition that cues from the environment are helpful, a
substantial body of research demonstrates that the presentation of cues during
memory search can sometimes be detrimental. We argue that the effectiveness of
cues depends critically on their content and timing. Various descriptive
theories of memory cues have been proposed in the literature, but they have been
difficult to distinguish empirically, which impacts our ability to predict how
effective different kinds of cues and their timing would be. To address these
issues, we will translate descriptive theories of memory cues into
mathematically-transparent computational models. This approach enables us to
quantitatively compare the predictions of these theories regarding the effects
of cues, and identify the model that best matches the data. This model can then
be used to simulate the effect of all possible combinations of cue content and
timing, enabling the selection of the most effective cues. Overall, the proposed
research program contributes to a unified account of when external cues are
beneficial or detrimental.
