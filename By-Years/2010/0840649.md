The PI's work is related to two different kinds of symmetries, one algebraic in
naure and the other that is analytic. The first kind is symmetries of the roots
of polynomial equations defined over the rationals, and the second kind is that
which complex analytic functions called modular forms have. The astonishing fact
is that there is a connection between these two different kinds of
symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;This has been implicit in number theoretic work since the
time of Gauss, as epitomised in his law of quadratic reciprocity. It has been
made explicitly into a unifying theme of modern number theory as part of the
Langlands program. The PI's recent work with J-P. Wintenberger on Serre's
conjecture results in concrete progress in this
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between these two different kinds
of symmetries, of roots of polynomial equations and of modular forms, is a
phenomenon that has affected a wide spectrum of mathematics and even some parts
of physics like string theory. It is a theme that is very old, still resonant in
current mathematical research, and promises to be so for a long time to
come.&lt;br/&gt;
