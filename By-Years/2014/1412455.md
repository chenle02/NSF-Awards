Understanding how molecules interact with each other to form stable assemblies
is of fundamental scientific interest and has potential applications in fields
as diverse as drug development, targeting and delivery, novel
responsive/intelligent materials, and the development of new sensors. In this
context, the formation of host-guest complexes, in which a large container
molecule (the host) provides a welcoming space for the docking of a smaller
molecule (the guest), is of great importance. Professor Angel E. Kaifer of the
University of Miami is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry Program at NSF to study the formation of host-guest complexes by
an important class of hosts, known as the cucurbiturils. This project provides
research opportunities to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students
(including women and members of underrepresented groups). Through this research,
students receive training across the boundaries of the traditional disciplines
of chemistry.

The cucurbituril hosts are very attractive because they form extremely stable
complexes with suitable guests in aqueous media. This research explores the
following avenues: (1) Use of cucurbiturils as modular components of complex
supramolecular systems, including at least two types of hosts. (2) Synthesis of
functionalized cucurbiturils as active components for the preparation of well-
defined supramolecular oligomers, as well as modification of the surface of
metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, endowing them with high-affinity binding
properties. (3) Electrochemical and EPR investigation of the polarity of the
aqueous microenvironments adjacent to the cucurbituril cavity entrances. (4)
Kinetics of cucurbituril exchange reactions between two different guests, with
particular emphasis on the detection of ternary intermediates.
