Nontechnical description&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will support student
participation in the 2016 International Microwave Symposium (IMS) that will be
held in San Francisco, California from May 22 to May 27, 2016. Support will be
provided for an educational program called IMS Connect which was initiated in
2014 and will be expanded in this year's event. The proposed work will focus on
exposing underrepresented students to exciting opportunities and potential
mentors within the IMS community related to broad technology areas such as
electronics and communications. The participating students will also be
introduced to innovation and entrepreneurship efforts emerging in a variety of
new technological areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
description&lt;br/&gt;IMS will address research areas in RF/microwave
engineering and is the largest conference in the world in this field. The
project will provide awareness on career opportunities and expectations and
access to role models and potential mentors. It will also be described in
professional magazines with the potential to encourage other conferences to
adopt a similar type of program.
