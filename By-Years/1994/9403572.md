Professor Gregory Ezra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in theoretical studies of
few body dynamics. Ezra applies quantum, classical and semiclassical
methodologies to investigate problems such as: 1) complex formation in ion-
molecule reactions with emphasis on proton transfer reactions; 2) classical-
quantum correspondence in coupled oscillator systems; and 3) semiclassical
theory of few-body Coulomb systems. A basic theme of Ezra's work is the relation
between the classical and quantum mechanics of nonintegrable systems such as
molecular Hamiltonians or multi-electron atoms. The primary aim of Ezra's work
is a detailed understanding of energy flow within a molecule and its
consequences for spectroscopy and chemical kinetics. Chemically useful
correlations are being sought between the shape of a molecular potential energy
surface and the associated reactive bound state dynamics. These correlations
will aid in gaining a deeper fundamental understanding of chemical dynamics.
