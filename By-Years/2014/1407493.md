Non-technical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of
Materials Research, and co-funded by the Nano-Biosensors Program in the Division
of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (ENG/CBET) to
the Johns Hopkins University, is to study electroactive biomaterials that are
relevant to regenerating nerves, cardiac tissue and skeletal muscle, all known
to respond to external electrical impulses. New electroactive biomaterials that
are capable of acting both as field carriers and as better cell migration
matrices will be poised to impact many emerging tissue engineering and bioenergy
applications. Before these impacts can be realized, it will be critical to
quantitatively characterize the magnitude of electric fields present in these
constructs and the specific impacts on cell biology. These investigations span
several areas of contemporary materials science thus requiring a cooperative
scientific effort among chemistry and engineering. The approach described here
builds on a new material platform developed at Johns Hopkins whereby small
organic molecules are combined with electronic and biological functions. The
molecules thus created can self-associate under biological conditions to yield
nanoscopic fibrils that resemble the structural elements of the extracellular
matrix. The present project seeks to understand how the electronic properties of
these nanoscale materials will impact cell behavior and to use this knowledge to
engineer specific cellular outcomes directed by optoelectronic inputs. This
research will expose students to the state of the art in biomaterial design and
characterization techniques used for optoelectronic and in vitro
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This award to Johns Hopkins
University will support an innovative program in optoelctronic biomaterials that
combines organic-based electronic function and cell-growth-promoting
oligopeptides. It involves a systematic study of the synthesis of peptide
nanomaterials, the assessment of their electrical and photonic properties under
aqueous and biotic environments, and the assessment of their cellular influence
in vitro. The key hypothesis is that nanoscale electric fields engineered into
peptide-based hydrogel scaffolds will have direct spatial and temporal influence
on cell adhesion and growth. New electroactive biomaterials that are capable of
acting both as field carriers and as better cell migration matrices will be
poised to impact many emerging tissue engineering and bioenergy applications.
Before these impacts can be realized, it will be critical to quantitatively
characterize the magnitude of electric fields present in these constructs and
the specific impacts on both material properties and cell biology.
