National Science Foundation Division of Biological Infrastructure Training
Programs NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships for 1997 Review Context
Statement and Summary of Panel Deliberations Thirty-one applications were
received for the fiscal year 1997 competition in which it is expected that 10
fellowships will be offered. Two applications were determined to be ineligible
and were returned to the applicants as inappropriate. One application was
withdrawn by the applicant who received funding from another Federal agency. A
panel of experts from fields relevant to the fields of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences was convened for a meeting in Arlington, VA
on March 31 and April 1, 1997. Prior to the meeting panelists had received
copies of all applications and written preliminary reviews on 12 applications.
Each application was reviewed by 3 panelists using the review criteria outlined
in the program announcement, NSF 94-133. Panelists were asked to assign a
preliminary rating of excellent, very good, or good to each application. After
reading the references, the panelists discussed the applications individually in
random order and assigned each one a final rating as follows: Final Rating #
Applications Excellent 7 E/VG 5 Very Good 9 Good 7 The panel rated your
application as excellent/very good. It is not possible to fund all applications
with this rating. In this application, there is an excellent link between the
planned fellowship activities and the applicant's career goals.
