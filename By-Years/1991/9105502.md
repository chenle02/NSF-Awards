An experiment which uses the methodology gained from VLBI to try to improve
determinations of the vertical from GPS will conducted. The experiment involves
establishing a network of homogeneous GPS sites, with each GPS receiver being
located at one of the VLBI sites participating in the low-elevation-angle VLBI
"R&amp;D" experiments. These experiments, and their predecessors, have been
extremely useful in developing methods for improving the accuracy of vertical
estimates from VLBI. By analyzing and comparing estimates obtained from both the
GPS and the VLBI data sets, methods for obtaining the most accurate
determinations of the vertical from GPS will be developed.
