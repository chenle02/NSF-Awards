The Ecological Society of America (ESA) has taken an active leadership role in
creating regional alliances of ecologists and educators. ESA has held a highly
successful conference on K-12 ecological education in conjunction with a meeting
of the Association of Southeastern Biologists. This conference was attended by a
team from each state, consisting of one or two ecological researchers, teachers,
science education administrators, and education faculty members. Team members
heard presentations on recent developments in pre-college ecological education,
and they collaborated on an action plan for their respective states. The action
plans and meeting proceedings were subsequently published in an ESA bulletin.
The Society has planned a similar conference for the Rocky Mountain region.
Ecological education in this region is made more difficult by the high level of
ecological diversity in the area, and the difficulties of travel for parts of
the year. The proposed Rocky Mountain conference will create benefits throughout
the region and beyond. Once established, regional alliances such as this will be
pivotal in implementing a national approach to ecological education. Conferences
such as these capture the active participation of scientists in pre-college
science education, create action plans for implementation, and solidify
partnerships for educational improvement. Cost sharing represents 26% of the NSF
contribution.
