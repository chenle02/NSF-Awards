9633418 Morgan The objectives of this project are to describe the propagation
and development characteristics of midlatitude upper tropospheric mobile troughs
("short waves"), characterize the basic state flow within which short waves
propagate, and identify the disturbances antecedent to short wave formation and
determine their relationship to the background atmospheric flow. The research
will utilize data from the North American radiosonde and rawinsonde network,
analysis and forecast fields from the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP) operational weather forecast models, and possibly data from an
upcoming international experiment known as FASTEX (Fronts and Atlantic Storm
Track Experiment). The NCAR limited area nonhydrostatic mesoscale model (MM5) as
well as simpler quasi-geostrophic models will be employed to help elucidate the
interactions between the basic state and the short wave precursors. The results
from this research should have practical application in improving short and
medium range weather forecasts. In addition, they may provide some guidance in
the deployment of adaptive observing systems for weather prediction. ***
