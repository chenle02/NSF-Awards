University of Dayton's program is to enhance the role of women in materials
engineering with a special emphasis on the area of titanium and titanium casting
technology. The program combines the technical program in the Titanium
Technology area with a substantially modified Women in Engineering recruitment
system named Women in Graduate Materials Studies (WINGES) which provides
doctoral education and research opportunities for three women materials
engineers.
