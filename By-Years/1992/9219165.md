This project combines theoretical modeling with laboratory experiments of the
freezing of ice floes in a wave field. Wave and sea ice interaction is a little
known area of research with however strong implications for both the large-scale
ice dynamics, and local-scale physical and biological processes in the marginal
ice zone. The proposed work consists of parallel investigations of computer-
simulated data to determine the the relation between wave characteristics and
the rate and duration of floe interactions on the one hand, and a series of wave
tank experiments on the other hand. These experiments will evolve from a simple
one-dimensional wave propagating into a field of simulated ice floes to examine
floe movement and clustering, to two-dimensional experiments in a refrigerated
wave tank to study the actual freezing process which is believed to involve the
compaction of newly generated frazil ice and the welding together of individual
so-called "pancakes" into successively larger ice floes. When the surface layers
of the ocean are close to the freezing point of sea water, such a process
operating on the 10 cm to 1 m scale, can extend the ice edge seaward extremely
rapidly, with significant effects on antarctic meteorological and biological
processes.
