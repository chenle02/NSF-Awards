9400253 Bash The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS), an association
of academic institutions, was established in 1971 as a coordinating and planning
mechanism for oceanographic facilities operated by those institutions. The UNOLS
Office is the focal point for planning, coordination and reporting of all UNOLS
activities. It provides administrative staff services, prepares and disseminates
ship schedules, user requirements, analyses of annual ship use, committee
reports, new marine regulations and other related information. Support for
special studies, the Medical Advisory Service for ship's crews and scientists,
travel expenses by UNOLS Council members, committees and consultants is also
provided through the UNOLS Office. This project will conduct the activities of
the UNOLS Office during the first year of a three year commitment to UNOLS
Office operations by five Federal agencies. These agencies include: The National
Science Foundation, (Division of Ocean Sciences), The Department of the Navy
(Office of Naval Research), The U.S. Department of Energy, The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, and The U.S. Department of the Interior (U.S.
Geological Survey and Minerals Management Service). The UNOLS Office is located
at the University of Rhode Island. This project is under the direction of Mr.
John F. Bash, Executive Secretary, UNOLS. ***
