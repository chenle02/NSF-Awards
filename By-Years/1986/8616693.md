The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate the process of slow
deformation of porous ground saturated with fluids. Various man- made
disturbances and geometries will be considered. The first category is concerned
with subsidence due to pumping from a well through a layered soil. In the second
category, ground deformation induced by an intense heat source buried in a thick
layer of soft soil will be studied. Finally, the thaw subsidence due to heated
structures or oil production wells will be investigated. The proposed research
has significant theoretical and practical implications. An award is recommended.
