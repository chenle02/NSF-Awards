Delaware attained EPSCoR status in January 2003 and has been actively involved
in setting up a statewide EPSCoR program. Delaware has established a management
team, convened a state committee, formed faculty planning teams at each of the
four Delaware institutions of higher education, and involved the Governor's
office and the Delaware Economic Development Office to develop a state science
and technology plan. This renewed planning effort will initiate a strong EPSCoR
outreach program, refine and deepen the research infrastructure improvement
strategy, and develop management practices for a sustainable Delaware EPSCoR
office. The higher education institutions involved in the planning process
include the University of Delaware, Delaware State University, Delaware
Technical and Community College, and Wesley College.
