The objective of this award is to analyze and improve multi-level incentive
mechanisms in health care to benefit patients, physicians, hospitals and payers.
A novel modeling approach based on multiscale decision theory will be developed
that can account for the multi-level interdependencies between stakeholders,
supports their decision processes and enables the re-design of incentive
programs. The approach integrates a new graphical modeling technique with a
modular mathematical formulation strategy to compute optimal decisions under
uncertainty and to identify effective incentive structures. In a case study, the
model will be applied to find mechanisms that can reduce the overuse of computed
tomography (CT) scans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this
research will lead to improvements in the design of incentives in health care.
Better alignment of incentives is one of the key mechanisms to lower costs while
improving quality for the U.S. health care system. The benefits to society and
economy will be an improvement in health care value, i.e., better health
outcomes at lower costs. Fundamental research and advances in multiscale
decision theory will lead to novel modeling and solution methods for complex
socio-technical systems. The work will also contribute to the education of
students and health care professionals on how to use incentives in
organizational system design. An international collaboration with Germany will
allow students to exchange ideas on health care system improvements from the
perspective of their country and culture.
