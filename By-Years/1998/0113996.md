The project addresses the problem of human interaction - in this case mechanical
interaction - with virtual environments. Considered are locomotion interface
energy-extractive devices that allow natural walking through virtual terrain.
The goal is to produce a sense of immersion in the virtual world by realistic
integration of walking with vision and sound, and by realistic energy
expenditure in moving about. For example, the system will be expected to
realistically recreate the fact that walking uphill is harder than downhill.
Additional degrees of freedom will be explored to investigate a more generalized
pattern of terrain walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
