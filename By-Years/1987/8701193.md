For the investigation of electron-electron correlation in atoms, the complete
understanding, both experimental and theoretical, of its influence in helium is
indispensable. For the past two years the investigators have been engaged in an
experimental and theoretical program to analyze this correlation. The process
which is examined is the photoionization to produce the n=2 level of the He+
ion. Through a measurement of the alignment of the 2P3/2 state, the additional
experiment necessary to determine the partial cross sections for production of
all continuum state contributing to the ionization has been performed at two
energies. This parameter will be measured throughout the energy region from the
n=2 to the n=3 ionization limits, with special attention to the 3s3p resonance
at 69.9 eV. In support of the experimental program a theoretical calculation of
the alignment using hyperspherical coordinates will be carried out. A
transformation of the alpha-coordinate allows solution of the angular equations
using a series expansion. This simplifies the numerical procedures and allows
calculation of more accurate channel functions and coupling parameters. The
alignment and electron angular distribution parameter beta will be calculated,
as well as the accuracy with which calculations using this technique can be made
and the scattering phase shifts for the e- + H system.
