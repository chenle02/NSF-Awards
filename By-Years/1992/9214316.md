This proposal requests funds to develop a neutron diffraction instrument to
measure stress and to support salaries of the researchers. The instrument will
measure residual and applied stresses in engineering materials by using neutron
diffraction. It will be located at the university's research reactor (the source
of the neutron beam). Some examples of the research to be supported include
studying thermal residual stresses in cemented carbide composite materials used
for cutting tools and the study of welds in metal-to-ceramic welding.
