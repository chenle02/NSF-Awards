This research, to be conducted in the Department of Chemistry at the University
of California, San Diego, will utilize time-resolved laser spectroscopy to probe
for evidence of solvent cage effects on Lewis acid base reactions. The acid-base
pair will be generated by photolytic dissociation of a ligand from a six-
coordinate, iron-porphyrin complex. Changes in temperature and/or pressure will
be used to extend the temporal range of the spectroscopic experiments, which
will be helpful in determining what portion of the reaction occurs in the
solvent cage and what occurs after diffusion of the reagents out of the solvent
cage. %%% Professor Douglas Magde of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California, San Diego will conduct experiments on pairs of
reactant molecules generated in close proximity in solution. Subsequent
reactions of these molecules will be monitored using rapid spectroscopic methods
to determine whether the surrounding solvent molecules provide a cage effect
that serves to hold the reactants together, or whether the molecules are totally
free to move apart and react later in a subsequent encounter. These studies are
designed to provide fundamental information important for all reactions that
occur in solution. The reactants chosen for study are related to biological
oxygen carriers so that the results will have special applicability to
biological functions.
