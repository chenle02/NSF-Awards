Behavioral responses to taste stimuli include those leading to ingestion (mouth
movements, tongue protrusion, etc.) and rejection (gapes, etc.). The neural
circuitry required for these behaviors is contained within the brainstem.
Several forebrain regions are connected to brainstem taste centers, but the
functional roles of these connections have not been determined. Therefore, the
specific goal of this study is to determine the behavioral roles of the
descending projections from forebrain structures to gustatory centers in the
brainstem. The general experimental approach will be to activate the descending
projections with implanted electrodes in conscious rats and to observe changes
in taste-related behaviors (particularly to salty and bitter stimuli). To
understand the mechanisms of the behavioral effects, changes in the location,
number and type of neurons in the gustatory brainstem, activated by forebrain
stimulation, will be determined using a combination of anatomical and molecular
techniques. It is expected that the results of this study will improve our
understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying taste-related behaviors and
provide a foundation for future research on the role of these pathways in more
complex behaviors. The broader impacts of the proposed activities include the
involvement of a diverse undergraduate student population in scientific
research, enhanced undergraduate student preparation for graduate work in the
Biological Sciences, and published findings to disseminate the results of the
experiments. Beyond those impacts, the proposed activities will increase
interaction among scientists and students at Stetson University, enhance
learning, teaching and training in classrooms and laboratories, and promote
outreach to local middle- and high-school teachers and their students.
