The purpose of this project is the development of a product design based on the
discovery of stable aqueous colloids. Such a colloidal system, with a particle
size of about one hundred nanometer, consists only of small simple molecules, in
contrast to current industrial processes where the addition of surfactants,
electrolytes, or viscosity modifiers is needed. Colloids are widely used in
medicine and industry to create liquid-based products such as pharmaceuticals,
food/beverages, agrochemicals. The process consists of creating a colloidal
system by dispersing hydrophobic compounds in an aqueous medium and stabilizing
them by small amphiphilic molecules known as hydrotropes. Low molecular weight
alcohols are typical examples of hydrotropes. The creation of such a system
requires only simple mixing, thus contributing to significant savings in raw
materials, equipment, and energy costs. This technology, so far, has been proven
for dispersing hydrophobic compounds such as cyclohexane. This proposal aims to
connect fundamental research discoveries and potential novel applications, so
that this research can be transformed into new products, processes, and
services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project is at the
intersection of physical chemistry, molecular physics, materials science, and
chemical engineering. The proposed research will enrich engineering education,
by bridging the gap between fundamentals, applications, and commercialization.
In addition to anticipated commercial targets, which include pharmaceuticals,
food/beverages, agrochemicals, cosmetics/detergents, the relevant commercial
landscape can be further extended to a much broader list of industrial and
medical applications, such as nano-encapsulated drug delivery or soft-matter
engineering. Recently, the interest in aqueous solutions of propanol and butanol
isomers, as a new clean energy source, has greatly increased because such
alcohols are considered promising alternatives to ethanol. These alcohols can be
produced via metabolic engineering, which involves bacteria. Making nanosize
colloids in these solutions could enable one to control the rate of metabolism
through encapsulation of bacteria.
