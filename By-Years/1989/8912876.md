The goals of this project are to elucidate the mechanisms of neurohormonal
control of cellular volume regulation in marine bivalve molluscs. Two neural
products, the peptide FMRFamide and the transmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)
increase the efflux of amino acids from isolated ventricles of the clam
Mercenaria mercenaria exposed to hypoosmotic stress. Phorbol esters also
potentiate the amino acid efflux of tissues in hypoosmotic media, suggesting
that the activation of protein kinase C is involved in the control of
hypoosmotic volume regulation. The roles of changes in intracellular Ca++ levels
in the modulation of the amino acid efflux of tissues in hypoosmotic media will
be investigated. Changes in the activity of protein kinase C in tissues exposed
to hypoosmotic media will be determined. The possibility that neurosecretory
cells in the visceral ganglion release FMRFamide into the circulation in
response to decreases in ambient salinity will also be investigated using
immunocytochemical techniques. While neurohormones have been implicatead in the
control of salt and water balance in invertebrates, no known hormone has yet
been clearly associated with the control of a specific osmoregulatory mechanism.
This project will associate the neurosecretion of FMRFamide with the control of
hypoosmotic cellular volume regulation in molluscs. In addition, this project
will provide new information on the cellular mechanisms involved in volume
regulation in molluscs and other animals.
