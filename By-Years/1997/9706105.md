97-06105 Wanamaker The significant hydrogen concentrations found in mantle
minerals and the rapid hydrogen diffusivities measured experimentally in olivine
have led several researchers to argue that the relatively high electrical
conductivities measured for Earth's upper mantle result from hydrogen defects in
the olivine structure. However, new measurements by the PI of the electrical
conductivity at one atmosphere show that "wet" olivine crystals are initially
less conductive than "dry" crystals and that the conductivity of the "wet"
crystals is observed to increase with time, approaching that of the dry crystals
after approximately 10 hours at 800=B0C. This increase in conductivity is
accompanied by a decrease in the hydrogen content of the crystals as determined
using infra-red spectroscopy. In this proposal the PI proposes experiments to
establish the relative electrical conductivities of olivine with and without
hydrogen at elevated pressure and hydrogen fugacity, and to determine
quantitatively the effect of hydrogen on the concentrations and mobilities of
defects in olivine and the transport properties of the upper mantle. These
experiments will establish the nature of the hydrogen defects, their mobility in
the olivine crystal structure, their effect on the concentrations and mobilities
of other olivine defects, and how these parameters vary with temperature and
pressure. These data will allow predictions to be made about the effects of
hydrogen on other transport and rheological properties of olivine and test
existing theoretical models of the sources of high electrical conductivity
anomalies and low seismic velocity anomalies in Earth's mantle. ***
