9408133 Ono ABSTRACT Various types of voltage-gated potassium channels determine
the pattern of electrical excitability in nerve cells. In the developing mouse
hippocampus, a part of the brain implicated in learning and memory, the
appearance of specific potassium currents of nerve cells in culture has been
shown to be controlled by the surrounding support cells by an unknown mechanism.
The presence of cloned potassium channel sequences in specific neurons will be
ascertained using molecular techniques and nucleic acid sequences complementary
to those present in these neurons will be used to block the synthesis of these
channels to correlate a particular sequence with a specific potassium current.
