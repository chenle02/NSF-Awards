The objective of WISE 2002 is to support the participation of fifteen
engineering students each year in the 2002 - 2004 Washington Internships for
Students of Engineering (WISE) programs. The NSF grant will be used to help
facilitate the participation of students from underrepresented minority groups
and currently underrepresented engineering disciplines to make the program truly
multidisciplinary and diverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1980, the WISE program
has brought up to 18 students each summer a total of 324 thus&lt;br/&gt;far to
Washington, DC to learn first-hand how government officials make decisions on
complex technological issues and how engineers contribute to legislative and
regulatory public policy decisions. Throughout the ten weeks, the students
interacted with leaders in the Congress and the Administration, industry, and
prominent non- governmental organizations. Meetings with Congressional
committees, executive office departments, and corporate government affairs
offices were daily activities. In addition, each student researched and
completed a paper on a current and topical engineering-related public policy
issue.&lt;br/&gt;
