This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program hosted at Wayne State University. The program consists of a
preparation phase involving a one-hour course given over the winter to student
participants, followed by ten weeks of summer research at either Wayne State
University or Fermi National Laboratory (Batavia, IL) in topics including
Astrophysics, Nuclear Physics, or Particle Physics. The one-hour course
introduces the students to the physical, mathematical and computational concepts
relevant for the summer experience. It includes a computer training homework and
an ethics component. The participants then merge with other existing REU
programs at each site for social activities and lectures on various scientific
topics. Students are mentored by PhD researchers working on leading edge physics
topics and/or technologies chosen for good mentorship qualities as well as their
leadership in their respective scientific fields. Students are required to
submit a report in the form of a paper at the end of their experience and
deliver oral presentations.
