0309511&lt;br/&gt;Rabalais&lt;br/&gt;This award to Louisiana Universities Marine
Consortium (LUMCON) provides support for the acquisition of a multi-corer system
to be used on R/V Pelican, a research vessel operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The
instrumentation will be used for sampling near-surface sediments of the Gulf of
Mexico with minimal disturbance. This acquisition should provide an important
new shared-use capability for marine scientists using R/V Pelican in their
research during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
