The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under a new mandate
received from the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations
Environment Programme, will provide near-term scientific and technical advice to
the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) which was established by the
United Nations to develop a framework convention on climate change. The IPCC
will also continue its ongoing efforts with respect to assessment of the
science, impacts and response options associated with climate change. The IPCC
will continue to work primarily through its Working Groups; will broaden
participation in these activities by developing countries, particularly in the
tropics and Southern Hemisphere; and will continue to be staffed by a small
secretariat located in Geneva.
