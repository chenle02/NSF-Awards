This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
meeting "International Workshop in Operator Theory and its Applications" (IWOTA)
a workshop that will take place during July 23-27, 2018, on the campus of the
East China Normal University in Shanghai, China. Additional information about
the conference can be found on the website http://iwota2018.fudan.edu.cn

The 2018 IWOTA meeting will continue the tradition of past meetings in this
series going back to 1981. The meeting will be focused on the latest
developments in functional analysis, specifically, operator theory and and
related fields. This includes applications in engineering and mathematical
physics from areas such as differential and integral equations, interpolation
theory, system and control theory, signal processing, and scattering theory. The
IWOTA meeting will run the week before the international symposium "Mathematical
Theory of Networks and Systems"(MTNS) and this pairing provide opportunities for
analysts to get exposed to engineering problems. Priority for funding will be
given to early career mathematicians, women, members of underrepresented groups
and those without other means of support. This is an important conference in
operator theory and its applications that will offer participants the
opportunity to learn of state-of-the-art research in operator theory with
applications to engineering and other sciences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
