9618014 Weihnacht MW Productions, a producer of educational multimedia is
collaborating with William Durham of Stanford University, to create an
interactive, educational CD-ROM based on the Galapagos Islands to enhance
7th-10th grade science. The products are to include self-directed and self-paced
discovery in five specific areas: 1) pattern and process in organic evolution,
2) the scientific method of inquiry, 3) the history of science around the time
of Charles Darwin, 4) community ecology and conservation issues in Galapagos,
and 5) the geology and climatology of the Galapagos. Using Galapagos organisms,
students explore examples of adaptation, homology, natural selection, sexual
selection, and co-evolution. They discover certain aspects of human impact on
the islands and all this while learning of Darwin's own voyage of discovery
around the world on the R/V Beagle. The main product from this project is a CD-
ROM on Mac platform that includes narrated video, animation, science
simulations, graphics, text and computer programming. Additional materials are
printed workbooks students use for compiling of results and teachers to use for
assessment of student work, and a printed guide for teachers on content,
pedagogical and technical issues involved. Content and pedagogy are to be
aligned with the National Science Education Standards.
