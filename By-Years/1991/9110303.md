This is a joint seminar proposed by Drs. John Kennedy and Witold F. Krajewski,
University of Iowa, and Professor Chin-Lien Yen, National Taiwan University
supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. The
seminar will discuss the use of modern meteorological observation systems (e.g.
satellites and radar) and computer models for predicting and forecasting natural
disasters such as hurricanes, rain, floods, and landslides, and exchange
techniques for controlling and mitigating potential damages. Natural hazard
mitigation is an important topic both for the U.S. and Asia. Damages caused by
floods and landslides are an extremely serious concern in the Pacific Rim
region. This conference provides an opportunity for the U.S. scientists to work
with scientists from Taiwan to set research priorities in this field. Advances
in prediction and mitigation of natural hazard can greatly reduce property
damage and human casualties.
