The purpose of this laboratory instrumentation project is to improve and
increase computer usage in statistical analysis and graphics applications in
upper division (major and minor program) geography courses. Students will have
the opportunity to access large data bases, perform more sophisticated
statistical analyses, and produce maps, graphs, and charts in a much less time
consuming manner. This will allow more time for material research and report
writing, as well as encouraging additional in-depth data analysis and graphic
presentation. The proposal will continue the computer applications upgrading
begun by the Department in the middle l970's as part of an ongoing effort at
affording geography students the best education possible within the discipline
with regard to both personal enrichment and career opportunities.
