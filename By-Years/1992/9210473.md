This is a study of the organization of technological inventive activity within
and across national boundaries and of the participation of the United States and
other countries. Inventive activity is an intellectual tradition which is
cultivated in most societies. Inventors, their laboratories or firms, and
nations compete with each others in inventive activity, but they often also
cooperate with others. One goal is to describe the dispersion of inventive
activity (in the form of patents, for example) across the world. Another goal is
to examine the position of the United States and to compare it to other centers
of inventive activity (Japan and Western Europe). The study will enhance our
understanding of the patterns and dynamics of technological development and its
links with science and the economic in national and international contexts.
