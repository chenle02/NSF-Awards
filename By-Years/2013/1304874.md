This project is to enhance advanced, automated manufacturing and processing
education at the College of the Canyons by aligning, expanding, and upgrading
three manufacturing technology related programs: Manufacturing Technology,
Electromechanical Systems Technology, and Welding (automated robotic and laser).
It is based on a comprehensive needs assessment that included review of the
following key factors: national and state training needs; emerging economic
trends; new technologies and applications; skill gaps and shortages;
opportunities for collaboration and leveraging of resources; the needs of
students; and the needs of the community. The project features strong industry
partnerships; new and upgraded curriculum for three AS degrees and certificates;
curriculum development/adaptation for the Fast Track training format; curriculum
development for customized incumbent worker training; upgraded laboratory
facilities supporting all three programs; improving the K-12 STEM pipeline;
work-based learning; outreach and recruitment; student assessment and support;
faculty and teacher training; and evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's
impacts include: 1) improving the STEM pipeline from high school through
community college and to the university level resulting in increased student
access to, and success in, STEM majors; 2) integrating upgraded technologies in
targeted curricula to foster a qualified manufacturing workforce; and 3)
preparing a new generation of engineers and technicians to meet the needs of
manufacturing employers for highly skilled workers that are essential for U.S.
industry to remain competitive.
