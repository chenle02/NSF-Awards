Title: Travel Support for the 19th International Symposium on Field- and Flow-
Based Separations Conference

1655926 Baalousha The 19th International Symposium on Field- and Flow-Based
Separations Conference Series was established in 1989 by John Calving Giddings
at the University of Utah, the inventor of the field flow fractionation
technique. Field flow fractionation can be used for molecular and nanoscale
separations, including separation of polymers, proteins, biomacromolecules,
pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, and natural and engineered nanomaterials
and molecules. These materials are complex, and thus separation, isolation, and
purification of these materials is also complex. A better understanding of these
materials and their properties will enable the isolation and commercialization
of target materials with specific properties of interest. This conference series
is unique and of particular importance to new investigators as there are no
similar conferences that address the broad topic of field- and flow - based
separation theory, method development, and applications.

This international meeting will take place May 14-17, 2018, in Columbia, South
Carolina. Travel funds will enable speakers and students to attend the
conference. The attendees will include various sectors of the research community
including academia, industry, and federal research laboratories. The conference
is organized into seven sessions over the course of three and a half days. The
last day will include a general discussion symposium to discuss progress in the
field and future directions. A training session will be held the weekend before
the formal programming, of interest to graduate students, post docs, and other
researchers looking to expand their expertise. The conference aims to educate
attendees on current developments in the field, disseminate recent results and
advances in molecular and nanoscale separations, and to determine future needs
and directions in the field.
