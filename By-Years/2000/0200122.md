This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Biosynthesis of two coenzymes in
methanogenic microorganisms." The methanogenic microorganism Methanococcus
jannaschii grows in hydrothermal vents, using hydrogen and carbon dioxide to
make methane gas. This project seeks to identify how M. jannaschii produces two
coenzymes, Coenzyme M and Coenzyme B, that cooperate in the final steps of
methanogenesis to release methane and conserve energy for the cell.
