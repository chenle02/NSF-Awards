This award will support two workshops, including one in the Bering Strait
region, that will bring together representatives from the scientific research,
local/native and operational observing communities to develop a science plan and
recommend priorities for the implementation of a sustained, long-term Bering
Strait environmental observing system that is an integral part of the Arctic
Observing Network (AON). The Bering Strait is a vital element of the Arctic
Ocean environmental system, as it is the only conduit for Pacific Water inflow
that carries with it salt water, freshwater, heat and nutrients that affect the
ocean and sea ice system further downstream. A Bering Strait environmental
observing system would obtain data necessary for documenting seasonal, inter-
annual and spatial variability in Pacific Water and related environmental
variables, and supporting research into understanding their role in the physical
and biological oceanography, and marine ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean and their
response to environmental system change.
