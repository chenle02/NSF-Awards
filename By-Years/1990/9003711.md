As a model to study how plants react to pathogenic attack the response of
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is being investigated.
In response to a variety of pathogenic and chemcial agents tobacco plants
produce large amounts of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins whose synthesis has
been associated with resistance to TMV. This laboratory has focused on the
synthesis, location, and function of the PR1 family of these proteins. Salicylic
acid (SA) has been used extensively as an inducer of PR proteins and local
acquired resistance to TMV. These observations together with the recent finding
that endogenous SA levels rose at least 20-fold in leaves of TMV-resistant, but
not susceptible, tobacco after TMV inoculation suggest that SA may be part of
the natural induction pathway following TMV infection. A major objective is to
determine the role of SA in induction of PR1 genes. This may provide an
important avenue to define intermediate steps in the signal transduction pathway
that leads to the defense response following pathogenic assault. As part of this
analysis the cis acting element(s) and trans acting factor(s) necessary for SA
induction will be defined. Many plants respond to viral infection by the
production of certain proteins which have been termed "pathogenesis-related
proteins". The goal of this research is to understand the molecular signals by
which the genes for pathogenesis-related protein are activated. The results of
this research will contribute to basic knowledge of the mechanisms of plant
defense against viruses.
