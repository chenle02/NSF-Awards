Abstract

Award: DMS-0705428 Principal Investigator: Craig C. Westerland

This research agenda has three parts. In the first, the principal investigator
proposes to study algebraic structures inherent in the geometry of moduli
spaces, particularly those that have not been studied from an operadic point of
view and including several families of moduli spaces from differential geometry,
algebraic geometry, and physics. The second part of the proposal concerns
applications of this study of moduli spaces to objects in homotopy theory,
including equivariant homology for the free loop space on a manifold, string
topology operations for a topological version of cyclic homology, and string
topology of classifying spaces of Lie groups. The third major project will apply
techniques from stable homotopy theory to the study of Hurwitz spaces, in a
collaboration with number theorists.

Moduli spaces are geometric objects that describe the variability of other
geometric objects. For example, any element of the collection of all spheres
centered at the origin in Euclidean three-dimensional space is completely
determined by the radius of the circle, a positive number, so the collection of
all these spheres (each of which is a two-dimensional object) is described by
the positive half of the real number line (a one-dimensional object). A moduli
space of particular interest in this and other ongoing mathematical research
describes the variable geometry of a surface such as the surface of a two-holed
doughnut with several points labeled or marked on it, a construction which
provides access to important questions of quantum field theory, algebra, and
geometry.
