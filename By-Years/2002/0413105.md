This project investigates unsupervised learning of motion models from visual
sequences.&lt;br/&gt;Recovery of detailed motion models would enable numerous
applications of motion recognition, analysis and synthesis in areas such as
surveillance, monitoring, multimedia, as well as understanding of motion in
general. Describing motion is difficult because it requires the knowledge of
motion categories; however, their manual specification is laborious and
automated extraction is aggravated by noise and ambiguous measurements of the
human motion from video. The central goal of this project is to develop methods
and algorithms for grouping and analysis of motion acquired from video sequence
using a unified statistical framework. The framework relies on concepts from
statistical modeling, Bayesian networks (switching linear dynamic systems) and
probabilistic reasoning to develop motion models of sufficient detail, quality,
scalability and robustness that could be used to (1) group motion into
perceptually plausible categories and styles, (2) recognize and predict motion
dynamics, and (3) possibly synthesize natural-looking motion. The utility of the
framework will be evaluated on sequences of human body or hand motion. The novel
methods and algorithms developed in the course of this project may have wide
applicability in many areas that involve modeling and grouping of sequence data,
such as biotechnology and life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
