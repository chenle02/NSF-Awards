The introductory general physics laboratories are ideal environments in which to
introduce modern, automated (computer interfaced) instrumentation and the
analysis of uncertainty in experimental and theoretical results. The results to
be measured and calculated in this project are angular accelerations of metal
disks rotating on air cushions. Having purchased one complete instructional unit
with funds raised by pre-engineering students, faculty have determined that
experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of angular accelerations
agree to within about 0.4%.This project is resulting in the acquisition of five
additional instructional units to be used in all general physics laboratories at
the University of St. Thomas and the introduction of automated instrumentation
and computerized data analysis in these laboratories. Computer results of the
data analysis supplement (not replace) the students' own calculations.NSF grant
funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
