In this proposal, using the classical diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition
systems as one of the basic examples for illustrations, Professor Wei-Ming Ni
intends to systematically study the interactions between diffusion and spatial
variations, with particular emphasis on the effects of varying diffusion rates -
including general shadow systems; that is, the limiting systems when one of the
diffusion rates tends to infinity. Moreover, to handle ecologically more
realistic models, directed movements as well as cross-diffusion systems, created
by either spatial heterogeneity or inter-specific population pressures, will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Spatial variations reflect inhomogeneous or
non-uniform distributions of resources in our environments. In this proposal,
Professor Wei-Ming Ni will first explore the roles of different dispersal rates
and spatial variations, as well as their interactions, in population dynamics of
two or more competing species. Then, directed movements, due to spatial
heterogeneity and/or inter-specific population pressures, will be studied in
order to understand mathematically the basic mechanisms involved, and thereby
enhance the ability of ecologists in modeling ecologically more realistic
situations.
