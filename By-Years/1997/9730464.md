*** *** 9730464 Duch This investigation identifies, explores, and explains the
evolving political and economic preferences of citizens in new African
democracies. How committed are African elites to the political and economic
freedoms introduced by reform movements in the late 1980s and early 1990s? How
popular are liberalization initiatives among ordinary citizens? Beyond these
empirical questions, for which currently there is little information, lie issues
of broad theoretical import. Are there relationships between support for
political democracy and support for a market economy? Are attitudes to reform
manifest in political and economic behavior? At stake here is the emergence of a
political and economic culture that can help a fragile regime of democratic
capitalism to survive and, over the long run, to consolidate. Designed
comparatively, this collaborative investigation elicits individual-level data
from both mass and elite actors by means of national probability sample surveys
in three countries. Data are gathered and analyzed by the investigators each
working closely with a partner research institution in Benin and Ghana. These
countries differ significantly in terms of their colonial experiences, cultural
and ethnic characteristics, recent economic history and endowments, and
institutional experiences. Thus, sub-Saharan Africa offers social scientists a
rich diversity of settings in which to comparatively evaluate explanations of
support for democratic capitalism. ***
