Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0105688&lt;br/&gt;J. McCarthy, University of
Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mixing or segregation of cohesive
granular materials is considered in the context of three particle-level sources
of cohesion: liquid bridge (capillary) formation, Van der Wals forces, or
electrostatic interaction. The method of Particle Dynamic Simulation, already
tested in the simple case of free-flowing powders (no cohesion), will be used to
establish the macroscopic flows which are induced by these microscopic cohesion
effects. Among other results, it will yield the prediciton of mixing or
separation in simple granular flows. Special attention is given to the "liquid
bridge" (or interstitial) modeling, which includes surface tension, pressure and
viscous forces, and the roughness of the surfaces involved.&lt;br/&gt;
