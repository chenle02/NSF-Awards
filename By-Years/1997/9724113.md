9724113 Bush Biosynthetic enrichment with stable isotopes, 13C and 15N, will be
employed in an NMR and molecular modeling study of the conformation and dynamics
of a series of complex polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Data on a
collection of closely related structures will be analyzed to determine the
influence of specific structural features, such as branching and substituent
positions, on the conformation and dynamics of complex polysaccharides. The
strategy of enrichment of the samples with stable isotopes will confer unique
advantages to this research project, making it possible to measure accurate
values of 3JCH, 3 JCC, 2JCC, and 3JHH by 3-dimensional heteronuclear NMR methods
such as HMQC-NOESY, HCCH TOCSY and quantitative coherence transfer. Long range
coupling constants will serve as a direct measure of the dihedral angle of the
glycosidic linkage. Molecular modeling, including molecular dynamics simulation,
will be used to interpret the experimental NOE and coupling constant data.
Enrichment in stable isotopes will make it possible to study the conformation
and dynamics of the oligosaccharides bound to lectins by using NMR spectroscopy
with isotope filters. The research will provide a significant improvement in the
understanding of conformation and dynamics of complex oligosaccharides and their
interaction with specific binding proteins such as lectins, glycosidases and
glycosyl transferases. An improved understanding of oligosaccharide conformation
and dynamics will be valuable in the biotechnology of polysaccharides, which are
widely used as food additives, as well as for other applications in materials
science. ***
