This project will provide support for students to attend the 36th IEEE
International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2016) to be
held in Nara, Japan, June 27-30, 2016. Conference experience is critical for
training undergraduate and graduate students to be well prepared for the
computing workforce of the future. ICDCS is a premier conference and has a wide
coverage of topics in distributed computing. The conference has made significant
impacts to the computing community since it was founded in 1979. The selected
papers have influenced the design and implementation of many distributed
computing systems, software and applications today. Participation in such a
premium conference provides an excellent opportunity for students and junior
faculty members to learn the latest advances in distributed computing and
interact with peers and world-renowned researchers. The availability of travel
grants will be announced widely and the students will be asked to provide a
document detailing how the participation will benefit them.
