This is a Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award. The
research is aimed at understanding the effects of photon irradiation on the
growth of wide-gap zinc selenide compound semiconductors using chemical beam
epitaxy techniques to grow the specimens. The research is being done in
collaboration with Professor Ã•Leslie Koldziejski at the Facility for epitaxial
Growth of Compound Semiconductors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The various photolytic, electronic, and pyrolytic processes associated with the
photo-assisted chemical beam epitaxial process are being studied.
