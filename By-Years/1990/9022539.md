The purpose of this workshop is to explore the state of current research in
Neurocontrol, provide a forum for addressing future research directions, and
coordinate research and development initiatives between the aerospace industry
and academia. Topics of particular interest include: o On-line Learning o Self-
Optimizing Systems and Parameter Identification o Control Space Exploration o
Sensor Fusion and Signal Processing o Flight Control Applications o
Manufacturing and Process Control Applications o Real-Time Hardware
Implementations for above Applications The Workshop will be hosted by Washington
University with the joint sponsorship of the National Science Foundation and
McDonnell Douglas Corporation. Several aerospace companies and governmental
agencies will be represented, as well as academic and corporate research
laboratories.
