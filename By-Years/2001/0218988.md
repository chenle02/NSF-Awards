This study will investigate online investing and virtual investing-related
communities (VICs)looking at two broad research issues: (a) How is information
generated, discussed, and diffused within and across VICs, and how do such
activities impact market efficiency? and (b) How do economic, social and
psychological influences together impact investor adoption, participation, and
satisfaction? The study will involve processing over three million messages
covering 40 stocks from 10 major VICs. The information will be parsed and
categorized, and various hypotheses related to diffusion and market impacts will
be tested. In-depth interviews and a large-scale survey of online investors will
validate a comprehensive model of investor satisfaction. This research
contributes to the information processing and diffusion, rumor propagation,
impact of IT on markets, and individual/group behavior literatures that lie at
the intersection of information systems, psychology, marketing, and economics.
The research results will lay the foundation for the design of software tools
that can detect worrisome types of information flow in real-time. From a
regulatory perspective, an understanding of social and psychological biases and
distorting influences will support the design of regulatory measures that
counter their negative impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
