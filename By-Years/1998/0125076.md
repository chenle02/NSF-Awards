Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;Software simulations enable students to
actively explore and understand scientific and engineering concepts through
visualization and an iterative approach to problem solving. Our project will add
major capabilities to our existing software simulation prototype, The Reactor
Lab. Existing modules are simulations of chemical reactors, but the software
framework is discipline-independent. Our first objective was to add a "lab
construction kit" that has enabled students and faculty to build new
simulations. The software will be integrated with the Internet to allow
distribution of modules for use on- and off-line, to allow sharing of new
modules, and to support communication and collaboration between students and
faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new modules that have been added will
complete those needed for a first course in chemical reaction engineering. The
final objective of our work was to establish and evaluate a prototype community
of lab builders and users. This community will expose faculty and students to
the collaborative working environments that are an increasingly important result
of the Internet. The initial impact of this project was to enhance the education
of chemical engineers and chemists about reactor analysis and design.
Additionally our work should impact the design of efficient and safe chemical
reactors, which is important in fields as diverse as pharmaceutical production
and semiconductor fabrication. Dissemination is being done via annual meetings
of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society for
Engineering Education. Our software has also been listed with the National
Engineering Educational Software Database. Articles will be prepared for
publication in Chemical Engineering Education. Web based data will be collected
to evaluate the number of hits.&lt;br/&gt;
