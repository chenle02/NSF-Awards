&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work entails
several goals: (1) to improve our theoretical understanding of the early
Universe and the different cosmological tools that can be used to probe it, (2)
improve our theoretical understanding of the astrophysical processes that
underlie our cosmological probes and (3) develop techniques to make full use of
existing and upcoming cosmological data sets that can probe fundamental physics.
In particular the PI intends to (1) study how interactions modify the
characterization of the phase transition to eternal inflation in slow-roll
models . (2) Strive to provide an intrinsically quantum mechanical definition of
eternal inflation. (3)Calculate the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations in
single field inflation models to one-loop. (4) Calculate the three-point
function of CMB anisotropies at recombination expected in the absence of
primordial non-Gaussianities. Also calculate the three point function of the
matter density field including GR effects. (5) Apply newly developed analysis
techniques to constrain non-Gaussianities using WMAP 5 year data. (6) Explore
the potential of 21 cm observations to constrain fundamental physics and improve
our modeling of the astrophysical processes that influence this observable. The
broader impacts of the proposal are both scientific and involve educational
outreach. The PI is co-author of CMBFAST, a publicly available code that has
become a standard code used to make theoretical predictions to compare with CMB
data. He has supervised students at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He
has developed a new Cosmology course for sophomores. The PI also routinely gives
public lectures including ones for elementary school students.
