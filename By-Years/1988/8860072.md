Significant numerical computations now commonly require vast processing power.
At the core of many of these problems is the solution of large, sparse systems
of equations. A host of specialized high-speed processors have been developed to
attack large problems. Systolic architectures have proven to be excellent
candidates for a range of tasks, and they promise to continue as powerful
computing tools for some time to come. But, without appropriate algorithm
development, these specialized processors will never reach their full potential.
The most obvious of the missing systolic algorithms are the sparse matrix
methods, including the conjugate gradient techniques (the "technology" that is
arguably the most important advance in large scale scientific computing during
the past decade and the one to come). Phase I will develop a conjugate gradient
method for systolic architectures. Such a method will greatly aid the use of
these architectures: the machine cycles will be used more efficiently as will
the time of the scientists and engineers using them. During Phase II the
theoretical concepts will be extended to include nonsymmetric conjugate gradient
methods and preconditioners.
