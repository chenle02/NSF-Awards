9614357 Kerr This research involves the development of models for estimating the
effects of material variations on the mechanics of earthquake faulting. The
objective is to identify characteristics of surface deformations for
distinguishing between homogeneous and nonuniform models in order to understand
deformation sources at depth in areas where field observations indicate spatial
variations in material properties. 3-D analytical and numerical techniques will
be developed for calculating elastic fields in nonuniform material to
investigate how subsurface variations in elastic moduli influence fault
mechanics. Use of these models in simulations of fault behavior will provide
more realistic calculations of the slip induced elastic fields, such as the
change of the stress state that a slip zone imposes on itself and nearby faults.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
