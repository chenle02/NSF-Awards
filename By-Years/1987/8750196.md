A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), which has recently been acquired
by the Chemistry Department of the University of West Florida is finding
application in six undergraduate courses and in directed student research.
Courses in basic organic chemistry, with a variety of majors, and advanced
organic chemistry, with chemistry and allied health science majors are
significantly enhanced by the availability of this system. Students are enabled
to collect and evaluate firsthand data as, for example, (1) separating and
identifying halocarbons by examining the molecular ions formed, (2)
differentiating between isomers such as methyl p-hydroxybenzoate and
p-methoxybenzoic acid by examining the fragmentation ions, (3) preparing and
analyzing volatile organometallics, and (4) evaluating water supplies for
organic contaminants.
