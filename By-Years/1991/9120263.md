This grant supports studies of the low latitude and equatorial ionosphere and
thermosphere. The main objectives are the understanding of the coupling of low
latitude electrodynamic drifts of high latitude current systems and low latitude
thermospheric neutral winds. These studies rely mostly on equatorial and low
latitude incoherent scatter radar and Fabry- Perot observations. Ionospheric and
protonospheric studies at the Arecibo Observatory will be expanded, and through
extensive collaborative efforts the use of local and global thermospheric,
ionospheric and convection models will be greatly extended. The main areas of
proposed work are: (1) processes controlling the penetration of high latitude
electric fields to low and equatorial latitudes, (2) comparative studies of
ionospheric disturbance electric fields using radar observations and results
from global convection models, (3) coupling of low latitude and equatorial
plasma drifts and neutral winds, (4) day-to-day variability and the effects of
the two-day oscillation in the equatorial thermosphere and on the equatorial
ionization anomaly, (5) high temporal resolution plasma drift measurements over
Arecibo, (6) composition of the low latitude topside ionosphere and
protonosphere, and (7) empirical modeling of the ionospheric electric fields at
middle and low latitudes.
