Cooperating underwater robots must coordinate their actions despite severe
communication bandwidth limits that exist underwater. This proposed research
addresses the coordination of underwater robots through the development of
theoretically justified decentralized control laws that enable a platoon of
autonomous underwater vehicles to cooperatively achieve a common goal while
requiring minimal communication. Fully realistic field trials are a crucial
adjunct to our analytic activities. In a collaborative effort with biologists
and marine scientists, platoons of small, inexpensive, autonomous underwater
vehicles will be deployed in a large coastal estuary to rapidly and adaptively
map bio-active chemicals. Education and outreach will be integrated with the
proposed research through both the development of a new course on the dynamics
and control of underwater robots, and the creation of a new autonomous
underwater vehicle contest for middle school and high school students in
collaboration with colleagues at MIT and the Association of Unmanned Vehicle
Systems International. The intellectual merits of the proposed research include
the development of an improved toolbox of distributed control laws and an
improved understanding of communication requirements for platoons of autonomous
vehicles in unstructured, real-world environments. The broader impacts of this
research effort include: the development of affordable technology that will
enable ocean and marine scientists to conduct scientific investigations that are
not otherwise possible; the development of curriculum, course materials, and
laboratory projects for underwater robotics; and the creation of an autonomous
underwater vehicle contest that is accessible to middle school and high school
students.
