The chemistry laboratory offerings are being upgraded with the acquisition of
Spectronic 20 model D spectrophotometers and Westronics recorders, a Shimadzu UV
spectrophotometer, electronic balances and a Perkin Elmer FT-IR 1600
spectrophotometer. Instrumental methods are being introduced into freshman
courses followed by expanded usage in the sophomore courses. Students are
preparing inorganic and organic compounds and then using the instruments to
characterize them, as well as study their spectroscopic properties. By using
both Spectronic 20's and a recording UV spectrophotometer, students are being
given the opportunity to see the impact that instrumentation can make on a
determination. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
