It is of vital importance that we maintain and evolve the infrastructure that
underlies the modern Internet. A fundamental question within this infrastructure
is that of `packet scheduling' which determines the order in which data is
transmitted across the switches and links that form the Internet's
infrastructure. Packet scheduling is thus a richly explored research topic: as
networks evolve to support new applications and technologies, so do the
requirements placed on packet schedulers, hence researchers and practitioners
alike have continued to develop new schedulers to suit current needs. The
implicit assumption to date has been that new scheduling goals necessitate new
scheduling algorithms. The research being undertaken in this project posits an
alternate viewpoint: rather than design new scheduling algorithms as new needs
emerge, it asks whether there exists a single scheduling algorithm that can be
tuned (i.e., through configuration changes) to match the performance of any
scheduling algorithm. Thus the project addresses a seemingly simple question: Is
there a universal packet scheduling (UPS) algorithm? The results will clarify
the fundamental limits of any packet scheduling algorithm as well as influence
the development of network switch hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existence
of a universal or near-universal packet scheduler could lower the barrier to
evolving network infrastructure and hence contribute to the broader goal of
ensuring that the Internet continues to serve as a transformative communication
service for the nation. The results of the research will be incorporated into
the curriculum for networking courses at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
