9400862 Weiss An ionomer blended with another polymer represents a special class
of copolymer/homopolymer blends in which one of the components carries a charge.
The presence of the ionic species may permit very strong, attractive
intermolecular interactions with another polymer and/or strong intramolecular
repulsions within the ionomer. Either phenomena may induce miscibility of two
otherwise immiscible polymers. This research is directed at the characterization
of the interactions and phase behavior of ionomer/homopolymer blends and
specifically the following three objectives: 1. to understand the macrophase and
microphase behavior of blends in which miscibility results from attractive
intermolecular interactions or respulsive intramolecular interactions; 2. to
define the role of the ionomer counterion, ionic concentration and polymer
molecular weight on the phase behavior and properties of the blends; 3. to
determine the effect of strong attractive or repulsive interactions on the
spinodal decomposition kinetics and the resulting morphology of critical
mixtures. Two systems will be investigated: (1) blends of lightly sulfonated
polystyrene (SPS) and a methylated polyamide and (2) SPS and bisphenol A
polycarbonate. The former is an example of a blend with specific attractive
intermolecular interactions, and the latter is a blend for which miscibility
occurs due to intramolecular repulsive effects. Model systems using low
molecular weight compounds will also be used. The specific experimental
techniques that will be employed include Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, light
scattering, small angle neutron scattering, small angle x-ray scattering,
differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. %%% The work
in this proposal will advance the field of polymer blends. This will lead to
tougher, stronger plastics for use in aerospace, automotive, and household
applications.
