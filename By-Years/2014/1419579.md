The goal of this project is to provide a unique opportunity for database
students to present their research results, learn cutting edge research, and
interact with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and
industry at the ACM SIGMOD 2014 Database Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one
of the most prestigious conferences in data management research, ACM SIGMOD/PODS
has contributed significantly to the advance of all aspects of data management
technologies and applications since 1975. Today ACM SIGMOD is a dynamic and
comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction; and it is a
leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers,
and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results and to exchange techniques,
tools, and experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide partial
support for students from U.S. institutions, especially female and minority
students, to attend and present their research work at ACM SIGMO 2014 in
Snowbird, Utah. Besides meeting with researchers from academia and industry
during regular program sessions, in SIGMOD 2014 students will be able to
participate in the following interactive activities as partially supported by
this project: a new researcher symposium, an undergraduate research poster
competition, face-to-face meetings with leading researchers, and a student
mentoring workshop. These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the
future career of the participants. The broader impact is to train the future
generation of leaders and workforce in the critical field of data management.
