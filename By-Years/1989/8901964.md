A problem at the heart of physics persistently refuses to go away: What happens
to spacetime at big bang and in the gravitational collapse at the center of a
black hole, both of them times beyond which -- according to physics as now
understood -- there is no time? The present work seeks to capitalize on this
difficulty; to turn it into opportunity to win new insight into the foundations
of physics. Tools to do this will include: (1) the classical dynamics of
geometry as seen in the initial- value formulation of J. W. York, (2) the
quantum version of this dynamics as seen in the usual WDW equation, (3) the
quantum theory of measurement as it tells what about the predicted dynamics
makes sense and what does not and (4) the translation of questions and findings
from and into the information-theoretical language of bit counts.
