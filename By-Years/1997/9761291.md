*** Chandra 9761291 This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore a novel technique of using silicon (Si) tubes for the
production of polycrystalline silicon, a material critical for electronics,
photovoltaics, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and many other devices. A
current worldwide shortage of polysilicon material may become acute in the
future. Bulk polysilicon is currently produced by chemical vapor deposition of
Si on a hot thin crystalline silicon rod. The diameter of the rod increases with
the deposition, but the process is very slow in the beginning because of small
surface area. Two different Si tube-based deposition techniques will be
examined. The first will increase yield by 15-20% by allowing deposition on both
inner and outer surfaces of the tube (with simple retrofitting), whereas the
second scheme will lead to a much simpler reactor design with a much reduced
energy requirement, better control, and higher yield. Phase I will establish the
relative feasibility of the two concepts through theoretical research, design
studies, and industrial testing. Potential commercial applications are expected
production of polysilicon in the semiconductor and solar industries ***
