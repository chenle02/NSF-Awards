Algal biofuels have been recognized as one of the preferred alternatives to
fossil fuels. However, algal biofuels are not yet economically viable due to the
high costs of cultivation and downstream processing to yield the finished
product. One of the barriers in the algal biofuel pathway is the harvesting
step. In this study, it is hypothesized that algal biofuel cultivation can be
engineered to utilize DNA as a flocculant for energy-efficient harvesting of the
biomass. During flocculation, the dispersed microalgal cells aggregate and form
larger particles with higher sedimentation rate. The concept of utilizing DNA as
a flocculant in micro algae must be verified and validated for variety of
species. Initial experiments will be conducted to verify this hypothesis at Dr.
Ji-Won Yang's laboratory at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
(KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea.

Current algal biofuels research is focusing on optimizing cultivation and
downstream processing. Hardly any research is addressing the issue of biomass
harvesting which remains a major challenge because it entails separating
microalgae from a medium of nearly identical specific gravity. The validation
that DNA-based flocculation could aid in harvesting of algal biomass and the
quantitative data to be generated in the proposed study can advance knowledge
and understanding as no previous studies have reported on it as a means to
improve the harvesting step in the algal cultivation-to-biofuel process chain.
This research is expected to contribute to efforts to demonstrate the practical
feasibility of algal-based systems for energy production. This NSF EAPSI award
is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.
