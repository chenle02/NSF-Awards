This research is in two topics. The first is the development of supercomputing
algorithms for micro-gravity liquid-metal flows that solve the mass, momentum,
and energy equations for single phase liquid metal transport in space reactor
systems. This work is also sponsored by Cray Research, Inc. The second topic is
investigations into a artificial intelligence method and expert system
technology for certain needs in the nuclear power industry. These include
methodology for processing massive amounts of data and reduction of data to
symbolic knowledge and real-time issues in knowledge based systems.
