Ma&lt;br/&gt;University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city-state relationship
under globalization is problematic to policy makers and scholars of urbanization
and comparative international development. To what extent is there evidence of
growing cross-border articulation of a global system of cities? Just what is the
nature of this relationship between "world cities" and the national states in
which they are geographically situated? To what extent does the world city
system articulate with the international system of nation states? To what extent
does the city system represent a different, competing logic? This project is
designed to address these questions, first by solving difficult data issues and
by then using these data to carefully analyze, quantitatively through new
network modeling procedures, the dimensions of global city networks over time
and their correspondence (or lack of correspondence) to the international system
of states. The research will develop network measures (primarily through inter-
city air transportation data) of the global city network, and it will analyze
these data through novel network analytic procedures. Several research groups
are currently attacking this problem in complementary ways, and this project
will produce substantial synergy with ongoing work on these important
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Study results will be presented
at scholarly meetings and in scholarly journals. Beyond the immediate
intellectual goals of this project, the research will develop a longitudinal
network database consisting of relations among oveer three hundred of the most
important cities in the world. This database will be made publicly available to
other researchers. In addition, the research will provide a new analytic
approach to comparing overlapping and nested, networks, and it will be a key
element in the doctoral training experience in sociology at the University of
Utah.
