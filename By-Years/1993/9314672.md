9314672 Buck Continental margins where the crust is hot or was hot during the
extension do not always match simple lithospheric extension models. The PI will
use a two-dimensional model of thin brittle-plastic crust overriding a thicker
viscous lower crust to learn more about controlling factors of long-term
continental margin development in South China Sea, Aegean Sea, the Woodlark
basin and the Exmouth Plateau.
