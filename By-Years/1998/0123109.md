Fifteen students majoring in computer science or software engineering are
receiving scholarships annually. These academically-talented students are
financially needy and the scholarships are allowing them to undertake fulltime
study. The university in cooperation with local business and industry is
providing internship and cooperative work experiences, career guidance and
opportunities, reviews of software projects and honors theses, and classroom
discussion regarding real world practices. These activities are improving the
academic and professional performance of the scholars and increasing the number
of students continuing on to graduate school.
