9630832 Rudy Nerve cells fire electrical signals, whose frequency is the "Morse
code" by which information is transmitted throughout the nervous system. Key in
determining the firing frequency of neurons are membrane proteins known as
potassium channels. Potassium channels are also important in the regulation of
the rhythmic contraction of the heart. Research funded by this grant
investigates the molecular composition of one type of potassium channel known as
A- type, which is particularly important in the modulation of the firing tempo
of neurons and heart cells. These A-type potassium channels regulate firing
frequency by periodically changing between active and inactive states. Previous
work has shown that the periodicity of activation of A-type potassium channels
depends on small molecules that interact with the channel. The goal of this
project is to isolate and characterize these small components of A-type
potassium channels and identify the genes that encode them. Results from
research is expected to significantly increase the understanding of the
molecular regulation of nervous system function.
