9312252 Muller This proposal concerns the theoretical investigation of the
dynamics of quantum spin systems. It is broken into three related areas: 1)
Dynamics of 1D and 2D quantum antiferromagnets. The numerical technique of
analysis will be the recursion method which makes it possible to extract
information on the gaps in the excitation spectrum, ordering in the ground
state, infrared singularities in spectral densities etc. 2) Transport of spin
fluctuations at high temperature. Spin diffusion will be studied in classical
and quantum systems using a mix of direct simulation and recursion methods. At
stake is the controversy over the long-time behavior of spin relaxation time. 3)
Quantum chaos in spin dynamics. The spin-boson model will be employed for a
study of incipient quantum chaos by looking at the quantum invariants of time
averages of non-conserved observables. This allows for direct comparisons with
manifestations of Hamiltonian chaos in corresponding classical model systems.
%%% The work here involves study of spin (magnetic) systems using a variety of
numerical techniques - the principal of which is the so- called recursion
method. This method has a rich history in condensed matter thoery but has been
applied only recently to spin dynamics. The spin to which we refer is that of
electrons in a lattice; usually "tied" reasonably tightly to lattice sites. Of
particular interest are the dynamics of spin diffusion and of spin relaxation in
model magnetic systems. Lastly, the PI proposes to study the onset of quantum
chaos (ie non-integrability) in spin systems. A methodology is proposed to allow
comparison between quantum systems and their classical counterparts. ***
