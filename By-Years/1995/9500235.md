DMS-9500235 de Souza/Brown This award will continue to partially a program that
has sponsored two mini-conferences on real and harmonic analysis a year since
1986. These conferences are held at Auburn University, and attracts participants
primarily form the southeastern states. These meetings have enjoyed a steady
increase in level of participation and served as a stimulant for activity in
both the geographic and academic area. Harmonic analysis combines those elements
of mathematics best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis. One seeks to decompose
complex problems into fundamental components. These components are then analyzed
for their basic characteristics. Finally, the solution is reconstructed through
a recombination of the components. The Fourier series and Fourier transform are
examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other representing a
continuous decomposition. More recently the theory of oscillatory integrals
added new dimensions to some of the more classical approaches to harmonic
analysis.
