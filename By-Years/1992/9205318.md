The principal investigator will study the Galeras Volcanic Complex, Columbia,
utilizing geologic/petrologic/isotopic techniques. He will attempt to understand
this volcanic complex in the context of other volcanoes in the region. He will
attempt to understand the functioning of the present volcanic center; this will
have import- ant scientific consequences, as well as important consequences for
residents threatened by the volcano. The PI will investigate degassing and
associated seismicity, the amount and source of released volatiles, and he will
address eruption forecasting for this region.
