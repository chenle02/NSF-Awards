This proposal describes a broad research program aimed at investigating the
consequences of a new perspective on the foundations of algebraic K-theory and
on the theory of trace maps to topological Hochschild and cyclic homology (THH
and TC). It has long been known that in some sense algebraic K-theory is an
invariant of the homotopy theory of the category of modules; this idea can be
made precise in terms of a motivic perspective, which views the geometry of
rings and schemes as encoded in their categories of modules, making such module
categories the central object of study. The PI will develop this perspective to
establish conjectures old and new, dramatically advancing our understanding of
algebraic K-theory and its deep role in topology, geometry, and arithmetic. The
work relies in part on new technology in homotopy theory: the emerging theory of
infinity categories and tools arising from the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel solution of
the Kervaire invariant one conjecture. The PI also proposes to develop a program
to identify undergraduates interested in mathematics and encourage them to
pursue graduate work in the mathematical sciences. The program will expose
participants to a novel curriculum emphasizing learning by discovery. The
proposed curriculum, incorporating pedagogical techniques from "inquiry-based
learning", is based on a software environment supporting an innovative treatment
of elementary linear algebra and algebraic topology via guided exploration.

The proposed research will advance our current understanding of the bridge
between algebra and high-dimensional geometry. Some aspects of the proposed
research will have impact on mathematical physics, particularly the study of
topological field theories and string theory. The educational program will
enhance the development of mathematically trained undergraduates and will
leverage the University of Texas' existing strengths in recruiting talented
undergraduates from traditionally under-represented groups.
