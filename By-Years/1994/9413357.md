Marine animals can have difficulties seeing well in the submarine environment,
where light intensity, color range, and object contrast are all lower than in
air. Nevertheless many marine animals have excellent vision, and one of the most
complex eyes known is the compound eye of a crustacean called the mantis shrimp.
This eye contains several classes of photoreceptors that include roughly 8
photopigments for color vision, another more than half dozen classes of
polarization detectors, and a sensitive system of ultraviolet receptors. This
work takes new technology of electro-optical devices into the field to explore
the properties of the visual world underwater, and to use behavioral activity to
assess visual perception. Using these animals as a model biological system, the
work will clarify the evolution of visual adaptations for contrast enhancement
and image analysis in difficult visual environments. Results will have broad
impact on visual neuroscience, neuroethology, and comparative evolutionary
studies; will have relevance to studies of ecological habitat and water quality;
and will be important for suggesting new engineering approaches to machine
vision.
