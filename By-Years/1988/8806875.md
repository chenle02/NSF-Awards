This is a research equipment grant for the purchase of an RF sputtering system.
This equipment will be used for research on surface acoustic wave (SAW)
microsensors for gas detection, including hydrogen sulfide. Other projects
include the use of SAW sensors for polyimide films, novel low loss SAW filters
and SAW waveguides on anisotropic substrates. These sensors use both metallic
and dielectric films.
