This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program is to Dr.
Sheldon G. Shore of the Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University, for
synthesis of new transition metal carbonyl cluster compounds. The number of
metals in the cluster used as the starting material is typically six, and metals
are Ru or Os. Loss of CO from known clusters results in new species which can be
utilized in the synthesis of mixed metal clusters containing seven metal atoms.
Attempts will be made to encapsulate boron into the mixed-metal clusters thus
formed. Additional target molecules result from reaction of lanthanide cations
with ruthenium, iron, and iron-ruthenium carbonylates. In a second part of the
project, the behavior of clusters on magnesia surfaces will be investigated,
especially with respect to proton transfer, thermal degradation, and reaction
with hydrogen. %%% This project involves the development of new synthetic
methods for metallic and bimetallic carbonyls. Some of the species prepared will
be used to produce metal cluster compounds containing electron-deficient boranes
or carboranes. Others will be reacted with solid magnesia to model surface
reactions. This work has application both to understanding bonding and
reactivity of organometallic compounds and to heterogeneous catalysis.
