A program at research that is required to certify standard reference materials
for carbon dioxide measurements in sea water will be conducted. Such standards
are needed to ensure adequate quality control of the measurements of carbon
dioxide planned as part of the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS), and of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The standards are primarily to prescribe
total dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity, but also encompass the
equilibrium partial pressure of CO2 and pH. Particular stress will be placed on
the use of appropriate primary standards to control the various laboratory
procedures, and on demonstrating that the various measurements are consistent
with a model for the chemistry of acidbase processes in sea water. This approach
will help to ensure the accuracy as well as the precision of the measurements
used to certify such standard reference materials.
