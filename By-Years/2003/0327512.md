A coupled model which accounts for the large-scale dynamics of a solar coronal
mass ejection (CME), and the small-scale energetics of the radiation from
associated flaring loop-like structures will be developed. The conventional ad
hoc heating function usually applied to the loops will be replaced with an
analytical model based on parameters determined from the onset and initial
evolution of the CME. This effort makes it possible to relate the temperature
and dynamics of flare loops to the propagation and evolution of CMEs. Because it
will have to account simultaneously for both the CME and flare observations,
this coupled model will be severely constrained and potentially calibrated by
solar observations. If the model turns out to be successful in this regard, it
could be used to forecast the properties of the CMEs, e.g., their speed and the
strength of the embedded magnetic field) from the characteristics of the
associated flare radiation.
