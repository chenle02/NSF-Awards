9726700 Dolan With this planning grant, the staff of the Bucks County Historical
Society will work with a group of museum professionals and community
representatives to develop plans for interactive exhibits that have science and
math content that will be placed in an outdoor park. They want visitors to learn
about the science, history, and aesthetics of early American hand tools and
technology by experiencing various hands-on activities. The planning activities
will include meetings of the planning committees, front-end evaluation, and the
testing of some prototype activities. At the end of the twelve month planing
period they will have 1) a better understanding of their audience and their
knowledge of the science and technology to be presented in the exhibit, 2) a
schematic design for the activities to be included in the park, 3) plans for
complementary educational activities, and 4) results of prototype testing of
selected activities
