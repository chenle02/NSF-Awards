This is a detailed study of two synorogenic conglomerates that were deposited
in response to thrust faulting in the Rocky Mountain foreland and the
Cordilleran thrust belt in northeastern Utah and northwestern Wyoming. The chief
objectives of the proposed work will be to develop facies models for thrust-
generated alluvial-fan deposits and to develop quantitative provenance models
for synorogenic conglomerates. Standard sedimentologic, petrographic and
palynologic data will be collected and the three-dimensional distribution of
architectural facies elements within each fan deposit will be determined by
detailed facies mapping in large, three-dimensional exposures. Results of the
work will provide a comprehensive model for the unroofing of thrust-faulted
uplifts and consequent deposition of alluvial-fan sediments in adjacent basins.
In addition, the proposed work will yield important new data to constrain major
episodes of thrusting in the Cordillera of northeastern Utah and the Rocky
Mountain foreland of northwestern Wyoming.
