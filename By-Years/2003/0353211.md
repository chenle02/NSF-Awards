The investigators will continue development of a coupled global magnetosphere-
ionosphere-thermosphere circulation model and to make it accessible to the
scientific community. The model will be expanded to include an adaptive mesh and
will be made more robust and user friendly. Extensive testing, model-data
comparisons, and establishing baseline metrics of the model's performance will
be an integral part of the development effort. The model results will be made
available to the scientific community via the Internet, and runs on demand will
be executed for selected events. Data analysis and visualization tools are also
provided to make optimal use of the model. The project also includes the
acquisition, installation, and maintenance of a new Beowulf computer cluster at
UCLA. The model will be used to study the space weather effects resulting from
disturbances in the solar wind. This is important for improving the ability to
mitigate the potential hazards on technical systems on earth due to solar
disturbances.&lt;br/&gt;
