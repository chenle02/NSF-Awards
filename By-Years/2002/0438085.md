This award supports the second EarthScope Education and Outreach (E&amp;O)
workshop in August 2002 to formalize responsibilities and identify outstanding
needs of the nationally distributed E&amp;O program. The workshop will provide
more concrete direction for developing the program and sustaining it over the
next decade. The draft E&amp;O program plan, based on recommendations from the
E&amp;O workshop and continuing community discussion, will provide the starting
point for the August workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide an
opportunity for community discussion and revision of the draft program plan and
for determining the appropriate mechanisms for electing the E&amp;O Steering
Committee once EarthScope is funded. The workshop must bring together both the
community of E&amp;O providers and the community of E&amp;O audiences. The
participants for this meeting will be chosen by the E&amp;O Steering Committee
and the Workshop Planning Group to have adequate representation of EarthScope
scientific and facility leadership; state and federal geologic surveys and
hazard mitigation groups; museums; parks and other informal educators; K-16
educators; education and outreach specialists; and NSF and NASA representatives.
