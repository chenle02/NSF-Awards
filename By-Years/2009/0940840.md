Learning, Pattern Recognition VLPR 2009 Institution: Princeton University
Abstract Date: 05/21/09

The 1st Sino-USA Summer School in Vision, Learning and Pattern Recognition
(VLPR2009) is the first NSF-sponsored summer school in China that brings
together leading American and Chinese researchers and students in the field of
computer vision and machine learning for a week of educational and cultural
exchange program. The summer school will be held on the campus of Peking
University in Beijing, China. This award will provide travel support for
American researchers and students to attend the summer school. The summer school
provides a forum for not only technical interactions but also culture exchanges
among researchers and students from two countries.
