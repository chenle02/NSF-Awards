This is a workshop proposal to provide funding for a Research Colloquium on
Indigenous Knowledge Systems. The purpose of the workshop is to convene an
international, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural network of scholars to
assess the current state of knowledge and develop a proactive research agenda
aimed at extending our understanding of indigenous knowledge. In addition, the
Program has asked that the workshop attendees consider the topic of an
Indigenous Knowledge Observation Network as they outline an agenda for future
research.
