Abstract Junge

The starting point of this project on 'Lp estimates in noncommutative
probability and analysis' are recent results and techniques from noncommutative
martingales inequalities obtained by Pisier/Xu, Randrianantoanina, Junge and
Junge/Xu. This new insight enables us to show a noncommutative analog the
maximal ergodic theorem for completely positive maps and study square function
inequalities in this setting (joint work with LeMerdy/Xu). The formulation and
properties are motivated by the theory of Operator Spaces. On the other hand
martingale inequalities are crucial in understanding independent, indiscernable
and exchangeable sequences in noncommutative Lp spaces and properties of almost
uniform convergence. Martingale inequalities and noncommutative probability are
also fundamental tools in analyzing the operator space OH and its realization in
the predual of type III von Neumann algebras. These techniques are similar to
those used by Pisier/Shlyaktenko in proving the noncommutative version of
Grothendieck's inequality. Surprising the analog of the 'little Grothendieck
inequality' in the context of operator spaces only holds up to a logarithmic
factor.

Quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and mathematical
models realizing these phenomena changed not only our perception of the world
but also the mathematical discipline. Many noncommutative (=quantum)
generalizations of classical mathematical theories for example the theory of
quantum groups and noncommutative (=quantum) probability theory. Very
interesting new phenomena and difficulties arise when adopting classical
concepts to this noncommutative framework. Noncommutative measure theory and the
theory of von Neumann algebras provide plenty of examples of genuinely new
phenoma. Indeed, von Neumann's motivation for his work on operator algebras (now
called von Neumann algebras) was to provide a good mathematical foundation for
quantum mechanics. In this tradition the theory of Operator Spaces provides the
right language for quantizing Banach spaces, a notion developed to describe the
spaces of solutions of differential equations. For example, using this language
it is now possible to talk about the expected exit time for a noncommutative
domain although we can never see the 'points' of this domain. As a long term
perspective these mathematical theories provide new features which may be used
to understand phenomena in physics and other natural sciences.
