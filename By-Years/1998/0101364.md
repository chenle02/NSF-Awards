DMS-0101364&lt;br/&gt;Gunnar Carlsson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of
this project is to develop flexible &lt;br/&gt;topological methods which will
allow the analysis of data &lt;br/&gt;which is difficult to analyze using
classical linear methods. &lt;br/&gt;Data obtained by sampling from highly
curved manifolds or &lt;br/&gt;singular algebraic varieties in Euclidean space
are typical &lt;br/&gt;examples where our methods will be useful. We intend to
&lt;br/&gt;develop and refine two pieces of software which have been
&lt;br/&gt;written by members of our research group, ISOMAP (Tenenbaum)
&lt;br/&gt;and PLEX (de Silva-Carlsson). ISOMAP is a tool for dimension
&lt;br/&gt;reduction and parameterization of high dimensional data sets,
&lt;br/&gt;and PLEX is a homology computing tool which we will use in
&lt;br/&gt;locating and analyzing singular points in data sets, as well
&lt;br/&gt;as estimating dimension in situations where standard methods
&lt;br/&gt;do not work well. We plan to extend the range of
&lt;br/&gt;applicability of both tools, in the case of ISOMAP by
&lt;br/&gt;studying embeddings into spaces with non-Euclidean metrics,
&lt;br/&gt;and in the case of PLEX by building in the Mayer-Vietoris
&lt;br/&gt;spectral sequence as a tool Both ISOMAP and PLEX will be
&lt;br/&gt;adapted for parallel computing. We will also begin the
&lt;br/&gt;theoretical study of statistical questions relating to
&lt;br/&gt;topology. For instance, we will initiate the study of
&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional homology of subsets sampled from
&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space under various sampling hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;The key
object of study will be the family of Cech &lt;br/&gt;complexes constructed
using the distance function in &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space together with a
randomly chosen finite &lt;br/&gt;set of points in Euclidean space.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop tools for
&lt;br/&gt;understanding data sets which are not easy to understand
&lt;br/&gt;using standard methods. This kind of data might include
&lt;br/&gt;singular points, or might be strongly curved. The &lt;br/&gt;data is
also high dimensional, in the sense that each &lt;br/&gt;data point has many
coordinates. For instance, we might &lt;br/&gt;have a data set whose points each
of which is an image, &lt;br/&gt;which has one coordinate for each pixel. Many
standard &lt;br/&gt;tools rely on linear approximations, which do not work
&lt;br/&gt;well in strongly curved or singular problems. The kind &lt;br/&gt;of
tools we have in mind are in part topological, in &lt;br/&gt;the sense that they
measure more qualitative properties &lt;br/&gt;of the spaces involved, such as
connectedness, or the &lt;br/&gt;number of holes in a space, and so on. This
group of &lt;br/&gt;methods has the capability of recognizing the number
&lt;br/&gt;of parameters required to describe a space, without
&lt;br/&gt;actually parameterizing it. These methods also have the
&lt;br/&gt;capability of recognizing singular points (like points
&lt;br/&gt;where two non-parallel planes or non-parallel lines
&lt;br/&gt;intersect), without actually having to construct
&lt;br/&gt;coordinates on the space. We will also be further
&lt;br/&gt;developing and refining methods we have already
&lt;br/&gt;constructed which can actually find good parameterizations
&lt;br/&gt;for many high dimensional data sets. Both projects will
&lt;br/&gt;involve the adaptation for the computer of many methods
&lt;br/&gt;which have heretofore been used in by-hand calculations
&lt;br/&gt;for solving theoretical problems. We will also initiate
&lt;br/&gt;the theoretical development of topological tools in a setting
&lt;br/&gt;which includes errors and sampling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
