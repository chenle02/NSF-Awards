Algebraic geometry is a central area of mathematics that studies varieties,
which are geometric objects defined by systems of polynomial equations. Moduli
theory aims to understand specific varieties by considering how they behave in a
family of such varieties. In particular, a moduli space consists of all
geometric objects of a particular type. This research project consists of
problems that arise from the fruitful interactions between algebraic geometry
and new developments in other fields of mathematics such as combinatorics, which
is concerned with organizing and analyzing discrete structures. This project
will fund undergraduate research and the PI will continue efforts towards
broadening participation of members of underrepresented groups in the
mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects aim to better
understand moduli spaces that are combinatorially rich in nature and their
cohomology theories. Fundamental objects of investigation include degeneracy
loci, homogeneous spaces such as Grassmannians and flag varieties, the affine
Grassmannian, and the moduli space of curves. More specifically, projects
include the study of degeneracy loci and their motivic classes, with
applications to Brill-Noether theory; quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory of
homogeneous spaces and connections to the affine Grassmannian; base point free
classes on the moduli space of curves arising from Gromov-Witten theory and from
representation theory; and other problems in algebraic geometry and algebraic
combinatorics, including several for undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
