Spectral methods have been widely applied to the study of transient and
turbulent flows, yet their scope of application has been limited by their
inability to treat discontinuous problems on nonsmooth domains. This project
will serve to reduce these two restrictions. It will design oscillation-free
spectral methods to simulate chemically reacting flows, especially the
detonation waves and the transition from deflagration to detonation. Spectral
shock fitting methods will be applied to study the interaction of a detonation
wave and disturbances. Essentially non-oscillatory approximations will be used
to resolve the high gradients and discontinuities in the solutions. The domain
restrictions will be eased by combining the spectral element methods with the p-
and the h-p version of the finite element method. Then the combined method will
be applied to general elliptic equations on nonsmooth domains, and the results
will be used to simulate flows in irregular channels.
