9318850 Shell Adrian College requests support from NSF for a connection of its
campus network to Michnet and NSFNET. Michnet is the midlevel network located in
the state of Michigan that will provide operations and network information
services. It will give Adrian College a 56 thousand bits per second connection
to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to
access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able
to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
