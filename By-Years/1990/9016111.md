Professor Parson is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study reactions of atoms and molecules by crossing one
molecular beam with another. The products are to be detected by
chemiluminescence and laser-induced fluorescence so that the energy states in
which the products are formed can be determined. These studies will map out the
elementary steps which make up the chemical reaction. Molecular beam studies of
reactions of Group VA atoms, clusters, and hydrides with halogens and oxidizers
will be carried out. Products will be detected by electronic chemiluminescence
or laser-induced fluorescence, and the Group VA molecular beam composition will
be manipulated by a combination of thermal, electric discharge, and
photodissociation techniques. The results should be relevant to understanding
mechanisms in bulk reaction systems. In addition to identifying important
elementary steps, single collision studies will provide information about the
disposal of reaction energy in products. By accessing different potential
surfaces with variable collision energy, major characteristics of those surfaces
can be inferred.
