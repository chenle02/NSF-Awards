Dr. Karl O. Christe, Chemistry Department, University of Southern California, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division for studies of high energy compounds and nonmetal main
group chemistry. The project will concentrate on an exploration of polynitrogen,
nitramine, and difluoramide chemistry; the preparation of high-nitrogen
compounds; and the development of quantitative Lewis Acid and Base scales to
relate protic and non-protic acids and bases. Theoretical ab initio calculations
will be done along with the experimental work to analyze bonding
relationships.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project joins theory with exceedingly
difficult experimental work and physical characterization and aims at a
fundamental understanding of high-energy molecules. It has potential
significance to the production and understanding of high energy density
materials for propulsion and energy storage. The PI is one of the few
investigators working in these areas and the project will serve as a training
ground for young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
