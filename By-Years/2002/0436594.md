The Colorado State University will create and produce "Riverwebs," a one-hour
documentary video exploring the hidden mysteries of streams, their intricate
food webs and the linkages between streams and forest ecosystems. This project
will communicate a body of international and interdisciplinary research on
streams in the United States and Japan, and also explore the human experience of
doing science. Major film themes are an introduction to stream life, the
exploration of stream food webs, and the motivations, friendships and
collaborative achievements of stream scientists. By interweaving natural
history, scientific and human themes, a holistic story emerges. At the heart of
this story is humankind's inherent close relationship with nature, our desire to
understand its complexity and our responsibility for its well-being.
