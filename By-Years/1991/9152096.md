The project's goal is to provide a networked engineering laboratory with unique
computer-aided instruction (CAI) and CAD capability. The laboratory is expected
to transform a traditional two-dimensional paper and pencil instructional
environment to an integrated three-dimensional dynamic computer-aided
instructional and design environment for teaching of the combination of
traditional engineering graphics instruction enhanced by computer-aided
instruction and visualization and three-dimensional computer-aided design and
drafting (CADD), in addition to computer-aided logistics (CALS) techniques. The
laboratory also provides students and faculty with the tools to implement 3D
CADD and solid modeling-based visualization techniques in an advanced, modern
integrated engineering design graphics (EDG) curriculum.
