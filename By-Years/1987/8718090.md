This is a one-day conference to bring together, for the first time, both the
directors of biotechnology research centers and the State and local officials
charged with developing and funding these centers, as well as their industry
partners and interested Federal officials; to recognize the contributions these
programs are already making to technological innovation in biotechnology
(including medical, agricultural, marine, and bioelectronics) and their vital
role in ensuring U.S. competitiveness in commercial biotechnology; to identify
resources and programs made available by the Federal Government, particularly as
they relate to exports and technology marketing in Japan and Europe; to permit
these individuals to share their experiences, identify common needs and
problems, and set an agenda for future cooperation.
