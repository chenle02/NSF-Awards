Biomedical engineering (BME) is one of the fastest growing fields, with an
expected job growth rate that is twice that of the overall job growth rate in
the US. However, there are only 22 schools offering accredited undergraduate
degrees in BME, and most schools do not have the resources to offer new degree
programs. The resulting gap between the demand for qualified BME professionals
and the programs for educating them constitutes a significant, yet unmet,
national need. Our goal has been to develop a new educational paradigm to help
reduce this gap. Our paradigm is based on a general method for introducing novel
multidisciplinary content into core engineering curriculum. Our methodology
consists of the integration of content specific laboratory experiments into core
courses to provide essential background, followed by an elective providing
topical depth. BME is used as the novel content and electrical and/or computer
engineering (ECE) as the core curriculum. The method is versatile, as it can be
easily modified to integrate other novel multidisciplinary content into any
engineering program to provide a better-rounded engineering education. The
implementation of this method has two specific objectives: first to provide ECE
students with fundamental and contemporary BME knowledge for future career and
graduate study opportunities; and second to improve students' interest in and
comprehension of ECE concepts by acquainting them with engineering solutions to
real world problems in medicine. These objectives are being achieved by
integrating a set of experiments - designed to demonstrate a wide spectrum of
BME concepts - into core ECE courses, along with a new elective providing a
comprehensive BME overview. A major outcome of our project is a learning
paradigm, which can serve as a model for integrating novel content into core
engineering curriculum. The full development of our approach will serve as a
building block for future undergraduate minor / concentration programs in a
variety of novel content areas, such as biomedical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
