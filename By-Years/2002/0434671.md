This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolution of
introns in untranslated regions of genes". Using predictions and insight from
theoretical population genetics, this project seeks ultimately to provide
creative methods and results for studying the evolution of traits in long-lived
plants, where generation times make existing methods impractical if not
impossible. The current focus is on the use of informatics tools to explore the
evolution of untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes, and specifically the
evolution of introns within UTRs. Introns are regions of genes that are removed
prior to their translation into proteins, and mistakes in the removal of introns
are implicated in about one-third of human diseases. Genome sequence data will
be used from many separate species to explore the effect of population size, and
genome features, on the structure and evolution of introns. A publicly available
database of introns found in UTRs is being constructed, as are several software
tools that will be of use to evolutionary and genome biologists.

The training goals are to learn the theories of genome evolution and the
techniques of genome biology. In combination with the Fellow's extensive
experience in both evolutionary genetics and software engineering, the
fellowship will provide a solid foundation for robust, comprehensive design of
large bioinformatics projects.
