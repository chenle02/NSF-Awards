Based on research that pinpoints the basic deficiency of current empirical
learning algorithms, the proposed project will develop a principled system to
complement them. The combination of traditional with new algorithms is designed
to improve overall system speed, accuracy, and generality. To develop a general
learning system that will perform well over many kinds of concepts, domains, and
situations, this project will: design a uniform approach that reduces "hard"
concept learning to the problem of learning "easy" concepts that current systems
can manage; allow flexible learning despite varied learning situations,
including uncertainty, incremental demands, and differing amounts and kinds of
knowledge; demonstrate in several ways the utility of the approach, including
progress on significant problems such as protein folding. In a new architecture
for concept learning, the project will: speed reliable learning by using a
uniform approach (essentially a single algorithm) in several stages of
progressive, "layered" construction from lower level components, using and
acquiring different kinds of knowledge in appropriate information structures.
