This Department is purchasing several pieces of equipment to: (a) support
recent curricular changes, (b) replace antiquated existing equipment and (c)
allow majors access to research experiences that are difficult or impossible to
obtain with current holdings. There are four basic types of equipment: (1) audio
equipment -- a 6W speech analysis system and Ensonique sound synthesis system to
allow students to modify and analyze human speech, environmental, musical, and
animal sounds in a wide variety of course and independent research settings; (2)
video equipment -- the Gerbrand presentation system and Coreco Image processor
to allow students to create, flexibly present, and analyze visual images for the
study of human cognition and perception; (3) the Biocomp 2001 to allow students
to measure the physiological indices of arousal relevant to both biological
psychology and social-personality; (4) artificial intelligence -- a Hero 2000
robot and NEXPERT expert system shell to allow students research experience with
two of the most burgeoning areas of inquiry in science today -- robotics and
artificial intelligence. The Department has already had considerable success
with its research- oriented approach. The proposed equipment allows the
Department to fully implement this approach.
