Image and signal processing laboratory experiments support major study courses
of the upper-division undergraduate programs in electrical engineering and
computer engineering. They offer students powerful techniques and tools to
apply, synthesize, design, simulate, and implement state-of-the-art solutions to
modern engineering problems. This project provides laboratory equipment capable
of supporting experiments in image processing. The equipment also enhances
educational capabilities in the area of digital signal processing. Such
educational capabilities in image and signal processing are critical to
technical leadership of U.S. industry. The new equipment establishes three PC-
based workstations to support eight programmed experiments based on classical
and modern approaches to image processing. The equipment also expands
capabilities of design projects at the senior level.
