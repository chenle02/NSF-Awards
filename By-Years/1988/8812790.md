The objective of this project is to develop an algorithm for deriving concise
behavioral descriptions of machine behavior from machine structure. Past work
has led to a simulator that can analyze a wide variety of mechanisms
kinematically, and simulate many of them to see what they will do. The simulator
will be generalized, and used to run a loop analyzer that posits and tests
regularities in behavior in order to produce hypotheses about what the mechanism
will do indefinitely far into the future.
