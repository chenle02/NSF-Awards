Research and development into quantum computers raises many new challenges for
security and privacy. For instance, large-scale quantum computers would
compromise much of the cryptography used to secure the Internet today. This
project's novelty is in developing new and systematic approaches for
constructing advanced cryptographic primitives that remain robust even in the
presence of sophisticated quantum adversaries. The project's impacts are in
enabling and realizing new and secure cryptographic primitives and mechanisms to
safeguard our critical digital infrastructure from the potential threat posed by
quantum computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is on lattice-
based cryptography, a popular class of mathematical assumptions believed to be
resistant against quantum attacks. This project investigates new constructions
of core cryptographic primitives, such as zero-knowledge proof systems,
pseudorandom functions, and software watermarking from standard lattice-based
assumptions. These primitives are important building blocks in systems for
outsourcing computations in the cloud as well as for protecting against
unauthorized distribution of software. In addition, the investigator develops
new cryptography courses and advises undergraduate and graduate students to
prepare them with the expertise necessary for designing the next generation of
secure computing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
