This is a project to study the fine-scale tectonics of the Kane Fracture Zone
from 0 to 80 my as a response to changes in plate motion. The work will be
accomplished by performing SeaMARC II profiles along the east and west limbs of
the fracture zone. Track lines will be run at an angle to the trend of the
fracture zone in order to obtain maximum information from the SeaMARC imaging. A
deep-towed magnetometer will also be used in order to provide age control on
structuralfeatures that appear on conjugate limbs of the fracture zone. The
principal products of the research will be a determination of the fine-scale
limit at which the KFZ records changes in plate motion, an improved
understanding of whether/or in what circumstances the FZ response occurred
synchronously and/or symmetrically at the two RTIs. The work will also begin to
provide a data base for examining Global plate interactions.
