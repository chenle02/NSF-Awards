Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1854, B. Riemann introduced the notion of
curvature for spaces with a family of inner products (Riemannian metrics). In
1918, P. Finsler studied the variation problem for spaces with a family of norms
(Finsler metrics).&lt;br/&gt;Recently significant progress in Riemann-Finsler
geometry has been made by mathematicians around the world. In particular. many
non-trivial examples of Finsler metrics of scalar (or constant) flag curvature
have been constructed and several local classification theorems have been
obtained.&lt;br/&gt;Riemann-Finsler geometry also has applications in other
areas such as mathematical psychology, general relativity, PDE, navigation
problems, imaging process, and module spaces, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference will provide a platform for mathematicians to communicate with each
other and discuss the research projects for the future.&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile,
this conference will provide a great opportunity for mathematicians in USA to
understand Riemann-Finsler geometry and find motivation to work in this
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
