Abstract Gilgenbach CTS-9522282 The PI proposes to extend his work on pulsed
laser ablation to the new film growth method of channel-spark pulsed electron
beam ablation. The objectives would be to develop a knowledge base and scaling
laws on electron beam ablation, which can be compared to laser ablation and thus
evaluate new engineering applications. Five research tasks will be addressed.
These include: (1) electron beam characterization, energy deposition mechanisms
and electrical efficiency; (2) diagnostic characterization, using laser and
optical techniques, of species composition (atoms, ions and electrons); (3)
particulate and molten droplet generation mechanisms, size and density; (4)
effects of electron transport, focusing, and plasma chemistry in background
gases; and (5) electron beam ablative deposition of thin films and correlation
with diagnostics. Where applicable comparisons will be made with the
corresponding laser ablation results. The electron beams will be generated using
a channel-spark device in which high currents (~1.5 kA),and moderate voltages
(~20 keV) are employed, resulting in beam energy of approximately 1 J/pulse. The
PI plans to carry out both experimental and modeling efforts during the course
of this investigation.
