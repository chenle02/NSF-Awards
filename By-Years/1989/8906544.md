The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens created extensive devastated landscape
that are undergoing varying degrees of recovery. This has provided ecologists
with a unique opportunity to study plant colonization of pristine landscapes.
The post- eruption landscape had various modes of disturbance, ranging from
tephra to mudflows to incandescent pumice. Rate and direction of plant recovery
have been similarly heterogeneous. This research proposes to continue long-term
studies of the heterogeneous recovery process of vegetation. There will be three
components (i) monitoring of permanent plots and permanent grids for seed fall,
nutrients and substrate moisture; (ii) performing experimental habitat
alterations and density manipulations of pioneer plant species; and (iii)
modeling to build a conceptual framework for determining probabilities species
establishment. By examining the recovery process in a variety of environments,
using common methods of data collectionand analysis, a comprehensive picture
will be constructed of primary succession on Mount St. Helens in particular, and
of primary succession, in general,
