This award is partial support of the 2019 Foundations of Process Analytics and
Machine Learning (FOPAM) conference on August 5-9, 2019 in Raleigh, North
Carolina. The aim of this conference is to bring together industry and academic
researchers to discuss the current status and future directions in data
analytics and machine learning relevant to the chemical process industries. The
funds will provide support to junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate
students that may not have the financial support to attend the workshop. The
conference also will include optional educational workshops.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the topic of data analytics
tools as applied to problems encountered in the chemical process industries. The
tools can be applied to processes regardless of whether the underlying phenomena
are biological, physical, or chemical. The conference will address topics in
data analytics and high-throughput data process for process monitoring and
diagnosis; machine learning for process and control design; computational
chemistry/materials analytics; reinforcement learning as applied to process
operations and control; and, synergies among process, materials, business, and
supply chain data analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
