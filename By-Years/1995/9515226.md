Morris 9515226 All electrically excitable cells, such as those in the brain and
other organs, are constantly receiving chemical signals in the form of
neurotransmitters and hormones. These chemical messengers interact with specific
proteins, called receptors, on the outer surface of their target cells and
through changes brought about by the activation of these receptors, transmit
their message into the workings of the cell. The studies proposed by Dr. Morris
study one such message system, the dopamine D2 receptor system. Dopamine is a
small molecule which is crucial for brain communication and organismal function,
particularly movement. Dr. Morris and his colleagues are using sophisticated
molecular biological techniques to develop an easily accessible model system in
which to study the events that occur in a cell subsequent to dopamine binding to
its cognizant receptor. This work will provide a detailed understanding of the
basic molecular mechanisms activated by a neurotransmitter binding to its
receptor and will have major implications on revealing how the brain encodes
chemical information and its translation.
