This proposal would provide computer resources to support three research
programs in the Mathematical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Bangerth will
work on the computational solution of non-linear inverse problems in tomography
arising from biomedical imaging. Of particular interest is the optimization of
experimental set-up that may involve tuning hundreds to thousands of design
parameters. Carroll will work on nutritional epidemiology and genome-wide
association studies. While statistical analysis of empirical data is feasible on
a simple multicore machine, current methodology requires the performance of
statistical methods to be tested on very large ensembles of simulated data.
Sottile and Teitler will take advantage of cluster computing to compute local
invariants of algebraic varieties, undertake a census of Galois groups of
hundreds of thousands of geometric problems, and continue large-scale testing of
conjectures in real Schubert calculus.

The primary computer resources requested are 16 additional nodes for the
126-node Texas A&M University Brazos Cluster, which is optimized to perform the
large number of single node/processor computations this research requires. This
Brazos cluster is a high-throughput cluster created in the Summer of 2008,
pooling the resources of five stakeholder research groups in four different
colleges (Agriculture and Life Sciences, Engineering, Geosciences, and Science)
and the Academy for Advanced Telecommunications and Learning Technologies at
Texas A&M University. The Principal Investigators will become stakeholders in
the Brazos cluster, giving them priority access to the new nodes and enhancing
their access to the rest of the cluster.
