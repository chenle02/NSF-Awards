Research continues in the area of advanced speech recognition algorithms,
architectures, and experimentation. Algorithms currently being tested include an
ear-model-based filterbank for speech recognition analysis, a dynamic
programming solution for connected speech recognition, and a DILEX approach for
continuous digit recognition. New algorithms are being investigated which apply
expert system technology and/or hidden Markov models or Markov random fields.
Finally, a training paradigm for large-vocabulary discrete utterances
recognition (thousands of utterances) is being developed using some of these
same ideas. The largest real hardware project, Armstrong, a distributed
multiprocessor, is in its very early stages of construction and consists of a
unique network of some 100 M68010-based processors. Another phase of the program
relates to the development of a hardware/software tool designed to be a high-
quality intelligent test instrument for speech recognition systems.
