Brian Laird is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the theory of solid-liquid
interfaces. Molecular dynamics simulations of solid-liquid interfaces will be
performed for a variety of materials using both idealized and realistic models.
Existing density-functional theories will be evaluated in light of the
simulation results and modified in order to correct observed deficiencies in an
attempt to extend the level of theory to materials displaying long range
intermolecular interactions and multi-component systems. The long term objective
of the research project is to understand, at a microscopic level, the solid-
liquid interface of a variety of materials, primarily mixtures (alloys), and
molecular systems with orientationally dependent interactions. Most crystals of
current technological interest, such as semiconductors, metals and alloys, are
grown from the melt, and information on the microscopic structure, dynamics and
thermodynamics of such interfaces is of fundamental importance in studies of
crystal growth and homogeneous nucleation. A better molecular level
understanding of the solid-liquid interface in such systems could help to
produce better defect-free single crystals of such technologically important
materials.
