The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship program provides an
opportunity for current elementary and secondary mathematics, science, and
technology classroom teachers with demonstrated excellence in teaching to serve
in federal agencies that impact science and mathematics education. All Einstein
Fellowship candidates have been recognized for excellence through the
Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics or Science Teaching or a
similar meritorious award. Einstein Fellows bring to Congress and selected
federal agencies the insights, extensive knowledge and practical experience of
teachers working in science and mathematics classrooms. This project supports
one Einstein Fellow assigned to NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE)
for an 11-month period. The Fellow serves as a valuable resource by working with
DUE Program Officers on programs focusing on effective mathematics and science
classroom teaching, preservice teacher preparation, projects that link teacher
preservice and inservice activities, and national teacher education issues.
