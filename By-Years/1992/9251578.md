In the last 30 years optics has undergone a revivification, driven to a large
extent by the application of lasers and computers. The manifestations of what
has been a real revolution are evident everywhere from credit-card holograms to
high-resolution television. With few exceptions, this technological whirlwind is
predicated on advances that are not well understood outside the immediate
confines of the discipline. Accordingly, we have begun to create a Modern Optics
Teaching Environment (MOTE) where all undergraduates can learn about, and indeed
experience, at least the basics of these developments and where physics majors
can get a state-of- the-art introduction to contemporary optics. Spectroscopy is
the window into the machinery of the atom and is central to the pedagogical
development of modern physics and optics. Accordingly, one of the most highly
used pieces of equipment in the MOTE is a 1.0 m research-grade monochromator.
Studies of sources are conducted using Fabry-Perot and Michelson
interferometers. The MOTE focuses on the laser inasmuch as it is one of the
premiere and most ubiquitous instruments in the exploration of contemporary
physics. Students build gas and dye lasers and study their operating
characteristics. Once the fundamentals of radiant energy are familiar, and the
laser as a versatile source is mastered, applications to nonlinear optics,
holography, spectroscopy, and fiber optics are explored with confidence. Seniors
also perform thesis research in laser spectroscopy using a pulsed nitrogen laser
and a pumped dye laser.
