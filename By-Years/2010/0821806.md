New Mexico State University (NMSU) has received funding from the National
Science Foundation to acquire major research instrumentation in the form of a
transformational new technology of genome sequencing called Emulsion PCR
pyrosequencing. First invented barely three years ago, this novel technology
reduces the time and cost of DNA sequencing to about 1% of existing technologies
and allows exploratory genetic characterization of environmental samples. The
multi-user genome sequencing core facility will allow NMSU researchers to
pioneer the understanding of 1) how mutations in a few genes can affect the
expression of hundreds of others, 2) how certain viruses ameliorate the
pathogenicity of some diseases, 3) how genes that allow beneficial bacteria to
live in hosts can change to allow pathogenicity, 4) the changes in microbial
communities of severely polluted and remediated soils, 5) mutations that drive
ongoing speciation in natural populations of plants and insects, and 6) genome-
level genetic characterization of non-model organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NMSU
is a leader in biotechnology education in the minority-majority state of New
Mexico, and it will be the first minority serving institution to acquire emPCR
pyrosequencing technology. The genome sequencing core facility will leverage
several existing programs and facilities in bioinformatics and computation at
NMSU to prepare its students for the next-generation biotechnology workforce.
