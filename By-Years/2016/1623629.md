Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) has been proven effective in
improving discipline-based student learning and professional skills such as
teamwork, communication, management, information processing, and critical
thinking. This project develops POGIL materials for fifteen cybersecurity topic
areas of cryptography, access control, network security, risk management, web
security, and secure coding. This project also evaluates the developed POGIL
materials and teaching methods in different courses at three universities with
the goal of investigating the following research question: Is using the POGIL
method more effective to learn cybersecurity than traditional/lecture-based
teaching methods in terms of learning outcomes, learning experience, attitudes
and motivation? This project also builds the national capacity in cybersecurity
education and disseminates project results through holding two in-conference
faculty workshops and one summer faculty workshop as faculty professional
development in cybersecurity. This project is implemented through the
collaboration of PIs from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State
University, the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and Old Dominion
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed POGIL materials will contribute
to the effective pedagogy resources for cybersecurity education. The study of
the effectiveness of the POGIL instructional method for cybersecurity education
will contribute to the research knowledge on effective teaching methods for
cybersecurity. The developed POGIL materials can be adopted by multiple
disciplines such as computer science, information technology and business, and
will be made available to a broader audience through conference presentations,
publication in appropriate journals, and through the project's web site.
