9405547 Humphreys This research is to model the dynamics of instantaneous
deformation of the western U.S. The deformation is broadly distributed and
diverse, yet the occurrence of domains of similar tectonic style suggest that
nearly uniform processes occur over broad regions. Together with existing
knowledge of crustal structure and relative plate motion data, estimated
strength and density structure provide the necessary information to forward
model by means of finite- element computer codes the dynamics of western U.S.
deformation. The resulting predicted deformation and stress fields can then be
compared with space-based geodetic data for model refinement. The product is
directly applicable to estimation of earthquake hazards in the western U.S. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
