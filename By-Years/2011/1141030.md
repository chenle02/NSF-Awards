This University of New Hampshire project entitled: Learning Mathematics through
Teaching proposes to develop new curriculum modules for an existing
undergraduate level course for future secondary teachers that are based on
experiences with student difficulties in this course, as well as on current
literature on mathematics teacher preparation. In addition the project provides
prospective teachers with a practicum experience with experienced teaching
assistants who have been trained in mentoring preservice teachers and in
planning and facilitating classroom practices. It is also developing,
implementing, and carrying out research on a professional development program
for teaching assistants who instruct precalculus. These teaching assistants are
being trained in facilitating inquiry-based student-centered teaching
strategies.
