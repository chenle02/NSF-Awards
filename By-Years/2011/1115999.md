The Internet represents essential communication infrastructure that needs to be
protected from malicious attacks. Many existing attacks and corresponding
defense mechanisms have focused on the computers connected to the Internet
rather than the network infrastructure itself. However, the network can also be
attacked since modern network components use software and hardware components
that can exhibit vulnerabilities that have not been previously studied. This
project explores this new type of in-network attacks and develops a novel
approach to providing fundamental security capabilities in networking hardware
based on hardware monitoring techniques.

The goals of this research are to significantly improve the understanding of
emerging vulnerabilities in the Internet infrastructure and to develop a
hardware monitoring system that can detect and stop an entire class of new
attacks in order to maintain an operational Internet. This research on the
design, implementation, and operation of protected router platforms is essential
for the continued success of the Internet. In addition, this project integrates
underrepresented minority and undergraduate students into research, develops
instructional components, and contributes to workforce development through
graduate student training.
