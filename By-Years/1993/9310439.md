9310439 Zvanut This project is designed to study the microscopic aspects of
defects in diamond thin films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
Electrical measurements such as steady state current measurements, ac impedance
measurements, and metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device measurements will be
used to characterize the diamond film. In addition, the powerful spectroscopy of
electron paramagetic resonance (PER) will be employed to extract important
information about defects and impurities at the atomic level. The investigation
proposed here will provide closer look at the insulating and semiconducting
properties of thin film diamond particularly those properties related to device
applications. For example, since a MOS device must be capable of withstanding
continued voltage stress, we will study the breakdown field of synthetic diamond
films to test the effects of various fabrication procedures. Furthermore, the
effects of long term current flow will be addressed in terms of electron and
hole trapping kinetics and energetic. The proposed project will address these
properties of the insulating diamond film as well as properties of the
semiconducting diamond. ***
