9353918 Landis This project is developing a portable modular short course which
faculty can take within their institutional context to better prepare themselves
to teach engineering to freshmen. Topics covered will include 1) understanding
engineering students, 2) achieving effectiveness in classroom teaching, 3) the
freshman year curriculum and early student development, 4) student/faculty
interaction, 5) the importance of the peer environment, 6) teaching to a diverse
student population, and 7) case studies of best teaching practices. Specific
materials to be developed include self-assessment instruments, monographs,
videotapes, and study guides to the videotapes. Materials will be developed with
the consultation and assistance of a National Action Committee of distinguished
engineering educators. Evaluation of the developed materials will be via actual
use by engineering faculty during formative development and a summative survey
of users of the final materials. Dissemination of the course materials will
include the usual conference and journal avenues. An additional avenue to be
pursued includes commercial publishers. ***
