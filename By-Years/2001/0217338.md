Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morin and Covich &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal requests funds to support travel to Switzerland for a joint European/
US workshop to examine biodiversity and ecosystem function in aquatic systems.
This is an area that has not received as much attention in aquatic systems as it
has in terrestrial systems. The Ecology program specifically encouraged
inclusion of marine participants in the proposed workshop. More than half of the
attendees supported by NSF Funds are junior participants (grad students, post-
docs and young faculty), and 50% of these were women. The workshop will also
foster international collaborations between groups of scientists that have had
relatively little interaction. &lt;br/&gt;
