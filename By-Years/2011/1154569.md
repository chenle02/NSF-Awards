The EVS Scholars program at the University of Texas at Austin recruits
academically talented but financially needy entering freshmen to its innovative
and interdisciplinary degree program leading to a Bachelor of Science in
Environmental Science. Housed in three different colleges at the university, the
program is demanding and rigorous, and prepares its graduates for further
education or employment in the burgeoning workforce in environmental areas.
Scholars are grouped in small cohorts and offered individualized academic
support, multifaceted mentoring, and professional preparation. The goal is to
attract and retain Scholars, allowing them to develop habits of
interdisciplinary critical thinking, research and field skills, and motivation
to contribute to solving environmental problems. With the help of current
Scholars, applicants are aggressively recruited and those chosen as scholars are
carefully nurtured. Since the student population at the University of Texas is
17% Hispanic, EVS Scholars will contribute diversity to a STEM area that
currently lacks it.
