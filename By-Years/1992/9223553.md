This project will plan and test an intensive engineering ethics short course for
engineering faculty. The course will take the form of a two to three day summer
workshop, a fall seminar series, and a capstone half day workshop in January
1994. These activities emphasize case studies, role plays, the development of
communication skills, team teaching and application of both analytical and
creative thinking to arrive at solutions of problems in engineering ethics. The
course will train engineering faculty to teach discussion sections in the
engineering ethics course at Texas A&amp;M. This 3 credit, elective course is
soon to be required of most engineering undergraduates at the university, and
could involve as many as 800 students each year. The short course would expose
25 faculty to most of the material covered in the course and enable them to
assign and grade coursework, lead discussions, and set the tone of the course.
As a result, these instructors will be prepared to make writing assignments,
grade student papers, lead class discussion, and set the tone of the course.
They will also be better prepared to introduce ethics case study narratives into
their own engineering courses. Several engineering faculty from other campuses
of the Texas A&amp;M system will also be invited to participate in the short
course. Faculty for the course will come from Texas A&amp;M, and from several
other universities where courses similar to theirs are in existence. These
faculty may develop similar training short courses at their own institutions.
The short course could also be offered as a professional development activity at
professional society meetings on a tuition, self supporting basis.
