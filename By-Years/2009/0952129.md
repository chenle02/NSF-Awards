Moral cognition is the study of moral judgment from the perspective of
cognitive science, which views the brain as an information processor. Cognitive
genetics is the study of how specific genetic variations affect how the brain
processes information. The goal of this project is to begin the integration of
these two young and rapidly progressing fields.

Recent research on moral cognition indicates that moral judgment is not the
product of a unified "moral sense" or "moral faculty." Rather, moral judgments
are produced through a combination of automatic emotional responses and more
controlled cognitive processes, where these two types of processes sometimes
compete with one another. This kind of competition is elicited by classic moral
dilemmas devised by philosophers: Is it morally acceptable to push one person in
front of a trolley, killing that person, in order to prevent the trolley from
running over and killing five people? People disagree about this case, but
research shows that the tendency to say "no" is preferentially supported by
automatic responses that depend on emotion-related brain regions such as the
amygdala. In contrast, the tendency to say "yes" is preferentially supported by
more controlled processes that depend on a part of the brain called the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Recent research in cognitive genetics has
identified variants of genes that influence neural activity in these brain
regions. For example, there is a genetic variant that is known to affect
emotional processing in the amygdala by regulating levels of the
neurotransmitter serotonin. Likewise, there is different genetic variant that is
known to affect controlled cognitive processing in the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex by regulating levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. This new research
builds on earlier studies to explore whether and how specific genes influence
moral judgment by examining moral judgments made by people with different
genotypes and by imaging the brains of people with different genotypes while
they make moral judgments. Moral judgment is a matter of widespread concern,
with relevance to such practically oriented fields as law, medicine, public
health, and politics. More philosophically, our capacity for moral judgment is
widely considered an essential feature of our humanity. Thus, a better
understanding of moral judgment and its biological basis may inform important
moral decisions and may teach us important lessons about ourselves.
