9419716 Abrams This project will use mathematical models of food webs to explore
the interactions between changes in population densities and changes in the
traits that determine individuals' feeding and anti-predator characteristics. It
builds on a previous project that explored the population dynamical effects of
rapid behavioral adaptation and developed a simple method of approximately
modeling the dynamics of quantitative traits. The present project is centered on
an analysis of the dynamics of simple food webs in which one or more species is
characterized by feeding and/or predator-avoidance traits that change adaptively
over time. Most of the food webs to be studies consist of groups of two to six
species. Two different models of trait dynamics will be explored to reveal
differences between traits whose distribution has a relatively inflexible shape
and those whose distribution can have any shape within the bounds of possible
trait values. The analysis of these models, and their extensions, will advance
our understanding of several problem areas ecology. Extensions of the basic
models will examine the dynamic consequences of species having two or more modes
of adaptive change in trait values, and will explore how the results of these
simple models are changed by spatially subdivided environments or more complex
population structures, such as size and/or age classes. %%% This mathematical
theory will provide a basis for predicting long-term changes in the populations
of species in ecological communities. Such long-term changes are almost always
affected by natural selection, which is absent from almost all ecological
models. By working out the potential consequences of adaptive change for
community dynamics, this analysis of simple models will provide a guide to what
types of adaptively flexible traits empirical community ecologists need to
study.
