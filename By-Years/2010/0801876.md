This award establishes Brigham Young University (BYU) as a research site of the
Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (IUCRC) for High-Performance
Reconfigurable Computing. Other sites of this collaborative research center
include the University of Florida (2007) and George Washington University
(2007). Reconfigurable computing (RC) technology can be divided into two areas
of use: High Performance Computing (HPC) and High Performance Embedded Computing
(HPEC). RC technology is used in the field of HPC to accelerate demanding
computations that would otherwise be performed in software on a large-scale
computing system. RC technology is used in HPEC to create high-performance
embedded computing solutions in areas such as signal and image processing, real-
time vision, cryptography, and network processing. The mission of this center is
to investigate, develop, and evaluate new concepts, methods, infrastructure, and
tools in reconfigurable HPC and HPEC, from building-block devices to
infrastructure to applications, and advance these technologies through research
and education for the benefit of center members, students, and the discipline at
large. The research BYU will address; 1) Novel Core Architectures and Related
Components for Aerospace &amp; Defense Applications, 2) Application Mapping of
HPC Codes to High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Systems, 3) Profiling,
Analysis, &amp; Performance Optimization for Reconfigurable Computing
Applications, 4) Middleware, Interfaces, &amp; other Infrastructure for High-
Performance Reconfigurable Computers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for High-
Performance Reconfigurable Computing should significantly enhance the U.S.
effort to maintain a strong leadership position within their area of information
technology. It may also serve to bring industry and users together to define
common standards. Industry members, researchers and students will gain from the
interactions throughout the life of the research center. This should be a
rewarding experience for all as the university has a detailed plan to achieve
diversity in working with several minority institutions. Advances in RC affect
virtually all disciplines of science and engineering which require high-
performance computing, be it mainframe-oriented or embedded. RC technology
promises to produce computing systems combining the flexibility of software-
programmable computations with the computational power of custom hardware.
