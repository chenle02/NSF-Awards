This research is concerned with showing that hyperplanes of the major
embeddable Lie incidence geometries all arise from embeddings. The cases that
remain are dual polar spaces, geometries associated with exceptional Lie groups,
and certain exceptional fields for the half-spin geometries. A class of
geometries crucial to forming general theorems about Veldkamp spaces will also
be considered. The principal investigator will continue work on Ä±m!-ovoids,
which are generalizations of both ovoids and spreads of polar spaces. The
research in this project involves the interplay between finite dimensional
geometry and the actions of groups of transformations on these geometries. This
work has implications for the structure of finite groups, for algebraic coding
theory, and for finite geometry.
