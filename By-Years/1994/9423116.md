9423116 Schaffer Vertebrate pigment cells are derived from the neural crest, a
set of cells that also gives rise to the craniofacial skeleton, endocrine
glands, the heart and the peripheral nervous system. This research will reveal
some of the mechanisms that lead to this developmental diversification.
Movements of pigment cells can be followed during development in amphibian eggs.
The research will use molecular techniques and experimental manipulation to
examine the interactions of neural crest cells with each other, with the
extracellular matrix through which they migrate and with the lateral-line
sensory system. The results will provide new insight into the mechanisms
underlying pigment cell patterns, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of how
developmental patterns have evolved to produce the diversity of structure we see
within and between species.
