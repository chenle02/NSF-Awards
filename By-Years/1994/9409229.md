This project will investigate the integration of new storage technologies, such
as flash RAM and helical scan tapes, into the storage hierarchy to take
advantage of each technology's strengths while masking its weaknesses. Ground-
breaking work in disk arrays has already been accomplished; in this project, the
emphasis will be on other areas of the hierarchy, such as solid-state memories
and magnetic tapes. For example, this research will investigate how to increase
the effective capacity of solid-state memories to mitigate their higher cost.
This research will take place in three stages: (1) measure new storage devices
and trace current I/O workloads; (2) design and simulate new hierarchical
architectures and algorithms; (3) implement a prototype hierarchical storage
system and measure its operation under real use.
