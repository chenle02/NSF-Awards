Fundamental research directed toward understanding both the chemical and micro-
structural features of the oxidation of multicomponent materials systems(SiGe
and SiC) using high pressure techniques is being carried out. The high pressure
technique allows the synthesis of chemically metastable materials that have no
natural analogs, and offers the ability to assess the effect of reaction rates
under isothermal conditions on the development of interface morphology. %%% This
research is expected to provide fundamental understanding of multicomponent
materials systems important to the electronics field. The understanding gained
will be helpful to semiconductor device design and fabrication. The results will
be of importance in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed
integrated electronic circuits.
