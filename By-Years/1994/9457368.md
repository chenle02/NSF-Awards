This NSF Young Investigator award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research on metal silicides by Dr.
Ziling B. Xue of the Chemistry Department, University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
Two areas are emphasized: development of synthetic routes to metal silicides and
polysilanes, and investigation of the mechanism of solid state organometallic
reactions. On the first topic, early transition metal silyl complexes which do
not contain cyclopentadiene or analogous ligands will be prepared; very few
compounds of this type are known. These compounds will be used to develop a new
route to metal silicides and polysilanes, which are useful for electronic
devices. Tetrahydrosilane will also be used to form metal silicides under
chemical vapor deposition conditions. In the second area, solid-gas reactions of
alkyl compounds with phosphines will be studied. Research will focus on the
factors affecting retention of solid state structure during reaction.
Instrumentation from Oak Ridge National Laboratory will be used for some of the
structural determinations. This work has implications for synthesis of
heterogeneous catalysts.
