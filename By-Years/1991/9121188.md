In accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NSF and NASA signed
in January 1991, the framework for collaboration between NASA and NSF was
established to jointly develop projects on antarctic activities that are
applicable to space research and exploration. On July 3, 1991 the Antarctic
Space Analog Program Committee reviewed several proposed projects and selected
two for funding as demonstration projects for antarctic space analog program
demonstration project during the 1992-93 austral summer. A summary of the
statement of work for those two projects follow this abstract. A total of
$150,000 is recommended for FY 91 funding by NSF/DPP. This will be matched by
$100,000 from NASA. FY 92 funding will also be provided by the two agencies.
