Terrestrial and marine ecology are disciplines that have developed with far too
few points of contact, given the common conceptual and methodological issues, as
well as more recent environmental concerns. A preliminary meeting (Santa Fe
1989) identified eight cross-sectoral topics where further interaction would be
valuable in advancing our understanding of ecological systems in general. This
month-long summer institute on spatial patterning and patch dynamics will mark
the first of a potential series with the aim of comparing and contrasting
terrestrial and marine ecological systems and the ways in which they are
investigated.
