This grant provides funding for the development of algorithms that contribute to
the practice of large-scale optimization, by converting between model
formulations that are natural to people and problem representations that are
efficient for computational solvers. These algorithms can be categorized as
detection methods that find structures hidden in models, transformation methods
that convert known structures to forms that solvers can handle, and a range of
intermediate situations requiring methods of both kinds. New algorithms will be
identified, designed, and tested in diverse optimization settings of practical
interest, using the most advanced currently available software for modeling as
well as solving. Advantage will be taken of ongoing efforts to standardize
communications between modeling systems and solvers, so as to allow for
independence from the file and data formats of particular software packages.
Specific studies will focus on generalized decision-variable domains, piecewise-
linear functions of individual variables, second-order cone programs of varied
forms, general convex expressions, complementarity constraints, and logical
expressions including disjunctions, implications, counts, and complex logical
constraints.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to
more natural and efficient modeling environments for optimization, and also to
more versatile solvers that can directly address a greater range of problem
types. Users of optimization will benefit in areas of science, engineering,
economics, and business as diverse as bioinformatics, chemical engineering,
large-scale circuit design, logistics, power management, robotics, statistics,
semiconductor manufacturing, telecommunications, and water resource planning.
Implementations of the studied algorithms will be released as open-source
software in readily available and well-documented forms.
