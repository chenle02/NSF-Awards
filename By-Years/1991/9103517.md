Proposed is a one day symposium on "Neuropeptides: Synthesis, Release, Action
and Evolution" at the annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologist (ASZ),
December 27-31, 1991, sponsored by the Division of Comparative Physiology and
Biochemistry and co-sponsored by the Division of Comparative Endocrinology. The
Symposium is designed to bring to comparative biologists who work with a diverse
array of organisms, some of the new insights and approaches now being used to
elucidate the mode of action of neuropeptides and the roles that they play in
the regulation of physiological processes. The topics will include the evolution
and roles of neuropeptide families, genetic approaches to neuropeptide
synthesis, neuropeptide processing and release (including evolution of release
sites), conformation and regulation of neuropeptide receptors, and
neurophysiological and behavioral actions of neuropeptides. Both invertebrate
and vertebrate model systems will be discussed. The 10 speakers include both
established and young investigators. The highlights of the Symposium will be
summarized by the organizers and published in the American Zoologist.//
