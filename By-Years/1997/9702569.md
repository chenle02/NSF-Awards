This project addresses three problems whose solutions are needed for the
advancement of instruction-level parallelism. They are: a decentralized
execution architecture to increase scalability; an instruction fetch mechanism
that can accommodate control flow changes; and a dependency checking mechanism.
Research will concentrate on the parallel execution window (PEW) model of
execution, in which the window of instructions are generally allocated to the
same execution window, so that parallel actions will usually be independent.
This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students in the development
of simuators and in their use in quantitative architectural comparisons.
