This is a project in medium-energy nuclear theory at the University of
Pittsburgh. Studies of antinucleon-nucleon and meson electroproduction
reactions, the effects of intermediate-state resonances, isobar excitation and
short- range quark interactions using the momentum-space approach developed by
the principal investigator will be pursued. Spin observables play a fundamental
part in studying these effects. In electroproduction, investigations of K+
photoproduction as a source of new information about the formation of N*
resonances will be carried out. Our coupled- channels antinucleon code will be
adapted to photoproduction processes and used to study reactions that relate to
possible work at CEBAF. The effect of multistep reactions will be studied.
Particular attention will be paid to the resulting spin observables.
