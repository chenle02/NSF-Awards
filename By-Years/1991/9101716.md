The enzymes used to carry out chemical or biological transformations are often
difficult to separate from the reaction mixtures in which they are found. One-
time use of an enzyme, however, is expensive. This has motivated a large body of
research on enzyme immobilization. The goals of this project are to develop a
simple method to permit repeated use of an enzyme along with enhanced enzyme
stability and, if possible, activity. A new immobilized enzyme system is to be
developed that will convert solid or macromolecular substrates, something that
many other immobilized systems are not suited to do. This will be based on
conjugating the enzyme (or enzyme complex) to a water-soluble polymer that is
sensitive to temperature, or in some cases, to both temperature and pH.
Temperature sensitive polymers exhibit a lower critical solution temperature
(LCST) when dissolved in water. Such polymers precipitate from solution when the
temperature is raised above the LCST. This occurs when the polymer is conjugated
to a protein. At any time during or after the enzymatic reaction, the polymer-
enzyme complex may be reversibly precipitated from the reaction solution,
facilitating product recovery and recycle of the enzyme.
