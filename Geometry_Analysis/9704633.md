9704633 Lott This project is concerned with relationships between geometric
analysis and the topology of manifolds. Among the topics to be pursued are:
L2-invariants of covering spaces and their possible extensions; p-form
eigenvalues of collapsing Riemannian manifolds and about topological
obstructions to collapse; analytic torsion forms and the topology of
diffeomorphism groups. Manifolds are curved spaces generalizing surfaces in
space. Thus an important geometric property of a manifold is its curvature,
which is defined locally. It turns out that there are restrictions on the
overall shape of the manifold, i.e., its topology, for the manifold to be able
to carry certain types of curvatures; conversely, knowing the curvature one can
make certain predictions about its global shape.
