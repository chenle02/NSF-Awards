Centrifuge and rotors will be acquired to support multiple projects in
biotechnology at Drexel University. These projects include the study of: 1) The
structure of delta ribosomes, 2) The splicing mechanism of RNA polymerase II
transcripts in fission yeast, 3) Molecular analysis of tissue specific position
effects in Drosophila, 4) Termination of DNA replication in E. coli, and 5)
protease expression in the dimorphic fungus Mucor racemosus.
