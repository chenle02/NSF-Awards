The Chemistry Department at Kearney State College will purchase a computer-
controlled gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer to update and enhance the
chemistry education of its undergraduate students. The instrument will be used
for demonstrations in two courses for non- science majors, and will be used by
students in several courses for majors: organic chemistry, organic qualitative
analysis, instrumental methods, and student apprenticeship. Projects include
investigations of agricultural pesticide residues, industrial wastes, and other
environmental chemical hazards. Acquisition of this instrument will also allow
faculty to implement their plan to develop and publish mass spectrometry
experiments for undergraduate laboratory courses.
