This action will provide support for three faculty members, research associates
and students to continue research in elementary particle physics. A new activity
will be started at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring to study reactions
initiated through the interaction of two photons with each other. This is a
continuation of the line of research the group has been performing at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Research and development of energy
measurement calorimeters for possible application in a particle detector at the
Superconducting Supercollider, is underway. The group will also develop a
detector to search for non luminous matter remaining from an early epoch of the
universe the so called weakly interacting massive particles.
