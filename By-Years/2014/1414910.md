Because they require no conventional propulsion system, solar sail spacecraft
are at the forefront of sustainable technology in space. The recent successful
deployment of the JAXA IKAROS solar sail has renewed interest in this type of
spacecraft to fulfill a certain class of missions once thought to be impractical
due to large propellant requirements. Of all the possible types of solar sail
configurations, the heliogyro has the most understood control strategy and is
the easiest to deploy. This structure, akin to a dutch windmill, uses long,
thin, flexible blades rotating about a central spacecraft body in order to
propel itself using solar radiation pressure (solar wind). The objective of this
project is to investigate the appropriate control architecture to maneuver the
attitude (orientation) of such a spacecraft while guaranteeing the stability of
the structure. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jer-Nan
Juang, an expert on solar sail technology at the National Cheng Kung University
in Taiwan.

As a consequence of their flexibility and size, heliogyro sails require
persistent control attention at the root of each blade in order to maintain
stability and achieve changes in attitude. The proposer will design an adaptive
control scheme robust to random vibrations and changes in the response of the
blades due to the highly-coupled non-linear nature of the system. The
development of the control algorithm will implement concepts of estimation and
system identification to approximate the system parameters and adapt to
uncertainties in real time. Furthermore, the project will require devising a
model to capture the system's dynamic response; creating blade pitch actuation
routines to reproduce attitude-changing maneuvers; implementing a realistic
model of solar radiation pressure; and investigating optimal sensor placement
along the blades in order to maximize observability. This NSF EAPSI award is
funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.
