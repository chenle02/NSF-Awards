This project investigates a variety of questions in low-dimensional topology,
the study of the global shapes of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces and of knots and
surfaces contained within them. This subject lies at the crossroads of many
disparate areas of mathematics, and it has a wide variety of applications
ranging from cosmology (the shape of the universe) to biochemistry (the knotting
of DNA molecules) to mathematical physics. Surprisingly, many problems in low
dimensions are usually more difficult than their analogues in higher dimensions
and require the use of invariants that go beyond traditional algebraic topology.
The PI's particular area of expertise is in Heegaard Floer homology, a
collection of invariants for 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, which has been one
of the most fruitful areas of research in low-dimensional topology since the
early 2000s. These tools bring together several different fields of mathematics,
including representation theory, differential geometry, and analysis, and the PI
hopes to elucidate the connections between these different areas and expand the
discourse among researchers in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific
goals of the project are (1) to make progress on a variety of concrete problems
in 4-manifold topology, including knot concordance, exotic smooth structures,
and embeddings of non-orientable surfaces; (2) to understand the relationship
between the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold and topological properties
such as the existence of incompressible surfaces, taut foliations, and left-
orderings on the fundamental group; (3) to establish relationships between the
knot invariants arising from gauge theory and symplectic geometry and those
coming from representation theory and quantum algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
