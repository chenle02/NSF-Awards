The subject of Professor Faris' research is the relation between two frontier
areas in wave propagation: random waves and nonlinear waves. The understanding
of these types of waves and their interaction is of importance both for our
knowledge of fundamental physical phenomena as well as technological
applications in a wide variety of fields; for example, electromagnetic waves in
plasma, optical fibers with impurities, and doped superlattices. When the medium
through which a wave passes is complicated and irregular, it may be treated as a
random medium. The solutions, called random waves, of the equations that
describe wave propagation in a highly random medium, are just beginning to be
sufficiently well understood to compare with experiment. In some situations a
remarkable phenomenon occurs, called localization, in which repeated scattering
actually traps a wave. The nature of the transition between localization and the
more common case of diffusion is not yet well understood, and mathematical
progress here would be a conceptual advance in the study of complicated
interactions of waves and matter. In previous work, Professor Faris has found
new situations, in dimension higher than one, in which localization takes place
despite the fact that this is not the only possible behavior. In the current
proposal, he treats localization in the presence of nonlinearities. In this
context, the wave interacts with itself and produces solitary waves, or
solitons. These waves behave in many ways like classical particles. The goal is
to obtain rigorous mathematical results for solitons in random media. This would
be a major step in understanding the dynamics of complex random systems.
