As mobile and network technologies proliferate, so does society's awareness of
the vulnerability of private data within cyberspace. Protecting private
information becomes specially important, since researchers estimate that 87% of
Americans can be identified by name and address, if their zip code, gender, and
birthday are known to intruders. The goal of this proposal will be to develop a
new set of verification tools, algorithms, and interfaces that enable secure,
effective and unobtrusive management of users' private information. The proposed
approach leverages formal verification techniques to ensure that the intended
privacy properties and goals are met. Because of the modular and robust design
of the proposed platform, it can be re-aligned and tuned to accommodate the
needs of specific use cases and applications (e.g., health-care, connected
automotive systems, and smart cities).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed system
will: (1) use model-checking to ensure that updated rules and boundaries
correctly enforce users' privacy intents, given that users' privacy boundaries
and rules constantly evolve (e.g., due to aging, social pressure, and changes in
health and personal relationships), (2) automatically translate control policies
to privacy-preserving protocol executions, which provably enforce privacy
intents. To achieve this, new approaches for activating privacy-preserving
functionalities based on the knowledge of privacy rules and boundaries, as well
as novel cryptographic tools will be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further
