Title: NSF Workshop on Assurable and Usable Security Configuration

It is estimated that configuration errors at the system or network level enable
65% of the attacks that have been seen, many of which have serious consequences
because often a misconfigured system permits attackers to access security-
critical objects.

The objective of this workshop is to provide a venue for discussions to
eliminate or drastically reduce misconfigurations. It falls on overworked system
administrators or the home user to configure their systems, often resulting in
seriously misconfigured systems. Research is needed to lead to tools that will
drastically reduce the work required to configure systems so that they are not
open to attack. The research will involve policy languages that permit users to
characterize their security and privacy needs, techniques to reify policies to
enforceable rules, and new techniques that support changes to a policy that
reflect down to the appropriate changes to rule sets.

The workshop involves the participation of industry so that the academic
participants will become familiar with policies and rule sets drawn from real
enterprises and networks.

The workshop will produce a detailed report to be posted on the NSF web site
