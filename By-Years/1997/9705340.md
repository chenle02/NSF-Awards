9705340 Barnes The University of Texas at Austin requests $399,341 to expand the
current Universo translations of StarDate into Spanish to more culturally
relevant programs for a growing Hispanic audience. Plans include creation of
longer programs with a different format for Hispanic Heritage Month for
1998-2000 and creation of complimentary collateral materials for distribution to
200 Spanish- language radio stations. Programs will also be distributed to 1,650
classrooms. A teacher's guide for using Universo in the classroom will be
developed in English with activities available in both English and Spanish. A
parent's guide to Universo/StarDate will also be produced to encourage parents
to get involved in skywatching activities.
