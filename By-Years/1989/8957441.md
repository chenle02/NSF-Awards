Electromagnetic wave scattering by random media is important for many areas
including remote sensing and target identification. Although considerable
progress has been reported on the wave propagation and scattering in random
media, there are many unanswered problems including the backscattering
enhancement effect in the millimeter wave and microwave regions. To understand
the interaction of the electromagnetic wave with medium, it is important to have
experimental data obtained under controlled environments. We propose to conduct
the carefully controlled experiments using random media of known statistical
characteristics in the millimeter wave and microwave regions. In the surface
scattering study we will construct surfaces of known mean heights and
correlation distances and measure both bistatic and backscattering cross-
sections. The backscattering enhancement effect by rough surface will be
carefully investigated. In the imaging study we will build a special chamber and
investigate the reconstructed image quality for different particle
characteristics and distributions. The proposed project will enhance our
understanding of how the electromagnetic wave is scattered by random media, and
will have important practical applications in the microwave, millimeter wave,
and sub-millimeter wave remote sensing.
