This award will enable Dr. Grant J. Mathews, Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, and six colleagues to collaborate with Prof. Ken'ichi Nomoto,
University of Tokyo, Japan, and co-workers over a period of two years. They will
study mechanisms responsible for the synthesis of the elements which occurs in
stellar explosions, including the "big bang," proposed as responsible for the
birth of the universe itself. Measurements of the electromagnetic and neutrino
spectra associated with the explosion of the well-observed 1987 supernova will
be correlated with theoretical models. An additional phase of this research
involves the study of a possible inhomogeneity of baryon distribution in the
universe, which can also help explain mechanisms of element formation
immediately after the initial big bang. The overall purpose of this research is
to understand processes involved in the formation of the universe. The many
observations of the 1987 supernova will be used in conjunction with today's best
theories to obtain a scenario for the origin of our universe, which resulted
from the explosive synthesis of particles into nuclei of elements, and
subsequent ejection of the synthesized material into the interstellar medium.
Contributions to this scenario will also be made by the obtaining of an improved
theoretical understanding of the processes of baryon diffusion in the universe,
which have long-term implications for the continuing expansion of the universe.
This research will bring together workers from Japan and the U.S. who have each
developed models for the 1987 supernova, and who will attempt to reconcile their
work.
