&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Error-correcting codes are a critical part of almost all
digital communications and data storage systems, including cell phones, the
Internet, space missions, and compact disks. Error control coding, also known as
channel coding, protects data against transmission errors to ensure adequate
transmission quality. The emergence of graph-based codes (such as turbo codes
and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes) with iterative decoding techniques
has revolutionized channel coding. It is now clear that LDPC codes will be an
essential part of future communication systems. Despite their astonishingly good
performance, LDPC codes suffer from important problems. This research provides
improvements in understanding and practical implementation of LDPC codes using
new approaches introduced by the PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of research considered
are 1. Parametric Iterative Decoding: A novel decoding method for LDPC codes,
called parametric iterative decoding, is investigated. The new decoding method
provides better trade-offs among reliability, bandwidth usage, and cost than the
standard iterative decoding. 2. Capacity-Achieving LDPC Codes: This research
studies a new approach to the analytical design of capacity-achieving LDPC codes
based on zero-rate codes and puncturing. Extensions of the ideas to construct
universal rate-adaptive LDPC codes are also investigated. 3. Error Floor of LDPC
Codes: This project develops a rigorous framework to answer the following
questions: Given an accepted level of the error floor, what is the best
performance we can obtain? How can we achieve this performance?&lt;br/&gt;
