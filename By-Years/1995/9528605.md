9528605 Luh International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) is composed of
46 National Member Organizations, each one representing the technical societies
concerned with automatic control in its own country. IFAC sponsors many
conferences, but the most important is the triennial World Congress. The 12th
such IFAC World Congress was held July 19-23, l993 in Sydney, Australia. The
13th will be held in San Francisco, California, June 30-July 5, 1996. The
conference in San Francisco is expected to have a very high level of attendance
from all over the world. It will be a particularly good forum for the exchange
of ideas among U.S. and non-U.S. researchers. This proposal is for a Block
Travel Grant from the National Science Foundation to support graduate students
from U.S. universities to attend the 13th IFAC World Congress. This will provide
an excellent opportunities for them to interact with the world leading
researchers in automatic control, learn the latest technical trend, and be well
prepared for their future career. ***
