A method is proposed to develop metal matrix composites (MMC) with high
directional thermal conductivities for use in the electronic components as
packaging material to promote heat dissipation. Since thermal management is one
of the critical aspects of packaging design, lifetime and performance of
electronic components can be increased dramatically if such a material is
economically feasible. Such a material could have significant economic impact.
The proposed method is to utilize commercially available graphite fibers
employing fiber spreading in a pneumatic and liquid flow field, followed by
uniform deposition of copper or aluminum on the spread fibers by hollow cathode
plasma technique. A thin interface layer of Si or Mo will be applied if
necessary, to improve adhesion and better translation of mechanical or thermal
properties. The coated fibers will then be weaved or placed in desired
architecture and consolidated at 50 to 80% of melting temperature. The resulting
material is expected to have high thermal conductivities (600 W/mK) in X and Z
directions.
