Detailed simulation of many discrete event systems is often slow even on state-
of-the-art workstations. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) techniques
offer an alternative to speed up such simulations. However, PDES is a hard
problem. The irregular, data-dependent nature of most simulations make
synchronization a difficult issue. In this CAREER project an inter-disciplinary
approach will be taken to address this problem. A new class of "adaptive"
protocols will be developed that integrates several mechanisms in a single
framework, to achieve optimal performance automatically, notwithstanding the
dynamic nature of most simulations. The target platform is a network of
workstations or possibly multiprocessors, connected by a high-speed network.
Several innovations are planned regarding protocol development and
implementation in a PDES kernel on such platforms. These include accounting for
the multi-granular of the platform and use of fast, user-level messaging
support. The work will focus on simulating of telecommunication and computer
networks.
