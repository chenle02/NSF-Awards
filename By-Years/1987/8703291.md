The investigator will study the Grad generalized differential equations which
model the equilibrium and slowly varying evolution of thermonuclear confined
plasmas in axisymmetric toroidal devices. Nonlinear and nonlocal terms enter
these equations through derivatives of the increasing rearrangement of a
function which models the poloidal flux of the magnetic field. The first and
second derivatives of this flux correspond respectively to magnetic field and
current profiles. It is important for physical reasons to determine whether
these profiles can develop singularities at the magnetic axis of the torus.
Professor Laurence will analyze the regularity of minimizers of a variational
formulation of these equations. He will treat the case in which the polodial
cross section is convex. He will introduce a set of approximating variational
problems and examine the minimizer of the original variational problem as a
limit. The m'th approximating problem is a free boundary problem with m free
boundaries. He will try to extend regularity results for the approximating
problems to the regularity of a weak solution to the original problem. The
increasing rearrangement was first introduced by Hardy, Littlewood and Polya.
Its properties are of interest in many areas of analysis, from harmonic analysis
to partial differential equations and isoperimetric inequalities. Professor
Laurence will examine how derivates of the rearrangement are affected by
isolated critical points of the underlying function. He will also study convex
symmetrization of functions over convex domains or over annuli A with convex
boundaries, as well as certain isoperimetric inequalities related to level set
analysis. The project falls into the general area of applied mathematics, with
applications to plasma physics.
