Theory Seminar and Symbolic Computation
Workshops&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New York Group
Theory Seminar is the oldest, continuously running research seminar in the New
York City area - some 48 years. It was started around 1955 by Wilhelm Magnus and
currently is held, for the most part, on Friday afternoons, at the Graduate
Center of the City University of New York under the direction of Gilbert
Baumslag and Sean Cleary, of the City College of New York. The emphasis of the
seminar is on Combinatorial, Geometric and Computational Group Theory. Many of
the talks touch also on three-dimensional topology, homological algebra and
theoretical computer science. There are usually 10 seminars each semester. A
sprinkling of these seminars are expository and are sometimes combined with one-
day or two-day long workshops or conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are
mathematical structures, which capture, in mathematical form, the nature of
symmetry. It turns out, for this very reason, that they play an important role
in crystallography, in particle physics, in geometry and in the study of the
three-dimensional world that we live in. They are an important tool in many
diverse mathematical disciplines as well as in theoretical computer science.
Recently they have been used in cryptography, a field of enormous economic and
strategic importance.&lt;br/&gt;
