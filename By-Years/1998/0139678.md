This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award provides support
for ten undergraduate students in mathematics and mathematical computer science.
The students will be chosen from applicants from across the country and will
work on research projects under the supervision of faculty advisors at Oregon
State University. The program will run for eight weeks each summer during the
years 2002, 2003, and 2004. The principal investigator organizes and supervises
the program. Three faculty members from the Mathematics Department and the
Computer Science Department will supervise the student research projects.

The students will also attend a seminar and will be given information about
various areas of mathematics and computer science. The projects that the
students work on will be designed so as to make the students familiar with the
process of mathematical research. The projects will emphasize the interaction
between pure and applied mathematics. Each student must complete a report on
their research activities for inclusion in written proceedings of the summer
program. Some post-program support will be available for the students to present
the results of their research at conferences.
