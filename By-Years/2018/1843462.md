The broader impact/commercial potential of this project enables connectivity in
otherwise difficult areas. Broadband access in rural America, for example, has
been a lasting problem that inhibits business and education alike. The primary
barrier to installation is the cost of trenching cable, which can be
$7,000-$30,000 per service location. Similar challenges exist in emerging
markets and remote industrial Internet of Things. Networks cannot easily be
replaced with today?s wireless technologies due to the losses that occur when
forwarding information wirelessly, which can eliminate up to half of the
throughput capability at each forwarding location. Low-loss mesh networking,
such as that proposed, would enable fully-wireless solutions to last-mile
connectivity problems globally by eliminating reliance on cable. The impact of
distributed and scalable algorithms extends beyond mesh networking into the
decentralization of other technologies to be more secure and robust, but cannot
due to performance issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on low-loss mesh networking that
could feasibly cover hundreds or thousands of acres with broadband internet
access without laying cable. The primary intellectual merits include scalable
aggregation of data, reducing communication interference with a predetermined
network structure, and other challenges that arise in very large wireless
networks. The objective of this research is a wireless mesh network topology and
hardware that can maintain less than 17% throughput loss-per-hop in a network
larger than 100 nodes. This will be accomplished through real-world trials,
simulations, and iterated testing of different geometries and time-domain
multiplexing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
