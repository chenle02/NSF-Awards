This project will investigate the use of Immobilized Metal Affinity Membranes
for protein separation and recovery. A coupling chemistry will be developed for
attaching IDA- iminodiacetate and TED-tris(carboxylmethyl) ethylenediamine with
spacer arms to inorganic, porous glass microfiltration membranes. Loading
isotherms for the ions Cu(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II) will be measured to determine
binding constants and metal-ion stability during washing. The modified membranes
will be used for fractionation of single and mixed proteins using model protein
systems. Gradient and stepwise elution of adsorbed proteins will be attempted by
varying pH, using displacers, and using a chelating agent. Immobilized metal
affinity chromatography is developing into one of the most powerful techniques
for purification of products from biotechnology. Rapid advances in membrane
technology are also dramatically changing the engineering aspects of commercial
scale biotechnology. The combination of these two techniques can have a
potentially large effect on development of large-scale protein purification
technologies.
