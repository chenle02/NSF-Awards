9702546 Weihs This CAREER grant explores a relatively new phenomena in nanoscale
multilayer materials: self-propagating, exothermic reactions. Using free-
standing multilayer foils that are sputter deposited, the velocities and
temperatures of the self-propagating reactions are quantified using optical
techniques. The thermodynamic driving forces are measured using calorimetry
techniques, and resulting microstructures identified using electron microscopy
and X- ray diffraction. The impact of structural and physical parameters on the
ignition, velocity, and temperature of the reactions are investigated, and the
resulting information used to develop models that aid in understanding the
reactions and in predicting material properties. The educational program is
designed to strengthen the materials science education infrastructure by
developing a national database for classroom demonstrations. This educational
program provides the design of a National Data Base for Classroom Demonstrations
in Materials Science. The database could be linked to NSF's home page to permit
quick access to ideas, instructions, and information for classroom
demonstrations. It could include descriptions, pictures and videos of exciting
new demonstrations in materials science. %%% Novel exothermic reactions have
been demonstrated in thick, free-standing multilayer foils. They ignite at room
temperatures with a simple spark, travel at speeds greater than 10m/s, and reach
temperatures above 1500 C. As free- standing foils they offer the ability to
generate heat rapidly and locally, providing new opportunities for joining
materials. ***
