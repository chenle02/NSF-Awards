9404265 Ablowitz This project involves the study of solutions to a class of
physically significant nonlinear wave equations. New reductions of the self dual
Yang-Mills system will be considered. The self dual equations have been shown to
be a master integrable system from which virtually all known soliton equations
are contained as special cases. Novel classes of solutions will be studied
including those recently found which can be expressed in terms of classical
automorphic functions whose solution structure possess complex singularities
which are natural boundaries in the complex plane. Nonlinear integrable systems
will be used in computational simulations in order to establish the existence of
and to analytically understand the phenomena of numerical chaos. New solutions
to physically important forced nonlinear wave equations will be developed. Many
of the nonlinear equations we are studying are universally important asymptotic
approximations in physical phenomena. Applications include nonlinear optical
wave propagation, internal and surface waves in fluid dynamics, lattice
dynamics, and relativity. The use of solitons in the technological application
of long distance communication has been widely noted. In this research project,
multisoliton solutions and their interaction properties will be analyzed in
order to significantly improve the effectiveness of soliton based communication
systems. This is usually referred to as wave length division multiplexing (WDM)
in optical communications. One of the forced nonlinear wave systems which will
be studied involves moving pressure distributions in surface waves, such as
ships moving at critical speeds.
