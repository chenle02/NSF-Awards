In this project, the PI's will continue analysis of data and publication of
results from a winter-time field study, conducted from October, 1991 to April,
1992, of the Columbia River plume over the Oregon/Washington continental shelf.
A broad array of data collected under a variety of environmental conditions
include: moored measurements of water velocity, temperature, conductivity
(density), bottom pressure, and wind; Lagrangian drifter currents; satellite
imagery; and coastal wind, sea level, and surface waves. Extensive further
analysis of a variety of mechanisms by which the plume is driven into the
coastal ocean and mixes away will be carried out, and the results published.
