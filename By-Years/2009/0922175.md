Intellectual Merit: Photonic crystal fiber represents a new frontier in fiber-
optic research. This project aims to investigate a novel platform concept based
on core-to-cladding-to-core mode coupling and recoupling enabled by long-period
fiber gratings inscribed in this type of fiber for resonance laser absorption
spectroscopy. Specific project activities will include simulation of mode
properties of select platform designs such as field distribution, overlap, and
propagation loss using commercial codes; simulation-guided laser inscription and
optical measurements of the platform structures for the realization of mode
coupling and recoupling at prescribed resonance wavelengths; and measurements
and assessment of the sensing capabilities of the optimal platform structures
via resonance laser absorption spectroscopy of environmentally significant
gases. This project will lead to a wealth of information on optimization of the
platform structures for strong cladding mode coupling and recoupling and for
resonance wavelength control so as to facilitate robust resonance laser
absorption spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will
provide a knowledge foundation for practical exploitation of novel fiber-optic
sensing schemes. Successful outcome of the project has the potential to usher in
a new sensing paradigm that fundamentally transforms the conventional fiber-
optic evanescent field sensing approach. In addition, this project will provide
an excellent opportunity for the training of a doctoral student as well as for
valuable research experiences of a high school science teacher and several high
school students in a frontier research area. The university-industry partnership
under the GOALI mechanism will significantly enhance the translational prospect
of university research, ultimately leading to commercial applications.
