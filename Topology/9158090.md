This Presidential Young Investigator Award will enhance support for John E.
Luecke's research in Dehn Surgery on Links, a topic in the topology of three-
dimensional manifolds. A link in a 3-dimensional manifold, M, is a collection of
circles embedded in M. A knot is a link of one component. The work this year
will have two aspects: (1) understanding when a non-hyperbolic manifold results
from Dehn surgery on a knot with hyperbolic complement, (2) generalizing results
about Dehn surgery on knots to results about Dehn surgery on links with more
than one component. Manifolds are natural objects of study, being spaces which
are locally but in general not globally like Euclidean space. The case of three
dimensions is the lowest dimension for which the closed manifolds have not been
fully classified. Knots and links are also natural objects, about which it is
surprising how basic are some of the questions still unanswered.
