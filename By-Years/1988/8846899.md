This supplement is responsive to the NSF initiative "Facilitation Awards for
Handicapped Scientists and Engineers". The equipment comprises special access
desks to house equipment provided by an earlier equipment grant, and a Vax
Graphic tablet to address the PI's finger dexterity difficulties. The equipment
project being supplemented provides equipment to experimentally investigate the
nonlinear oscillatory behavior of structures. The equipment, a dynamic signal
analyzer, collects data from physical structures undergoing vibration tests.
Nonlinear oscillations have been studied extensively in the past. These studies
have focused on long term time response, the behavior exhibited long after
transients have decayed. This project investigates how the motion evolves during
the decay of the transients. Two projects benefit from the use of the equipment.
The first focuses on the vibration of a cantilevered beam. Theoretical claims
have been made for the potential of dangerous vibrations for certain types of
disturbances. This project will attempt to substantiate these claims. A second
project is concerned with rotating systems where theoretical claims have also
been made for serious nonlinear behavior. These claims will be investigated
through experimentation.
