This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of surface vibrational spectroscopy. During the tenure of this
three-year continuing grant, Professor Langell and her students will develop and
test computational procedures to enhance the applicability of high resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to the study of adsorbates on
transition metal oxides (TMOs). HREELS has proven to be an invaluable tool in
the characterization of metal adsorbates. Presently, it is only of limited
usefulness for the characterization of adsorbates on TMOs because intense
surface phonons from the substrate interfere with the vibrational spectroscopic
signals of interest. Professor Langell's approach draws upon the Maximum Entropy
Method to develop a phonon deconvolution procedure to remove much of the
interfering phonon structure and greatly improve the resolution of TMO-adsorbate
HREELS. %%% Attainment of the goals of this project will enable the use of a
sensitive vibrational spectroscopic technique (HREELS) for the detailed
characterization of adsorbates on TMOs. Such systems are of broad technological
importance in chemical catalysis.
