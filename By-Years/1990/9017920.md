Xylaria is a large (at least 400 names and ultimately 500 or more species)
widely distributed fungal genus (Family Xylariaceae, Order Sphaeriales,
Subdivision Ascomycotina). Many taxa occur on wood, seeds and fruits, and leaves
of angiospermous plants; some taxa are associated with insect nests. Most taxa
decay wood and a large number are plant pathogens. They are common endophytes.
Xylaria and its allies are most numerous in the tropics where they form a
conspicuous part of the mycota. Many taxa are endemic and likely to become
extinct as hosts are destroyed. Mycofloristic studies that include cultural,
anamorphic, cytological, structural, and life history data are proposed. It is
proposed herein: to continue studies of Xylaria from the Guianas; to treat
Xylaria and its allies from Taiwan; to complete treatments of Xylaria from
continental United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Longer term objectives
include a treatment of Xylaria of the neotropics and, eventually, a world
monograph.
