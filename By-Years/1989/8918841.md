Professor Hans C. Andersen is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform research in the application of
statistical mechanical theory and computer simulation to equilibrium and
dynamical problems in condensed phases. This research will provide a molecular
level interpretation of the physical properties of condensed phases which are
important in the design of glassy and semiconductor materials with desired
characteristics. Andersen plans to study the homogeneous and heterogeneous
nucleation of crystals in supercooled liquids using the molecular dynamcis
method. The same method will also be used to study the kinetics of structural
relaxation and transport in supercooled atomic liquids and glasses. A new set of
interatomic potentials appropriate for hydrogen in silicon will be developed and
used to perform simulation studies of pure silicon and silicon containing
hydrogen. Path integral methods will be extended for studying equilibrium
properties and dynamics of low temperature systems. Improved interaction
potentials for phsisorbed adsorbates on metal surfaces will be used in molecular
dynamics simulations of small hydrocarbons on metal surfaces, and to calculate
surface diffusion constants for comparison with experiment.
