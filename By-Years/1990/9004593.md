This grant is for the purchase of a cesium ion source for secondary ion mass
spectroscopy (SIMS). The cesium ion source allows for greater than two orders of
magnitude increase in sensitivity for electronegative elements such as carbon
and oxygen. The instrumentation will be used for research on heteroepitaxial
thin films of compound semiconductors deposited with carbon-bearing
metallorganic precursors, high temperature ceramic superconductors, and ion-
implanted steels.
