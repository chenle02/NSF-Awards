The project examines the hydrodynamics and transport properties of a liquid-
liquid contacting device for the study of phase transfer catalysis (PTC) and
related reactive- transport systems. Research on solid-liquid PTC is now
continuing with liquid-liquid PTC. Mass transfer is studied between aqueous
streams and between aqueous and organic phases with the use of an
electrochemical tracer technique. The vertical distribution of radial velocities
is investigated with a recently acquired laser-Doppler velocimeter. The role of
hydrodynamic instabilities in the laminar-flow contacting device is examined.
The results are useful in various industrial organic syntheses for the
production of polymers, pesticides, and pharmaceutical.
