Plant growth facilities will be provided to support research in plant molecular
biology. The growth chambers will support genetic and biochemical research
utilizing transgenic tomatoes and tobacco plants, clover, and Arabidopsis. Other
plant research in ecology, cell biology and physiology will also be supported by
the new facilities.
