This Informal STEM Learning Resource Center, referred to as the Center for
Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE), will be led by a team of
principal investigators and staff from the Association of Science-Technology
Centers, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Washington, and Oregon
State University. Other key collaborators are the American Association for the
Advancement of Science Center for Public Engagement with Science, the new
National Informal STEM Education Network, and Arizona State University. CAISE
will continue the work it began in 2007, which includes serving professional
audiences in informal STEM learning and, in this award, professionals in science
communications. The resource center's goals are to advance and better integrate
the professional fields of informal STEM learning and science communication by
(1) broadening participation in these fields, (2) deepening links between
research and practice, and (3) building capacity in evaluation and measurement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAISE's main activities will be undertaken by cross-sector
task forces of field leaders and emerging leaders who will be responsible for
conducting field-level analyses, engaging stakeholders, and creating roadmaps
for future efforts. CAISE will also build on existing communication channels for
dissemination to the larger field, through a variety of convenings and forums
and via their designed website, www.informalscience.org. An External Review
Board and Inverness Research will provide oversight of CAISE's program
activities and evaluation of the center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is
funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to
advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and
development of STEM learning in informal environments.
