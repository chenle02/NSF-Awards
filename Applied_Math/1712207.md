Tomography is the mathematics and engineering used to image the internal
structure of an object from indirect data. Tomography algorithms produce images
(reconstructions) of the inside of objects from this indirect data. Important
types of tomography include X-ray, sonar, radar, and seismic imaging. Standard
tomographic algorithms work well with complete data--enough data to image the
object accurately and stably (for example, X-ray data from views all around the
body provides complete X-ray tomography data). However, many tomographic
problems have limited data--some data are missing and standard reconstruction
algorithms typically do not image all features of the object and might produce
artifacts in the reconstruction. Added streaks and other artifacts are common in
limited data reconstructions, and the results of this project will characterize
the artifacts, analyze why they occur, and determine how to suppress them. This
characterization of artifacts will allow researchers to distinguish features of
the object from artifacts in the reconstruction. The research to suppress
artifacts will provide algorithms that produce clearer reconstructions in which
artifacts are less visible. Direct applications of this research include X-ray
tomography, synchrotron imaging, seismic imaging, and radar. This project
focuses on inverse problems in tomography, which allows researchers to image the
internal structure of an object from indirect data. There are many effective
reconstruction algorithms that utilize complete tomographic data (for example,
X-ray data from views all around the body); however, many tomographic problems
involve limited data, in which some data are missing. The goal of this project
is to develop new mathematical methods in micro local analysis to understand and
solve limited data tomography problems. Currently, this paradigm is valid only
for limited data sets with smooth boundaries that have specific orientations.
The resulting reconstruction methods will be tested on industrial synchrotron
data. The investigator will also analyze models for seismic imaging and develop
the microlocal analysis of the normal operator and generalizations, including
calculating its symbol. This calculation will be used to refine the operator so
that the reconstruction highlights object boundaries and is uniform throughout
the object. The symbol indicates which object singularities will be visible and
which will be invisible in the reconstruction. The operator will be implemented
using the approximate inverse and tested on data generated from the wave
equation and real data. These methods will also be extended to bistatic radar
applications, characterized by a transmitter and receiver flying independently
in opposite directions.
