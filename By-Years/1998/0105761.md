Computer architecture research is based on experimental evaluation of
application behavior.&lt;br/&gt;One critical issue in the architecture of high-
end enterprise servers is the design of the memory&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy, which
must be designed to support current and future data-intensive
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few evaluations of the memory behavior of
large commercial applications exist, especially in the&lt;br/&gt;public domain.
The research proposed here is based on a collaboration between IBM and USC
to&lt;br/&gt;take advantage of the IBM Watson Server Performance Laboratory to
explore the memory&lt;br/&gt;behavior of high-end commercial
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, it is proposed to use the
IBM MemorIES board to collect bus activity&lt;br/&gt;traces from a modern server
machine running large, finely tuned OLTP, DSS and Web
workloads.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the sheer size of the traces, samples of
transaction records will be collected only &lt;br/&gt;in selected time
intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides obtaining traces, the goal of this
project is to characterize the memory&lt;br/&gt;behavior of these applications,
to evaluate alternative memory hierarchies for future&lt;br/&gt;high-end
commercial servers, and to explore new multiprocessor architectures
for&lt;br/&gt;commercial systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental
environment provided by the IBM Watson Server Performance
Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;cost millions of dollars and years of effort to setup. This
proposed research will leverage these&lt;br/&gt;efforts. It is a unique
opportunity to collect and disseminate traces and experimental
data&lt;br/&gt;which would be practically impossible to obtain under any
reasonable research budget.
