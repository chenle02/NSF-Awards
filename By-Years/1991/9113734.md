This is a proposal for a workshop to identify the research needs for coping with
uncertainty in power systems. Four areas of research are identified under this
topic: uncertainty in future capacity needs, uncertainty in the regulatory
environment, uncertainty in environmental effects, and uncertainty in power
system modelling. This workshop will also be supported by the Edison Electric
Institute.
