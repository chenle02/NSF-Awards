This Faculty Award for Women Scientists is for research on object oriented
database systems. Features of these systems include: object identity; supporting
complex objects; encapsulation; classes and types; and inheritance. There have
been several attempts to combine object oriented with deductive approaches in
order to derive a data model that retains the advantages of object orientedness
while having a declarative language with formal semantics. This research
develops a declarative language for the object oriented data model. It includes
novel features such as meta-variables and named values. Meta variables allow a
rule language to have method inheritance naturally, and also facilitates
parametric inheritance. Named values bridge the concepts of value and object.
