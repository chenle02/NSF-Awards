9305261 Bogue The goal of this project is to document the variation of the
ancient geomagnetic field intensity during a normal-to-reverse (N-R) polarity
transition that occurred approximately 4 million years ago. An existing sample
collection from 28 superposed basaltic lava flows from the Hawaiian island of
Kauai provides a paleomagnetic record of this reversal. Paleointensities of
these samples will be determined using a modified version of the classic double-
heating experiment. Finally, this study will continue an ongoing effort to
improve the efficiency of the paleointensity experiment by letter identifying
samples that are likely to undergo serious thermal alteration in the lab.
Research will focus on low-temperature demagnetization, both in preliminary rock
magnetic experiments and during the paleointensity experiment itself.
Undergraduate students will play a central role in this research. ***
