A new approach to teaching undergraduate organic chemistry lab is to carry out
the experiments on 1/100th to 1/1000th the scale previously used. In this way
student exposure to substances which are toxic, flammable, corrosive,
carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic is reduced by a corresponding amount
and there are concomitant savings in the disposal of laboratory waste and the
purchase of reagents and solvents. Since the apparatus and techniques for
microscale experimentation differ form those used in the past, faculty need some
guidance before embarking on this way of teaching the undergrade organic
laboratory. To this end, a three week-long workshops on teaching microscale
organic experiments are being conducted at Mount Holyoke College and California
State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Participants have an opportunity to carry
our microscale experiments under the principal investigator`s guidance, assisted
by undergraduate who have helped develop these experiments. There is a strong
emphasis on laboratory waste and disposal methods. Participants learn how to
minimize laboratory waste and how to convert hazardous by-products to less
hazardous material before declaring it a waste in addition to learning how to
carry out microscale organic experiments. The faculty participants home
universities will contribute to the cost of the program by paying for the cost
of the travel to the program.
