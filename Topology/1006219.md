Central to this project is the question, first proposed by Gromov, of
classifying finitely generated groups by their (quasi-isometric) geometry. The
PI's proposal follows two principle lines of study. The first direction is to
shed light on the question of quasi-isometrically classifying various families
of groups. The second direction of study, involves applying knowledge gained
from analysis of the quasi-isometric structure of a family of groups to
illuminate questions of a different nature: for instance to embeddings of
3-dimensional manifold groups or to functional analytic properties of mapping
class groups.

Quasi-isometric geometry is a way of considering geometric properties of a
space which are unchanged by a "small" change of the distance function. In this
proposal the PI considers the geometry of various natural families of groups and
studies question such as: to what extent do geometric properties determine
algebraic ones. One family of groups which the PI continues to study with Walter
Neumann (Barnard College) are those associated to 3-dimensional manifolds---
these spaces are of crucial importance throughout low-dimensional topology and
in physics as well.
