The purpose of this research is to establish a test model of a highly
comprehensive supervision system. It will be implemented on a 200 Series
Omnimill with a Flex-Mate Controller. Sensors of tool wear, tool breakage,
chatter, geometric errors due to cutter deflections, and of cutter overloads
will be employed. Signals from the sensors will be processed together with
predictions based on inputs derived from the numerical control (NC) program and
on analytical models and simulations. Using these models and information theory,
corresponding corrective actions will be derived and carried out through
routines implemented in the NC Controller. Thus, this system will be
comprehensive in that sense that apart from the sensor signals it includes also
inputs from the Computer-Aided Design (CAD)/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)
system for more than just the usual cutter location path data and it includes
the Controller for the execution of the corrections. Some of these corrections
will permanently modify the NC program.
