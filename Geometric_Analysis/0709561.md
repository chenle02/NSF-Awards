Abstract

Award: DMS-0709561 Principal Investigators: Krzysztof P. Wojciechowski, Slawomir
Klimek

We propose to organize a conference on applications of Dirac operators in
geometry, topology and quantum field theory at the Department of Mathematical
Sciences of the Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis from
Friday to Saturday, March 2-3, 2007. The main purpose of the conference is to
create an opportunity to present and discuss some of the most recent and
important results in the aforementioned area of mathematics.

The tentative list of speakers includes 1. W. Muller (Bonn University) who will
talk about the relation between the spectral analysis of Dirac operators and the
Selberg Program. 2. A. Carey (ANU Canberra) is expected to talk about his recent
work on spectral flow and the spectral shift function. 3. J. Dodziuk (CUNY New
York) will talk about Laplacians on graphs. 4. M. Braverman (NEU) will talk
about generalized analytic torsion and eta-invariant. 5. S. Stolz (Notre Dame)
will talk about applications of Dirac operators in algebraic topology. 6. L.
Nicolaescu (Notre Dame) will talk about his research on singularities. 7. P.
Kirk (IU at Bloomington) will talk about applications of eta invariant and
spectral flow to the study of the topology of 3-manifolds. We have also
scheduled several talks by graduate students who are about to complete their PhD
theses on related topics.

This meeting has a long and outstanding tradition dating back to 1994. It is
well-advertised within the Indiana math community. It is recognized as an event
having a unique atmosphere with a mixture of presentations of new results and a
lot of interaction between older and younger generations of mathematicians. The
list of speakers includes many famous mathematicians whose work is related to
Dirac operators. Previous meetings have resulted in several important
collaborations by the participants published in journals of the highest quality
. This year we are going to make an extra effort in order to bring the
Conference to the attention of the math community on a national level and we are
going actively pursue graduate students with research interest related to the
Conference.
