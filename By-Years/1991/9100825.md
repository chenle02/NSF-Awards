A physics research program for nine undergraduate students is planned at UC
Irvine each summer for the next three years. The program involves projects with
a variety of physics research groups under close faculty supervision. Close
contact between the student participants is promoted through shared housing, a
special seminar series, excursions to other research labs in the Los Angeles
area, and social activities. The program is administrated by a senior Ph.D.
research physicist/teacher experienced in involving undergraduates in research.
With the assistance of the project PI, this administrator arranges publicity,
recruitment, orientation, seminars, excursions, a post-summer follow-up program,
and generally works to insure a valuable research experience for students in the
program.
