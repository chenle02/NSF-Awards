0922992&lt;br/&gt;Strasser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a
request for NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) support for acquisition of
a dual beam SEM/FIB (Scanning Electron Microscope / Focused Ion Beam) system at
the University at Buffalo (UB), State University of New York (SUNY). The
instrument would be incorporated into and managed by UB's INS (Integrated
Nanostructured Systems) Instrumentation Facility. The acquisition is driven by
an interdisciplinary group of UB faculty from four different departments
(Electrical Engineering, Chemical &amp; Biological Engineering, Physics, and
Chemistry). The envisioned instrument will allow UB researchers to expand their
research activities into a broad range of new applications. The proposed
instrument will be capable of fully automated preparation of samples for
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), structuring and modifying surfaces, deep
etching of materials, defining devices and depositing both metals and insulators
with nanoscale resolution.
