The proposal will install and operate an all-sky camera in the vacinity of
Nothern Michigan University in collaboration with Cornell University. The all
sky images from the camera will overlap and extend the east-west coverage
possible when combined with the imager operated by Boston University at the
Millstone Hill Observatory. Investigations using these data will focus on the
equatorward edge of the diffuse aurora. The particular phenomena to be
investigated are the large scale undulations along this edge often observed
during times of enhanced magnetic activity. The observations will be coupled
with ionospheric plasma convection measurements using the Millstone Hill
incoherent scatter radar. The project involves undergraduate students at
Northern Michigan University who will learn image processing techniques to
manipulate the images. The auroral science will be mentored via strong
electronic collaboration links to be established between NMU and Cornell.
