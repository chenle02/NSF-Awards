This project will support the year-round Center for Undergraduate Research in
Mathematics (CURM) which will promote academic year undergraduate research in
mathematics and statistics based upon a unique model. CURM will support faculty
members mentoring undergraduate students in research groups that consist of 2-5
students and 1 faculty mentor working together as a team on a research project
at their own institution. CURM will accomplish this by administering mini-grants
to approximately 11 faculty each year who will mentor approximately 35
undergraduate students conducting research in mathematics and statistics during
the academic year at their home institutions across the U.S. Included will be
workshops that will bring all of the participants together from around the U.S.
to (1.) train the faculty mentors in mentoring skills, in helping their mentored
students succeed in graduate school, and in setting up consistently funded
undergraduate research groups at their own institution and (2.) allow students
the opportunity to present their research to their peers, prepare for graduate
school, and hone their technical communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
CURM project will target two critical transition phases: (a) undergraduate
students making a successful transition to graduate school; and (b) newer
mathematics faculty members making a successful transition to becoming
successful and contributing members of their institution. We will target female
participants and participants from undergraduate institutions. For the first
transition point, undergraduate students will be mentored so that they develop
the skills that will help them in graduate school and in their research. For the
second transition point, we will provide new faculty members with the necessary
skills to successfully set up and maintain long-term research programs that also
involve mentoring undergraduates.
