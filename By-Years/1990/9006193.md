The purpose of this continued research effort is to develop a animation
(simulation) technique for construction site layout and operations optimization.
A experimental 3-D graphics tool will be developed for use in assessing the
value of computer animation in construction site activities; that is,
quantitative reporting of user activities and resource utilization. Such
reporting capability will make possible the scientific evaluation of computer
animation functionality. It would also act as an educational tool that could be
used for pedagogical purposes as well as to identify future construction site
research problems.
