Proposal #: 93-21879 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V KNORR, a 279 foot vessel owned by the Navy, the R/V OCEANUS, a
177 foot vessel owned by NSF, or the R/V ATLANTIS II, a 210 foot vessel owned by
WHOI. All of these vessels are operated by the Institution in support of
oceanographic research, and NSF is the primary user of each ship.
Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware, a 3-D GPS system, an FSI
CTD system, CTD data storage upgrades, Niskin bottles, auxiliary sensors for the
CTD, a calibration temperature bath controller, a water filtration system, a
multi-sensor core logger, a -70 degree freezer, a grab sampler, a hydro winch
slip ring assembly, a portable sterilizer. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the ships during 1994/95 and
will enhance the scientific capability of the vessels in the future.
