The evolutionary relationships of species within an ancient family of bony
fishes (the gars) will be determined by comparing the electrophoretic
similarities and differences in their gene products (enzymes) and in the tissue
patterns of expression of these genes. The use of species differences in
developmental patterns of gene expression as biochemical traits constitutes a
new approach to the systematics of this group, and will help establish a basis
for the application of this approach to investigate the evolutionary
relationship of other organisms. This approach should also yield new insights
into the nature and rates of change of gene regulation over different
evolutionary times.
