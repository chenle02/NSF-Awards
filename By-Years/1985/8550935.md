The Puerto Rico Resource Center for Science and Engineering has developed a
program for assisting teachers at both the elementary and high school levels.
The Center will offer the following three workshops: oWorkshop I for Secondary
School Teachers on the Supervision of High School Research; oWorkshop II for
Elementary School Teachers on How to Develop Teachers for the Teaching of
Science; and oWorkshop III for High School Teachers on How to Develop Teachers
for the Teaching of Chemistry and Physics. Workshop I will help teachers develop
the necessary skills to serve as advisors of scientific research projects
proposed by students for presentation at science fairs. Fifteen secondary school
teachers will attend a three-week session during the summer of 1986. Two follow-
up sessions, one each semester, will be held to analzye students' research
projects and to constructively help the teacher-advisor bring these projects to
fruition. Workshop II will help elementary teachers develop the content and
methodology necessary to teach and understand hands-on work in the classroom.
Workshop III will help high school teachers in physics and chemistry improve
their approach to teaching science. Twenty teachers will attend each workshop at
each site. Follow-up activities will be provided at four sessions each semester.
