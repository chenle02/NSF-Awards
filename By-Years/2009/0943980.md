This Phase I Center will address the foremost challenges in the field of C?H
functionalization: the regioselective and stereoselective modification of
unsaturated carbon centers. The goal is to make available a suite of chemical
transformations for C-C, C-N, C-O, and C-X bond formation that are predictable,
general, and utilitarian. The realization of this objective will provide novel
technologies that change traditional paradigms for the logic of chemical
synthesis. The Center for Stereoselective C-H Functionalization will broadly
share their research results to maximize the impact of this award. The Center
will also fund collaborative training opportunities between Center investigators
and also with industrial partners for graduate students and postdocs. The Center
will partner with regional Minority Serving Institutions (HBCUs or HSIs) to
provide symposia and research opportunities to students from under-represented
groups. Center investigators will also engage high school teachers and students
in the Center projects. The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program
supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental chemical
research challenges that have a high probability of both producing
transformative research and leading to innovation. These Centers will attract
broad scientific and public interest by sharing the results of their innovative
approach to this challenging question.
