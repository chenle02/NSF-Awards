The authors have previously developed a model of hypertext, called Trellis,
based on the formalism of Petri nets. As in other hypertext models, Trellis
represents information fragments and the relationships that tie the fragments
together. An important premise underlying Trellis is the claim that the actions
of browsing a hypertext should be formally represented. A formal description of
browsing not only permits analysis and verification of the dynamic properties of
a document, but also standardizes the semantics of browsing by providing a
succinct, unambiguous, and implementation-independent definition of behavior.
Within its notational framework, Trellis provides the ability to synchronize
simultaneous traversals of separate paths through the hypertext and the ability
to incorporate access considerations into the hypertext, specifyingnodes that
can be proven to be visible only to certain classes of browsers. Trellis is a
timed model, permitting specification of event delays and durations as well as
system-generated invocations. The investigators conduct two main projects under
this research. Both are based on the Trellis hypertext work already
accomplished. The first is the development of abstract representation methods
that permit the mapping of a single unified hypertext specification into
documents suitable for each of many different hypertext systems. This, in turn,
can reesult in interchange methods for different hypertext systems based on
translation into and out of the unified model. The second is an authoring
language "laboratory" to allow the rapid specification and evaluation of
hypertext authoring languages. The projects will produce results of both
theoretical and practical interest.
