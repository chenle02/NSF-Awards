The Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pT181 contains a cis-acting sequence element,
cmp (for competition), whose deletion impairs the plasmid's ability to coexist
with an incompatible plasmid. The element, which is external to the minimal
plasmid replicon, affects the ability of the plasmid's origin of replication to
utilize the plasmid-encoded initiator protein. The goal of this study is to
understand the molecular mechanism by which cmp affects the site-specific
interaction between ori and RepC over a distance. Structural requirements for
cmp will be elucidated in terms of minimal sequence, DNA bending and distance
from ori. Comparative studies with cmp-like elements in other plasmids will
define common structural and functional features. These studies will be carried
out by using an in vivo assay for the Cmp phenotype using plasmids having
progressive deletions of the cmp region, having cmp located at various distances
from the origin, or having the pT181 cmp replaced by cmp-like elements from
other plasmids. Cmp plasmids have a lower titratable negative supercoiling than
Cmp+ plasmids. The nature of the linking difference associated with cmp will be
studied by assaying levels of superhelical tension in vivo in cmp+ and cmp
plasmids by means of a supercoiling-sensitive promoter. The contribution of
other plasmid elements to cmp-associated supercoiling will be examined by
determining the linking difference between non-pT181 plasmids carrying pT181 cmp
and/or ori in the presence/absence of RepC. The possibility of interactions
between cmp and other plasmid elements and between cmp and host factor(s) will
be investigated by isolation and characterization of plasmid-and host-linked
mutations that suppress the Cmp phenotype. A knowledge of cmp structure and
function will provide the first evidence for the participation of enchancer-like
elements in DNA replication. This study will contribute to our understanding of
the mechanisms by which auxiliary factors and DNA elements govern site-specific
interactions between proteins and DNA.
