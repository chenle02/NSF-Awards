This research program is for study experimentally and theoretically of the
coherent generation of electromagnetic radiation using electron beams as the
lasing medium. The proposed major areas of activity are: (a) Research on short
period wigglers (microwigglers); (b) Electron cyclotron maser (CARM) amplifier;
(c) High efficiency, 35 GHz UBITRON; (d) Theoretical studies of free-electron
laser mechanisms and novel accelerators. Studies under (a) are motivated by a
desire to develop table-top size facilities operating at lower voltages. Studies
under (b) and (c) are in part motivated by a desire for novel higher frequency,
high power drivers for use in the next generation of RF LINAC's, with the view
of increasing the acceleration gradients above those available at present. The
theoretical studies under (d) will be tied closely to the experimental projects.
