9360656 Flores Only a small number of persons are trained to transcribe Braille
music to the printed form. The conversion is a manual process, thereby limiting
the access that blind musicians have to printed music. The purpose of the
planned investigation is to develop a computer-aided (PC Windows environment)
Braille music transcription system which will automate the process and allow
individuals with little training in the Braille music code to transcribe printed
music into Braille. The translator to be developed would also provide the
capability to a blind musician to enter Braille music code and produce sheet
music for use by sighted musicians. Success in developing a computer-aided
transcription will meet an important need. ***
