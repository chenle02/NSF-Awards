The conference "Recent Advances in Algebraic Geometry" will be held May 16--19,
2013 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The motivation behind the
conference is the extraordinary progress made in the past decade in our
understanding of the geometry of higher dimensional algebraic varieties, as well
as in areas such as Hodge theory, enumerative geometry, or syzygies. It will
bring together leading experts in Algebraic Geometry, to inform the audience of
the major developments of the past few years, to propose new research
directions, and to establish connections between different subfields. The
following themes will be represented at the conference: the Minimal Model
Program and its applications, vanishing theorems and multiplier ideals, derived
categories and applications, Hodge theory and complex geometry, moduli spaces
and enumerative geometry, commutative and computational algebra. More details
about the conference, as well as the list of confirmed speakers, are available
at the conference website, at http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~mpopa/robfest/

The conference will focus on some of the outstanding recent developments in
Algebraic Geometry. The speakers have been chosen on the basis of their research
contributions to the field, but also for their expository skills and dedication
to the development of younger generations of researchers and teachers in
mathematics. Some have produced many of the most important textbooks and
advanced monographs in Algebraic Geometry in the last decades, have introduced
many of today's algebraic geometers to active research topics, and have been a
major force in developing the field as a whole. We therefore expect the
conference to be well-attended by young researchers wishing to learn about, and
then share with members of their groups, current questions in a wide spectrum of
topics. The talks will contain a substantial expository and didactic component
for this younger audience, for whom it is sometimes difficult to keep up to date
with the rapid developments that the field is seeing.
