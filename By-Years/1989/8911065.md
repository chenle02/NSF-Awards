Gas Chromatography (GC) used in conjunction with Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy gives the chemist a powerful tool for the separation and
identification of a wide range of compounds. The knowledge and use of these
techniques are indispensible to the modern chemist. This RUI award from the
Chemistry Instrumentation Program will be used by the Department of Chemistry at
Point Loma Nazarene College to help acquire a GC-FTIR system for research and
teaching. The areas of chemical reasearch that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include the following: 1) Mechanistic investigations of halogenation
reactions 2) Synthesis of substituted cholic acids and carbohydrates.
