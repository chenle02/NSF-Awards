This award supports the continuation of the summer undergraduate research
(REU)&lt;br/&gt;program in the Department of Physics at Lehigh University. Each
summer program lasts ten weeks, with most students beginning around June 1. The
student is expected to become involved in all aspects of a particular research
project of suitable challenge and duration. The program involves research,
weekly faculty seminars and lab tours, a student symposium at the end of the
summer, and various social functions that foster the interaction of
undergraduate students with faculty and graduate students. The topics of
research available to undergraduates include Astrophysics, atomic and molecular
physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, optics, nanotechnology, plasma
physics, and statistical physics. The site is co-funded by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;
