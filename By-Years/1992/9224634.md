This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the
Chemistry Division in support of the research of Prof. Thomas Katz. The focus of
this research is the rational development of ways to make a variety of
helicenes, to obtain them optically active, and to link them together to produce
ones much larger than available before.The Diels-Alder reactions of enol ethers
of bis-acetophenones and related nitrogen and sulfur compounds will be studied
as routes to the helicenes. A number of ways will be evaluated to obtain the
helicenes optically active, including a new method using amine adducts of
quinones. The methods to be studied for linking helicenes will include one using
the Diels-Alder reaction, a second using photocondensations, a third involving a
unique trimerization, a fourth using charge-transfer complexes, and a fifth
using coordination complexation. The synthetic approaches will allow helicenes
to be made in large quantities which has not been possible before. The
synthesized helicenes should have novel optical properties, including very large
rotational strengths, electronic absorptions at very low wavelengths, and
nonlinear optical coefficients, which may impart unique material properties to
these compounds. %%% Professor Katz will focus his work on the rational
development of ways to make a variety of helicenes, which are helical molecules
with unbroken chains of conjugated electrons that wind in one direction. The
synthetic approaches will allow helicenes to be made in large quantities which
has not been possible before. The novel optical properties of these helicenes
may impart unique material properties to these compounds allowing them to be
used to make high-density optical storage devices and new liquid-crystalline
phases.
