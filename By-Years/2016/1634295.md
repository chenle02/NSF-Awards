1634295 &lt;br/&gt;Jewett, Michael &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
support for the 'Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED)
Conference 2016' to be held at the Hilton in Chicago, July 18-21, 2016. SEED
2016 is the third conference in an annual series of meetings intended to bring
together researchers from industry and academia in the area of Synthetic
Biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEED conference will provide leadership in
the development of the field of synthetic biology and will serve to broaden the
participants in the field by appealing to broad sectors in industry and
providing a means for young investigators and those outside of the field to
participate. It will focus on designing, harnessing, and expanding the
capabilities of biological systems. The multidisciplinary session topics will
include (i) Self-sustaining systems and photosynthetic driven bioproduction,
(ii) Biological circuits in natural and engineered systems, (iii) Bio-design
automation, (iv) Biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by
the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET and by the
Synthetic and Systems Biology Program of MCB.
