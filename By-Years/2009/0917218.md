Computer systems are commonly coupled with human operators who
add&lt;br/&gt;hands, eyes, and judgment to the computer programming and its
sensors&lt;br/&gt;and actuators. The operators can be viewed as programming
platforms&lt;br/&gt;in their own right, where manuals, training, and system
feedback&lt;br/&gt;provide the programming. However, operators have unique
platform&lt;br/&gt;characteristics compared to computers, including, in
particular, the&lt;br/&gt;likelihood of making numerous and diverse errors.
Hence systems that&lt;br/&gt;rely on operators require a protection envelope
representing an&lt;br/&gt;engineered collection of system behaviors that prevent
important types&lt;br/&gt;of operator errors from leading to losses. Having a
well chosen&lt;br/&gt;protection envelope is crucial to the robustness of a
system that&lt;br/&gt;relies on human operators. This project formalizes
operator task&lt;br/&gt;analysis based on models, languages, and techniques
created for the&lt;br/&gt;formal analysis of concurrent processes and use this
formalization to&lt;br/&gt;specify and automatically prove properties of the
protection envelopes&lt;br/&gt;of systems that rely on human operators for their
safe and secure&lt;br/&gt;execution in specified environments. The project uses
concurrent game&lt;br/&gt;structures to provide a technical foundation for
reasoning about&lt;br/&gt;protection envelopes specified using alternating-time
temporal logic.&lt;br/&gt;Progress is validated with case studies for airport
screening and&lt;br/&gt;veterinary tagging protocols. Interest in this type of
contribution&lt;br/&gt;will extend beyond specialized areas like jet pilots and
nuclear plant&lt;br/&gt;operators to roles like: customers in ecommerce
transactions or&lt;br/&gt;automated retail checkouts, drivers in automobiles
with new types of&lt;br/&gt;computer control, managers of smart warehouses,
factory floors, and&lt;br/&gt;office buildings, and first responders in
emergencies.
