This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project proposes to test
the feasibility of extended delivery of ciprofloxacin from a novel lipid drug
delivery vehicle : the vesosome. Ciprofloxacin is a valuable antibiotic whose
therapeutic index would be enhanced with an extended release vehicle.
Ciprofloxacin remains stably encapsulated in conventional unilamellar liposomes
during storage in buffer. However, ciprofloxacin is known to leak rapidly from
conventional liposomes in vivo, even with optimized compositions, which limits
the therapeutic benefits. This difference is believed to be due to membrane
degradation by macromolecular serum components. Hence, fundamental stability
advantages are expected in vivo with a multi-membrane vesosome. In this Phase I
project, ciprofloxacin will be loaded into vesosomes by standard chemical
gradient techniques and the formulation efficiency, stability during storage,
and release rates (in serum) will be measured. If performance is found to be
superior to optimized unilamellar liposomes, clinical development of vesosomal
ciprofloxacin would follow.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of drug delivery,
particularly for delivery of ciprofloxacin. Therapeutic indications would
include critical blood-borne infections, lung infections, and localized
infections.
