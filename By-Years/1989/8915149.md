Funding for software development for bioacousitc research is requested. A
diverse research group will perform bioacoustic research in such areas as bird
vocalizations, elephant vocalizations, and human linguistics. A common theme
found in the proposals is the analysis of the structure of acoustic signals. The
advances proposed include: real-time display of the signals together with audio
reproduction, signal analysis, editing capability and interchangeable modules
capable of handling the various modes of differing projects.
