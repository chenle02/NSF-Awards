The research involves the improvement of pitch-based carbon fibers used in
construction of composite materials. Composites using various shaped fibers are
formed, the compressive properties are tested, and comparisons made to predict
optimum fiber shape. Matrex stress analyses for each fiber shape are considered
theoretically. The buckling load and moment of inertia of the fibers are
determined experimentally. The matter of fiber formation is emphasized. All
fibers are produced by the same method and under the same conditions- melt
spinning. The experimental portion requires chemical processing combined with
mechanical testing. This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards
for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
