9451280 McHenry This project aims to upgrade and modernize the undergraduate
laboratories for instruction in materials science and engineering. In
particular, the new equipment is used in the development of two new
superconductivity laboratory experiments, and also a demonstration with emphasis
on producing high temperature oxide superconductors of current interest. The
laboratories are structured so as to emphasize synthesis and processing of
ceramic materials while demonstrating novel superconducting properties. The
laboratory equipment impacts upon the students' ability to synthesize state of
the art materials as well as to characterize their structural and
superconducting properties.
