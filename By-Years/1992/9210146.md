This proposal is to study the formation of melanocyte cell hybrids which
contain negative regulatory genes that suppress either the production of melanin
or the production of basic fibroblast growth factor. Individual chromosomes from
non-pigmented cells will be transferred to melanocytes, and chromosomes from
normal melanocytes will be transferred into melanoma cells. Techniques are
available to form microcell hybrids which can then be subjected to karyotypic
analysis for identification of the individual chromosomes. Tissue specific
extinguisher loci have not been well characterized in melanocytes, although they
have been characterized in liver cells. In liver cells, down-regulation of
target gene expression occurs at the mRNA level; similar experiments will be
carried out in melanocytes. %%% Melanocytes produce the pigment melanin under
closely regulated conditions. When melanocytes are converted to melanoma cells,
which are frequently cancerous, the production of melanin and of a growth
factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), is increased. This proposal is to
prepare microcell hybrids of melanoma cells containing individual chromosomes
from normal melanocytes, in order to isolate the specific genes that in normal
cells suppress the production of melanin and of bFGF. The individual chromosomes
will be identified by standard karyotypic analysis. The molecular structure of
the genes involved in suppression will then be determined.
