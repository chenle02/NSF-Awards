Hindered transport of fluids in pores of molecular dimensions, and equilibrium
partitioning of the fluid components between a bulk external phase and
microporous membranes are being investigated. Computer Simulation of model
systems via grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics
techniques and theoretical studies in statistical mechanics and kinetic theory
are used to clarify the mechanisms involved when transport partitioning of
fluids in micropores cannot be treated by conventional hydrodynamics or
continuum formulations. In particular, the influence of fluid particle/pore wall
and fluid particle/fluid particle specific interactions at different
temperatures and densities are investigated. Furthermore, membrane models, with
pore structures characteristic of many real porous media employed in chemical
practice, are used to delineate the influence of pore structure on these
processes.
