The focus of this research is to study the behavior of roof trusses fabricated
using cold-formed members and connections. Both full-scale and sub-assembly
tests of steel roof trusses will be conducted. The test specimens will be
representative of industry design, fabrication, and erection practices. Of
particular interest will be the behavior of the connections, to include
eccentricities resulting from the use of C-shaped members connected back-to-
back, and the use of self-drilling screws as connectors. Emphasis will be placed
on defining the member buckling characteristics and the influence of the end-
restraint effect of the end connections. This is a cooperative project with the
American Iron and Steel Institute.//
