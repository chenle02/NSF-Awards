The International Conferences on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems has
been held every two years since 1964. Over the years, these conferences have
played an extremely important role in promoting the development and application
of a variety of magnetic resonance techniques to the solution of biological
problems, and are clearly recognized as the premier international meetings in
this important field. The XIVth meeting will be held in England in September,
1990. It will cover the latest advances in the fields of NMR and ESR including
(1) protein and peptide structure and dynamics; (2) 3D structure from 2D NMR;
(3) metalloprotein and electron transfer; (4) biological membranes and (5)
magnetic resonance imaging.
