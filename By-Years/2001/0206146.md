An understanding of the processes by which stars and planets form remains one of
the fundamental goals of astronomy and astrophysics. Although the broad outline
of the process has become clear, much remains unexplained, particularly
concerning rotational and orbital angular momentum evolution during the pre-
main-sequence lifetime of young stellar objects. How and why do multiple systems
form from a single infall envelope? What physical mechanisms regulate the
rotation rates of young stellar objects? How do rotational velocities evolve
with pre-main-sequence evolutionary state? The PI will carry out two major
projects to address these questions: 1) a dedicated, comprehensive program for
the determination of protostellar rotational periods via near-infrared
photometric monitoring to obtain lightcurves, and 2) a systematic near-and mid-
infrared, high angular resolution survey of embedded young stellar objects in a
single star-forming cloud to discover and characterize the evolution of
binary/multiple systems over timescales of 100,000 to 1 million years. ***
