This project is concerned with the automorphism groups of partially ordered
sets which are highly homogeneous. The principal investigators will focus on
freeness and high transitivity of almost all subgroups, the representation of
free products with amalgamation as highly transitive subgroups, and maximal
subgroups. They will also explore the automorphism group of the real line. A
group is an algebraic object having a multiplication defined on it. Groups occur
naturally in many areas of mathematics, physics and chemistry. Every finite
group can be embedded in a group of permutations. This project is concerned with
infinite permutation groups. It involves group theory, logic and combinatorics.
There are also possible connections with computer science.
