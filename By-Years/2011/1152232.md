With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professor Kenneth Suslick at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign and Mr. Michael Schilling at the Getty Conservation Institute and
their groups will develop a new approach to cumulative colorimetric sensor
arrays and the development of a compact CCIS-based array analyzer for museum
monitoring. Specifically, the PIs propose to (1) create new approaches to
colorimetric sensor arrays to meet the extraordinary sensitivities demanded for
artwork monitoring by the use of cumulative colorimetric sensors, (2) test newly
developed arrays against the important museum pollutants at relevant
concentrations, (3) construct a compact CCIS-based array analyzer, (4) create
software to use the compact CCIS reader to identify pollutants for intermittent
(e.g., hourly) wireless reporting, and (5) test the analyzer at the Getty
Conservation Institute under more realistic conditions and with applications to
specific curatory issues at the GCI. The proposed research, if successful, will
provide a new and exceptionally powerful technology for molecular recognition
and sensing and apply it to the low-cost monitoring of the environment and
atmosphere (i.e., museum pollutants) in contact with artworks on display, in
enclosed display cases, and in storage. In addition to significantly improve the
process through which cultural heritage artifacts are stored, displayed and
protected for the education, edification, and enjoyment of future generations.
This collaborative project will strengthen ties between academic researchers and
museum conservators extending the capabilities of both groups. Advanced student
training at all levels from postdoctoral level to high school is expected.
Research results will also be disseminated through scientific magazines
targeting general public.
