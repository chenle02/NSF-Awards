9622176 Malley The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer with autosampler
requested in this proposal will be used for several ongoing research in the
areas of environmental engineering such as: "An Evaluation of UV for
Disinfection of Groundwater and its Effect on Biological Regrowth in
Distribution Systems"; "Role of Protozoa in an Organically-Contaminated
Subsurface Environment". "Bioremediation of Alaskan Soils Contaminated with
Petroleum Hydrocarbons"; The Effect of Natural Organic Matter and Iron on
Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) in Radon Removal from Drinking Water".
Evaluating GAC Sandwich Modifications to a Slow Sand Filtration Facility";
"Treatability of Natural Organic Matter from the Croton Reservoir - New York
City"; and "Fundamental Research on the Mechanisms of the WES-Phix Process in
Eight Waste Materials." In each of these projects, low levels of organic carbon
play a fundamental role in the biological, chemical and/or physical processes
that are occurring in the environmental engineering system being studied. The
TOC analyzer will quantify these low levels and detect small changes in the
organic carbon that may impact each system's engineering behavior.
