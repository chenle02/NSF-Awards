This research is concerned with characterizing geometries related to the Lie
incidence geometries and other geometries related to simple groups. One part
concerns geometries whose basic planar unit is an affine plane. A critical side
issue of that study has been the determination of the geometric hyperplanes of
the Lie incidence geometries. In this connection a geometric characterization of
alternating k-linear forms seems imminent. This would show that all hyperplanes
of Grassman spaces arise from such forms. A second part concerns a more long-
range effort to generalize the characterizations of Lie incidence systems into a
systematic whole. The third concerns some new directions into "non-parabolic"
geometries related to simple groups. The fourth concerns substructures of polar
spaces. The research in this project involves the interplay between finite
dimensional geometry and the actions of groups of transformations on these
geometries. This work has implications for the structure of finite groups, for
algebraic coding theory, and for finite geometry.
