This ambitious mathematical research project has to do with actions of Lie
groups, and certain of their discrete subgroups, on manifolds. A very simple
example of this situation is the group of rotations of three-dimensional space
about axes passing through the origin, acting on a sphere centered at the
origin. In higher dimensions, the examples become more exotic, and more
importantly, as Professor Zimmer has discovered, the rules of the game that say
what sorts of actions can occur on what sorts of manifolds change in striking
and fundamental ways. A whole new subject, which might be called nonlinear
representation theory, is growing up to take its place next to the older and
much better understood theory of group representations on vector spaces. This
research impinges directly on four core areas of mathematics: analysis,
geometry, algebra, and topology. More specifically, Professor Zimmer will
investigate the topology of manifolds admitting an action of a semisimple Lie
group or discrete subgroup by describing features of the representation theory
of the manifold's fundamental group. The arithmetic nature of actions of of
these groups will be investigated. There will be continued study of the
phenomena alluded to above that make the higher-dimensional case qualitatively
different from the lower-dimensional.
