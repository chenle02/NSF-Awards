The aim of the project is to study double affine Hecke algebras, new and very
useful objects in representation theory with many applications in mathematics
and mathematical physics. The main objectives are as follows: 1) semisimple and
unitary representations of double affine Hecke algebras and the harmonic
analysis direction, 2) the counterpart of the Jantzen filtration and its
connection to the Plancherel formula for affine Hecke algebras, 3) the non-
semisimple theory and its applications to the decomposition of the polynomial
representation, 4) the polynomial representation as |q|=1 and at roots of unity
with possible relations to Lusztig's quantum groups.

The theory of double affine Hecke algebras attracts now quite a few specialists
in representation theory and neighboring fields. It has deep relations to
physics (the quantum many-body problem, Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation,
Verlinde algebras and more). It also provides deep formalization of the concept
of the Fourier transform, demonstrates the power of p-adic methods and
tremendous potential of the q-functions. The project includes algebraic and
analytic aspects of this quickly growing theory and applications, for instance,
possible applications to the Langlands duality.
