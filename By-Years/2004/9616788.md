9616788 Gross The myriad changes in the electric power industry are bring about
very major changes in every aspect of the industry. The recent legislative and
regulatory initiatives are providing further pressures for accelerating these
changes. These are resulting in the disintegration of the heavily entrenched
vertically integrated structure. With the release of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Orders 888 and 889, a foundation for the rules of the road
of the new regime has been established. This workshop will focus on the
technical and engineering issues associated with the restructuring of the
industry. The Workshop will provide a forum for some of the leading electric
power system experts to exchange views and develop a compendium of research
needs and draft the blueprint for research directions. The Proceedings of
prepared presentations, papers and discussions and the summarized
recommendations will provide a conference record that will be disseminated to
the power research community at large. ***
