This research project in theoretical computer science focuses on problems in two
interrelated areas: algorithms for graph problems, and the design of data
structures. The common theme is the investigation of efficient computation in
these area. The goals are to generate improved techniques, and characterize
significant complexity relationships. A central issue is the efficient
coordination of the acquisition of information during a complex computational
task. Three problems concerning graphs are being investigated: (1) balancing
competing demands. An example is finding a spanning tree of a graph subject to
balancing mutually contending terms in the objective function. (2)The
sensitivity of algorithmic solutions to changes in the problem input. (3) Search
strategies for relocatable objects in graphs. In addition, the project
investigates data structures for dynamic maintaining of information about
graphs.
