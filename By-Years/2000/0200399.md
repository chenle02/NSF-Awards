An investigation is proposed to develop an innovative built-in diagnostic
technique for a reliable and quick initial assessment of composite
retrofitted/rehabilitated civil infrastructure upon inspection after a major
seismic event or at a routine maintenance. The major components of the smart
composite system consist of composite materials for structural reinforcement and
a diagnostic sensing system for assessing the integrity of the retrofit. The
diagnostic sensing system is made of thin diagnostic sensor films, external
hardware far signal generation and processing, and diagnostic software for
signal interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To assess the integrity of the
retrofit after a major earthquake or at routine inspections, pre-determined
diagnostic signals will be generated automatically from piezo-actuators built in
the film to neighboring optical fiber sensors. Diagnostic software will compare
sensor measurement with a baseline reference taken at a healthy condition to
determine quickly and reliably the status of the integrity of the structures in
three possible levels: Green-no damage and continuing usage, Yellow-minor damage
and continuing usage with caution, and Red-severe damage and no usage with
immediate repair. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon completion of the study, a
prototype of the proposed system will developed. Field implementation and tests
will be followed to further verify the efficiency and reliability of the smart
systems. This project will be conducted in collaboration with the Smart
Structure Research Center of Japan and the California Department of
Transportation&lt;br/&gt;
