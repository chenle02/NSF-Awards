A summer institute in physics will be offered to 20 teachers. The institute
will be 6-8 weeks in length. Those participants who opt for the longer time will
have the opportunity to be involved in a research experience with the university
faculty for 2 weeks. There will be 6 two day follow up sessions on the
university campus during the academic year. Electronic networking between the
teachers is anticipated where feasible. Graduate credit will be offered for
those who complete the entire program. The project is aimed mainly at teachers
whose major was in an area of science other than physics who teach in smaller
schools in rural areas in Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin. A few
leader/master teachers will be included. These teacher will act as mentors for
the under prepared participants. A strong emphasis in the program is placed on
the constructivist approach to teaching to reflect the results of current
research in physics teaching. Demonstrations, laboratory experiments, field
trips and seminars will broaden the spectrum of course offerings. Cost sharing
is (43%).//
