As the gate oxide thickness of a metal- oxide- semiconductor (MOS) transistor
shrinks down to below 10nm, there is strong evidence that the carrier mobility
in the conduction channel is reduced systematically with gate oxide thickness.
The objective of the research is to experimentally establish the relationship
between the channel mobility and the gate oxide thickness for both p and n
channel devices over a wide range of thicknesses (3-20nm), with a goal toward
the development of a set of empirical equations useful for future device
simulations. In addition, important issues pertinent to the processing of very
thin oxide MOSFET MOS field effect transistors (FET) devices will be
systematically investigated; the results should be relevant to practical down-
scaling of VLSI devices.
