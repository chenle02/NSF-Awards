This award will support collaborative research in eukaryotic genetics between
Dr. James Haber, Brandeis University, and Dr. Bernard Dujon, Pasteur Institute,
Paris, France. The objective of the project is to compare and contrast two
different recombination systems of yeast. The role of double-strand breaks (DSB)
in initiating recombination has been well established in experiments ranging
from X-ray induction of recombination to the "targeted" transformation of
restriction endonuclease-cleaved DNA. In this project, the researchers will
compare and contrast HO- and w-endonuclease initiated DSB recombination in
yeast, using genetic and physical methods of analysis. The work will be carried
out using galactose- or phosphate-regulated genes to control expression of the
nuclease. Recombination will be primarily assayed using a plasmid containing
transcribed and untranscribed copies of the E.coli LACZ gene, where the
transcribed copy is disrupted by the endonuclease recognition sequence. Both
researchers have carried out significant work on recombination systems, and the
proposed project will benefit greatly from their combined expertise. This
collaboration offers a unique approach to the study of recombination events that
occur in different organelles of the eukaryotic cell.
