Research funded by this grant will support the detector development activities
of several university groups. These groups are part of a large collaborative
effort involving physicists from many countries to build the Compact Muon
Solenoid (CMS) detector. This detector will analyze the collisions of high
energy beams produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The ultimate goal of
this experiment is to better our understanding of the structure of matter and of
the basic forces of nature.
