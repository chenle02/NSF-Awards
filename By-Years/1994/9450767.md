9450767 Small The CUPM Recommendations for a General Mathematical Sciences
Program detailed a new view of undergraduate mathematics, stating a philosophy
centering on goals for student learning and outlining a needed broadening of the
curriculum. Subsequent CUPM documents call for a 4-semester sequence of study
that contains the core of mathematics normally found in three semesters of
calculus and semesters of discrete mathematics, linear algebra, differential
equations, and probability and statistics. This call for a broader view of
mathematics dovetails well with the vision for secondary school mathematics
outlined in the NCTM's Curriculum and Evaluation Standards. A workshop during
summer, 1994, brings together leaders from secondary, community college, liberal
arts and research university mathematics to discuss such 7-into-4 programs and
to review their implications for the variety of individuals and client
disciplines they serve. The United States Military Academy at West Point has a
fully implemented model of a 7-into-4 curriculum. The activities of the workshop
focus on discussing the content that should be central to each of the seven
curricular areas, examining the Academy's program, and considering how content
can be better integrated to better prepare the students served. The products of
the conference consist of proceedings with commissioned papers and reactions,
details on the West Point program, and actions and recommendations of the
workshop. Panel discussions based on the workshop will be proposed for future
MAA meetings. ***
