Tunable monolithic inductor and capacitor (LC) circuits for use in miniature
wireless transceivers will be developed using microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) technology. Smaller, higher performing, and less-costly integrated
systems are the goal of wireless personal communication systems (PCS). Advances
in nanofabrication technology are enabling the creation of complex mechanical
structures such as inductors (L), and tunable capacitors (C) that can be
monolithically integrated on silicon and thus reduce the number of off-chip
discrete elements. A copper-encapsulated polysilicon spiral inductor suspended
over a cavity in silicon has been fabricated and achieved a quality factor (Q)
of 36 at 5 GHz. Through this new fabrication technology of integrated
polysilicon and bulk silicon micromachining, other high-performance rf (radio-
frequency) elements will be developed. Among them are parallel-plate variable
capacitors tuned by microactuators, transformers, and tunable LC filter
circuits. The fabrication and microactuator technologies to be developed will
have far reaching benefit to the MEMS and nanotechnology community by enabling
new classes of devices in areas beyond wireless communications.

The success of the MEMS field depends not only on new enabling technologies, but
also on the education and training of a pool of skilled engineers and
researchers. As MEMS open new markets, and with the growing efforts in
nanotechnology, a critical need for MEMS-trained engineers will develop. The
MEMS curriculum development will involve refinement of the senior-level
undergraduate MEMS course; establishment of a new MEMS project design course;
and the building of MEMS instructional infrastructure, specifically an
Instructional Laboratory for MEMS characterization, simulation and design that
will facilitate cross-disciplinary exchange. The interdisciplinary nature of
MEMS makes it an ideal environment for the training of a new generation of
students who will receive exposure to a broad range of concepts
