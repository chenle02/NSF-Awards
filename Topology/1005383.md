The Conference on "Topology and Geometry in Dimension Three: Triangulations,
Invariants, and Geometric Structures" will be held at Oklahoma State University,
June 4-6, 2010. The conference brings together experts and emerging researchers
to report on recent results and explore future directions in the study and
understanding of 3-manifolds. Geometric structures on 3-manifolds are known to
exist but relatively little is known about direct construction of these
geometric structures; specifically, constructing the geometry from a
description, such as a Heegaard splitting or triangulation of the manifold. This
conference will highlight finding direct connections between topological
structures on 3-manifolds (triangulations in particular) and geometric
structures and expanding the use of these structures to a study of new
invariants and applications of hyperbolic geometry to 3-manifolds.

Three-dimensional space provides the local space-model for much of science and
engineering. Three-manifolds are locally modeled on three-dimensional space and
their study and understanding leads to better predictions and understanding in
science and more effective applications in engineering and technology. Recent
advances in our understanding of three-manifolds has generated new energy making
it one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas in mathematics; and
making this Conference very timely for reporting on emerging results and
plotting future directions.
