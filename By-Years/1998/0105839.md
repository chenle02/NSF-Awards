The research will use a variable-resolution stretched-grid general circulation
model (SG-GCM) to conduct climate studies on anomalous regional events. The
following issues will be addressed: (a) numerical experimentation with new
emerging SG-GCMs incorporating land-surface models; (b) simulation at seasonal
and interannual temporal scales, and regional-to-global spatial scales; (c)
improved understanding and modeling of processes that affect regional climate
variability. The major goals are simulating the 1997-1999 El Nino Southern
Oscillation and related monsoon circulation with 25-40 km and finer resolution;
studying intraseasonal and interannual regional climate variability for the
extended multiyear SG-GCM simulations; studying the impact of sea surface
temperatures and land-surface forcing on SG-GCM simulations; studying the impact
of ensemble integrations; and developing educational tools for students. The
work is important because the SG-GCM formalism may prove to be a viable new
approach to regional and subregional climate studies and applications.
