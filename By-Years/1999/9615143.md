ABSTRACT EEC-9615143 Pearlman The analog technology of television is in the
process of changing to the recently approved FCC High Definition Television
Standard which is digital. Although digital video is mature enough to generate
and deliver digital video alot of research is necessary to enhance and broaden
the current capability. This award provides funding for a planning meeting for
an industry/university meeting to determine if there is sufficient industrial
support to establish an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Digital Video at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The envisioned research
agenda of the proposed Center would address: digital image and video processing,
filtering; image, video, and audio compression; communications - terrestrial,
cable, and satellite; networked video and high speed switching ; multimedia;
content creation; semiconductors and materials (VLSI); servers and mass storage;
and displays.
