The "Career Connections Program" is a three year project designed to increase
the awareness of technically based careers in fields requiring mathematics and
science among disadvantaged and minority students. The primary components are
counseling, faculty development, academic tutoring, career awareness programs,
parent/guardian involvement, with teams of teachers, counselors, and
scientist/mathematicians/engineers from the private sector partners. The program
will begin in 1989 with 300 ninth grade students assigned to teams of volunteer
teachers who will be scheduled to blocks of time for math and science with
groups of participant students. The high school counselors assigned to these
same students will also be participants in the team. Paraprofessionals, and
graduate students will form a link between the school program and the parent(s).
Private partners will provide various types of career awareness activities
growing out of the particular industry from which individuals may come. The
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will provide supervision and training of
members of the teams. South Division High School in Milwaukee is located in the
midst of the Hispanic community and has a broad representation of minorities and
a drop-out rate of 50% over four years. Cost sharing of the partners will total
103% of the National Science Foundation funding.
