This award provides funds for the renewal of a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site in Minority Group Demography at the University of Texas at
Austin. The Sociology Department and the interdisciplinary Population Research
Center will host the REU. For ten weeks each summer, eight students will be
exposed to demography via course work, seminars, and hands-on research
apprenticeships with faculty. In addition, they will write scholarly papers,
present their work in colloquia and conferences, and participate in
professionalization workshops. Students may be affiliated with projects ranging
from race/ethnic infant mortality differentials, to the experiences of women of
color in the labor market, to the performance differentials among college
students by ascribed statuses like ethnicity and gender. An Ethics seminar will
introduce professional ethics as an explicit part of the curriculum and
professional socialization efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes
to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
in science through active undergraduate research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;
