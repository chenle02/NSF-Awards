ABSTRACT

The investigator is organizing the 2002 Red Raider mini-symposium at Texas Tech
University on ``Contemporary Algebra and Algebraic Geometry". The mini-symposium
will consist of five distinguished lectures on current research topics on group
theory and its applications, algebraic structures and algebraic geometry. The
distinguished lectures will be delivered by William Fulton, Robert Griess, James
Lepowsky, Gregory Margulis and Efim Zelmanov.

The purpose of the mini-symposium series is to put together a program in which
some of the most oustanding scholars in selected areas of Mathematics and
Statistics will deliver lectures on timely research topics and methodology, with
the objective of providing members of the mathematical community, especially
early career mathematicians and graduate students, an opportunity to broaden
their repertoire of research tools and to learn about new research venues. The
event also provides a forum for members of the mathematical community to
interact with outstanding scholars in a relaxed atmosphere. The above list of
speakers includes two Field Medalists (the Field Medal is the highest
recognition bestowed in Mathematics) and three members of the National Academy
of Sciences.
