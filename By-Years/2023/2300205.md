The provided support will enable United States-based students to attend and
participate in the 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE
2023). This conference will take place in Anaheim, California, USA from April 3
2023 to April 7, 2023. The ICDE 2023 conference is a premier international
technical event centered on various aspects of database research and practice.
It provides a forum that promotes students and researchers to identify
scientific foundations for building large-scale database management systems that
can work ever more effectively. Efforts will be made to broaden the
participation of underrepresented students and researchers. The conference will
thus contribute directly to training the next generation of scientists who are
both consumers and developers of technology in database management system design
and implementation. The involvement of United States-based students will have a
direct impact in creating a highly-qualified workforce that can take on the
emerging data science challenges of the future.

Database research profoundly influences many domains of societal importance
including health sciences, the field of Internet of Things (IoT), service-
oriented computing, real-time business analytics, and social computing. The ICDE
2023 conference provides researchers and practitioners from academia, industry,
and government agencies with an excellent opportunity to share their research
and experiences on all aspects of data management and analysis at scale. The
aims of the conference are multi-fold: (1) to provide an international forum for
sharing research results addressing major challenges in next-generation database
research; (2) to stimulate interactive discussions on research in the database
area through panels, posters, tutorials, and student scholar roundtables; and
(3) to motivate and engage future generations of researchers via the many
conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, and panel
and breakout sessions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
