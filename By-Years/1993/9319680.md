ABSTRACT P.I. Rebecca Huss-Ashmore/Christine Varga SBR- 9319680 Adolescent
preganancy is an important problem world-wide. This is true not only because of
its increase, but because of the associated health problems for young women and
their babies. In the U.S., adolescent mothers are characterized by having a high
prevalence of obstetric and neonatal complications. These are linked to maternal
behaviors, especially to inadequate antenatal care and poor nutrition. It is
also clear that the urban context affects pregnancy outcome by influencing both
health-related and reproductive behavior. In South Africa, adolescent pregnancy
has also become a major problem. South African studies have revealed an
association between late or non-entry into antenatal programs and poor preganncy
outcomes among urban teenagers. However, almost no research has addressed
intermediate factors affecting clinic attendance patterns. Similarly, there is
little data on adolescent diet. This project will assess antenatal care and
nutrition (diet and energy reserves), and examine the relationship between
clinic attendance, nutrition and pregnancy outcome among urban South African
primigravida adolescents. Project objectives will be achieved by 1) the
examination of demographic and socio-behavioral factors and 2) investigation of
nutritional status and 3) collection of pregnancy outcome data. This study
relates to the anthropological concern with human adaptation to specific
environments - in this case, the modern urban environment. The graduate student
already has been awarded a Fulbright Fellowship and is in th e field. ***
