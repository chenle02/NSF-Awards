9616775 Murthy The purpose of this grant is to perform an evaluation of Russian
research on the exploitation of electromagnetic (EM) effects I hypersonic
flight. There are many possible approaches to the use of EM to boost the
potential speed and efficiency of hypersonic aircraft, and may possibilities for
following research involving plasmas, EM, computational engineering, intelligent
control, new materials and so on. The major goal of this work is to see what the
Russian research really tells us about the nature and viability of such
possibilities. ***
