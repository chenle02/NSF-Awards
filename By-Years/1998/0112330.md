The Department of Mathematics at the University of California at Los Angeles
will purchase a PC cluster which will be dedicated to the support of research in
the mathematical sciences. This equipment will be used by researchers in the
UCLA applied mathematics group to carry out the parametric studies required for
the development and implementation of multi-scale mathematical models. This type
of modeling effort is associated with several research projects and spans a wide
range of application areas including semi-conductor growth modeling,
computational fluid dynamics, and image processing.
