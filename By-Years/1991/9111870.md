A comparative theoretical study of the interactions of positron and of
electrons with atoms will be made. The research will include the following
topics: 1. Positronium formation in ground and excited states with high positron
impact energy. 2. Comparison of theoretical calculations of collision cross
sections for various processes with positron and electron impact. 3.
Annihilation and thermalization of positrons and the transport of electrons in
various gases. The theoretical methods used optical scattering potentials for
the collision cross section calculations and time dependent solutions of the
Boltzmann equation in order to estimate the time dependence of various
parameters related to electron or positron transport.
