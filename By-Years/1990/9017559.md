The proposed research plans to provide a fundamental understanding of the
behavior of light secondary attachments and equipment in large space structures
under a variety of microgravity loading conditions. One main objective is to
develop passive and active vibration control strategy for sensitive on-board
equipment. Responses of light secondary systems and equipment aboard large
flexible space structures and spacecrafts with or without vibration control
devices will be analyzed. These systems and equipment will be subjected to
acoustics, on-board moving (rotating) instrumentation, lift-off, micrometeroid
impacts and maneuvering and deployment loadings. Deterministic and probabilistic
techniques, as well as, digital simulations will be used in these analyses. The
nature of tuning of secondary systems to space structures with passive or active
vibration control devices will be critically examined. Particular attention will
be given to performance analyses of frictional dampers for passive vibration
control of equipment aboard space structures.
