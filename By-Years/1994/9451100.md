The aim of the project is to establish an introductory undergraduate laboratory
with a modern three-dimensional fiber braiding machine for manufacturing,
testing and applications of high performance textile materials and structures
for composites. This project will foster a proposed cooperative educational
experience between Textile Engineering and Materials Engineering at Auburn
University. The specific educational objective is an introductory knowledge of
composites for the manufacturing and application of various flexible structures
in composites. Besides its regular use as an undergraduate teaching laboratory,
the proposed equipment will provide excellent opportunity for undergraduate
students in their senior design projects and independent studies. This project
will help to produce graduates with knowledge of the latest thrust in fibrous
materials for industrial applications. This project will integrate textile
engineering, textile chemistry and materials/mechanical engineering. It will
expand the range of textile applications in high performance materials mark will
take the students beyond the borders of traditional textiles and introduce them
to new manufacturing methods and applications of textiles where high performance
is a requirement. It will introduce students to new, innovative textile
structures for composites. The proposed braiding machine will be used to
manufacture advanced textile structures for composites. The purpose is to
produce a range of high quality braided textile structures to be used as
composites in high performance applications for the automotive, aerospace and
construction industries. This project will strengthen the University's
interaction with industry.
