Chemistry Department is purchasing two double beam recording spectrophotometers
for use in several upper division courses. Students in biochemistry are using
the instruments to study the effects of varying the reaction conditions of the
rates of enzymatic reactions and in characterization of DNA preparations. The
spectrophotometers are also being used to analyze hydrocarbon mixtures in
advanced instrumental analysis laboratories. Additionally, undergraduate
research participants are making extensive use of the instruments in their
investigations.
