The International Council of Scientific Union (ICSU) will expand its efforts to
plan for and to improve international coordinationm of global change research.
To this end ICSU's new Advisory Committee on the Environment will oversee and
coordinated the various ICSU programs and other activities related to global
change research. These include the International Geosphere-biosphere Program
(IGBP); global change-related activities of ICSU standing committees, such as
those of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Researh (SCOR); and global change-
related programs of ICSU unions. A new ICSU science officer for global change
will staff the Advisory Committee on the Environment; organize ICSU forums on
global change issues; serve as ICSU liaison with other international
organizations and private industry groups concerned with global change research;
and ensure effective implementation of the ICSU Strategy on Global Change.
