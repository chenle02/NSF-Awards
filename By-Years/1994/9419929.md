NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY PI: URCUIOLI IBN-9419929 How Expectancies Influence
Behavior The ability to anticipate forthcoming events which occur with
predictable regularity is very important to both humans and animals. The
capacity to anticipate future events has often been demonstrated to influence
ongoing behavior. Yet there is much about this important cognitive ability that
is not well understood. This research program will examine the types of
situations in which animals learn to expect predictable future events, will
assess the cognitive processes by which these expectancies develop and will
investigate the mechanisms by which these expectancies influence behavior. These
goals will be accomplished through experimental comparisons of the predictions
made by two prominent learning theories regarding the nature of the experiences
thought important for expectancies to develop control over behavior. The
resulting information will provide a much clearer picture of which types of
experience are necessary, and will thus provide important insight into the
origins of the ability to anticipate events.
