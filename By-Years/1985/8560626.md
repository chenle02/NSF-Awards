The research will attempt to reduce to practice a "hot electron" photocathode
that has been described in theory. If successful, this would provide a viable,
and perhaps economically feasible, method for solar-powered chemical processes,
specifically photo-electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
