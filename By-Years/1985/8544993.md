This research will develop a computer program to assist production managers in
coordinating their work and in making decisions. The program will integrate such
factors as facility layout, forecasting, planning, scheduling, and inventory
control. The approach comprises four tasks: (1) developing a prototype data base
for a production system; (2) developing software capable of simulating and
graphically displaying facility layout, planning, scheduling, and control; (3)
developing an improved layout routine that includes probabilistic and
sensitivity analyses; and (4) developing an algorithm for inventory allocation.
