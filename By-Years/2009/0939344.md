This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "A Practical Approach to Integrating Nanotechnology Education into
Undergraduate Curriculum", at North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCAT),
under the direction of Dr. Dhananjay Kumar, will bring together a team of
engineering faculty members who are actively involved in nanomaterials-based
research to enhance undergraduate nanoscience and engineering education in the
area of devices and systems. The goal of the project is to expose undergraduate
students to the design, manufacturing and characterization of nanostructured
materials systems and device prototypes. An interdisciplinary nanotechnology
course (Nanotechnology I) with a significant hands-on laboratory component will
be developed as a preparatory course and will be offered as a junior-level
technical elective open to all engineering majors.
