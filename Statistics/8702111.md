The research which is proposed here is mainly concerned with two problems in
methods associated with generalized linear models: diagnostics for tests of
significance and data analytic methods in the presence of overdispersion. While
there has been substantial development of diagnostic techniques associated with
point estimation in generalized linear models, the research proposed is to study
the effects of individual data points on tests of hypotheses concerning
parameters of the model. The purpose includes ascertainment of whether the
significance of a test is overly dependent on a very small part of the data, and
other diagnostic issues. The proposed technique is based on the contributions of
individual data points to the likelihood ratio test statistic. The second part
of the proposed research concerns regression and analysis where the response
variables are like binomial or Poisson but exhibit more variation that would be
expected from these probability distributions. Several issues related to this
case are proposed for study: (i) the similarities and differences in
overdispersion models based on covariates being omitted and based on covariables
being measured with error, (ii) the analysis of data when there is
overdispersion due to both omitted variables and measurement errors, and (iii)
data analytic methods involbing interactions when there is overdispersion
present. Regression methods are used to predict what some entity will be or will
do based on related information and to determine the strength of association
between measurements and responses. The proposed research will enhance and
augment the collection of statistical research tools and procedures that are
referred to collectively as "regression analysis". This research promises to
lead to improvements in the performance of these tools when variables are
measured with error and when influencial predictor variables are unknown or
unavailable, and therefore omitted. Since this situation is extremely common in
experimental and social science, improvements will have a wide positive impact.
