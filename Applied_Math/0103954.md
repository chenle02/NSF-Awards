This research addresses behavior of solutions to the mathematical equations of
capillarity theory. The equations will be studied in their full nonlinear
generality, using procedures deriving from the intrinsic structure of the
physical problems. These procedures have turned out to interact in a natural way
with newly developed methods of geometric measure theory, which were developed
initially for the special case of minimal surfaces in other contexts. In a
number of cases of interest, striking and unusual behavior of solutions was
uncovered in this way. Our investigations will continue in directions that have
already led to discoveries of discontinuous dependence on boundary data,
symmetry breaking, failure of existence under physical conditions, failure of
uniqueness under conditions for which solutions exist, and discontinuous
reversal of comparison relations.

Capillary interfaces play an important role in many practical situations,
notably in reduced gravity or in configurations for which physical length scales
are very small. Capillarity is an essential concept for describing situations in
which substances are in contact at surface interfaces and do not mix. A precise
understanding of the mathematical properties of solutions of the capillarity
equations will provide valuable insight for resolving such matters as how to
design fuel tanks on an orbiting spacecraft so that the fuel will be accessibly
located, predicting where oil or water resides in underground pore spaces of
rocks, or determining the manner in which the faces of microelectronic
components will become partially covered when they are dipped in a coating bath.
The work under consideration is of particular relevance for predicting
unexpected behavior of liquids in these and in other applications.
