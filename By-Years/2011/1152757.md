This award will support workshops at annual winter meetings of the Association
for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO). The period to be covered
includes the 2012 Ocean Sciences meeting to be held in Salt Lake City as a joint
effort among ASLO, the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and The Oceanography
Society (TOS) and the 2013 ASLO Aquatic Sciences meeting to be held in New
Orleans. The PI will have two workshops at each meeting, one will be a video
workshop (film festival) to be held on the Sunday before the formal meeting
schedule and the other will be an evening panel discussion during the week. The
underlying need for these workshops is that the environmental science community
is doing a poor job of conveying to the general public the severity of
environmental problems we face today and developing an interest within the
public and elected officials for remedial actions. Through this work we will
create a greater awareness within the research community of the need for more
outreach and to provide guidance on how to better communicate the results of our
research.
