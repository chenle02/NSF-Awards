With this Alan T. Waterman Award, the Foundation is supporting the research of
Dr. Robert M. Waymouth of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University.
Professor Waymouth is the twenty-first recipient of the award and will receive a
medal as well as a $500,000 grant over three years for scientific research or
advanced study in any field of science. Dr. Waymouth has been cited for his
seminal contributions to the design of well-defined organometallic catalysts for
the synthesis of novel polymers. His research interests target the interface of
inorganic, organic and polymer chemistry. Dr. Waymouth's dedication to teaching
is attested to by his award winning activities at Stanford.
