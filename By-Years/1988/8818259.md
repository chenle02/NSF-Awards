The purpose of this proposal is to provide three workshops and several study
sections whose objective is "to develop an infrastructure which will unify the
bioengineering community in the United States." With the introduction of
bioengineering as a recognized engineering discipline, it is imperative that a
professional society be established to coordinate the research and industrial
efforts of the bioengineering community. This organization will also be a source
of information and direction for academic and government agencies which use
bioengineers in their mission. This effort is essential for the vitality and
properly directed growth of bioengineering in the United States.
