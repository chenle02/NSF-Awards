The proposal is to continue the studies of the Sun at the Big Bear Solar
Observatory, exploiting the excellent observing conditions and specialized solar
instruments. The data obtained are then studied at Caltech. They propose to: 1)
continue comprehensive observations of the Sun in various wavelengths, and of
the Doppler and vector magnetic fields. 2) continuous measurements of vector
magnetic fields and velocity fields in active regions and magnetic movies in Ho
to understand the causes of solar flares. 3) study new data showing a strong
influence of sunspot motions in causing flares. 4) study the motions and flows
in sunspots to understand how they form and what keeps them stable. 5) observe
solar flares in the infrared helium line, hitherto not possible on a regular
basis. 6) continue our BEARALERT program of electronic warning of high
probability of solar flares. 7) study important details of sunspot structures.
8) make round-the-clock observations of solar magnetic fields to understand
their evolution and development.
