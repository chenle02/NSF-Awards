Physics (13) The project is adapting and implementing exemplary research-based
instructional strategies in a physics department at a multicultural urban
college. The project involves the participation of a large fraction of the young
and future faculty in the department. The group is working together to change
the way introductory physics is taught in a particularly challenging context.
The project focuses on strategies and curricula that are student-centered, based
on physics education research, and that integrate advances in instructional
technology, but that were all developed for a different audience. Most of the
successful reform strategies require significant interactions among students and
between students and instructor. Therefore the adaptation requires care, since
students come from many different cultures and most speak English as a second
language. The intellectual merit of this project is in using the tools of
physics education research to systematically study how students learn and to
develop an understanding of issues specific to the multicultural context. The
project is having a significant impact within the department and institution. In
addition, this project making a much broader impact nationally because the
college is representative of a large number of multicultural urban colleges
