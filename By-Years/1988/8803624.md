The PI proposes continued field work and petrological, geochemical and
structural studies of both high P and high T components of the Seward Peninsula
convergent orogen. Thermal relaxation in crust thickened by Jura-Cretaceous has
caused uplift and exposure of a continuous sequence of blueschists to
amphibolites and granulites. Detailed work is planned in the Kigluaik Mountains
to investigate the geodynamic evolution of middle and lower crustal levels in
this convergent margin. P-T- time paths will be established using
thermobarometric and geochronology methods. The role of fluids will be
investigated using phase equilibria, fluid inclusions, and stable isotopes.
Simple thermal models will be constructed to explain metamorphism of thickened
crust.
