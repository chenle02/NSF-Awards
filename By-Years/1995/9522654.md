9522654 Pantelides The concept of convex modeling provides an attractive
alternative for analysis of uncertainty in systems for which a limited amount of
information is available. The optimization algorithms to be developed will be
used for minimizing the volume of a structural system under uncertain static
loads, self-strained uncertainties such as fabrication errors, temperature
gradients, support settlements, and a combination of the above uncertainties.
Constraints on the joint displacements and member stresses will be imposed.
Another type of problem with uncertainty is that of minimizing the volume of a
structural rotational or transnational supporting springs. Constraints on member
stresses and joint displacements are imposed. A different type of problem is one
of minimizing the amplitude of the primary structure equipped with a dynamic
absorber when uncertainties exist in the damping and frequency characteristics
of the vibration absorber and the primary structure. The optimum design of
structures with uncertain structural properties, under uncertain earthquake
excitations will also be performed. Finally the minimum volume design of
structures with uncertain soil- structure interaction properties, under
uncertain earthquakes will be performed.
