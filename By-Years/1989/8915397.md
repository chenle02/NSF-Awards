The objectives of the proposed project are to gain fundamental understanding of
the dynamic, thermal, and chemical structures of premixed and nonpremixed flames
of chloromethane and tetrachloroethylene, and to provide insight into such
practical issues as flame stabilization, fuel mixing, and surrogate selection
for incineration of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The investigation will involve
laser-based measurement of temperature, velocity, and major species in an
opposed-flow burner over a range of pressures and mixture ratios. The detailed
structure will be compared to numerical predictions using available chemical
kinetics data, and asymptotic analysis will be used to derive a reduced
mechanism. Incineration is a viable technology for the safe disposal of
hazardous chlorinated hydrocarbon wastes. These chemicals, however, are more
difficult to burn than their unchlorinated analogs, they form soot more easily,
and trace amounts of highly toxic compounds can be generated. The proposed
research will increase the knowledge base of the combustion of this class of
compounds.
