This award will support the development and expansion of a consortium of
universities and corporations for the purpose of research exchanges with Japan.
In particular the award will cover the activities leading up to and including a
three-day conference and planning meeting to be held at the University of
Arizona at which representatives of the participating universities and
corporations will meet to develop detailed agendas for the exchange program.
Japanese representatives will also attend for one of the three days. The
principal emphasis of the planning conference will be on defining an effective
strategy for expanding American experiences in Japan. The important goals of
this consortium are as follows: 1) increasing the number of American scientists
and engineers with firsthand experience in Japan through short-term and long-
term research experiences in Japan; 2) involvement of scientists and engineers
from industrial research labs; 3)access to more technically advanced facilities
and equipment in Japan; 4) facilitating the rapid exchange of students within
active research programs; and 5) expanding the exposure of young researchers to
international research environments. This program will contribute to U.S. policy
goals of increasing access to Japanese research and development and sending more
American researchers to Japan. It should also make the decision to go to Japan
easier for the individual researcher by providing a matrix of institutional
backing and support so that their visits to Japan are seen as enhancing to the
individuals' careers.
