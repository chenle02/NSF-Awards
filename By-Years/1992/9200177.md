This award provides support for two undergraduate researchers working under the
supervision of the principal investigator on problems arising from number
theory. It is concerned with the roots of L-functions of number fields and of
algebraic curves. The Riemann zeta function is the most famous example of such
an L-function. Knowledge of the precise location of the roots would have far
reaching implications. For example, information on the roots of the zeta
function relates to the distribution of prime numbers, while the roots of the
L-function of a curve are related to the number of points on the curve. The
students will study certain concrete cases - orthogonal polynomials which arise
as Mellin transforms. They have a particularly simple form, and the background
needed to analyze these functions is not extension. Symbolic computation using
software such as Maple will play an important role in this work.
