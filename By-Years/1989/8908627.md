This Research Initiation Award will permit Dr. Wang to continue his integration
of passive and active sensing techniques. Dr. Wang recently joined the
University of California at Santa Barbara, where he is building capabilities for
3-D vision research. Integration of passive and active vision is an important
and relatively new research area where he and his students hope to contribute to
industrial computer vision. Initial work will use active sensing to add surface
detail to contour or silhouette information derived from multiple passive views.
