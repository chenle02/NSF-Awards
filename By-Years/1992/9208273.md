This doctoral dissertation project focusses on the intersection of legal
discourses and discourses on ethnic and national identity in the British Virgin
Islands. It examines the ways ethnic and national identities have been mutually
constructed during the islands' twentieth century experience of continued
colonial status, an economic boom fostered by tourism, and a concomitant
increase in migration from other Caribbean islands. British Virgin Island
national identity has been precariously defined against migrants from
independent Caribbean nations who come to work there (who currently make up
almost half of the islands' population), the islands' relationship to the UK,
and the tourists British Virgin Islander businesses hope to attract. Unlike
earlier research which took ethnic and national identities as "givens" and
attempted to explain their interactions in terms of "adaptation" resulting from
competition over scarce "resources," this study follows leads from recent work
on India which questions the premises of adaptationist approaches. Using court
cases, records, and interviews, the study will contest the definition of
"resources" and "competition" as self-evident, and test the proposition that
"resources" themselves are historically constructed along with legal and
cultural processes of national and ethnic identity formation. This research will
add to anthropological theory on nationalism, ethnicity and law.
