&lt;br/&gt;EF-0312612&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bernstein,
Herbert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a few years ago,
interactive rendering of the surfaces of several hundred atoms with the best
available software strained the then-available hardware. Current software
technology for the rendering of molecular surfaces is slightly short of the
performance needed for high-quality interactive rendering of the largest
macromolecules on commonly available graphics workstations. Some of the best
available packages in terms of performance are limited in their range of
applications. This is the time for an aggressive push to gain the best possible
software performance and the best possible coverage. This project aims to
provide a significant improvement in surface-rendering algorithms by trading
time for space, by changing dots and triangles to elliptical rendering elements
more appropriate to this task, and by embedding an awareness of display
resolution in the algorithms used. The contribution of this project is in an
improved understanding of the tradeoffs among the parameters involved. The
broader impacts of this effort include training of undergraduate students in the
cross-disciplinary skills required for work in Bioinformatics, preparing of
curriculum materials that should be of value to others teaching undergraduates
and first-year graduate students such skills, increasing general awareness of
the importance of the interaction of resolution considerations with analysis of
algorithmic complexity in computational geometry, and increasing use of
molecular surface renderings to facilitate understanding of interactions among
molecules.&lt;br/&gt;
