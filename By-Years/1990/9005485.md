Components necessary to complete construction of a high- resolution electron
energy loss (HREELS) spectrometer are acquired and assembled. Initially, this
system will be used to study the adsorption and reaction of organic molecules on
single-crystal surfaces of conducting and insulating metal oxides. This work is
relevant to ongoing efforts to develop new selective catalysts for a variety of
industrial processes. including replacements for chlorofluorocarbons and water-
treatment chemicals.
