The major source of one-carbon groups in the cell is the conversion of serine to
glycine and methylene-H4folate. In addition to H4folate this reaction also
requires pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP). The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). This proposal focuses on elucidating its
structure, regulation, and mechanism. Under the previous grant the enzyme was
purified to homogeneity from several sources and several more purifications are
underway. Site-specific mutagenesis will be used to determine the function of
several amino acid residues at the active site in the E. coli enzyme. Next the
structural genes from rabbitt liver which code for cytosolic and mitochondrial
SHMT will be cloned. The genes will be isolated sequenced and expressed in a
procaryotic plasmid system. Additionally, the function of mitochondrial SHMT
will be determined.
