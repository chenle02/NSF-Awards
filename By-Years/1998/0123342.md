0123342 Raskin The objective of this research is to develop and optimize
biologically active carbon (BAC) filtration systems to remove low concentrations
of perchlorate from drinking water. These systems must produce water that meets
all regulatory standards, is biologically stable so that its quality does not
degrade during distribution, is free of odorous substances, and has a low
chlorine demand so that excessive chlorination by-product formation will not be
an issue. The proposed research could result in an efficient, bench-scale
perchlorate treatment process that can produce water meeting these requirements.
The specific objectives are: (1) to develop methods for microbial identification
and quantification in BAC filters, (2) to develop a biofilm modeling approach
for optimizing BAC filter operation and design, and (3) to integrate process
engineering optimization, microbial characterization and biofilm modeling. ***
