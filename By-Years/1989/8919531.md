In nature, young rhesus monkey females are integrated for life into their natal
group, whereas males transfer during puberty. The social position that young
females attain in their group depends very much on that of their mother. When
adult, a female's place in the rank-order is usually at about the same level as
that of her mother and sisters. There are strong indications that this
inheritance of status is mainly a social (as opposed to genetic) process,
brought about by the young female's association with her kin. Not only a young
female's future rank, but also her future friends in the group are to some
extent predictable; she will form bonds with other females of her age and status
level, both kin and nonkin. Whereas these outcomes of social development are now
fairly well known, the details of the process are not. There are many ways in
which mothers, actively or passively, may guide their daughters' development,
for example, by supporting them against particular opponents, by bringing them
into contact with the offspring of their kin and friends, or by preventing the
development of certain other contacts. The purpose of this research project is
to continue an investigation of the way rhesus mothers shape the social
environment of their daughters. Data will be collected on a wide range of
behaviors of young monkeys and their mothers in two large groups. For the first
time, social development will be followed over the entire developmental period,
from birth to adulthood, in order to investigate the extent to which social
interactions at early stages of development predict relationships formed at
later stages. Because this project considers socially positive behaviors (e.g.,
bonding, social tolerance) along with socially disruptive behaviors (e.g.,
aggression, rank acquisition), the study may be able to integrate these
behaviors into a single theoretical model of social relationships.
