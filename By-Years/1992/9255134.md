The Marquette University Equal Opportunity Program (EOP), together with the
College of Engineering, offers a 4-week Summer Science Camp Program that
provides enrichment experiences in science, engineering and mathematics 59 48
middle school minority students, plus academic year activities at Marquette and
in three area middle schools. Activities include: 1) exploration of "The
Wonderful World of Robotics" through hands-on discovery and demonstration
activities in civil, mechanical, electrical and computer engineering; and 2)
construction of a LEGO/TC robot to accomplish a task of their choice. Academic
year follow-up activities include: 1) Science Saturdays at the MU College of
Engineering; 2) Science Clubs; 3) one-on-one assistance with students' science
fair projects; and 4) participation in a mini science fair at MU. Both summer
and academic year programming provide career exploration, college planning, and
personal development components designed to inform and motivate middle school
students about preparing for careers in science, engineering and mathematics.
