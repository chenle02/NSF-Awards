This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes new
electrochemical measurements in supercritical water environments for material
corrosion studies. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is a unique and
promising approach for neutralizing a wide variety of wastes. However, the SCWO
reactors are susceptible to corrosion failure leading to contamination of the
effluent stream with corrosion products or catastrophic failure of the reactor
itself. In order for SCWO reactor technology to be scaled up and commercially
implemented, in-situ/real-time corrosion monitors are required. The proposed
measurements will yield the basic information necessary for corrosion sensor
development for SCWO reactors. The Phase I program will demonstrate the
feasibility of an in-situ/real-time corrosion monitor for SCWO reactor by
correlating our measurement technique with weight loss measurements. This
provides the basis for further development of two sensing methodologies for
continuous monitoring of corrosion in SCWO reactors. The corrosion monitoring in
real time is essential for SCWO reactors for (a) scale-up, safe, and longer
operation, (b) optimization of process parameters for maximum waste stream
treatment, (c) elimination of effluent stream contamination with corrosion
products, and d) avoidance of catastrophic failures.
