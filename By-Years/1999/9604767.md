Biologists at the City College of New York are requesting matching funds to
purchase a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The new TEM will replace a
Phillips 300 purchase 26 years ago. The research aided by the new equipment is
quite broad in aspect, covering fields such as Neurobiology, Molecular
Developmental Genetics, Immunobiology, Protistology, Molecular Systematics,
Endocytobiology, and Evolution. More specifically the following projects will be
aided: 1) Phagosome- phagolysosomal processing in diatom-bearing endosymbioses
in foraminifera; 2) Karyokinesis and systematics of foraminifera; 3) Molecular
systematics of planktonic diatoms; 4) Cell surface phenotypes of thymic nurse
cells; 5) Contact between thymocytes and thymic nurse cells; 6) Molecular and
genetic analysis of the Drosophila compound eye; 7) Molecular mechanisms
underlying axonal development and connection specificity in the embryonic and
metamorphosing nervous system of the frog Xenopus laevis; and 8) Studies of
growth factors and neurotransmitters involved in the signal cascade by means of
which the retina modulates growth of the sclera which, when awry, can lead to
myopia.
