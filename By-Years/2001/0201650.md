This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program, will examine public attitudes toward the terrorist attacks of September
11, 2001. The researchers are undertaking telephone interviews with
approximately 100 individuals each week for six months as part of a national
rolling-cross section design. The research offers the opportunity to study
public attitudes in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks and assess the impact
of threat on public opinion and its interaction with public policy decision
making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These data will be of value to scholars interested
in the topic and also to decision-makers trying to differentiate among threats
to physical safety, the American economy, and the American culture, status and
way of life. The researchers will be able to gauge how public opinion changes
over time on issues under debate in Washington in tandem with changes in
perceived threat.&lt;br/&gt;
