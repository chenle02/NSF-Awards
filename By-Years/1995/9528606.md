9528606 Mishra In recent years, vacuum microelectronic devices (VMDs) have
become of great interest in the fields such as high speed, high power devices
and flat panel displays, because of they combine the advantages of both vacuum
tubes and modern semiconductor devices. The key to the success of vacuum
microelectronics is the fabrication of the solid-state electron emitters
(SSEEs). For applicatimn in flat panel displays, it is required that SSEEs
should be stable and generate uniform electron emission with high efficiency and
moderate current density. On the other hand, for applications in medium RF power
amplifiers and high power RF sources, SSEEs should be very reliable and generate
electron emission with high current density. Two types of SSEEs, field emitters
1 and planar emitters 2,3 have been reported in the past with some success.
Field emitters, due to its intrinsic nature, have very high emission efficiency
and attracted much attention in the field of flat panel displays. Much progress
has been made in recent years in the development of field emitters arrays (FEAs)
4, owing to the fast advance of modern semiconductor technologies. In this
proposal, we propose a GaN based field emitter and its arrays with an unique
fabrication process based on reactive ion etching (RIE) and selective regrowth
of GaN point or wedge emitters. ***
