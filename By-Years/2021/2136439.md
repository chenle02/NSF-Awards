The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a wearable device and associated software
that will decrease the cost of care and improve the quality of life of the 1+ M
patients with Parkinson’s disease, their personal caregivers, and their medical
providers. This project will increase our understanding of Parkinson’s disease
and other neurological and motor disorders. It will reduce current costly
treatments with an online solution using the device and associated software. The
research objective is to develop the hardware, software application, and
database that constitute a complete, working system which will improve the
quality of life for Parkinson’s patients and improve the data available for
Parkinson’s disease researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a wearable biomedical
feedback device that communicates with a mobile application to alert users in
real time when a specific physical vocal pathology is detected by the device.
Post-event information can then be evaluated by users and their medical
caregivers using a graphical user interface within the mobile application. Data
will also be transmitted and stored in a database of people with Parkinson’s
disease. Upon addition and refinement of new data, the technical results will
include a wearable device, analytic software, and a database will be used to
improve and fine-tune the software to improve both the identification, speed,
and modality of correction as well as serve a highly valuable database for
Parkinson’s researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
