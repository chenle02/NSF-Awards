Visualization has been identified as a critical component in the process of
interactive exploration and mining of complex data repositories. This project
focuses on the issue of quality at all stages of the visual exploration process.
Types of quality considered include quality of the data itself, including
reliability, age and completeness; quality of the transformation of the data
into aggregated data abstraction; quality of data querying process by
controlling of quality-of-service of retrieved data; and quality of mapping of
data attributes to graphical objects and their screen layout resulting in
different perceptible structures and various degrees of
clutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve a ground-breaking holistic approach
towards handling quality across the visual exploration pipeline, this project
develops at each stage: (1) Metrics and models for measuring and capturing
quality; (2) Algorithms for quality optimization based on selected quality
metrics; (3) Visualizations to convey quality information for both data and
structure spaces; and (4) Interactive tools to enable the user to control the
optimization processes and specify preferences when trade-offs
exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit involves the definition,
calculation, optimization, and visual presentation of quality metrics and
attributes of both the information content and the structure space at all stages
of the visualization pipeline. The expected results will have an impact in the
application domains that routinely perform exploratory data analysis. The
resulting tools enable effective visual exploration by explicitly exposing and
integrating the quality of the data, which, while often ignored in existing
tools, can have a tremendous impact on the decision-making process. The results
of the project will be disseminated via the Internet
