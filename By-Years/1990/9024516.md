This investigation is concerned with a number of important problems in
computational algebra. These include algorithms for evaluating roots of
polynomials, evaluating eigenvalues of matrices, polynomial interpolation, etc.
Several questions related to lower bounds on the depth of computation trees will
also be explored.
