The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a high field fourier transform nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer for undergraduate instruction in an integrated
manner from the lower division through the senior course level. Eight
lecture/laboratory courses involving majors and non-majors are being affected by
the technology. Basic 13C and 1H one- dimensional and two-dimensional (COSY,
HETCOR, INADEQUATE) NMR techniques are introduced in the sophomore Organic
Chemistry course using known natural products and the students progress to
structure elucidation of unknowns in Organic Qualitative Analysis. Equilibrium
constants and reaction rates are being measured in Physical Chemistry during the
junior year. At the senior level students study induction decay in the Molecular
Structure and Reactivity course and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in both the
Advanced Inorganic Chemistry course and during participation in Senior Inorganic
Chemistry Research Projects. Inorganic Chemistry focusses on molecular structure
determination of main group and transition metal compounds, molecular
rearrangements, and electronic structure, while projects in Organic Chemistry
involve both the kinetics of molecular rearrangements of organic compounds and
the structural elucidation of complex bioactive natural products.
