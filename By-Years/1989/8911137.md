The marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium uses an unidentified mechanism to
protect its nitrogenase enzyme from deactivation by oxygen. Several cellular
oxygen consuming reactions may minimize the in vivo oxygen concentration during
periods of photosynthesis. Analysis of the mechanisms proposed to date indicates
that there remains to be discovered a significant oxygen consuming process in
the Trichodesmium colonies. The hypothesis being tested is that the
photoreduction of oxygen (Mehler reaction) removes a significant fraction of
photosynthetically evolved oxygen. Tests of this hypothesis and measurement of
other oxygen consuming reactions require stable isotope techniques. Two related
O-18 techniques are capable of determining photosynthetic oxygen evolution and
oxygen consumption rates in the light: membrane inlet mass spectrometry and O-18
isotope dilution techniques. The methods to be used are either new or have been
confined to laboratories before. With modern, reliable and compact mass
spectrometers it is feasible to conduct stable isotope techniques at sea. %%%
The nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium must possess some mechanism
whereby its nitrogenase enzyme is not deactivated by oxygen produced during
photosynthesis. The photoreduction of oxygen (Mehler reaction) is a possible
pathway which will be investigated in thei project. A newly developed mass
spectrometer and oxygen 18 isotopes will be used at sea in the Caribbean to test
the hypothesis that the Mehler reaction of general importance in Trichodesmium.
