A fundamental and long studied problem in statistical mechanics is to establish
the connection between the microscopic world and its macroscopic behavior. The
investigator's research concerns stochastic models associated with the evolution
of dilute gases, coagulation-fragmentation phenomenon and the formation of
solids. As the first step, one derives a partial differential equation for the
macroscopic evolution of such stochastic models. In the case of a dilute gas,
one shows that after a suitable scaling, the particle density converges to a
solution of the Boltzmann equation. In the case of the coagulation-fragmentation
phenomenon, the rescaled microscopic particle density converges to a solution of
the Smoluchowski equation. As a model of a crystal, one may consider an
inhomogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation with viscosity. After a suitable scaling,
the solutions converge to solutions of homogeneous Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
Probabilistically, such a convergence is a law of large numbers and its
corresponding central limit theorem and large deviation principle provide us
with some vital information about the microscopic model under the study. Our
world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid or a gas is a
collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move
erratically without any particular aim. However these molecules manage to
organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale.
The investigator's research concerns the relationship between the microscopic
structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids, gases and solids. The analysis
of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting particles
is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate behavior of fluids and
gases. Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient
way of simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases.
