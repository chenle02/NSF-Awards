Abstract

Award: DMS-0503596 Principal Investigator: Christopher M. Judge and Bruce
Solomon

The Bloomington Geometry Workshop brings together leading geometers to discuss
and disseminate recent advances in geometry and related fields. This year's list
of speakers includes Ian Agol, Francois Ledrappier, John Lott, Gang Tian, and
Fangyang Zheng. These speakers will inform participants of work in hyperbolic
manifolds, rigidity, Kahler geometry, and the Ricci flow.

The purpose of the Workshop is to help foster cooperation and collaboration
among researchers in the midwest region as well as help educate graduate
students and young researchers about the latest developments in geometry. Most
of the funding will be used to support the travel of graduate students and
recent PhD's. These young researchers will come away from the workshop better
prepared to take part in current research in geometry, a field of basic research
that is important to computer graphics, quantum physics, material science, and
many other scientific disciplines.
