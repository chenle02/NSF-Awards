The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms of eucaryotic gene
regulation. The system chosen for study is the yeast transcriptional activator
ADR1 in its control of glucose repressible alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2).
Particular emphasis will be placed on defining the mechanisms by which ADR1 is
regulated, the functional regions of ADR1, the factors which mediate or
influence ADR1 function, and the means by which these factors and ADR control
ADH2 transcription. A combination of biochemical, recombinant DNA, and genetic
analyses will be used. The in vivo phosphorylation site of ADR1 will be
identified and the role of cAMP-dependent (cAPK) and -independent protein
kinases in ADR1 regulation will be ascertained. The mechanisms by which ADR1
will be identified. The ADR1 protein will be isolated and its regions important
to transcriptional activation, regulation of glycerol growth, oligomerization,
glucose control, and induction of petites will be identified. The proteins which
bind to or mediate ADR1 action will be studied biochemically and genetically.
The SAF1-3 genes required for ADR1 activation of ADH2 transcription will be
cloned and sequenced. The role of the CCR1 and SCH9 protein kinases which act
independently of ADR1 controlling ADH2 will also be determined.
