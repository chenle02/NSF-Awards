The time of divergence of species is a fundamental question of evolution. Some
species on Earth are separated by billions of years whereas others diverged only
thousands of years ago. Understanding the divergences times is critical for
looking at rates of change across biology. Divergence times are obtained from
the fossil record and molecular clocks, where time is measured by regular
changes in DNA and proteins. A biological database of species divergence times,
using fossil and molecular data, is being designed and developed to provide
scientists with this information. The database will be web-based and provide
molecular times at different taxonomic levels, with statistics of multigene time
distribution. The ready access to this information will accelerate research in
diverse fields of science ranging from molecular biology to geochemistry and
astrobiology.
