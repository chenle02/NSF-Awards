Abstract: This award provides partial travel support and local expenses for 10
new researchers and 5 of the invited speakers at the conference on "Statistics:
Modeling of Processes in Science and Industry" being held in conjunction with
the 50th anniversary of the Department of Statistics at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). The theme reflects the research
accomplishments and philosophy of the department, which encourages interaction
between theory and applications. The main objective is the search for general
principles of statistical modeling as they evolve from specific applications in
different subject matter fields. The conference will provide a forum for
discussion of these ideas and establish communication between well established
and new researchers. The timing on the heel of the annual joint statistical
meetings in Baltimore should facilitate the travel logistics for potential
attendees. Sessions planned will cover: Process and Quality Control,
Experimental Design, Medical and Biopharmaceutical Statistics, Linear Mixed
Models, Bayesian Statistics, Nonparametric Estimation, and Survey Sampling.
