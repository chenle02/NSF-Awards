An important aspect of design is the balancing of conflicting objectives into a
unified goal. Thus, the designer can be viewed as a decision maker charged with
identifying alternatives that best match the overall design objectives. This
research focuses on methods to represent design goals in an operational form,
suitable for standard optimization formulations. The goal of the research is to
contribute to the understanding of decision making in design and the
formalization of this process in computations. The research will focus on three
aspects of the formalization of the decision process: the construction of
operational models for the aggregation of design objectives and the
representation of preference structures; the incorporation of decision making
models and optimization algorithms into a unique computational process; and the
management of this information in a rule-based, computational environment. The
methodology relies on fuzzy set representation of criteria for design evaluation
and on the exploitation of sensitivity and constraint activity information to
facilitate the communication between optimization and decision making. The
implementation of these ideas in a computational environment will promote and
organize the understanding of the process of decision making in design.
