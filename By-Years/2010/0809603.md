This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Charles G. Riordan at the University of Delaware
to develop the coordination chemistry of nickel in its monovalent oxidation
state to activate dioxygen and related small molecules. The approach combines
coordination chemistry with spectroscopic techniques, augmented with
computational studies, to generate a detailed understanding of geometric and
electronic structures of novel reactive intermediates. Long-term objectives
include advancing these new species in stoichiometric and catalytic oxidations
of organic molecules. Complementary studies aim to activate elemental sulfur and
selenium to produce new, soluble Ni-S and Ni-Se structures Related studies of
the heavier O2 congeners, S8 and Se, complement these studies affording the
opportunity to gain comparative insight into small molecule/element reductive
activation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program aims to advance the fundamental
understanding of nickel-based dioxygen activation through systematic studies
designed to address issues of structure, mechanism of formation and inherent
reactivity characteristics. Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students
will develop a range of technical skills in areas including chemical synthesis,
anaerobic and cryogenic methodologies, advanced spectroscopic methods and
kinetics while developing intellectual breadth in the underlying principles of
contemporary inorganic chemistry. Interactions with laboratories at Wisconsin-
Madison and California-Davis will expose students to collaborative approaches in
problem solving. &lt;br/&gt;
