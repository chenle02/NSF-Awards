Tohline will investigate the collapse of gas clouds to form stars, using a
supercomputer and extensive imaging of the computed gas clouds. He will start
the computed collapse either from a series of newly discovered mathematical
solutions for rotating clouds or from a set of solutions for massive accretion
disks. He will trace the development of instabilities, especially those that
cause fission into smaller pieces. Stars are known to form by the collapse of
small, dense interstellar clouds. Rotation of the clouds is known to be
important, in part because most stars occur in binary pairs. But the actual
collapse of rotating clouds has not been traced. Will the cloud split into
pieces? How fast will the resulting stars rotate? Tohline will use a
supercomputer to investigate these questions and will use images of the computed
clouds to determine which solutions most resemble those in nature.
