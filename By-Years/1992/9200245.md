Investigations of persistent atmospheric flow anomalies have found that high
frequency transient eddies play an important role in maintaining anomalies
against downstream propagation. The precise way in which these transient eddies
affect the onset and decay of the anomalous patterns remains a question. For
example, the onset of anomalies is often associated the upstream intensification
of synoptic-scale disturbance )storms), but it is not clear whether this
intensification occurs in a background environment neutral or stable with
respect to large-scale eddies or as a consequence of large-scale instability. A
diagnostic technique has been developed that allows examination of the forcing
of the slowly-varying large-scale flow in terms of both low frequency and high-
frequency transient eddy processes. It has been applied to perpetual January
data from a two level general circulation model. Results indicate that the low
frequency processes typically, thought not always, determine the local growth or
decay of anomalies. Under this award, the principal investigators will apply
this diagnostic technique to the output form a sophisticated model, the
Community Climate Model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and
compare the results with those of the previous study. This research will enhance
our understanding of the causes of intraseasonal climate variability.
