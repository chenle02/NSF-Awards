This program focuses on low temperature pressure broadening studies of three
molecules of astrophysical interest, ammonia, formaldehyde, and methanol. Both
helium and molecular hydrogen will be used as broadening agents, and comparison
will be made between the experimental results and those of theoretical
calculations also performed in the context of this project. Emphasis will be
placed on confirming the accuracy of the potential curves for use in
interpreting data from interstellar clouds.&lt;br/&gt;
