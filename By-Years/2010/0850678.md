This award provides support for the fourth meeting in the series of February
Fourier Talks (FFT), held 19-20 February 2009 at the University of Maryland,
College Park. The conference encourages and financially supports participation
by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting includes invited lectures on
topics of current research interest and also encourages poster presentations by
students and recent Ph.D. recipients. The conference brings together workers in
a variety of different areas of research in harmonic analysis, with emphasis on
shortening the process of making pure mathematics
applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
