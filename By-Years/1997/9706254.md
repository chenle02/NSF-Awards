9706254 Stolper The goals of this project are (1) to develop an experimental
data base at 25 and 30 kbar characterizing the major element compositions of
vapor-undersaturated liquids produced by near-solidus melting of subducted,
hydrated mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) beneath island arcs; (2) to determine
whether hydrous near-solidus in equilibrium with an eclogite residue are
interconnected at low melt fractions, which is important for understanding
whether these liquids can be extracted from the slab into the overlying mantle
wedge; and (3) to determine the partitioning of high field strength (HFS) and
rare earth elements (REE) between clinopyroxene, garnet, and near-solidus melts.
The experiments proposed here will expand the ability to model the geochemical
signature of near-solidus slab melts and hoe this signature would alter the
mantle and be expressed in erupted lavas from convergent margins.
