Soil erosion is the main cause of failure for dams and levees and can have
disastrous consequences, such as the catastrophies in New Orleans in 2006 and in
Iowa in 2008. According to the latest Report Card for America?s Infrastructure,
issued in 2009 by the American Society of Civil Engineers, dams and levees are
in the D minus range. Many dams and levees are structurally deficient and barely
above failing. The risk of internal erosion in earth structures becomes a
critical issue.

The main goal of this research is to address the mechanics of deformation and
instability caused by internal erosion. A stress-strain model will be developed
that will (1) consider the micro-scale mechanism of pore collapse, and (2)
account for the evolution of internal structure such as specific volume and
gradation. T his stress strain law will be implemented into a finite element
method capable of analyzing earth structure under erosion. This research work
will be conducted in collaboration with Ecole Centrale de Nantes, where an
experimental soil erosion research program is currently in progress. The
collaborator will provide experimental results necessary for this research.

The scientific significance of this research is twofold: (1) The investigation
will lead to a new direction of damage mechanics, in which the damage is not
caused by external load, but rather by a loss of part of the material
constituents. (2) The micromechanics modeling method, in which the behavior is
derived from postulated mechanisms, will provide insight into the underlying
physical processes. The study will also bring the mathematical expressions of
soil fabric (such as voids and particle size distribution) into the physics of
constitutive models, which is of core importance to a constitutive theory for
soil.

The broader impacts will be as follows: (1) Integrate research and education by
incorporating the research results and activities into graduate courses on sear
strength and soil mechanics. (2) Broaden participation and enhance diversity by
involving undergraduate students from the Northeast Alliance Program at the
University of Massachusetts, an NSF funded program aimed at recruiting
underrepresented minority students into doctoral study in science and
engineering. (3) Enhance infrastructure for research and education by
establishing international collaboration with the Civil Engineering Laboratory
of Nantes.Saint-Nazaire. (4) Develop a defense against natural disasters such as
landslides and floods through the enhancement of civil engineering
infrastructure.
