This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create
innovations in the science and application of polymer doping, fiber drawing, and
bundling technology. Research will be conducted to shrink fiber diameter limits
to submicron dimensions, to dramatically reduce diameter fluctuations, to
increase pixel density, to increase array size, to reduce manufacturing time,
and to improve array quality. Experiments will be performed to develop novel
methods of doping polymer with higher concentrations of quantum dots and other
nanoparticles. Additionally, a ribbon array cutting machine and a microwell
fabrication apparatus will be developed. The current glass-based fiber optic
technology is expensive, has limited functionality, and cannot be used in some
applications. The company's proposed polymer products will be better
replacements for current glass products, not only because of lower fabrication
costs, but because of the increased functionality polymers provide, as well.

The innovations from this Phase II program will have significant scientific,
technological, and social benefits. For example, in the fields of biological
investigations, genomic studies, new pharmaceutical development, and detection
of biological agents, polymer fiber optic arrays will increase the efficiency
and integrity of high speed analyses for high throughput parallel
experimentation. This program will also advance scientific understanding of the
dynamics of Qdot and nanopartical dopants in polymers, providing fundamental
benefits to the scientific literature for nonlinear optical polymer dynamics, as
well as new methods to exploit quantum phenomena in mesoscopic devices. The
commercialization of cost-effective, reliable microstructured fibers provides
equipment manufacturers a pathway to supply new products of high impact to
medical, information technology, and retail markets.
