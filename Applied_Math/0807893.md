The variational condition provides a unified mathematical model for a large
number of equilibrium problems. It is also closely related to other mathematical
problems such as optimization problems and complementarity problems. The
investigator and her colleagues study the mathematical structure of certain
finite-dimensional variational conditions, develop solution algorithms, and
apply these to handle model input uncertainty in practice. Specifically, they
investigate the influence of the major constraint qualifications on the
structure of the variational condition, to identify conditions that indicate
nice solution behavior and are more general than the current nondegeneracy
condition. Based on these conditions, they analyze the sensitivity and stability
of a variational condition with respect to perturbations in both the function
and the set in its formulation, provide criteria to identify classes of
practical problems that satisfy these conditions, and design and justify
algorithms for solving these problems. They also apply knowledge gained in this
work to other areas dealing with model input uncertainty, such as robust
programming and stochastic optimization.

The investigator studies a mathematical model called variational condition.
This is a general model that characterizes an equilibrium status. For example,
it can model an economic equilibrium that predicts commodity prices, sector
activities, and consumer consumptions, or a force equilibrium that describes the
geometry and dynamics of a mechanical structure, or a traffic flow equilibrium
in a transportation or computer network. Thus, this model provides a unified
framework for a very large number of equilibrium problems from areas including
economic policy studies, structural engineering, transportation, computer
networks, materials science, and other areas. It is also closely related to some
other important mathematical problems, such as optimization problems; it can be
regarded as a generalization of optimization problems. In this project, the
investigator and her colleagues seek to develop better insight into the
mathematical structure of this problem, and to exploit this insight to produce
better computational algorithms and the means for justifying them. They
investigate what the solutions of this problem look like, how they change
corresponding to changes in the model input, how to find a solution quickly and
robustly, and how to identify practical problems that are easy to solve and have
robust behavior. Success in the work helps to better understand, analyze and
solve the broad class of equilibrium problems.
