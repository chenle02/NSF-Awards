The biota of the world's seafloor is fueled by bursts of seasonal primary
production. For food-limited sediment communities to persist, a balance must
exist between metazoan consumption of and competition with bacteria, a balance
which likely changes through the seasons. Polar marine ecosystems are ideal
places to study such complex interactions due to stark seasonal shifts between
heterotrophic and autotrophic communities, and temperatures that may limit
microbial processing of organic matter. The research will test the following
hypotheses: 1) heterotrophic bacteria compete with macrofauna for food; 2) as
phytoplankton populations decline macrofauna increasingly consume microbial
biomass to sustain their populations; and 3) in the absence of seasonal
photosynthetic inputs, macrofaunal biodiversity will decrease unless supplied
with microbially derived nutrition. Observational and empirical studies will
test these hypotheses at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, where a high-abundance
macro-infaunal community is adapted to this boom-and-bust cycle of productivity.
The investigator will mentor undergraduates from a predominantly minority-
serving institution, in the fields of invertebrate taxonomy and biogeochemistry.
The general public and young scientists will be engaged through lectures at
local K-12 venues and launch of an interactive website. The results will better
inform scientists and managers about the effects of climate change on polar
ecosystems and the mechanisms of changing productivity patterns on global
biodiversity.
