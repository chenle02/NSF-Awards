This project is concerned with the application of category theory to the
semantics of programming languages. The principal investigator will examine
algebraic semantics in the category PER, order-enriched sketches, enriched
semantics, initial algebras and some computer related research. The research in
this project involves the application of category theory to problems in
theoretical computer science. Traditionally, category theory has dealt with the
foundations of algebra; namely, it has focused on sets with algebraic structure,
mappings between sets that preserve that structure, and even more abstract
functors that relate the collections of algebraic structures and their mappings.
In recent years, this research subject has enjoyed a rebirth in theoretical
computer science. In this project, the techniques of category theory will be
applied to study the semantics of programming languages, data types, and
categorical programming.
