9503544 Binder Maryville College is seeking support in connecting its campus to
INTERNet by installing a node on campus. The support would be in the form of
computer hardware, communications software, and communication services.
Maryville College currently has dial-in access to INTERNet through the
University of Tennessee in Knoxville for most of its faculty and staff, but this
service is quite limited, and it is not available to students. By connecting to
INTERNet via a node, Maryville College would be able to greatly improve and
expand its current computer services to its constituents, especially its
students. These connections will provide operations management and information
services and it will give the college a 56 thousand bits per second connection
to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The benefits of the NSFNET connection include e-mail between local and
remote researchers and educators, file transfer capability and the ability to
use remote computer resources. Also the college will have the ability to
investigate innovation in educational resources and incorporate them into their
curricula.
