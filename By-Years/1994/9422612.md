This project involves the dissertation research of a student of cultural
anthropology at Northwestern University. The student will examine how US and
Japanese companies in the midwestern US negotiate with each other. Using in-
depth exploratory interviews with 25 local expert representatives of US
companies, the student will establish a list of vital topics. These topics will
then be used to analyze 6-8 complete cases of contract formation. The goal is to
analyze the cultural context of the business negotiations to show how general
principles of contract law are redefined to fit local cultural and situational
concerns. This research is important because international trade is increasingly
vital to the economic health of US communities. Advances in our understanding of
how cultural factors influence bargaining can help US actors deal with foreign
counterparts
