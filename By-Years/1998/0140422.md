The investigator is carrying out a program in the theory of automorphic
representations. The program is to find different methods to produce automorphic
funtoriality and then relate such methods. The point of finding such connections
is to determine automorphic-type formulae( such as periods or theta integrals)
for special values of automorphic L functions. Specifically the techniques of
the regular trace formula (as well as the relative trace formula) and the use of
the converse theorem produce examples of such functorial lifting. The
investigator relates these techniques to theta correspondence and the descent
method. Such new techniques make it possible to determine the nonvanishing of
the new liftings in terms of special values. The motivation of the above work is
to have an analytic formalism to study the special values of certain automorphic
L functions. It turns out that some of the most famous problems in number theory
(such as Fermat' s last theorem and more generally the determination of integral
solutions to polynomial identities) have as a goal the concrete analysis of such
L functions as above. The information given by the investigator's approach may
be useful in the qualitative study of these L functions.
