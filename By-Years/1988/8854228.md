This project will provide partial support for a series of short courses on
topics of current interest to college and university science faculty. The course
presenters are scholars at the frontiers of their disciplines who meet
intensively for several days with faculty to communicate new knowledge,
concepts, and techniques which will enhance college instruction. The national
program will offer about 70 courses per year at locations in the various regions
of the country. Also, some courses will be offered at special discipline-related
sites. Included will be topics of interest to faculty in mathematics, the
natural and social sciences, and engineering. The program will be evaluated for
constant improvement of its service to faculty. It will update and enhance the
teaching of an average of some two thousand college and university faculty each
year. In addition to NSF support, participants and their institutions will
contribute about three times as much to the operation of the project.
