9502645 Truszczynski This award provides support for the acquisition of a high-
performance distributed cluster-based computing system consisting of a number of
high-performance multiprocessor workstations interconnected by a high-speed LAN.
These LAN-connected clusters will themselves be interconnected by a high-speed
ATM backbone network. The Computer Science department will thus build a
distributed multicomputer based on a scalable, distributed shared memory
paradigm which will facilitate the department s research efforts in distributed
and parallel computing, distributed multimedia, vision and scientific
computation, and distributed control for manufacturing.
