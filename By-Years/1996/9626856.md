9626856 Marker In studying the real numbers with exponentiation, van den Dries,
Macintyre and Marker gave an algebraic construction of a nonstandard model. This
model has proved useful in understanding the asymptotic behavior of functions.
Marker's work concentrates on the relationship between formally solving
differential equations in this model and the problem of finding actual solutions
at infinity. Marker will also work on problems in the model theory of
differential fields. This is a fascinating area, requiring a sophisticated
mixture of ideas from model theory, differential algebra and algebraic geometry.
(Through the work of Buium and Hrushovski, differential algebra has had
significant number theoretic applications.) Marker studies the geometry of
solutions to algebraic differential equations, concentrating on the use of model
theoretic dimensions to develop intersection theory. Model theory is a branch of
mathematical logic where one studies mathematical structures by looking at their
properties expressed in formal languages. For example, in the real numbers one
can say that every number is a cube, but one cannot say that every bounded set
has a least upper bound. Nonstandard models of the real numbers share all their
formal properties. Studying nonstandard models often leads to fresh insights
into the real numbers themselves. Recently, model theorists have been studying
the exponential function. These investigations have led to important new
insights into the geometry of solution sets of equations involving exponentials.
This work has already found applications in analysis, control theory and neural
networks. ***
