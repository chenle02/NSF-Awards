In order to better understand the physics of convection in the Earth's mantle,
the PI will study three-dimensional thermal convection in a fluid with a
strongly temperature dependent viscosity v(T). An important motivation of the
work is to better understand how the toroidal component of the Earth's plate
tectonic velocity field is generated. The work comprises three parts: (A) A
numerical (Galerkin method) investigation of steady square cell convection in an
infinite Prandtl number fluid with v(T) stress-free boundaries, together with a
detailed study of the stability of the resulting solutions. (B) A study of
poloidal-toroidal coupling in 3D high Rayleigh number convection, using the
single- and multi-mode mean field equations with a variety of rheological laws
and heating modes. (C) An experimental study of convection in a v(T) fluid with
a free surface, to measure the degree of poloidal-toroidal coupling as a
function of Rayleigh number and viscosity contrast.
