An optical device that can be made to switch either passively or actively like
an electronic transistor at optical frequencies can find important use in
numerous engineering systems, particularly communications and computing systems.
The purpose of this investigation is to further develop the understanding
through both experimental and theoretical research of optical power-dependent
phenomena in optical waveguides. These waveguides include dielectric waveguides,
semiconductor surfaces, and thin metal films. A primitive bistable device has
already been demonstrated. Both theoretical and experimental research involving
more elaborate systems will be performed. Several device configurations
involving controlled bistability, designing and testing nonlinear directional
couplers, and phase conjugation and four-wave mixers will be examined.
