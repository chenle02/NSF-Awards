This project enables the Biology faculty at Smith College to enhance its
laboratory teaching of Physiology and Neurobiology by acquiring new, state-of-
the-art instrumentation. The new equipment includes digital storage
oscilloscopes which can freeze transient data for examination by students and
discussion with their professors; dual channel chart recorders, controllable by
computers, to make hard copies of data for analysis; microcomputer-based data
acquisition systems (updating an innovative data system originally designed at
Smith) to give students in Neurobiology access to improved techniques for
studying the nervous system; and stimulators and amplifiers, for use in
physiological and neurobiological experiments. With this improved, modern
instrumentation, Smith College is continuing its tradition of preparing women
for careers in science. The project's Principal Investigator is being encouraged
to publish the novel elements of his undertaking so that other institutions may
benefit from them.
