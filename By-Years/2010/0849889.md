This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially
targeted for support and student scholars are enrolled in undergraduate or
graduate programs in computer science. The scholarship program builds on a
successful CSEMS program on campus and includes targeted, deliberate activities
aimed at building a community of scholars. The scholars are participating in
seminars, internships, service learning activities, and mentoring. Students are
working closely with faculty who assist them in the development of graduation
goals and a career plan. Career counseling sessions provided to the scholars
cover topics such as developing organization skills, time management, team-
building, improving communication skills, intercultural sensitivity, conflict
resolution and professional ethics. The results from the project are being
rigorously evaluated through a variety of measures.
