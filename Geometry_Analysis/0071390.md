Abstract

Award: DMS-0071390 Principal Investigator: Thomas E. Cecil

The principal investigator and his collaborators, Quo-Shin Chi and Gary Jensen,
will study submanifolds of Euclidean space and the sphere within the context of
Lie sphere geometry. Of particular interest are submanifolds with special
curvature properties. These include isoparametric hypersurfaces, which have
constant principal curvatures, and Dupin hypersurfaces, which have the property
that each principal curvature is constant along each of its corresponding
curvature surfaces. The main problems to be studied are the classification of
isoparametric hypersurfaces of the sphere with four principal curvatures, and
the classification of locally irreducible Dupin hypersurfaces with four or six
principal curvatures. This research is primarily local in nature, using the
method of moving frames in Lie sphere geometry.

This project focuses on an important class of surfaces, Dupin surfaces, which
have very special curvature properties. Examples of Dupin surfaces are planes,
spheres, circular cylinders and the cyclides of Dupin, which have been useful in
recent years in advanced computer-aided design. Dupin surfaces have higher
dimensional analogues which were first studied by the great French mathematician
Elie Cartan in the 1930's and which have been researched extensively by many
mathematicians over the past thirty years. The goal of the proposed research is
to classify these higher dimensional Dupin surfaces. Another important aspect of
the proposal is the principal investigator's mentoring work with undergraduate
students. Over the period of the grant, three undergraduate students will be
supported by the grant for a summer of directed independent study in an area
related to the principal investigator's own research. Each of these students
will then write an honors thesis based on this study. In the past ten years,
most of the students who have written honors theses under the principal
investigator's supervision have then pursued graduate study in mathematics. In
this way, the principal investigator's previous grants have played a significant
role in the education of some of the next generation of scientists.
