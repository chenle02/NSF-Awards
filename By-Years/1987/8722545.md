This conference in non-commutative ring theory concentrates on some special
classes of ring, including rings of differential operators, and will feature
principal speakers from England as well as the United States. Support for
graduate students and young investigators is available. Ring theory is a core
area of algebra with connections to all areas of mathematics. The topics of the
conference stress those areas with strong connections to analysis, topology,
linear algebra, and combinatorial group theory.
