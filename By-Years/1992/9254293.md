This is a joint project of the New Jersey Institute of Technology as lead
institution for the North/Central New Jersey and Camden County College as lead
institution for the Southern New Jersey CIM Consortia. The consortia operate
fully articulated programs aimed at the AAS and BSET degrees in Manufacturing
Engineering Technology. The consortia consists of 13 community colleges and NJIT
in the North/Central; Camden County College, 5 other community colleges and NJIT
in the Southern. Articulated curricula of the two consortia include a two course
sequence in Manufacturing Systems. This sequence is critical to the success of
the program. Significant deviations in course content and emphasis among the
member colleges have been noted. This project will solicit input from the
manufacturing industry on required skills which should be attained through the
first course of the two-course sequence. During a summer Curriculum Development
Institute, selected faculty members will develop model curricula and training
modules. The project will also identify possibilities for sharing of laboratory
resources in support of the model.
