0226153&lt;br/&gt;Mousseau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explosion and subsequent
nuclear fire ar the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986 led to one of the largest
scale human-induced ecological disasters ever. Vast amounts of highly
radioactive materials, estimated to be in the range of 50-200 million curies,
were spread widely across the Eastern European landscape, and the northern lands
of Ukraine will remain contaminated for tens of thousands of years to come.The
regions surrounding the power plant were heavily contaminated by radioactive
fallout. A considerable increase has been reported in thyroid cancer, childhood
leukemia, chromosomal aberrations, and the frequency of congenital malformations
and microsatellite instability in human populations around Chernobyl and
Belarus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with scientists at the French
Centre National de Researche Scientifique (CNRS), The University of Extramadura
in Badajoz, Spain, and the National Museum of Natural History in Kiev, Ukraine,
we will investigate the effect of radioactive contaminants on a common bird
species of Europe, the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica. We will compare
morphological asymmetry, immunological assays, visible mutations (e.g.,
albinism), and mutations in microsatellite DNA and in the p53 genes (a gene
often associated with cancers in human), as well as measure rates of offspring
survival to fledging, in swallows living in the fallout area vs. in swallows
living in uncontaminated areas. Because barn swallows most often occur in
association with human habitation, this species is accessible for scientific
study and can also serve as a model for studying the potential long-term effects
of radioactive contamination on wildlife and human populations. &lt;br/&gt;
