Virtually every human endeavor in a broad variety of disciplines in science,
engineering, and finance, is encountering the need to make new discoveries
through the analysis of massive datasets. Yet, the task of creating the
necessary scalable analysis tools for modern high-performance parallel hardware
is a daunting task, due to the complexity of developing efficient algorithms and
subsequently having to parallelize and tune these algorithms for real systems.
This research project aims to address this problem by developing a new domain-
specific programming model, called the Tree-based High-Order Reduce (THOR)
model, that enables rapid automatic implementation of customized parallel data
analysis and mining tasks with minimal coding effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
key enabling insight behind THOR is the generalized n-body problem (GNP) theory,
a mathematical formalism that unifies the expression of seemingly disparate
statistical data analysis tasks, including n-point correlation, hierarchical
clustering, k-nearest neighbors classification, and kernel density estimation,
among numerous others. As its name suggests, a GNP elegantly generalizes the
classical n-body problem from physics to a much broader class of problems. Most
importantly, the GNP form permits the development of asymptotically fast
solutions, e.g., generalized versions of the fast multipole method. The THOR
model enables the data analyst to specify a GNP, from which the THOR program
generator can automatically produce a highly tuned parallel implementation. In
short, this project aims to show how a programming model, which is bound to an
appropriately high-level mathematical formalism while having the simplicity of a
model like MapReduce, can lead to both scalable data analysis algorithms and
their efficient implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
