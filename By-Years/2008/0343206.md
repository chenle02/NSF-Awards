Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has been awarded a grant to develop predictive
models for protein structures. Proteins are chains of amino acids that fold into
complex forms (in three dimensions) in order to function. Bystroff and
colleagues have written a program called SCALI (for Structural Core ALIgnment)
that aligns proteins that share a certain part of their folding arrangement
(regardless of their sequential ordering) and then clusters these alignments to
find the recurrent themes. The results show that all protein folds can be
described as a small set of folding arrangements, or cores, and that each core
has characteristic patterns of amino acid preferences. To model these, the
alignments are converted to a set of hidden Markov models (HMM). In this project
new algorithms will be developed to deal with the specific problems associated
with "self-avoiding" HMMs. A heuristic method will be used to find the most
probable path (according to the models), while an exact solution is proposed for
the sum over all self-avoiding paths. The exact solution has many potential
applications for other methods using HMMs.
