This project is a three-week summer school that looks at the interactions
between atmospheric and oceanic sciences on the one hand and modern applied
mathematics on the other. It is built around the three themes of numerics,
stochastics and asymptotics. The numerics component emphasizes the development
of modern conservative advection schemes and interface tracking schemes for
geophysical transport problems. The asymptotics component emphasizes the
dynamics of balanced flows, reduced models and homogenization. The stochastics
component covers a variety of topics including particle models, stochastic
calculus, kinetic theory and applications to Lagrangian stirring and moist
convection. Approximately 15 faculty provide lectures and mentor the students as
they conduct short projects to apply the lecture material. The student body
consists of 20 or more graduate students and approximately 12 post-doctoral
researchers. Faculty and students are drawn from both the geosciences and the
mathematics communities.
