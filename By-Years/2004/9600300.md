9600300 Normark The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Benjamin Normark to work with Dr. Roger L. Blackman at the Natural History
Museum in London, England. Dr. Normark and Dr. Blackman will conduct a program
of research into the molecular and genomic evolution of obligately
parthenogenetica aphids, focusing on the tribe Tramini. This work will build on
Dr. Normark's ongoing research into the molecular evolution of the aphid tribe
Tramini and on Dr. Blackman's ongoing cytogenetic research into Tramini and
other aphids. A central goal will be to synthesize molecular-biological and
cytogenetic techniques to progress towards an integrated view of the evolution
of aphid genomes in the absence of sexuality. They will focus on the Trama
troglodytes complex and on the tribe Tramini of which it is part. ***
