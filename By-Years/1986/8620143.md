Narrative: The principal investigator has observed in his laboratory a novel
phenomenon called "electrokinetic lift": a normal force produced by a streaming
potential generated by the sliding of two charged surfaces separated by a thin
gap of electrolyte solution. He proposes to analyze and model electrokinetic
lift of colloidal particles for three-dimensional flows for both thick and thin
double layers. The results of this research are important to processes such as
lubrication, hydrodynamic chromatography, filtration, and particle detachment
and deposition. Changes in the sphere-wall separation distance, which are an
indication of lift, will be measured using a new technique called total-
internal-reflection microscopy (TIRM). It is also proposed to develop TIRM for
the purposes of this research.
