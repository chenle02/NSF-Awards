The expected service demands in wireless information networks in the near
future exceed the current capabilities of these systems. Efficient allocation of
the limited spectrum will be a critical factor in the design of the next
generation of wireless networks in order to meet the future demands. We study
two issues related to the resource allocation problem in wireless communication
networks. These are the sharing of the locally common, spatially reusable radio
channel and the effect of the rapidly changing topology. Regarding the first
issue, we propose a queuing model that captures the channel allocation problem
in radio networks. The major research goal is to characterize the system
performance and to develop scheduling algorithms for sharing the resource
efficiently. The throughput of the system and the average packet delay are the
two performance measures of interest. In our previous research we characterized
the throughput properties of the above model and we gave maximum throughput
scheduling algorithms. Regarding delay, we obtained the optimal scheduling
policy in a network with tandem topology. We wish to extend the above results
with special emphasis on scheduling policies that are implementable in the
distributed environment of a radio network. A stochastic model of time-varying
topology is also proposed here. The understanding of the effect of the time-
variability on the stability and throughput of the system as well as the
development of transmission control algorithms that effectively take into
account the topology information are the major research goals regarding changing
connectivity. Preliminary results have already been obtained for a single-hop
network.
