The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable accurate and efficient diagnosis of
unruptured brain aneurysms. More specifically, it will make it easier for
neuroradiologists to diagnose and analyze medical images for patients with
unruptured brain aneurysms, as up to 40% are fatal. Unfortunately, complete
review of relevant images can take up to 30 minutes. The software will identify
regions of interest in images prior to manual review. enabling accelerated
diagnosis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will develop an end-to-end medical image processing software to
empower neuroradiologists to better diagnose unruptured brain aneurysms. This
project will undertake deep learning using a convolutional neural network to
diagnose, monitor, and provide clinical decision support for intracranial
aneurysms from MRI or CT scans. This approach will improve noninvasive diagnosis
for significant neurological conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
