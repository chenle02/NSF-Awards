Abstract

A detailed mathematical study will be undertaken of so-called "Sigma-Delta"
conversion schemes, which use simple and easily implementable algorithms to
represent bandlimited functions by one-bit sequences; convolving such a one-bit
sequence with an appropriately chosen filter leads to an approximation of the
original bandlimited function. Different schemes, corresponding to different
approximation orders, will be studied in detail; we expect the mathematical
insights gained will lead to new variants that have better mathematical
properties, and to generalizations to other settings than the approximation of
bandlimited functions.

Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, present in a wide range of
applications, some familiar to all of us (e.g., CD players), others more
confined to the field of scientific instrumentation, makes use of schemes that
start by taking highly redundant information, and then replacing it by one-bit
or few-bit sequences, from which the original information can be reconstituted
with good precision. Because of the physical constraints in these conversions,
the schemes used in practice have very interesting mathematical properties,
quite different from the standard representation of numbers by a decimal or
binary notation. It is proposed to study these properties in more detail, with
the goal of proposing variants on the schemes, and to identify a wider range of
applications for these conversion schemes.
