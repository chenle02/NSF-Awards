0308749&lt;br/&gt;Ferry-Graham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Chile award will
support Dr. Lara A. Ferry-Graham, San Jose State University, for a planning
visit to complete a proposal for a research collaboration with Dr. Julio Vasquez
at the Universidad Catolica del Norte in Coquimbo, Chile. The researchers are
working to determine the functional morphological mechanisms that facilitate
invasions by marine fishes into the temperate regime. Teleost fishes survive in
a variety of diverse habitats and the feeding mechanism is thought to be largely
responsible for that success. Comparing temperate species with their tropical
counterparts in both Chile and California will provide a unique opportunity to
have replicate data points on the appropriate global scale. Chile offers the
only reasonable replicate of the California habitat for determining generalities
regarding temperate invasions and the mechanisms that might facilitate them.
Invasion biology is an important area of research for community ecologists
because invaders can have dramatic impact on ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;
