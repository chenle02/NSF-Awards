Our research is centered on the study of the properties of
subatomic&lt;br/&gt;particles called muons. Muons are easily produced at
particle&lt;br/&gt;accelerators, and they are a major component of cosmic rays
at the&lt;br/&gt;surface of the earth. According to all experimental evidence
they are&lt;br/&gt;the same as electrons except that they are 200 times heavier,
and they&lt;br/&gt;are radioactive. It is a great mystery why muons exist at
all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the electron, the muon can be thought of as a
sphere which spins on&lt;br/&gt;its axis. It is also a magnet, with the north
pole pointing along the&lt;br/&gt;spin axis. For a number of years, we have been
doing an experiment to&lt;br/&gt;measure the strength of this magnet to very
high precision. The value&lt;br/&gt;of this quantity is very sensitive to the
spectrum of particles; if&lt;br/&gt;there are new, as yet unseen particles, then
the value will be altered&lt;br/&gt;from theoretical expectations. We have seen
a deviation from the&lt;br/&gt;expected value which is interesting but not yet
big enough to be&lt;br/&gt;convincing evidence of new physics. We are proposing
further&lt;br/&gt;measurements to sharpen the comparison between theory and
experiment. &lt;br/&gt;At the same time, we are mounting major experiments to
investigate other&lt;br/&gt;parameters of the muon: its lifetime, its electric
dipole moment, and&lt;br/&gt;the probablility that it will decay directly into
an electron without&lt;br/&gt;the usual accompanying neutrino. The last process
has never been&lt;br/&gt;observed, and is expected to be very rare. The lifetime
experiment is&lt;br/&gt;well under way, while the other two experiments are in
development.&lt;br/&gt;
