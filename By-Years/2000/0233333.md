This design proposal for technical assistance has three focus areas aimed at
helping technical assistance providers: 1) identify bodies of research and best
practices and translate these findings to the specific needs of the MSPs; 2)
work with MSP leaders to use existing and newly collected data about the MSPs to
inform their decisions; and 3) help create and sustain a national capacity and
supportive community for the MSPs.
