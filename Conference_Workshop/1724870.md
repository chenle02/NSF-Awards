This award supports participation in three annual meetings of the Northeast
Probability Seminar, to be held in New York City in November of 2017, 2018, and
2019. Columbia University will host the 2017 seminar, New York University will
host the 2018 conference, and the City University of New York will host the 2019
conference. The regional conference series features talks by both well-
established and promising probabilists and provides opportunities for
participants to learn about recent developments in probability research and to
exchange ideas about ongoing research. The meetings are especially valuable for
junior researchers to become acquainted with other researchers in the area.

The first of these meetings will be held at Columbia University, November 20-21,
2017. The meeting will have invited featured talks by leading researchers in the
mornings. The afternoons will be set aside for informal sessions to discuss open
problems and to provide opportunities for junior researchers to present their
research. Additional details are available at the conference web site:
