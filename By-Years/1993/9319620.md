January 10, 19949319620 Bhattacharya Description: This project provides partial
support for a U.S. mathematician to engage in collaborative research with
colleagues at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta and in New Delhi. In
Calcutta he will interact with Dr. B.V. Rao on iterations of i.i.d. maps
belonging to certain special classes such as the quadratic family. In Delhi he
will interact with Dr. R.L. Karandikar on problems in Markov processes,
especially stochastic differential equations and diffusions. During his
sabbatical, Dr. Bhattacharya will also briefly visit institutes in Germany and
Japan. ***
