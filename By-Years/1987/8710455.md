This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of surface
spectroscopy. During the two year period beginning 1 July 1987, Professor Friend
will develop new research capability in near edge X-ray absorption fine
structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy with which she will study the adsorption
structure of reactant molecules on clean and modified tungsten and molybdenum
surfaces. This activity will complement chemical investigations already underway
in her laboratory that are supported by the Foundation through a Presidential
Young Investigator Award. The NEXAFS studies will utilize the synchrotron
facility at Stanford University and will involve the collaborative cooperation
of Dr. Joachim Storr of IBM-San Jose who is a world authority in this area. This
work is expected to lead to an enhanced molecular-level understanding of the
reactivity of heterohydrocarbons on the surfaces of industrially important
molybdenum and tungsten catalyst surfaces.
