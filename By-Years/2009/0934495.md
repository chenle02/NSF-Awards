La Salle University is developing the specific components of an NSF Teaching
Fellowships and Master Teaching Fellowships (TF/MTF) initiative focusing on two
distinct target populations throughout Eastern and Southeastern Pennsylvania:
STEM professionals who are enrolling in a master's degree program leading to
teacher certification, and science, technology and mathematics teachers
preparing to become Master Teachers. Specific components being developed during
the planning phase include: (1) Partnerships with institutions of higher
education, school districts, non-profit organizations, and private industry, (2)
Commitments to provide matching funds, (3) Curricular requirements, course
syllabi and professional development activities, (4) Processes for recruiting
and selecting program participants, and (5) Methodology and criteria for
evaluating TF and MTF program components, participants' performance, and the
impact of the TF and MTF participants on their students, schools, and school
districts. La Salle's TF/MTF initiative emphasizes pedagogical expertise,
content/disciplinary knowledge, curriculum development, mentoring, inquiry-based
methods, assessment of student outcomes, and practitioner-oriented professional
development to complement course work in order to produce high caliber expert
teachers and Master Teachers with a sense of mission.
