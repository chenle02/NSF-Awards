This award provides funds to support advancement of NSF's Regional Class
Research Vessel (RCRV) to the Construction Stage with Oregon State University as
the Lead Institution for a three-ship construction effort.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science tool kit has evolved dramatically since the
last Regional Class ships were delivered in the early 1980's. The
interdisciplinary oceanography community now routinely employs a wide range of
sophisticated instrumentation (acoustics, optical sensors, video, high speed
data links, specialized nets and corers) deployed in a variety of ways (ship-
mounted, lowering on ropes and cables, Remotely Operated Vehicle and Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles) and geared toward multiple scales of interest. The new
class of RCRVs will include state-of-the-art design features and equipment for
enhanced investigation of the present and emerging coastal science themes. These
capabilities are simply not available on the older Regional vessels due to their
age and physical configuration. Along with the R/V Sikuliaq, the RCRV project
represents NSF's inter-agency commitment to Academic Fleet modernization.
