Kreidl will observe A-type (Ap) stars to search for stars with rapid
oscillations (periods of a few minutes). An accurate measure of the period is
possible, permitting very detailed checks on theoretical models. Kreidl will
also measure stellar variability on time scales of hours, to determine the
nature of sporadic variations and to relate any regular variations to other
(delta Scuti) variable stars with similar colors and luminosities. Many stars
pulsate, growing and shrinking regularly. The pulsations have taught us much
about the interior of those stars. A new kind of stellar oscillations has now
been observed, involving horizontal as well as radial motions. Observed solar
oscillations already provide qualitatively new information on the solar
interior. Kreidl will investigate one group of oscillating stars, performing the
first search in the northern hemisphere and measuring oscillation periods more
accurately than is possible on the Sun. The telescopes of the Lowell Observatory
allow the extended observing times needed to measure oscillations and other
forms of stellar variability.
