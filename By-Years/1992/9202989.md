This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Richard Ernst of the University of
Utah in a research collaboration with Professor M. Angeles Paz-Sandoval of the
Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del I.P.N. (CINVESTAV) in Mexico
City. The purpose of the research is to study the incorporation of oxygen and
nitrogen containing pentadienyl ligands into transition metal complexes. This
award will allow the expansion of a current domestic effort studying general
pentadienyl ligands to the very promising oxygen and nitrogen containing
analogues. The Mexican side will focus primarily on the preparation of the new
ligands, and incorporation of these into metal complexes, while in Utah
additional efforts will be made to incorporate these ligands into other metal
complexes, to study potentially useful reaction chemistry, and to study the
natures of these compounds by a variety of physical methods, including single
crystal x-ray diffraction. As metal pentadienyl compounds have already proven
very useful in metal film depositions and reaction chemistry, it is expected
that similar practical applications will develop from the oxygen and nitrogen
containing analogues.
