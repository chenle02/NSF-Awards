An integrated photosynthesis system, which includes a self-contained infra-red
analyzing set-up, a lap-top computer, and a plant growth chamber, is being used
in the freshman course, General Biology, to demonstrate how the rate of
photosynthesis is easured prcisely. In the sophomore-level General Ecology
course it is used to conduct a primary productivity study in an ecosystem on
campus, and in the junior and senior level Plant Structure and Function course
it is used by students to measure accurately and precisely rates of
photosynthesis and respiration under different conditions. Each Plant Structure
and Function student is required to design and conduct an experiment in which
the system is used to measure photosynthesis. The university will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
