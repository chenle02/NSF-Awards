9504021 Miller Oregon State University will undertake an ocean sciences
instrumentation development project to develop and test a new high-capacity,
hoseless zooplankton collecting pump system for use at sea. The pumping system
(to be named MEGAPUMP) is designed to address several shortcomings with existing
pumping systems. The unit will consist of an underwater pump mounted on a
carousel collection unit. The pump will be front mounted with a short manifold
that serves 10 rotating filter collection tubes. A stepping motor will be used
to "select" the next filter by remote actuation. The overall configuration will
be mounted in a steel cage to prevent mechanical damage during deployment. Power
supply to the MEGA will be via the suspension cable. Environmental sensors to be
attached to the pump include a magnetic flow meter and a CTD for measuring
conductivity, temperature and depth. The MEGA will facilitate zooplankton
sampling with greater spatial resolution and depth capacity than previous
systems. The samples obtained using this system will allow for a greater
understanding of microstructure aggregation of zooplankton through high
resolution sampling. This new capability will be important for current and
future investigations involving oceanic zooplankton.
