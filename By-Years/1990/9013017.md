The essential objective of this proposed project is to develop a method for the
multiobjective optimization on nondeterministic structural systems under
serviceability, ultimate and residual reliability requirements imposed
simultaneously. State-of-the-art optimization and structural reliability methods
will be used in this research. Efficient and effective techniques of combining
multiobjective mathematical programming with system reliability requirements
will be developed and a decision support space will be proposed. Procedures for
risk-based making in a multiobjective framework will also be developed.
