9616654 A request has been made for $3,000 to help offset the costs of page
charges for a special issue of the IEEE Journal to be devoted to high pressure
arcs and high frequency thermal plasmas and to appear in April 1997. In
particular this funding will help defray the publication costs for those
potential contributors from the former Soviet Union (FSU) and in East European
countries who are unable to come up with these page charges. It is anticipated
that papers from these leading scientists will make an important contribution to
our knowledge and technological base in this field and will facilitate
cooperation between scientists of the FSU and East European countries with
scientists in the USA.
