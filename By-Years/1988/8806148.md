In order to test many evolutionary hypotheses, it is necessary to have a good
understanding of the phylogenetic history of the group being studied. Powell and
colleagues have been exploring the use of modern molecular technology to
determine genetic relatedness; in particular they have measured DNA differences
among species. If one makes the assumption that species become more genetically
dissimilar the longer they have been separated in evolutionary time, then these
genetic distances reflect history and thus allow the construction of
phylogenetic relationships. The group of organisms studied is the common "fruit
fly" or, more properly, Drosophila. These flies have a long history in genetic
and evolutionary studies and are beginning to play a large role in more modern
studies in molecular evolution and development. The major project support by
this renewal is an exploration of a new strategy to determine degree of genetic
differences among species. Previous work has shown that Drosophila are extremely
fast evolving with respect to changes in DNA. Even morphologically
indistinguishable species may have very different DNA. Because of this rapid
rate of evolution on the molecular (as opposed to morphological) level, it
becomes difficult to compare distantly related species. This is because they may
be so different one cannot distinguish homologous sequences; homologous
sequences are those that are similar due to having a common origin. There is a
part of the genome, however, which is relatively slowly evolving which may be
more useful in comparing species. This is the portion of the genome which codes
for proteins; it represents only a small part of the total genome, probably less
than 10%. Powell and colleagues will isolate the protein coding region of the
Drosophila genome and compare it among species. This will not only allow them to
determine relationships among species, but also allow to compare how
functionally different parts of a genome are evolving.
