This award supports participation in the 2015 Houston Summer School on Dynamical
Systems, taking place May 20-28, 2015 at the University of Houston. This event
introduces graduate students to recent progress and novel techniques in
probabilistic dynamics and ergodic theory, as well as giving a bird's-eye view
of fundamental areas of dynamics. The school also covers applications to other
areas where these ideas are useful, such as mathematical neuroscience,
statistical mechanics, and information theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of
the school consists of four lecture series covering topics in uniform
hyperbolicity; partial hyperbolicity; parabolic dynamics and renormalization;
and decay of correlations via spectral gap, coupling, and cones. These lectures
will be given by internationally recognized researchers in dynamical systems:
Boris Hasselblatt (Tufts University); Keith Burns (Northwestern University);
Jayadev Athreya (UIUC); Vaughn Climenhaga (Houston); Matt Nicol (Houston); Will
Ott (Houston); Andrew Torok (Houston). The school also includes further lectures
on advanced topics and applications, informal review sessions, problem sessions,
and project sessions, with particular emphasis on maximizing interactions
between students and lecturers and allowing plenty of opportunity for
discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer school web site:
