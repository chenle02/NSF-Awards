This research will examine marsh secondary succession and the role of clonal
integration of marsh plant populations in dictating marsh plant disturbance
dynamics. Specifically, the following will be done: 1) Examine the generation
and causes of variation in the edaphic conditions of marsh bare patches, 2)
Explicitly test the hypothesis that the occurrence of interspecific competitive
and facilitative interactions during secondary succession is dependent on local
edaphic conditions, and 3) Evaluate the role of inter- and intraspecific
variation in the morphology, clonal integration, and salt tolerance of marsh
perrenials in resisting and responding to disturbance events. In addition to
elucidating the dynamics of a widespread native plant community, this research
will contribute to understanding a number of previously unexplored aspects of
the organization of assemblages dominated by clonal organisms, and provide a
rare experimental study of the relative importance of competitive and
facilitative interactions in plant community process and pattern.
