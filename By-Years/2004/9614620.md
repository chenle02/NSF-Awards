9614620 Samson A major problem in plate tectonics is defining the positions of
continental blocks in the past, but these plate reconstructions become
increasingly different with increase in age, until the Precambrian, where the
large uncertainties lead to major controversies. Part of the problem stems from
the lack of knowledge of the even identity of individual crustal blocks. The
project involved the systematic geochemical analysis of Precambrian rocks in
northern France to determine their relationship to other crustal blocks in the
circum Atlantic region. The chemical compositional, isotopic, and age
information to be collected will be used to test several possible correlations
of the rocks which will in turn lead to a better understand of Precambrian
tectonics.
