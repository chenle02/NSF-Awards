9723058 Sheridan Somatostatins are a relatively diverse family of peptide
hormones known to affect a wide array of biological processes, including growth,
development, and metabolism. Despite the significance of the group of hormones,
little is known about their evolution or about the mechanisms which control the
genes that encode them. With this project, the PI will use a simple model
system, rainbow trout, to examine fundamental aspects of somatostatin gene
expression. He will provide for the first time a definitive analysis of the
polygenic origin of somatostatins. He will characterize the expression of
alternate forms of somatostatins and investigate how somatostatin gene
expression is controlled by various environmental and endogenous (i.e., other
hormones such as insulin) factors. While this research pertains specifically to
fish, it will provide important new insight into the evolution of the
somatostatin gene family and yield novel information with board relevance to the
understanding of somatostatin-mediated control of growth, development, and
metabolism.
