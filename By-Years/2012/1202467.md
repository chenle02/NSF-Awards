The NCLSAMP project proposes to utilize "promising practices" as well as new
program initiatives to achieve the following goals: 1) Increase the pool of
competent underrepresented graduates with STEM bachelor's degrees; 2) Promote
retention and baccalaureate degree attainment in STEM academic programs, and; 3)
Increase the number of students who matriculate into STEM graduate
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase V (Senior-level) NCLSAMP expected outcomes
at the end of the project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. An overall average of seventy-five
percent (75%) of NCLSAMP participants will be retained in STEM baccalaureate
programs within the Alliance. &lt;br/&gt;2. The pool of competent
underrepresented graduates with STEM bachelor's degrees will have increased by
10%. &lt;br/&gt;3. The number of NCLSAMP participants who matriculate into STEM
graduate programs will have increased by 10%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building
upon its successes in the implementation of cohort-based learning, collaborative
instructional approaches and block-scheduling, the Alliance will help its
members institutionalize and maintain high impact practices engaging a larger
population of underrepresented students into STEM-learning communities. Best
practices that will continue and expand based on Phase I experience include
Facilitated Study Groups, Research Skills Development Workshops, and Mentored
Research Experiences for Undergraduates.
