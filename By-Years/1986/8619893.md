This project is centered around the creation of a parallel software laboratory,
called PARASOL. This facility is intended to support a variety of projects
investigating both the fundamental nature of parallel computing and its
application to problems of importance in software engineering and in scientific
computing. The award will aid in the establishment of this software laboratory
through provision of support for a tightly-coupled multiprocessor and a number
of workstations along with support for maintenance costs, support staff and
related costs. The research builds on work conducted under a previous
Coordinated Experimental Research (CER) grant and will extend the earlier
contributions, as well as providing for expansion in new directions. Significant
results are expected in the very important areas of (1) the fundamental nature
of parallel computing and (2) applications of parallel computing to problems in
scientific computing and software engineering.
