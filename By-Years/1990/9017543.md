Recent investigations have shown that Fe may limit phytoplankton growth in
oceanic regions, and thus may be a key factor linking marine biological
production to climate. Quantitative analysis of this iron hypothesis requires
assessing the Fe-demand in oceanic phytoplankton. The iron demand of oceanic
phytoplankton can be estimated only if the Fe-nutritional requirement of the
population is known a priori. Dr. Welschmeyer will relate an organism's Fe-
compositional ratio with its Fe-nutritional status. The results will shed
additional light on the factors controlling primary productivity in the ocean.
