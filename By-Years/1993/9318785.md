9318785 Timbie Funding is provided for the development of a new type of
millimeter-wave detector, the hot-electron microbolometer. The device, based
upon the temperature dependence of the I-V characteristic of a superconducting
tunnel junction, was first demonstrated by a group at the Boulder laboratory of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The same group will
fabricate the devices for this project. Receivers to be used in the measurement
of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy will be constructed from the hot-
electron microbolometers developed under this project. ***
