The investigator proposes to conduct design-based research to examine teachers'
understanding and use of inquiry-based methods in science, children's emergent
conceptual understanding of science content, and strategies embedded in inquiry-
based activities to support metacognitive reading comprehension of fourth-grade
students.

In this research, a series of qualitative and quantitative studies will be
undertaken that examine the intersection of metacognitive comprehension
strategies and inquiry-based methods in developing a technology-based system
designed for fourth grade elementary school science. Comprehension skills are
crucial to support elementary school students' learning of science content
particularly when employing inquiry-based methods and expository text. The
results are expected to improve understanding of reading comprehension strategy
supports in science activities.

This research will be closely integrated with several educational activities in
collaborative instructional design and elementary school science teaching. Two
graduate assistantships will be supported across the five years of the grant in
addition to tuition or stipend support for the participation of six teacher-
designers who will co-construct an inquiry-based strategy support system with
researchers. Research output from this effort will encompass multiple
publications, Web-based curriculum artifacts and videotaped examples of the
instructional approach disseminated on the Web for teacher review and comment.
