An important area of current astronomical research concerns the study of mass
loss of red giant stars as they evolve to white dwarfs through the "planetary
nebula" stage. It is now believed that this loss occurs as a wind of atomic
particles. The intensity of this wind increases over the course of several
thousand years until the envelope of the star is peeled off in a very fast wind
at a rapid rate. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue previous
studies of this phenomenon by using a determining the amount of mass lost in
this wind in a large sample of red giants from the strength of two carbon
monoxide emission lines in the nebular material surrounding them. The amounts of
mass loss will be correlated against known stellar parameters such as stellar
mass, luminosity, radius, and chemical composition to permit an empirical model
to be developed as to how mass is lost during this critical brief stage of
evolution.
