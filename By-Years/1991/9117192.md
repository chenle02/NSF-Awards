Professor Kivelson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Compuational
Chemistry Program to study motions of molecules in liquids, especially
supercooled liquids whose motions exhibit many anomalous properties.
Experimental dynamic light scattering measurements will be carried out together
with relevant computer molecular dynamics simulations, and the results will be
used, together with extant data, to develop theoretical models relating the
molecular motions to the structure of the liquids. Kivelson will devote a major
portion of his research effort to searching for a correlation length which
diverges with decreasing temperature for supercooled liquids in an effort to
confirm the existence of a second order (or higher) phase transition. In another
aspect of his research, Kivelson will study the high-frequency molecular motions
in liquids which are characterized by cage rattling and barrier crossing. %%%
Since most chemical reactions take place in solution, it is of fundamental
importance in the field of chemistry to have a molecular level understanding of
molecular motion and the interaction between solute and solvent. Kivelson's
research involves the use of light scattering experiments and computer
simulation to further our understanding of this detailed molecular picture.
