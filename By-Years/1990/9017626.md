This research will continue studies of pigment geochemistry to expand current
analyses to include phycobilins, and to develop and synthesize a suitable
pigment internal standard for HPLC pigment analysis. Over the past three years
photosynthetic pigments in suspended particulate matter and sediment trap
samples collected from the Black Sea, and as part of legs 2, 3, and 4 of the US
JOGOFS NASBE has been analyzed. The goal has been to determine the distribution
of algal pigments in the euphotic zone and deep ocean, and to study the
qualitative (transformation reactions) and quantitative aspects of the export
flux to the sediment-water interface. The present effort will bring this project
to a logical conclusion.
