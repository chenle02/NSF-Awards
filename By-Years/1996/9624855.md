This CAREER award provides support for the construction of a research and
education program in visual information processing. This field is inherently
interdisciplinary, and includes portions of computer science, electrical
engineering, applied mathematics, psychology, and neuroscience. Yet, educational
curricula often do not cross these disciplinary boundaries. One objective of
this award is the construction of an educational curriculum, starting next year
with the introduction of two innovative foundational courses. The first, an
undergraduate lecture course entitled "Foundations of Vision: Perception and
Computation" will cover a broad range of material in vision science, from
perceptual psychology, to single-cell physiology, to computational theories of
visual processing. The second, a graduate lecture/laboratory course entitled
"Fundamentals of Image Processing and Computer Vision", will cover basic tools,
both theoretical and applied, that are common to these two fields. The second
objective of this award is the study of a set of basic and applied research
issues in visual image processing. The research will be based on the family of
"steerable pyramid" image representations, and will include the use of this
representation in an adaptive context, rotation-invariant pattern matching,
noise removal and enhancement, representation of texture and orientation
content, and differential recovery of three-dimensional scene structure.
