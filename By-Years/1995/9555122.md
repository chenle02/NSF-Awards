Multimedia computer modules suitable for undergraduate chemistry lecture and
laboratory courses are being designed. The modules are both content and skills
oriented, interdisciplinary and multidimensional, and take full advantage of the
benefits of simulation, computation, and visualization. They are being designed
and created as tools for the teacher and for the student, and are primarily
directed at general chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic
chemistry, and materials science. Module topics will include the next version of
IR Tutor, and applicable and important spectroscopies and diagnostic devices
such as electronic absorption (UV-Vis) and electronic emission (fluorescence and
phosphorescence); proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); atomic
absorption (AA); thermal analysis; topics in polymer chemistry and materials
science; and PCR technology. Secondary objectives of the project include (1) a
broadening of the chemistry curriculum beyond traditional disciplinary
boundaries, (2) new undergraduate courses, (3) enhanced effectiveness of
teaching assistants, (4) an expanded role for post-doctoral students in
undergraduate education, and (5) improved performance by classes of students.
