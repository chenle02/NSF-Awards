Gravitation is the central problem in any attempt to unify the forces of
nature. A new approach to unification which offers great promise is called
superstring theory. Professor Deser's research will focus on the still
mysterious relation between spacetime with its gauge invariance and string
dynamics. In parallel, properties of gravitational theories, particularly in
higher dimensions, the role of the cosmological constant and the relation of
general relativity to other gauge theories will be pursued at both classical and
quantum levels.
