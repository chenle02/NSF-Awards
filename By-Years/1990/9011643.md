This award supports an Antarctic Geophysical Working Group. The Division of
Polar Programs has instituted a new geophysical effort aimed at achieving a
quantum step forward in understanding the structure and evolution of the
antarctic lithosphere. In parallel, the Scientific Committee for Antarctic
Research (SCAR) Group of Specialists is developing plans for a major geotraverse
across the Antarctic continent. U.S. scientists are heavily involved in this
SCAR initiative. The Antarctic Geophysical Working Group will provide a focus
for U.S. efforts in these areas and for participation in international research
aimed at understanding the relationship between Antarctic crustal evolution and
ice sheet history.
