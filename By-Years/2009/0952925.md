The PI requests funding to partially support two activities related to the
effects of noise. The first is The Second International Conference on the
Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life workshop which will take place in the city of
Cork, in the Republic of Ireland August 15-20, 2010. The second is a Working
Group on the Effects of Noise on Fish and Turtles. The Working is in the final
stages of completing a draft manuscript that lays out the data in the literature
and research recommendations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the conference is to draw together new
knowledge on the importance of underwater sound to animals and to the effects of
sounds upon them, whether those sounds occur naturally, are made by the animals
themselves, or result from human activities. The product of the Working Group
will provide the first consensus document, produced by the scientists who have
been doing much of the work on fish and turtle noise effects and fish and turtle
bioacoustics, on the value of the data collected to date, and on their
usefulness in setting criteria.&lt;br/&gt;
