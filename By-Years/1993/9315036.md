9315036 Crawford This award will support a graduate student to investigate the
feasibility of using naturally occurring neutrinos to map the density
distribution through the Earth's mantle and core. Theoretical investigations
show that it is possible to determine variations in density - and possibly
composition - as a function of depth by measuring the absorption of neutrinos
passing through the planet. By taking advantage of the initial deployment of the
DUMAND II detector array, the PIs and graduate student will be able to document
experimentally the practical utility of this method. The outcome of this project
could revolutionize our understanding of the geodynamical and geochemical
evolution of the Earth's deep interior. ****
