This research program originates from a broad interdisciplinary study, combining
mathematical and computational machineries to address a long-standing problem in
the field of computational science, i.e., to approximate the joint spectral
radius in an efficient way. Different from current approaches, in this project,
the PIs propose an innovative approach via matrix rank decomposition. The main
idea is to reduce the computational complexity through rank decomposition
methodology so that desirable precision can be achieved. The proposed work will
provide much needed common ground between theoretical study and computational
approximation of joint spectral radius, and the research findings would
effectively improve the existing approaches in literature, which in turn will
lead to a valuable impact on applied sciences, such as system design and control
in engineering and other related fields, as well as to better understandings of
some long-standing open problems in mathematics. This project will provide
mentorship and training for graduate and undergraduate students. Professional
development of the students will be enhanced through mentoring activities which
include broad training in mathematics and numerical analysis, guidance in oral
and written communication, advice on career development, and dissemination of
project results at national/international conferences.

The goal of this research project is to establish error bounds and to develop
efficient algorithms for the computation and approximation of joint spectral
radius by using lower rank matrix sets. The PIs will pay particular attention to
the singular value decomposition, although other types of decompositions will
also be explored, such as the rank decomposition from row echelon form obtained
from Gaussian elimination. By using the concept of symmetric gauge function and
its subdifferential, the joint spectral radius will be approximated through rank
decompositions and the error bounds will be estimated by using generic vector
norms. The proposed procedure for seeking a desirable gauge function is based on
the rank approximation, allowing the minimization of its value at each step.
Numerical algorithms will be established and are expected to provide effective
computational tools to be applied to engineering and related fields.
