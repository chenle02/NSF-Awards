9311906 Pitt This one year exploratory project is on research to determine the
effect of strong electric fields on the permeation of water and cryoprotectants
(CPAs) across cell membranes. Membrane permeabilities, as affected by
electroporation, will be determined for a model cell system and a single CPA
(glycerol) to explore the basic concepts and elucidate mechanisms. This project,
which is to provide preliminary data, will involve: (1) the assembly and testing
of equipment; (2) a study of the effect of electroporation conditions on cell
viability; and (3) experiments to quantify the penetration rate of glycerol into
cells at different electroporation conditions. The results of this research may
provide important information for the long - term storage of viable cells at
cryogenic temperatures. This has applications in biotechnology, agriculture and
medicine. ***
