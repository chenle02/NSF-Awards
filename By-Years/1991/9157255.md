The proposed research is directed toward a structural analysis of the protein-
protein interactions underlying gene regulation in prokaryotes. Genetic and
biochemical approaches will be employed to examine (i) the mechanism of
transcriptional activation by phage lambda repressor and the E. coli CAP protein
and (ii) the nature of interactions between regulator bound some distance from
one another along the DNA.
