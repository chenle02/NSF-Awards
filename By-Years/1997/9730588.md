9730588 Stephen This award will support the U.S. participation in a joint
seismic experiment with scientists from Germany. The objective of the project is
to acquire seismic reflection and refraction data from the Ninety-East Ridge in
the Indian Ocean. The U.S. scientific component will be responsible for
measurements to be recorded in a borehole to be drilled as part of the Ocean
Drilling Program. The seismic sources for this experiment will be deployed from
a German vessel which will rendezvous with the drillship, JOIDES Resolution, and
will be undertaking a regional study of the crustal structure of the ridge.
Specific scientific questions being addressed include crustal anisotropy and
heterogeneity, and the detailed velocity structure surrounding the drill site
which will be the location of a permanent seismic station to be installed by
French scientists. ***
