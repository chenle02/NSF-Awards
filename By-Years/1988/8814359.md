Project involves investigation of the equations of state and the anharmonicity
of the earth and applys it to such problems as the mineralogy of the upper
mantle and temperature gradients in layer D". Project studies include the
anisotropy of the core and constrained anisotropic inversion of surface wave
data, and low order harmonics of lateral heterogeneity.
