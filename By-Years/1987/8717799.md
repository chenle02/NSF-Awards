Statistical problems in simulation to be studied include modeling input
processes, analyzing output, reducing variance, and designing simulation
experiments. Statistical and computational problems involving simulation are
motivated by the need to calculate complicated statistical quantities. Most of
the problems center around integration, both high dimensional integration and
simultaneous integration of thousands of related integrals. The importance of
developing fast methods for integrating well behaved, accurately known,
functions is highlighted by observing that this is the main obstacle in the way
of the creation of a general Bayesian statistical analysis software package. In
this project, the simulation approach to numerical integration will be
investigated. A taxonomy of manufacturing system models will also be developed.
This is a multidiscipliary research project in statistical modeling and
stochastic simulation and their use in manufacturing systems design and
evaluation. The proposed research program is composed of three distinct, but
related, types of projects: statistical problems in simulation, statistical and
computational problems involving simulation, and evaluation of statistical and
simulation procedures for analyzing manufacturing models. The objective is to
develop and refine computational statistics and simulation methodology, with
particular emphasis on evaluation and comparison of methods in the context of
manufacturing systems. The significance of the research is the development of
mathematics and algorithms in computational statistics and stochastic simulation
that are relevant to practitioners of statistics and simulation, especially in
the manufacturing setting.
