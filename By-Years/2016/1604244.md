This award supports research in general relativity theory, and related problems
in mathematical astrophysics, in which strong gravitational fields play an
interesting role. The general scope of this research includes problems in
gravitational astrophysics in which insights from analytical, applied, and
computational mathematics can be used to help interpret gravitational waves
detections by Advanced LIGO. In particular, the projects supported here will
improve our understanding of neutron star collisions, providing insights into
the nuclear composition of such objects. They will also study the impact of
solving the Einstein equations, which govern the dynamics of black holes and
neutron stars, in spacetimes of different geometrical characteristics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects can be grouped in three specific
areas: neutron star physics, gravitational-wave data analysis, and numerical
relativity. These studies will allow observations of neutron stars and our
understanding of strong gravitational fields to be used to determine the
neutron-star equation of state in a way that is free from any assumptions about
the microphysics of neutron star matter. They will also help the gravitational
wave simulation community determine the accuracy of their waveform models that
play an essential role in detecting and interpreting astrophysical gravitational
wave signals. The studies in numerical relativity described here involve
developing techniques for solving Einstein's equations on manifolds with
arbitrary spatial topologies. These methods will be used to study a variety of
problems, including an effort to explore the gravitational analog of the
turbulent cascade seen in fluid systems, and exploring cosmological models
numerically to determine whether and how non-trivial topology could be
recognized through observations.
