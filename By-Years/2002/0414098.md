Inventory of Plants Dispersed by Bats in a Neotropical Forest
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott A. Mori and Tatyana A. Lobova
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bats play an important role in the dispersal of flowering
plants in tropical forests. They are especially critical in the colonization of
plants into forest gaps and man-made clearings. The goals of the proposed
project are to inventory plants dispersed by bats in the forests of French
Guiana; to create a tool for the identification of bat-dispersed plants based on
morphological, anatomical, and molecular data; and to address hypotheses about
bat/plant interactions. This project will be directed by Dr. Scott Mori, a
specialist in the Guianan flora, and will utilize the expertise of Dr. Tatyana
Lobova, a specialist in dispersal biology and plant morphology. To accomplish
the proposed goals, a Web-based bat/plant interaction database will be enhanced
and updated, a list with descriptions of the plants dispersed by bats in central
French Guiana will be published and, an illustrated atlas of the seeds dispersed
by bats will be created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the
first community-wide inventory of all plants potentially dispersed by bats in a
Neotropical rain forest and in the production of a guide for the identification
of bat-dispersed species. This information is essential for understanding rain
forest regeneration and conservation. The project will have a broad impact in
achieving a better understanding of plant/animal co-evolution and will point out
the important ecological and evolutionary roles that bats play in tropical
ecosystems. This study will promote the conservation of bats and the plants upon
which they depend.&lt;br/&gt;
