This collaborative research between Dr. Toshio Murashige, University of
California, Riverside, and Dr. Li-Chun Huang, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, concerns
the reappearance of traits such as rootability of stem cuttings, formation of
adventitious shoots, and development of somatic cell embryos in shoots from
mature trees which are grafted onto juvenile root stocks in vitro. The research
is intended to explore the causes of a phenomenon known as "rejuvenation" which
occurs when shoots from mature trees are grafted onto juvenile rootstocks and
then demonstrate certain traits which are normally found only in juvenile
plants. The project is supported by NSF and by the National Science Council of
Taiwan under the cooperative science program between the American Institute in
Taiwan and the Coordination Council for North American Affairs.
