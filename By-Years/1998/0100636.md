We propose an experimental and theoretical investigation of quantum interference
current control (QUIC) in a number of large- and small-gap semiconductors. The
investigations will include terahertz burst generation and detection using
ultrashort laser pulses. We request funds for two graduate students and faculty
summer salary. With prior NSF support, the basic theoretical concepts of the
proposed experiments have been worked out, a well equipped, state-of-the-au
ultrafast laser laboratory was set up, and preliminary experiments were
conducted. With support committed by UNTvI / NASA's PURSUE (Preparation for
University Research of Students in Undergraduate Education) program, one to two
undergraduate/minority students will be involved in this project.
