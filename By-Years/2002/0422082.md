Abstract Belinskiy

The objective of this project is to promote research and education in the field
of differential equations by providing for the participation of approximately 30
beginning researchers (advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. receipients)
in the Twenty.Fourth Southeastern.Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential
Equations. The 2004 Conference will be held at the University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga on October 22.23. This series of conferences has become a firmly
established tradition in the Southeastern.Atlantic differential equations
research community. The conference attracts some of the top experts in the field
who attend the conference each year.
