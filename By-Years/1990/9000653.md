Professor Jeffrey R. Appling and other members of the Chemistry Department of
the University of Kentucky are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend eight (8) weeks each summer actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. Projects range from determination of the
temperature dependence of the thermal motion of anthraquinone to the chemical
speciation of oxygen in fossil fuels using derivative activation analysis.
Students will be invited to return to Lexington the following spring to present
their results at the annual Regional Undergraduate Chemistry Research Poster
Competition sponsored by the University of Kentucky Graduate School.
