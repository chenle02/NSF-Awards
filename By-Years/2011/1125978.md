This award supports participation of doctoral students in the Doctoral
Consortium of the 25th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-11) to
be held on August 7-11, 2011 in San Francisco, CA. The Doctoral Consortium (DC)
will be held on August 7-8. This award supports travel stipends for 13 US
student participants and one-on-one mentoring lunches, a group dinner, and a
poster session for all participants. The Doctoral Consortium will extend over
two days and will include participant presentations, panel discussions, feedback
to the participants from mentors, informal discussions (over lunch and during
breaks), a group dinner for students and mentors, and a poster session. Each
participant will give a 20-minute presentation that will be followed by 20
minutes of discussion led by an assigned mentor to provide feedback on the
research and the presentation itself. To help the participants make the
transition from being students to embarking on a research career, there will be
a presentation on guidelines for developing a successful research program. In
addition, there will be panel discussions addressing issues such as research
strategies, job search, publishing, and establishing research funding.
