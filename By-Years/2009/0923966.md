(SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for crops with increased yield. Yield
is directly related to nitrogen (N) utilization and is dramatically affected by
climate. Plant Sensory Systems has developed a genetic modification to plants
that increases their N use efficiency (NUE) and tolerance to drought and high
temperatures. The modification is the insertion of a novel pathway for making
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in plants. Phase I research demonstrated that the
genetically modified model plants were more drought- and heat tolerant and had
higher yield in both N-limited and N-sufficient conditions compared to wildtype
plants. In Phase II the gene construct will be tested in a crop plant to
demonstrate commercial feasibility. Agronomic performance in N- and water-
limited and sufficient conditions will be determined in homozygote corn
lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the
stabilization of the agronomic sector of the economy and a reduction in adverse
effects of agriculture on the environment. The innovation would lead to crops
with higher yields that cost less to produce. The need for less N fertilizer
would reduce costs to the growers and have significant environmental savings by
reducing the amount of N that runs into the watershed. Moreover, a reduction in
fertilizer production and application would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The
innovation confers tolerance to climate changes, which would also reduce crop-
production costs and increase yield. The proposed technology has great
commercial potential in a market actively seeking increased NUE and value-added
traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
