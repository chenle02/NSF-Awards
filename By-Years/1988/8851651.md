The purpose of this project is to integrate Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
spectrometry into all levels of an undergraduate chemisty curriculum. Innovative
experiments have been designed to introduce beginning students to application of
computer-aided instrumentation and to support the study of basic chemical
principles and analytical techniques. Sophomores will use the FTIR in organic
chemistry and will be taught instrumentation operation so they can make
extensive use of the FTIR in upper-division courses and undergraduate research.
The laboratory portion of analytical, physical, and biochemistry courses will be
altered to introduce students to modern data collection techniques, on-line
spectral manipulation, kinetic studies, rotational spectroscopy, GC-IR, and
analysis of air pollutants. This ILI award, jointly supported by the Chemistry
Shared Instrumentation Program and the USEME Division of SEE, will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Northern Colorado to acquire FTIR
instrumentation that will be used to enhance undergraduate laboratory
instruction in this RUI Department.
