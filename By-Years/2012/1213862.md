In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program
of the Division of Chemistry, Professor W. Carl Lineberger of the University of
Colorado, together with his postdoctoral and graduate student researchers, will
study the transient structures and reactive processes involving reaction
intermediates and solvated anions. The experimental techniques include time-
resolved photodissociation and photoelectron imaging spectroscopy and negative-
ion photoelectron spectroscopy. Important classes of molecular systems that will
be investigated include three-member cyclic carbon-nitrogen radicals important
in combustion, the OO-OH radical important in determining the atmospheric
concentration of OH near the tropopause, and a variety of ion-neutral complexes
important in understanding proton transfer. A key component of all of the
proposed experiments is the extensive participation of theoretical collaborators
that brings state of the art theory, simulation, and experiment
together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the systems to be investigated have been
chosen for their fundamental science implications, they often have important
medium-term applications, in fields ranging from atmospheric chemistry to
combustion science to anionic polymerization. This project will also be a
vehicle for scientific workforce development by providing students and
postdoctoral researchers with a solid foundation across many areas of chemistry.
In addition, participants in this research program will make important
contributions to the extension of the Colorado Science Education Initiative
(SEI) to undergraduate physical chemistry classes at Colorado. Finally, both the
research and educational activities described in this proposal provide an
essential credibility for the principal investigator in his continuing
activities that involve advocacy of research and education for the physical
sciences.
