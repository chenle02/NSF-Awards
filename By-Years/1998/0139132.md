The Center for Earth and Environmental Science at Plattsburgh State University
(PSU) and the W. H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute will provide an eight-
week summer research experience for 12 highly motivated undergraduate students
interested in ecosystem research. The PSU summer research program will involve
an interdisciplinary investigation of ecosystem-level processes in the
sandstone-pavement jack pine barrens in northeastern New York. the physical
environment of the pine barrens strongly influences ecosystem processes such as
runoff, organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, and aquatic and
terrestrial habitats. This special ecosystem is a distinctive component of the
Champlain-Adirondack Biosphere Resserve and the REU studies will have
significance for organizations like the Adirondack Nautre conservancy and Nature
Conservancy Canada, which are developing management plans for these areas. The
sandstone pavement ecosystems have been a focus of undergraduate research at PSU
since 1972 and the REU program will build upon these ongoing efforts.

The principal objectives of the Plattsburgh REU program are to promote the
professional development of our undergraduate researchers and instill a better
appreciation for ecosystem complexity, function and value. The REU participants,
individually and in small groups, will work closely with the program's faculty
mentors on research projects ranging from surface and ground water hydrogeology,
forest biochemistry (nutrient cycling) and terrestrial plant, aquatic and
wetlands ecology.
