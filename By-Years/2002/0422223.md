This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
low cost process for producing high-pressure hydrogen. This process uses a
proven, regenerable, low cost CO2 sorbent to minimize capital costs and improve
efficiency. The key to the process is a sorbent that shifts the equilibrium of
the reforming and shift reactions that convert hydrocarbons to hydrogen. The
sorbent will be produced using commercial production equipment and tested to
determine its lifetime and performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the near term,
an improved hydrogen production process would significantly reduce the cost of
the hydrogen used in oil refineries to make reformulated (cleaner burning)
gasoline, and bulk chemicals such as fertilizers and chemical intermediates. In
the longer term, the new system can significantly reduce the cost of producing
hydrogen to distribution centers that will be needed for hydrogen fueled
vehicles and other fuel cell applications&lt;br/&gt;
