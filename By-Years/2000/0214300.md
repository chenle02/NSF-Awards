Minnesota- Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create nationally
representative datasets for the study of slavery and slaveholding in the mid-
nineteenth century United States. New samples will be added to the Integrated
Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), a census database spanning the period from
1850 through 2000. Using the 1850 Census of Slave Inhabitants, the project will
construct (1) a random sample of the slave population with all available slave
and holding characteristics, (2) a smaller sample of the slave population
obtained by linking slaveholders in the existing 1850 free sample to the slaves
they held in the Census of Slave Inhabitants, and (3) a new version of the IPUMS
1850 freed population sample that identifies slaveholders in the existing
dataset and includes a representative sample of slaves. These samples will
complement similar samples of the 1860 slave population currently being created
by the PIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large-scale nationally representative samples
of the population censuses have transformed our understanding of American
social, economic, and demographic history. The samples of the 1850 slave
population will provide the earliest representative body of individual-level
data on U.S. slaves and slaveholders. When used in conjunction with samples from
the 1860 slave schedules this project will allow the analysis of change over
time in the critical decade preceding the Civil War. Since 1850 and 1850 slave
schedules were the only national individual-level censuses of the slave
population, a sample of the 1850 slave census will provide a baseline for the
study of the African-American population.&lt;br/&gt;
