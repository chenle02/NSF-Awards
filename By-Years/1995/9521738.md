With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Gibson of Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University will develop the methodology of self
assembling rotaxane systems into supramolecular structures. This methodology
depends on the host-guest relationship between bipyridine salts and 32-crown-10
ethers. Once assembled, the structure will be stabilized with covalent bond
formation. A myriad of structural motifs is planned and incudes linear, branched
and ultimately dentritic type architecture. These types of systems hold promise
for new ventures in the areas of photo and electro devices, catalysis and mass
transport media. A new class of supramolecular structures is planned from the
self assembly of rotaxanes and crown ethers. Once assembled and fixed via
covalent bond formation, these types of structures can be explored for their
photo and electro device properties. Further, they are anticipated to have
catayltic properties and may be used as a mass transport media. + Ûª▓ ÑOh ª'
