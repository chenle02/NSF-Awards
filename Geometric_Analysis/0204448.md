The main subject of our proposal in the geometry and topology of group actions
on symplectic and contact manifolds. The underlying theme is that these
symmetries offer a very powerful tool for classifying or computing invariants of
such manifolds. More specifically, ideas that we will investigate include: the
cohomology of symplectic quotients by loop groups, the cohomology of contact
quotients, highly symmetric manifolds, the Gromov width of coadjoint orbits, the
topology of the group of symplectomorphisms, uniruled symplectic manifolds,
foundational work on group actions on contact manifolds, the relationship
between completely integrable systems and toric contact manifolds, and explicit
constructions of special metrics on contact manifolds.

The goal of the project is to further our understanding of two important types
of geometry --- symplectic and contact. Both geometries have their origins in
mechanics and optics and are currently of interest to physicists investigating
string theories.
