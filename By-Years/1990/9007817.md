This research is to use connectionist networks to provide high accuracy,
speaker- or accent-independent speech recognition. Recurrent connectionist
networks and meta-pi networks, an architecture that uses multiplicative gating
connections, provide the framework. Subnetworks provide speaker-specific models.
Automatic methods to learn and maintain large speaker sensitive nets will also
be studied. These networks will provide slower adaptation and will aid in
automatic initiation of new units or subnetworks as they are incorporated. The
techniques will allow for dialect and accent adaptation as well as speaker
identification.
