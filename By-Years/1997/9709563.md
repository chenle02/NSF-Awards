Abstract ATM-9709563 Hughen, Konrad, and Overpeck, Jonathan T. University of
Colorado, Boulder Radiocarbon, Ocean and Climate Change over the Last
Deglaciation Well-dated, high-resolution paleoclimate records offer the only
opportunity to observe the behavior of the integrated climate system during the
last deglacial, a period of abrupt change; but the use of such records is
hampered by the lack of a reliable 14C versus calendar-age calibration curve for
the period before 11,800 cal. yr. BP. This award supports a project designed to
provide a 3000-year extension of the atmospheric and marine radiocarbon
calibration curves back through the entire deglaciation. The project will create
an atmospheric radiocarbon calibration data set from the highest deposition-
rate, annually-laminated Cariaco Basin core PL07-58PC. This will extend through
the entire period of deglaciation with 14C sample resolution (one 14C date per
15-30 calendar years) comparable to that of the 11,800 cal. yr. BP tree-ring-
based calibration record. This will allow the correlation of 14C- and calendar
age-dated paleoclimate records around the world, as well as calculation of
accurate rates of change during abrupt events. This project will also create a
time series of the low- to high-latitude surface North Atlantic 14C gradient
between the tropical Atlantic Cariaco Basin and high-altitude Atlantic Troll 3.1
cores that will serve as a record of high-latitude 14C reservoir age variations
in this region and provide the marine radiocarbon calibration data set needed to
compare high-latitude North Atlantic paleoclimate records to their low-latitude
equivalents and to terrestrial records.
