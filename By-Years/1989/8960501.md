This is a SBIR Phase I project to develop a new tape of probe and associated
computing instrument for quickly measuring thermal properties of solid
materials. The combination to be employed is based on the miniature thin-film
heat flux sensor recently developed at Virginia Tech. The new probe will enable
the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of solid materials specimens to
be measured simply and rapidly. At the end of the probe will be a heat-flux
sensor and two thin-film thermocouple, applied to it by a masked sputtering
process. To measure the thermal properties of a material specimen, the probe and
specimen, initially at different temperatures, will be placed abruptly in close
thermal contact by mechanical registration device. The resulting flow of heat
and the rapidly changing surface temperatures of the specimen will be converted
to transient electrical signals. These will be measured an recorded as functions
of time. A method for computing thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity
from the electrical signals will be developed. The device to be developed will
have application in materials manufacturing quality control, in research
laboratories, and possibly in medical applications.
