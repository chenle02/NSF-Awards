This SGER proposal is requested to cover the cost of surveying coastal uplift
around the&lt;br/&gt;Pagai and Sipora islands related to the M8.4 and 7.9
earthquakes of September 2007.&lt;br/&gt;Significant uplift has occurred there,
rising porites heads well above the sea level (several&lt;br/&gt;tens of
centimeters typically and locally more than 1 meter). These heads are known
to&lt;br/&gt;grow close (within centimeters) to the sea level at the time of the
low tides and their&lt;br/&gt;emergence thus provides a measurement of co-
seismic uplift (with appropriate correction&lt;br/&gt;for tidal effects). This
data set will provide exceptional constraints, in addition to
the&lt;br/&gt;existing SUGAR GPS measurements, on the co-slip on the
megathrust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will shed important light on the
characteristics of large megathrust&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes, with direct societal
implication for Sumatra, where Padang (over 1 million&lt;br/&gt;inhabitants) is
exposed to the risk of a M&gt;8.5 tsunamigenic earthquake. This
research&lt;br/&gt;will be conducted in collaboration with our Indonesian
partners and will provide key data&lt;br/&gt;for graduate students.
