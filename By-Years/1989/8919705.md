The goal of this project is to measure the dynamics of the concentration of
dopamine in the extracellular fluid of the brain. Dopamine is a recognized
neurotransmitter which plays an important role in regulating neuronal activity
in several regions of the brain which deal with olfaction, movement, and other
brain functions. Numerous pharmacological agents are known to act at the
dopamine synapse. These agents include stimulants, neuroleptics,
antidepressants, and anti-Parkinsonian drugs. Thus, dopamine clearly plays an
important regulatory role in the brain, and direct, time-resolved measurements
of its action should provide new insights into the underlying factors which
regulate this neurotransmitter. Dr. Mark Wightman is continuing his development
of voltammetric technologies which will allow in vivo analysis with subsecond
time resolution for measuring dopamine.
