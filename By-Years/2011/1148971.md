This project will elucidate the role of small RNAs in determining inflorescence
architecture. Plant architechture is largely determined by the genetic
mechanisms regulating patterns of cell division, specification and early
differentiation that occur in special structures called meristems. The
architecture elaborated by the inflorescence meristem is especially important
because it controls reproductive patterning. For example, the tassel and ear of
maize are inflorescences and, thus, the processes that regulate their
architecture control such things as the number and position of seeds that will
form. This project aims to understand how a key class of gene regulatory
molecules called microRNAs regulate maize inflorescence architecture. The
project centers on a mutant, fuzzy tassel (fzt), that affects a key enzyme
required for producing microRNAs and plants with the fzt mutation display severe
defects in inflorescence development affecting both the tassel and the ear. The
project will employ genetic, molecular, and genomic approaches to identify
microRNAs with key roles in inflorescence developement and link specific
microRNAs and microRNA target genes to discrete stages of inflorescence
development. Modulating expression of microRNAs or microRNA target genes could
be used manipulate inflorescence architecture and ultimately increase yield.
This project will also enhance science education by providing authentic research
experiences for high school, community college, and early college students. The
project will have a major impact because these groups often do not have access
to independent research experiences. For example, community college students
will participate in a summer internship program and this is expected to ease
their transition to a four year curriculum including science. A research based
genetics lab course will also be implemented, allowing undergraduate students to
participate in authentic research as part of the normal biology curriculum.
