When studying control systems, one of the first steps is the construction of a
mathematical model of the physical system under consideration. Such a model
always contains elements which are uncertain. These uncertain elements may be
parameters, constantor time varying, which are unknown or imperfectly known or
they may be unknown or imperfectly known inputs to the system. Despite these
uncertainties the control system should be designed so that the overall system
responds in a desired fashion. The aim of this research is to derive controllers
which guarantee the desired behavior under the assumption that the uncertainties
are deterministic but vary within perhaps uncertain bounds.
