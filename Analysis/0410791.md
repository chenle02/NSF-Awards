Conference on Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Applications

ABSTRACT

An international "Conference on Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and
Applications" will be held in Paris, France, June 21-25, 2004, in honor of
Professor Haim Brezis. The program emphasizes the interplay between theory and
applications of nonlinear PDEs. Areas of application covered at the conference
include materials science, combustion, relativity and gravitational waves, and
fluid mechanics. A distinguished group of speakers has accepted the invitation
to speak at the conference. The conference organizers expect between 200 and 300
participants. The program includes invited talks, short presentations by
selected young researchers, poster sessions, and a round-table discussion. Four
speakers have been asked to give short tutorial courses prior to the conference.
Details are to be found on the conference's web site,
