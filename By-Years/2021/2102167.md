The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical care for scoliosis
patients. Scoliosis, a sideways curvature of the spine, affects 6-9 million
individuals in the US, or 2-3% of the population, and has estimated healthcare
costs of $3.5 billion by 2028. Current treatments for scoliosis include bracing
and/or spinal surgery. Patients are often treated with a rigid thoracic
scoliosis brace that does not typically provide curve correction. Compliance
with wearing the brace can be challenging. The proposed technology is an
intelligent, active brace that applies corrective forces to the spine via a
dynamic, adjustable platform and reports compliance through its sensors. This
personalized system may improve clinical outcomes at reduced cost.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
seeks to advance the development of an innovative scoliosis brace. The proposed
system is designed to be comfortable to increase wear compliance by patients.
The brace has a dynamic mechanism that can be adjusted to provide continuous
pressure, and will have Bluetooth-connected sensors allowing parents and
physicians to ensure treatment quality. The new technology will accommodate
patient growth and curve correction while maintaining a precise fit, and may
lessen the social stigma of wearing a brace. In this Phase II proposal,
functionality and durability of the smart pad and sensor system in a clinical
setting will be verified, feedback from end users (orthotists, spine
specialists, patients and families) on the mobile application and physician
dashboard will be collected, and the system economics and fabrication will be
optimized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
