This project, at the University of Georgia, creates an I-Corps Site (I-Corps
UGA) at that institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded
entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support
multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps
Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I-Corps UGA strengthens entrepreneurship and
commercialization in the local and regional ecosystem and supports the growth
and diversification of Georgia's economy. I-Corps UGA will increase the
participation of women and minority students in the resulting innovation network
through active collaboration with other local and regional educational
institutions serving minority and underrepresented populations. By leveraging,
strengthening, and expanding its existing innovation network at the University
of GA, the I-Corps UGA enhances the regional and national capacity to support
STEM technology development and commercialization. In doing so I-Corps UGA
nurtures and supports faculty and student innovators and increases the number of
STEM technologies brought to the market. This project demonstrates a strong
existing foundation in Business Model Canvas and Lean Startup methodologies.
Partnerships with groups such as the Office of Institutional Diversity, Peach
State LSAMP, the UGA Women's Leadership Initiative, Terry College's Women's
Initiative and with a HBU will lead to broader inclusion of women and
underrepresented groups in the program.
