The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is supporting Prof. Veronica Vaida
of the University of Colorado at Boulder to develop an ultraviolet time-resolved
fourier-transform spectrometer (TRFTS). She will investigate three systems: a)
photofragmentation of radicals of atmospheric importance, such as the chlorine
dioxide, chlorine nitrate and nitrate radicals, b) vibrational quenching rates
of various oxygen-containing radicals with oxygen, nitrogen or argon, and c)
photoreactivity of complexes, in which TRFTS will be used to monitor changes in
the products, quantum yields, and photofragment internal energies when ozone-,
sulfur dioxide- or chlorine dioxide-water complexes are photolysed. The
experimental technique as developed and exploited in this endeavor will combine
time resolved fourier transform spectroscopy with ultraviolet absorption
detection of photoproducts. Light initiated chemical reactions are prevalent in
the atmosphere. These studies will address fundamental questions about
reactivity of radicals and their complexes, with the quantitative rigor
necessary for inclusion of such reactions in atmospheric models.
