The State of Ohio proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative to improve the
educational outcomes in mathematics and science by creating a framework and
process for the pre-service education and sustained professional development of
middle school and junior high school mathematics and science teachers. The
initiative is to be implemented through ten regional centers which are to be
established and staffed by teams which include scientist/educators and teacher-
leaders and which emphasize inquiry-based instruction. The centers will utilize
research strategies that assess changes in student learning; perform additional
research to focus on the adaption or creation of new inquiry-based instructional
materials; and provide ongoing support to practicing teachers. Cost Sharing:
300%.
