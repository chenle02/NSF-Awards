concentrated in its tiny nucleus. The atomic nucleus is made of nucleons, which
are either positively charged (protons) or electrically neutral (neutrons).
These subatomic particles, however, are not elementary but are themselves
composite objects made of quarks held together by the strong force via the
exchange of glue particles (gluons). The properties of protons and neutrons are
a manifestation of that strongest force on Earth. The present theory of that
force is Quantum Chromodynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research program at
the University of South Carolina is based at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. There, we use high-energy
electron and photon beams along with sophisticated particle detectors as
powerful microscopes to study the subatomic world. We try to answer questions
like: What is the structure of the nucleon? What are and how can we excite its
internal degrees of freedom? Does the structure of the nucleon change if it is
embedded in dense nuclear matter? The experimental study of these properties
gives insight into the nature of the strong force and allows for rigorous tests
of the underlying theory. Our program provides scientific training to young
researchers and also benefits the medical physics community through our
understanding of the use of photon and electron beams for
radiotherapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
