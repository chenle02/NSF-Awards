This work will exploit recent advances in atomic de Broglie wave interferometry
for precise measurements of rotation and for new tests of the Equivalence
Principle. The potential impact of Bose-Einstein condensed sources on future
precision measurements will be experimentally assessed through application of
atomic AC Josephson effects to sensitive and precise measurements of
acceleration and h/m (the ratio of Planck's constant to atomic mass), and
through the study of squeezed many-body atomic states in the context of
achieving statistical sensitivities below the atom shot-noise limit. The dynamic
evolution of entangled many-body quantum states will be studied in connection
with this latter goal.
