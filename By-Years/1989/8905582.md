A program of knockout reactions using intermediate energy electrons will be
carried out at the MIT/Bates linac using light nuclei targets (A less than 12).
The goal of these studies is to obtain momentum and energy distributions for
bound nucleons, so that detailed comparison can be made with many-body
calculations. These experiments will also address the questions of many-body EM
currents in nuclei, off-shell nucleon form factors, EM structure of the
deuteron, and ultimately the nature of short range NN interactions. Experiment
planning for CEBAF will be carried out, as well as R&amp;D for high power
cryogenic targets in support of those experiments. In addition some pion
production work will be done at TRIUMF and LAMPF. The California State group
will collaborate with other groups on some of these activities and will lead in
others.
