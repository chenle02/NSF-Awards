This project introduces beginning students to the concept of nondeterminism.
This enhances their laboratory experience by highlighting procedural abstraction
and allowing the students to work on equipment which is typical in industry.
These effects are achieved by using ADA as the first programming language,
running on workstations. Thirteen workstations running ADA, a fileserver, and
CASE software are required. The institution is providing matching funds in an
amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
