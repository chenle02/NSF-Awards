The nature of the mechanical behavior of high-grade, isotropic basement rocks
that allow them to accommodate the fold shapes of sedimentary cover sequences is
a problem common to many orogens. This renewal will continue research on several
examples of such folds in the Rocky Mountain foreland. This work will synthesize
existing data on the fold geometry and detailed kinematic information of these
examples. Results are expected to be applicable to a number of orogens
containing basement-cored folds.
