This awards supports the research of Professor G. Kempf to work in algebraic
geometry. He will study the syzygies of homogeneous coordinate rings, matrices
on Picard bundles of algebraic curves, and moduli of Abelian varieties. The
research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the
past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it
treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely
polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from
analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.
Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
