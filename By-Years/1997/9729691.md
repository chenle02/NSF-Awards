9729691 Huband The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is
conducting a one year exploratory study in the dissemination of developments in
engineering education, both teaching techniques and course content, by a novel
means namely arranging visits by highly respected engineering educators to
locations either at or near schools of engineering to encourage participation by
being readily accessible to engineering educators. It is hoped that this method
will take recent developments in engineering education to educators who might
not otherwise be contacted. This project is an experiment to determine if this
method of dissemination offers advantages of lower cost and greater
effectiveness over other methods.
