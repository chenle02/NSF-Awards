Theoretical models of mass transport to metamorphic terranes present petrologic
and stable isotopic criteria for recognizing the passage of fluids through
metamorphic rocks and may provide techniques for quantifying the pattern and
extent of fluid flow. This project will attempt to determine the scale and
extent of fluid infiltration responsible for quartz veining and 18O depletions
in the Chugach metamorphic complex, Alaska. This work will take advantage of the
recent mapping and structural work on these rocks done by workers at Rice
University. Results should provide a more realistic evaluation of the role of
fluid flow in the thermal evolution of the Chugach terrane and by analogy to
other similar convergent arc-margins.
