9970325&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Mubayi plans to undertake research in
graph theory with emphasis on Ramsey theory, hypergraph coloring, connectivity
of cages, and graph covering. The main thrust of his project is to study
variations of problems in Ramsey Theory posed by Paul Erdos. He will also
develop the coloring theory of mixed hypergraphs, investigate the connectivity
properties of cages, and study a new problem related to graph
covering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research falls into the general area
of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods
to study arrangements of objects. These methods are extremely important to
modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those
occurring in telephone systems or internet providers, deal with finite sets of
objects and require combinatorial analysis. Ramsey theory studies the conditions
under which certain substructures in a discrete setting are forced to appear. It
has applications to efficient information retrieval, to clear communication with
noisy channels, and to the effect of failure of intermediate facilities in a
communication network.&lt;br/&gt;
