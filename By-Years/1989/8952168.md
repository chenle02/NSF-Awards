Analytical equipment now available for chemical analysis of dissolved organics
in water will be utilized as part of a new and expanded undergraduate water
chemistry program. The requested additional instruments will extend the
capabilities of teaching to include a broad range of inorganic chemical analyses
of natural and contaminated waters. Specifically, the absorption
spectrophotometer will provide analysis of major cations , minor cations, and
selected trace metals, the ion chromatograph will be used for anion analyses and
analytical balances for preparation of standards for gravimetric experiments.
The use of field meters and filtration units will permit unique on-site
instruction in which EPA protocol for field sample collection, preservation,
analysis, and documentation can be learned. A new laboratory manual will be
developed to instruct students on modern chemical sample collection and analyses
for both inorganic and organic constituents.
