The evolution of structural traits (e.g., bones and muscles) often occurs
through changes in the timing of development. The behavior of animals may also
evolve via such changes in developmental timing; however, this possibility has
been almost completely ignored by behavioral biologists. Preliminary evidence
suggests a strong link between the development and evolution of anti-predator
behavior in garter snakes. The present study will explore this relationshiop in
detail and thus should add significantly to our knowledge of the evolutionary
modification of behavior.
