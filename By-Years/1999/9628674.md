9628674 Nelson This project is to refine models of chemical reactions during
melt migration through the mantle sing an extension of chromatographic theory.
In addition to the chromatographic principles outlined by previous workers, we
will include consideration of changing porosity, melt fraction and variable
mineralogy as a function of extent and type of melt-mantle reaction. To test the
model predictions, we propose to obtain a unique data set from thick alkalic
basalt sequences. Initial implementation of this model suggests at lease three
distinct chemical characteristics to search for its alkalic basalt sequences. In
published data, previously, these trends have been ascribed to mantle
metasomatism and/or presence of trace mantle phases such as zircon or rutile.
Preliminary evaluation suggests that the chromatographic model may be an equally
viable alternative hypothesis to explain certain alkalic basalt trends. The need
for a more definitive test of the model motivates an analytical program to
obtain isotopic and trace element flow-by-flow characterization of selected
alkalic basalt vents on Hawaiian and Canary Islands.
