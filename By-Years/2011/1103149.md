This is a three-year project to carry out a data analysis and modeling study of
the electromagnetic coupling between the Earth?s magnetosphere and the
ionosphere-thermosphere system of its extended atmosphere. The mid-latitude
ionosphere is a complicated overlap region of processes initiated at high and
low latitudes, with each playing a dominant role in the electrodynamics at
different times depending on the current level of geomagnetic activity, as well
as the pre-conditioning of the system. The overarching goal of this effort is to
advance understanding of the physics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling in
this region by addressing a number of specific outstanding science questions: 1)
how ionospheric conductance and neutral winds affect ring current dynamics and
penetration electric fields, 2) how ionospheric conductance and neutral winds
impact current closure between the ring current and the ionosphere that drive
sub-auroral plasma flows, and 3) mechanisms of corotation lag in the
plasmasphere. A framework of models that self-consistently couples the
ionosphere-thermosphere with the inner magnetosphere and ring current will be
utilized. This capability was recently developed by the proposing team. It will
be complemented through this effort by a component that allows for direct
comparisons with a large, diverse set of ground-based and satellite
measurements, including observations from the newly established mid-latitude
radar stations of the SuperDARN network and the newly available global
observations of near-Earth magnetic field variations provided by the AMPERE
project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will foster extended collaborations
between the proposing team of modelers and the many NSF supported community
facilities providing the multitude of observational data that will be utilized
for this study. This will help demonstrate the versatility of these measurements
