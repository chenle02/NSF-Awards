With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carol Espy-Wilson will conduct
three years of interdisciplinary research. This project combines knowledge and
techniques from engineering, speech science, and computational linguistics to
develop a robust automatic speech recognition system that works well for a large
and diverse population. This project includes the development of (a) acoustic
parameters that target the linguistic information in the speech signal, and (b)
a new paradigm for recognition that integrates current speech knowledge with a
powerful statistical framework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge-based speech
recognition system serves as a model of the early stages of speech perception.
Its development is a tool for understanding and coping with variation in speech
that occurs within and across speakers due to differences in gender, age and
emotional states. New insights will be gained in the areas of speech production,
speech perception, and acoustic phonetics. Further, different components of the
system can serve as speech analysis tools to be used in various applications
including speech coding, automatic speech transcription, speech enhancement, and
speech training aids for speech pathologists and their clients.
