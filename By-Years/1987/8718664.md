This project will synthesize superconducting fibers of YBa2Cu3O9-x(&lt;10
micrometers), and measure their electrical and mechanical properties. A
precursor sol prepared by the Pechini process will be used for the fiber drawing
process as its viscosity characteristics can be modified to permit drawing and
it has been utilized to synthesize superconducting powders and sintered
ceramics.
