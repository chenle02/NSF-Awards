Through this project, the Botany Department is microscaling the labs of upper-
division courses that feature analytical biochemistry as a key component of the
lab assignments. This project mostly affects Plant Physiology, but Plant
Genetics, Plant Growth and Development, and a newly approved thesis program for
botany majors also benefit. These courses serve mainly botany majors and biology
teaching majors. Performing labs on a microscale, rather than a conventional
scale, allows the Botany Department to address several problems. The cost of
reagents on a conventional scale is prohibitive; microscale labs reduce the
amount of chemical waste generated. Student lab technique improves, as students
are more careful when handling chemicals in small amounts rather than in large
quantities. Finally, microscale labs can be completed more quickly than full-
scale ones, allowing students to analyze and interpret, not just collect, their
data while they are still in class. This project funds the purchase of a
microtiter plate reader with supporting computer hardware and software for data
collection and analysis. The plate reader is used in place of a
spectrophotometer for microscale labs. The plate reader also gives students the
opportunity to use computer-interfaced laboratory equipment. This project also
shows application of the microscale approach in a subject area other than
organic or inorganic chemistry.
