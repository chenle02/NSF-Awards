The goal of this research is to characterize chemical species on the surface of
small (&lt; 10 nm) metal particles, suspended in liquid media, using surface-
enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SER). The research is focussed on colloidal systems
consisting of nonaqueous suspensions media and/or chemically reactive metals.
The physical mechanism by which species on metals (such as lithium, sodium,
potassium, rubidium and aluminum) produce enhanced Raman scattering will be
explored. The results of these studies are important in developing a better
understanding of surface adhesion, lubrication and protection of metal surfaces
for corrosion resistance.
