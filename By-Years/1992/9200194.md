The University of Nevada, Reno, with its outstanding interdisciplinary program
in the areas of hydrology, hydrogeology and water resources, and with strong
affiliation and interaction with the Deseart Research Institute, will conduct
this REU program in such a way as to exchange ideas, discuss data, and assist in
cross discipline "fertilization". Students will participate for 10 weeks during
the summer. Each week students will meet in a seminar format. In addition,
during most of the program the students will meet in a semi- informal "research
group" setting to discuss their own research results, interact with the other
students and faculty advisors and/or have laboratory demonstrations of
equipment. Faculty will give overviews of their research programs. Emphasis will
be placed on how student and faculty research fits into the bigger,
interdisciplinary picture of hydrological sciences. During the last week the
seminar and research group meeting will be combined so that the REU students
synthesize their information, and practice their communication skills by
presenting their results.
