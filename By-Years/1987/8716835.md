This project will improve the uranium-series dating technique and apply uranium-
series dating to dusty Antarctic ice samples. These include samples from the
main Allan Hills ice field, the Lewis Cliff ice field, and an ice sample close
to an imbedded meteorite in the western Allan Hills ice field. The terrestrial
age of the imbedded meteorites will also be determined.
