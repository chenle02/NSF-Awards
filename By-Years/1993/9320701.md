9320701 Krivo This is a study of racial residential segregation, social
isolation and homicide. It will examine the extent to which black and white
urban homicide rates are a consequence of the high levels of racial residential
segregation in American cities. Research will assess two sets of hypotheses: 1)
Which of a variety of aspects of residential segregation are related to race-
specific patterns of homicide in central cities. 2) What specific factors link
racial residential segregation to rates of lethal violence. The primary data are
from the 1980 and 1990 censuses of population and homicide incidence files
compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the samples will consist of
central cities with at least 100,000 population and 5,000 blacks for each year.
%%% This research will illuminate how and why the high levels of racial
residential segregation found in most American cities are related to one of the
most serious urban problems: high homicide rates, especially for African-
Americans. The study will also advance our understanding of the consequences of
concentrated poverty and social isolation of urban blacks by assessing to what
degree these pattern contribute to criminal violence. ***
