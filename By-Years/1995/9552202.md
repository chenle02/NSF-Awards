Undergraduate Neurobiology Laboratory To broaden our offerings in cellular
biology and introduce students to a rapidly developing and exciting field we are
establishing a junior/senior level lecture/laboratory course in neurobiology for
biology and biochemistry majors. Students conduct several weeks of structured
exercises to familiarize them with the use of equipment, followed by 7-8 weeks
of student designed and executed mini-research projects. The new course builds
on and extends skills students are learning in the Department's newly-designed
introductory level core courses that feature investigative laboratories, and
provides students the opportunity to pursue curiosity-driven experiments in a
somewhat structured format. To establish the laboratory, which emphasizes
cellular neurophysiology and neuron-muscle interactions, electrophysiological
setups centered on the Macintosh computer-based MacLab data acquisition and
analysis system have been acquired. This system allows digital storage and
manipulation of physiological data, which is acquired using micromanipulators,
preamplifiers for intracellular recording, and stimulators/stimulus isolation
units. The experience benefits not only those students who choose to pursue
postgraduate studies in biology or medicine, but will also provide an important
education in the methods of scientific investigation for students who pursue
careers in education, public service, law, etc.
