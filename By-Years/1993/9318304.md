9318304 Badgley This research is a continuation of a study of the influence of
climate on the ecological structure of mammal communities as represented by size
and trophic structure. Using existing data, this study will encompass analyses
of mammal faunas on five continents. The primary research questions include
evaluating the correlation among size, trophic specialization, and phylogenetic
affiliation among continental faunas and among assemblages from different
continents. The study will document the response of mammal assemblages to
changing climatic conditions. Also, phylogenetic constraints will be
incorporated into an understanding of size and trophic structure of different
faunal assemblages. %%% The proposed research represents the first detailed
analysis of relationships between climatic conditions and ecological structure
of mammal assemblages on a continental and global scale. Results from this
research will lead to a clearer understanding of the role of climate in shaping
ecological communities, and to a predictive model for mammalian faunal change
under scenarios of future climate change. ***
