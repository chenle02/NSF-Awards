Castellini OPP97-25859 Abstract Lipid metabolism is the primary source of
energy in seals and accounts for over ninety percent of the resting metabolic
rate of these marine mammals. As a consequence, they have adapted to a high fat
marine-based diet, large lipid stores (blubber), a clear reliance on lipid for
energy and minimal dependence on carbohydrate metabolism. Beyond the basic
requirements of glucose for central nervous system demands, it appears that
seals have a variety of metabolic options for utilizing lipid for almost all
other requirements. One intriguing aspect of the lipid based metabolism of seals
is their ability to fast for extremely long periods. Even the pups of some
species, such as elephant seals, can go without good or water for several
months. This metabolism is driven by lipid stores, but regulation of the process
is not understood. Questions exist regarding the transfer of lipids between
maternal blubber stores, the milk and the pups. The distribution in time and
location of various types of lipid compounds in seals is not known. This project
will analyze a unique set of archived samples of Weddell seal blood with the aim
of elucidating some of the questions relating to the lipid biochemistry of
fasting in seals. These samples, collected for other purposes, became critical
through analysis of the biochemical parameters associated with weaning and long
duration fasting in seal pups. Collaboration between Drs. Castellini and Rea and
Dr. Rene Groscolas in France will lead to a better understanding of lipid
metabolism in these Antarctic seals.
