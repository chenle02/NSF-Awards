This research into the mathematics of deformation and flow of materials is
motivated by applications to subsurface flows of fluids such as groundwater, oil
and gas, avalanche dynamics, including the processing of granular materials in
tumblers and chutes, the motion of microscopic fluid droplets, and the role of
shock waves in the propagation of signals, for example in optical fibers. The
mathematics linking these applications concerns the modeling of continuous
processes with nonlinear equations, and the study of wave-like solutions of the
equations. Recent experiments and new models have opened up opportunities for
fresh insights into these complex systems. The research project will include
graduate student training in mathematics and physics, with an emphasis on clear
presentation of results at scientific conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project on nonlinear models of continuum mechanics focuses on four
areas where recent developments provide opportunities for progress. The
investigation of dispersive and dissipative shock waves will take place in the
context of models of magnetization and porous media flow. New models of two
phase flow possess singular nonlinearities that stimulate innovations in
analysis and numerical simulation. The study of contact lines of droplets on
soft elastic substrates involves the formulation of models for asymmetric drops
that can be solved by the method of transforms and dual integral equations. A
conjectured mechanism for the motion and control of microscopic droplets is to
induce spatial variations in the elastic modulus of the substrate, thereby
providing a driving force on the droplet. Granular flow models, specifically
with poly-disperse grain sizes, will be analyzed using the theory of nonlinear
partial differential equations. The equations will incorporate recent
descriptions of stress distribution in granular materials, coupled to an
established dynamic mechanism that quantifies how grains of different sizes
accumulate in distinct layers.
