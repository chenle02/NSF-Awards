This research will analyze the performance of concatenated coding systems and
modulation schemes operating over the additive Gaussian channel (AWGN) and
various fading channels by examining the loss of capacity resulting from each of
the encoding and decoding steps. This information will then be used to guide the
design of new coding systems. The techniques described in this research allow
the separate evaluation of codes and decoders and thus the identification of
where loss of capacity occurs. Knowledge of this capacity loss is important for
the overall design of a communications system, e.g. for evaluating the benefits
of inner decoders that produce information beyond the maximum likelihood
estimate. First a general technique for calculating the composite capacity of an
orthogonal code and the AWGN channel in isolation has been developed. Then the
composite capacities of an orthogonal code, the AWGN channel, and various inner
decoders including the decoder estimating the bit-by-bit probability of a one,
as in turbo codes, has been developed. The calculations in these examples show
that the maximum likelihood decoder introduces a large loss in capacity. Some of
this capacity loss can be regained by using only slightly more complex inner
decoders, e.g. a detector for M-ary frequency-shift-keying that outputs the two
most likely frequencies and the probability that the ML estimate is correct
gives substantially less degradation than one which only outputs the most likely
frequency. This project extends these results to other codes and other channels.
Practically useful results should be short codes that come close to the sphere
packing bound for the Gaussian channel and improved conventional and parallel
concatenated codes for fading channels. Experimental studies will be included in
the work.
