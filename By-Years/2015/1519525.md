This SBIR Phase I project focuses on designing exercises and developing a set of
computational methods to measure and enhance semantic-based creativity in the
workforce. When hiring a prospect or training an existing employee, there is no
efficient way to measure one's problem solving abilities. In order to be an
efficient problem solver, an employee must possess the knowledge (e.g., an
employee is given a problem whose solution she has witnessed or contributed to
previously) and the employee needs to think creatively (e.g., the employee
encounters a novel problem; in most scenarios, creative employees use
brainstorming methods to generate a number of possible solutions and test
possible solutions to arrive at the best answer). This project's unique approach
is the design of models, where creativity and divergent thinking is measured and
a CQ index is generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using advanced techniques in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and psychometric approach, the project
evaluates the responses and generates an index called "Creativity Quotient,"
which represents users' creativity. The responses are evaluated based three
factors: fluency (# of unique and relevant ideas), flexibility (# of categories
of responses) &amp; originality (infrequency and uniqueness of responses). The
technique deploys a word or phrase-based associative weight where the algorithm
measures the uniqueness of associations between words and phrases. Unique
associations receive higher weighting.
