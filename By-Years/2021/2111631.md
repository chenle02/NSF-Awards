The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve digital content delivery of
volumetric content, or representation of 3D subjects. Current volumetric content
is commonly limited to very short clips (typically &lt; 10 seconds) due to huge
file sizes. This research advances a low-cost, live-streaming, 360-degree
volumetric content platform with no duration limits, even on 4G networks. An
individual will be able to take low-cost, readily available components and
create what would commonly be referred to as a hologram of themselves, for live
broadcast and/or recording. The content will be compatible with existing mobile
devices, and most commercially available wearable extended reality (XR) devices.
both mobile and tethered. Due to the entry-level off-the-shelf hardware that
this project will leverage, volumetric content creation costs will be on par
with online video production costs, ensuring broad adoption across a wide number
of applications, including medical, education, training, safety, entertainment
and telecommunications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the capture of a human subject
using two or more depth-sensors, quickly combine those in a single stream of
compressed video, and broadcast them to mobile and wearable devices using
existing cloud services. This content can then be viewed on a standard two-
dimensional device like a mobile phone, or on a 3D device like an XR wearable.
The content will be fully realized, and viewable from any angle at any time.
There will be no duration limits, and file sizes will be comparable to standard
HD video content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
