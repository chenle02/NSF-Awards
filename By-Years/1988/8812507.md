In the past decade researchers have begun to study how the public intuitively
perceives the risks of hazardous technologies. Studies of risk perception are
today widely cited by risk managers and play an active role in public
discussions concerning risk policies. However, because risk perception
methodology lacks a formal evaluative structure, it is often not clear how
public input should be incorporated into evaluations of risky technologies or
how public concerns should be weighted as part of policy decisions regarding
choices among technologies. The general objective of the proposed research is to
facilitate the integration of risk perception with risk evaluation approaches as
part of social risk-management policies. The specific objective of the research
is to explore (a) the connections between psychometric risk measures, the
physical features of a technology, and sociological concerns, and (b) the
legitimacy of risk-perception concerns as contributors to risk evaluations. The
research will develop a better understanding of the sources and legitimacy of
perceived risk by examining in-depth one key risk characteristic, dread and by
testing a methodology for investigating the policy appropriateness of social
concerns of risk.
