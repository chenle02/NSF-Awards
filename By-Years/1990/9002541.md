Work on this project combines geometry and function theory in several complex
variables to study how the geometry of a domain influences the properties of
holomorhpic functions defined on the domain. Although progress has been made
recently in understanding domains whose complex geometry is not excessively
degenerate, so-called domains of finite type, the general state of knowledge is
still limited. Among the most manageable classes of holomorphic functions
defined on a domain, those which are square integrable are probably the most
useful. It is possible to convert any square integrable function on a domain
into its nearest holomorphic neighbor by a process of integration against a
kernel function - the Bergman kernel. There is a unique such kernel for each
domain and integration projects each function onto the best holomorphic
approximant. Perhaps the most important question related to holomorphic
functions on domains is that of determining whether or not the projection
preserves functions which are differentiable on the boundary of the domain. Are
their images also differentiable on the boundary? Even experienced
mathematicians would consider the likelihood of such an event an accident. The
facts are otherwise. If the boundary has a smooth, curved shape (pseudoconvex)
then the projections are always differentiable. Work will continue in an effort
to extend present results to domains which are not pseudoconvex. Among the more
tractable domains to be analyzed are the Hartogs domains. These are domains
possessing some circular symmetry. Several counterexamples in function theory
have been found in Hartogs domains. Ultimately, this work will be applied to the
general problem of analyzing biholomorphic mappings between domains in several
complex variables. These maps are known to have smooth extensions to the
respective boundaries in many instances. A complete description of the domains
for which these smooth extensions exist is probably the most important question
under investigation in several complex variables at this time.
