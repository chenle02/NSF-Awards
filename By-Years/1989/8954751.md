Computer modeling is becoming a standard tool for experiment and theory. It is
being used to study extremely complex processes, ranging in scale from the inner
structure of the proton to star duster formation and decay. It can be an
illuminating source of creative insights about the structure and behavior of
complex phenomena that were previously inaccessible. It is expected to provide
dramatic breakthroughs in physics, chemistry, genetics, meteorology, demography,
and other fields. Modeling can be made accessible and comprehensible to high
school students through the use of powerful new kinds of modeling tools that
combine visual representations of process structure and behavior with effective
support for student control of process interactions. The major goal of this
project is the development of such tools and an evaluation of their
effectiveness of fostering scientific insight and understanding. The different
types of models and the varied uses of modeling in research will be described
first, to help define the most compelling opportunities for educational
interventions. The uses and expressive power of different forms of
representation will be investigated and the key cognitive issues that arise in
the use of modeling will be identified. The various modeling tools that are
currently available will be analyzed to identify their scope of effective
applications and to determine the need for new tools. A modeling laboratory
comprised of a coherent set of tools for use in the science curriculum will then
be developed, together with preliminary curriculum materials for a set of
initial applications. A formative evaluation of the tools and materials will be
conducted with a select group of students.
