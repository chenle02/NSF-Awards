On some Nonlinear Elliptic Equations

Abstract of Proposed Research Yanyan Li

This award is to continue earlier studies on the compactness of solutions to the
Yamabe problem, and on the existence of solutions to a very general fully
nonlinear version of the Yamabe problem. The PI also proposes to study, in
collaboration with Luis Caffarelli, multi-valued solutions to the Monge-Ampere
equations in order to understand behavior of a metric generated by a multi-
valued solutions to the Monge-Ampere equations near the vertex of a Y-shaped
singularity in 3-dimensional space.

Many questions in (Riemannian) geometry can be formulated as questions about
the properties of certain associated nonlinear partial differential equations
and their solutions. These formulations have often proved to be the means to
prove very general geometrical theorems. The results often depend on the
dimension of the manifolds and other geometrical invariants. Under this award, a
number of specific conjectures and problems of this type will be investigated.
