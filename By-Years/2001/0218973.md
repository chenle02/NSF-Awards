Software is multidimensional; it has many representations besides
the&lt;br/&gt;program source. These include formal specifications, test
suites,&lt;br/&gt;documentation and even the development history. As software
evolves,&lt;br/&gt;these dimensions must stay consistent and reflect each other
as&lt;br/&gt;thoroughly as possible. In practice, however, while these are
usually&lt;br/&gt;consistent when first created, they tend to receive unequal
attention&lt;br/&gt;and therefore gradually become inconsistent. Programmers
thus&lt;br/&gt;typically rely on the source code to the exclusion of most
other&lt;br/&gt;dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's goal is to help
programmers cope with software&lt;br/&gt;evolution by viewing the dimensions of
software as constraints on one&lt;br/&gt;another. The project proposes a
constraint representation common to&lt;br/&gt;the different software dimensions.
Software evolution then becomes a&lt;br/&gt;process of maintaining consistency
between constraints. These&lt;br/&gt;constraints also help programmers identify
high-level features in&lt;br/&gt;their system, and generate rationales to
document design decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The escalating costs of software
maintenance give the project&lt;br/&gt;immediacy and its results high
significance. It will have immediate&lt;br/&gt;impact by developing tools for
programmers to use. It will have&lt;br/&gt;effect over the long term by
employing these tools in educational&lt;br/&gt;settings so future developers
have a better appreciation for the&lt;br/&gt;importance of maintaining the
multiple dimensions of software.&lt;br/&gt;
