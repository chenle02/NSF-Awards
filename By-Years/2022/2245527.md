ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and
coordination of an ocean observation system. The IOOC support office provides

activities. An IOOC that is able to effectively support these goals will make
meaningful contributions to broader societal goals related to climate, maritime
operations, natural hazards, national security, public health, ecosystems, and
natural resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
