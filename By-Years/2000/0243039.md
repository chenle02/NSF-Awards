This award provides a three-year continuation of NSF support for the annual
Summer Workshops on Economic Theory conducted each summer by the Stanford
institute of Theoretical Economics.&lt;br/&gt;For more than 30 years, these
workshops have attracted top scholars from around the world, giving them
opportunities to present their research results as well as collaborate on new
research. This collection of workshops brings together prominent scholars as
well as younger economists for presentation and discussion of their research. A
special effort is made to identify young economists who would benefit from
attending these workshops, and give them extra help to make the trip. This
outreach to newer members of the profession gives them opportunities to meet
senior scholars as well as other young researchers in their fields. These
workshops have been particularly effective in providing an atmosphere for
scholars to learn from each other and engage in collaborative research on
innovative topics in economic theory, mathematical economics, and related areas.
