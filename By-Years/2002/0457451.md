This experimental research program is aimed at efforts in atom optics and
interferometry experiments using cold atoms. The primary emphasis will be the
development of atom interferometers with confined atoms, e.g. atoms confined in
waveguides or trapping potentials between the beamsplitters. The secondary focus
of the group will be a precision experiment using a novel atom interferometer
with unconfined atoms to measure the fine structure constant at the parts per
billion level. This will be used to measure h/m, which will be combined with the
group's recent atomic mass measurements to determine the molar Planck constant.
This can be combined with other recent mass measurements (plus the Rydberg
constant) to yield a measurement of the fine structure constant alpha. The
broader impact of the program is in education of the graduates students as well
as efforts at on the development of a web based tutorial system for physics.
