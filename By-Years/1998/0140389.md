The goal of this project is the study of collisions between relativistic nuclei
and ultimately the determination of the properties of nuclear matter over a wide
range of temperatures and densities. Extremely hot or dense objects which are
made of nuclear matter exist in the cosmos, however, without the possibility
direct study of neutron stars, supernovae, or the Big Bang, one resorts to the
challenging studies of finite and transient systems as provided by nucleus-
nucleus collisions. It has become clear that in order to understand the nuclear
equation of state or to identify a transistion to a new state of matter, the
quark-gluon plasma, it will require a comprehensive and correlated set of
measurements as well as extensive calculations which relate the observables to
the nuclear matter variables. This project focuses on the acquisition and
analysis of such a set of data using the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR)
experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) located at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. The collection of detector systems which make up the STAR
experiment provide detailed information about individual collision events. The
UCD group will use data from these detectors to reconstruct the events and
infer, from the recorded debris, both the dynamics and the thermodynamics of the
collision.
