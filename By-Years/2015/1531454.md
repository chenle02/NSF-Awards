Mass spectrometry instruments with ultrahigh mass resolution and extreme
sensitivity are especially well suited for the analysis of complex environmental
samples, such as found in the organic mixtures in atmospheric aerosols, and a
range of natural waters and hydrometeors. The proposal seeks to acquire and
commission an ultrahigh mass resolution Thermo Orbitrap Elite MS, with high mass
resolution aiding in more accurate molecular weight determination, and
interfaced with 2-D liquid chromatography to aid in separation in mixtures of
like compounds.

Molecular signatures and relative quantities of molecules in complex mixtures
will be used initially to further our understanding of: (1) atmospheric aerosol
processes (e.g., cloud cycling and aging) and properties (e.g., hygroscopicity
and volatility); (2) carbon cycling responses to changes in biota and climate;
and additional applications such as: (3) multiphase reaction chamber work; (4)
fate of organic contaminants during water treatment

Advanced analytical instrumentation also significantly expands the research
opportunities and training exercises for students, postdocs and the next
generation of researchers/teachers.
