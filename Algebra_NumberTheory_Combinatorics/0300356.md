Abstract: Quantum Cohomology, Representation theory and Feynman Amplitudes

The principal investigator wants to pursue research in two areas:
Representations of the fundamental group and Quantum Cohomology, and the study
of the structure of Feynman amplitudes (the second area is in collaboration with
Patrick Brosnan of UCLA). In the first field, the PI wants to generalise his
recent geometric proof of Horn and Saturation conjectures to the Quantum
analogues of these conjectures. This project is inspired by the the problem of
unitary representations of the fundamental group of p1 of projective n-space
with n points removed with prescribed local monodromies. The principal
investigator plans to investigate the existence of Horn type recursion for other
groups and study analogues of the Saturation conjecture. A final goal of this
work is to determine an optimal set of inequalities for the problem of existence
of unitary representations with prescribed monodromies. In the second field (in
collaboration with Brosnan), the principal investigator will continue the study
of relations between Feynman amplitudes and algebraic geometry. The first step
of this work is to understand in general Algebro-geometric terms the integral
computations of the physicists.

The study of relations between Representation theory (`symmetries') and
Algebraic Geometry is a very important area of research. Part of the motivation
for this work comes from eigenvalue problems, which are important in numerical
computing and in wave mechanics. The work on the geometry of Feynman amplitudes
is of interest both in mathematics and physics. The aim is a better mathematical
understanding of Feynman amplitudes, which are fundamental to the quantum
theory.
