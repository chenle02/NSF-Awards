The University of California, San Diego, proposes an RCMS program to increase
the number of students from underrepresented groups who earn the Ph.D. in
oceanography and its related constituent fields. The program will have
secondary, undergraduate, and graduate components. At the secondary level,
efforts will be made to improve science instruction and to provide academic
enrichment and career counseling for students in selected schools. At the
undergraduate level, the program will consist of four elements: a faculty
preceptor program, small seminars for freshmen and sophomores interested in
science; a faculty mentor program, two-term research experiences for juniors and
seniors majoring in science; a summer research program, eight-week summer
experiences at Scripps Institution of Oceanography for science majors between
their junior and senior years; and an undergraduate research conference,
opportunities for students to make public presentations of research papers. At
the graduate level, students will be enrolled in the Scripps graduate program.
The RCMS program will be carried out jointly by UCSD's Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, the Office of Graduate Studies and Research, and the Office of
Undergraduate Affairs.
