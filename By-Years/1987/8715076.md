This award supports cooperative research between Daniel Rock of the University
of Nebraska and A.A. Schudel of the National Institute of Land and Cattle
Technology in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This research in molecular virology will
characterize the Bovine herpesvirus type-1 involved in infection of the bovine
central nervous system. It will identify, through in-situ hybridization, regions
of the viral genome that are transcriptionally active in the central nervous
system neurons and identify and characterize specific latent infection-related
viral genes within these regions. This will lead to knowledge of the interaction
of an alpha herpesvirus with neural tissue during latent infection in a natural
host and development of strategies for preventing latent infection or preventing
its reactivation. Such knowledge is needed for the development of genetically-
engineered latency-negative vaccines. This is an ambitious proposal but at
modest cost. It is an excellent example of the advantage of collaboration. A
unique well-characterized genetic strain of BHV-1 will be made available by the
Argentinians to the U.S. PI, whereas he will contribute the techniques and the
methodology to be used in the research project. While the practical purpose of
studying a potential threat to the cattle industry is important to both
countries, the research has promise for understanding herpesvirus latency.
