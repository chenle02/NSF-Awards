A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V
Blue Heron, an 86-foot Coastal research vessel owned by the University of
Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the US Academic
Research Fleet (ARF). Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue
Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997. The vessel is
outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and
scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port
calls. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) and is available for charter by research scientists on
any of the Great Lakes. In 2021, the vessel completed 51 funded days, 31 of
these (61%) were for NSF. In 2022, the vessel is scheduled for 69 days, 53 of
which (77%) will be for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation
requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;1) Acoustic Releases with links
$77,752&lt;br/&gt;2) Carousel Water Sampler with bottles $56,999&lt;br/&gt;
$134,751&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
