This grant provides funds for the conduct of an advisory workshop to assist in
setting a research agenda for the Manufacturing Machines and Equipment research
program. The objective of the workshop is to identify extant knowledge from
disparate fields that can be integrated beneficially into the technology of
manufacturing machines. The workshop will bring together about 35 participants
from a wide range of disciplines, including materials science, economics,
mathematics and others. It will be held in the fall of 2004, hosted at the
Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The workshop
participants will identify critical needs of manufacturing machines, and then
develop plans for the integration of knowledge from other fields toward meeting
these needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the workshop will be a plan for
increased collaboration between researchers in the field of manufacturing
machines and other disciplines. It should foster more innovative research in the
field, resulting ultimately in improved competitiveness across many areas of
manufacturing.
