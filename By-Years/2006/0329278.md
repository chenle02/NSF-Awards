This project develops new algorithms, programs, and theory for Relational
Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning (RL) seeks to design and build
intelligent programs that optimize their behavior by taking actions and
receiving reinforcement or feedback from the environment. Current research in RL
is focused mainly on problem domains where the environmental states are
represented as vectors of propositions. Many real world domains such as
logistics planning, information extraction, and semantic information retrieval
from the Web require relational representations and are not amenable to
propositional learning methods. This project develops methods to solve
reinforcement learning problems in such domains by extending to the relational
setting techniques such as hierarchical learning, building and exploiting models
of the world, learning compact representations of value functions and policies,
and combining planning with learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
of the project include discovery of more general and effective reinforcement
learning algorithms, development of new heuristics to solve logistics planning
problems, and more effective ways to interact with the Web to retrieve useful
information. &lt;br/&gt;
