The American Mathematical Society will administer a program for selecting and
supporting approximately 90 U.S. early-career and more senior mathematicians to
attend the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul Korea in August
2014 (ICM-2014).

The International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) is held once every four
years, and is one of the most significant gatherings of the world's leading
mathematicians, where major developments in mathematical research, across sub-
disciplines, is discussed. Attendance by U.S. mathematicians at this meeting is
important for the scientific health of the nation because U.S. mathematicians
discuss, learn and share in mathematical research that is going on all over the
world. The Society has administered similar travel grant programs for previous
ICM gatherings, beginning with ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan and most recently for
ICM-2010 in Hyderabad, India. The program ensures that there is strong
attendance by U.S. mathematicians, promoting contact with mathematical
scientists from other parts of the world, which is important not only for the
education of future mathematicians, but also for the long-term vitality of
mathematical research in the United States. In addition, efforts will be made to
ensure that early career mathematicians, women and minorities receive full
consideration to support their attendance.
