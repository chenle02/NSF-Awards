A proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance study of an interesting class of newly
synthesized liquid crystalline materials will be carried out to determine the
manner in which molecular structure and dynamics correlate with liquid crystal
phase properties. Also, NMR will be used to explore issues that include homo-
and heteronuclear decoupling in solids; broadband and narrowband coherence
transfer in liquids; and order selective and nonselective preparation of
multiple quantum coherence in solids, liquids, and liquid crystals.
