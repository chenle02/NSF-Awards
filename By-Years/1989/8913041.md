The University of Alaska Rasmuson Library proposes to substantially increase
researchers' access to arctic and polar based bibliographic sources through
networking of existing library holdings in a number of major institutions
(University of Colorado, Ohio State University, Dartmouth College, Alaska
University system, the Western Library Network, and the Research Libraries
Information Network). Bibliographic records will be merged and made available
semi-annually on a compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM). Comparison of in-
house on-line holdings of four specialized research libraries will be conducted
and unique records added to the common base. An important separate file, "A
Union List of Polar Serials," will be completed and added. These activities and
results will be exchanged with other specialized arctic and polar international
centers and will at the same time greatly increase availability of social
science literature. Results of this project will be responsive to repeated
recommendations and findings of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, the
Arctic Research Commission, several reports of the National Academy of Sciences,
and will complement environmental data activities of the Interagency Arctic
Research Policy Committee and bipolar information retrieval and dissemination..
