The principal investigator will study the origin and history of cogenetic silica
undersaturated and silica saturated igneous rocks. Specifically, he will address
the question of whether the latter can be related to the former via
incorporation of silica- rich crustal components. Rocks from four specific
localities will be investigated using petrographic, major and trace element
analytical, geochronologic, and stable isotope techniques. The processes to be
studied are likely to be common ones. The research results thus will have
potentially wide applicability in helping geologists understand the origins of
plutonic igneous rocks.
