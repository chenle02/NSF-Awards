The volume of hypertext on the World Wide Web is dwarfed by the amount of data
made available in networked databases, which has been estimated to be 400 to 550
times larger than the WWW hypertext. This proposal refers to this data as the
Federated Facts and Figures on the Internet, or simply the FFF. The goal of this
work is to explore the mechanisms for -- and consequences of -- aggressively
leveraging this resource.

The proposal has three aspects. First, it describes algorithms and systems for
exploiting facts and figures on the Internet. In particular, it proposes
adaptive query processing for the Telegraph system, to adjust to the volatility
characteristic of the Internet. It also proposes extending Telegraph to
``trawl'' large amounts of data from the FFF, by running recursive queries over
multiple data sources. The second goal of the proposal is to explore the
ramifications of providing FFF tools to the broad Internet user base. This
includes an investigation of policy -- both social and technical -- and the
economic incentives and ramifications surrounding such policies. The third goal
is to explore the design space of countermeasures that can prevent FFF
technologies from being misused.
