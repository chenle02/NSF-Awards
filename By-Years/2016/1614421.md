Throughout the world, desert soils are overgrown by microorganisms that hold
them in place, forming a biological soil crust. In China, rapid economic
development and overgrazing have destroyed much of the crust, contributing to
massive dust storms, poor air quality, and the expansion of deserts into
previously arable land. They are trying to correct the damage, but the crusts
grow slowly, and present many restoration problems. The United States is
beginning to develop desert areas more extensively, especially with the rapid
growth of the solar industry, and efforts are being made to prevent the issues
experienced by China from occurring. While much of the current research focuses
on trying varied approaches to see which will enhance success, this project will
instead look at specific desert environmental factors to determine which present
the greatest challenge to both preservation and restoration. This research will
be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Zhang Yuanming, a noted desert ecologist
and director of the Key Laboratory of Biogeography and Bioresource in Arid Land,
at the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, located in Urumqi, China.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Three major environmental stresses experienced on the
desert surface are ultraviolet radiation, oxidation, and desiccation. This
project will attempt to determine the limits of adaptation of biological crusts
to these extreme conditions. Common lichen species found in both the Mojave
Desert in the Southwestern US and the Gurbantunggut Desert in Northwestern China
will be exposed to high levels of these stresses, and then be rehydrated while
the recovery of chlorophyll fluorescence is monitored. Varying levels of
humidity and differing rehydration temperatures will also be tested to determine
how these affect recovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia
and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S.
graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and
Technology of China.
