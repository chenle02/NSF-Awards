The objective of the Undergraduate Internship Program in High- Performance
Computing in Fluid Dynamics at the University of Minnesota is to promote and
help support undergraduate involvement in ongoing and new research on high-
performance computing in fluid dynamics, and in new software development efforts
for scientific computing and graphics support for such research. The program
provides a special opportunity for undergraduates to participate in the research
programs and enrich their experience. Undergraduates will work with faculty on a
wide variety of projects on high-performance computing in fluid dynamics.
Faculty from various disciplines have individually contributed projects on a
variety of closely related topics in fluid dynamics and will be responsible for
supervising undergraduate students. The program will be administered by the
Minnesota Supercomputer Institute and will be open to undergraduate student
participants who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States and
its possessions. The projects are unified by their common elements of high-
performance computing and graphics development for the fluid dynamics
applications.
