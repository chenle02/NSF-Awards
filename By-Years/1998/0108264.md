The Third International Symposium on Radiative Transfer will be held June 17-22,
2001 in Antalya, Turkey. Funds will be used for travel by six emerging
scientists for their participation in the Symposium. Three pre-tenure faculty
and three doctoral students whose research focus is in the area of radiative
heat transfer will be invited. Each will be expected to participate fully in the
Symposium, by submitting and presenting some aspect of their research activity
for review. The invited participants will receive partial travel support which
will cover a portion of the estimated Symposium travel expenses, with the
expectation that the remainder will be provided either from the participant's
own funds or the participant's institution.
