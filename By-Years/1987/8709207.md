A substantisl body of data shows that identical (Monozygotic or MZ) twins
maintain closer relationships with one another relative to fraternal (Dizygotic
or DZ) twins. The present research concerns the identification and examination
of factors underlying social relationships within MZ and DZ twinships. It is
particularly concerned with the further application and refinement of
observational methods for capturing subtle aspects of cooperation and
competition between twins and unrelated children; this interest extends earlier
research on social interaction between young twins. Some old questions, such as:
are MZ twins more closely affiliated than DZ twins, and why? acquire new
significance in light of social-genetic and kinship-genetic explanations of
behavior. The present study will determine if twin group differences in
cooperation and competition observed in childhood samples are also maintained in
an adolescent twin sample. This new approach encourages reevaluation of more
traditional theories of twin dynamics, such as those offered by psychoanalytic
theorists. The implications of outcomes from studies of twins and non-twins, for
social processes and activities within groups and populations, are related areas
of interest.
