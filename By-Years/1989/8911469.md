Studies in Science, Technology and Society supports projects that examine the
social, intellectual, economic, and political contexts that influence the
development and use of science and technology. This project focusses on
diffusion of scientific knowledge and tests hypotheses concerning center -
periphery relationships in information exchange. Four hypotheses will be
examined in this project: how diffusion is increasingly globalized; how position
in the global network of national scientific communities -- called the
scientific world-system, is defined by the directionality of information
exchange; how local centers exist more in certain disciplines than others; and
how centrality is affected by research performance and collegial ties with
foreigners. The international networks of knowledge diffusion will be measured
by bibliographic citations given each year (1974-1986) by researchers in each
major country to previous works from each major country (USA, UK, FRG, France,
Canada, Japan, and USSR) in each discipline (clinical medicine, biomedicine,
biology, chemistry, physics, earth and space science, engineering and
technology, and mathematics). The project will yield knowledge about the
strengths and limits of bibliographic citation analysis in developing an
understanding of the structure and dynamics of creation and diffusion of
knowledge among scientists and in nation-states. It will produce publications
contributing to knowledge about the scientific world-system and reports serving
domestic and foreign science policy. This study comes from well-qualified
researchers. Research and dissemination plans are appropriate; institutional
support is very good; the budget is modest. The project has important
implications for our understanding of intellectual and social factors that
influence development and diffusion of scientific knowledge. Support is
recommended.
