The topic of this conference is various aspects of similarity solutions of
differential equations (solutions obtained by the classical Lie group method or
generalizations), the occurrence of similarity solutions in applicable
situations, the study of similarity solutions of particular equations, and the
relation of similarity solutions to more general solutions of the relevant
equations. Subjects to be discussed include travelling waves for reaction-
diffusion equations, blow-up and quenching problems, equations soluble by
inverse scattering and the Painleve transcendent equations, and boundary layer
problems. This grant will help support a conference to be held at the University
of Pittsburgh on April 26-28, 1991, whose goals are to provide a forum for the
exchange of ideas and results on the leading edge of research in this topic.
