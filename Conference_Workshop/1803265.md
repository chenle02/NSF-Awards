This award supports the participation of US mathematicians in the conference
Representation Theory, Mathematical Physics and Integrable Systems to be held
June 4-8, 2018 at Centre International de Recontres Mathematiques in Luminy.
Talks at the conference will address the latest progress in research at the
nexus of representation theory, mathematical physics, and integrable systems,
and will formulate open problems that will drive the development in these areas
in the coming years. The conference will foster an environment for the
establishment of lasting international collaborations between US and foreign
researchers.

The conference will cover the latest developments on the interface of
noncommutative algebra, differential and algebraic geometry, and perspectives
arising from physics. These connections have proven numerous in recent decades,
leading to advances like the development of new and powerful knot invariants,
new perspectives on enumerative geometry and string theory, and the introduction
of cluster algebra and categorification techniques into a broad range of
subareas in algebra, geometry and mathematical physics. The conference website
is https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/1746.html

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
