&lt;br/&gt; NER: Oligonucleotide-directed alignment of cytoskeletal &lt;br/&gt;
filaments for nanoscale assembly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is currently great
interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology for manipulating material at
submicron scales. In cells, however, this is a routine task -- the transport of
intracellular cargo is carried out by motor proteins that move along
cytoskeletal filaments called microtubules. Directional movement is achieved
because microtubules have a structural polarity and motors move unidirectionally
along them, with different motors moving in different directions. We seek to:
(i) reconstruct the intracellular transport system in vitro using purified
kinesin motor proteins and microtubules, and (ii) use it to transport defined
cargo (biological or synthetic nanoscale objects) to specific sites on a two-
dimensional substrate. To lay down microtubule tracks with desired orientations,
we will take advantage of the specificity and reversibility of DNA hybridization
as a "molecular glue". Single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides will be attached to
defined sites on glass surfaces and complementary oligonucleotides will be
covalently attached to microtubules. By making microtubules whose ends are
functionalized with different DNA sequences and spatially patterning their
sequence complements, a variety of microtubule geometries will be investigated.
These tracks will be used to direct the motion of cargo-laden kinesin motors as
a step towards building systems for biomolecular separations or directed
assembly applications.&lt;br/&gt;
