This project is investigating the characteristics of "entry points" to NSDL that
are specifically geared to middle schoolers to promote science information
literacy and more generally, to use NSDL resources. Master teachers and students
are involved in all aspects of this project's research and development, with an
Advisory Group providing guidance on several aspects of the project. These
include the selection of the Master Teachers; the creation of a functional
specification for the entry points; the development of prototypes; the study of
their characteristics from both a human computer interface and a learning gains
perspective; and evaluation of their impact on student attitudes and
performance. This work is informing the NSDL community's understanding of how to
provide services tailored to the needs of children, and more generally, it is
contributing guidance to the integration of future services into the NSDL core.
