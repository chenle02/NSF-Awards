This award provides support for participation of graduate students and young
researchers in the Shanks Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Fluid Dynamics,
held at Vanderbilt University, on Saturday February 28, and Sunday, March 1,
2015. The field of fluid dynamics has a long history going back to the works of
Bernoulli and Euler. Despite its long history, fluid dynamics continues to be an
active and exciting field of research, with many of its fundamental problems
still wide open. For instance, the lack of a scientifically satisfactory
understanding of turbulent phenomena, and questions regarding the long-time
existence of the fundamental equations believed to govern the dynamics, are two
well-known examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together some
leading researchers in the area of mathematical fluid dynamics, with emphasis on
the application of partial differential equations to the study of the problem of
fluid motion. The main goal of this workshop is to facilitate discussion and
collaboration in a focused setting. In particular, the workshop will provide an
ideal opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to interact with
experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
