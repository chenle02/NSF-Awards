0119392&lt;br/&gt;Ezenwa&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are: (1) to
encourage undergraduate electrical, mechanical, computer engineering, and Allied
Health students to conduct senior-year design projects in rehabilitation
engineering, and (2) to focus such design projects towards the needs of specific
individuals with orthopedic and/or neuromuscular disabilities. Students are
recruited from the class rosters of the Departments of Allied Health,
Occupational Therapy (OT), and Electrical Engineering, and elective course
registrants from the mechanical, industrial and computer engineering
departments. It is expected that 7 design projects will be completed each year
of the three year program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clients have been identified in
the greater Milwaukee area who would benefit from the proposed senior design
projects. The significance of the program is (I) exposing undergraduate
engineering students to the field of rehabilitation engineering at a formative
stage in their educational development might sensitize them towards the role of
this profession in a rehabilitation setting; (II) exposing occupational therapy
students to more in-depth characteristics of assistive technology device
performance in order for them to be able to determine demands imposed on a
device by a person with a disability; (III) by forming small design groups that
comprise engineering and OT students, engineering students may grasp the
physiologic and functional limitations necessary for effective problem
formulation and solution; (IV) the students from Allied Health should learn why
certain engineering components are used and to acquire the knowledge necessary
to deal with vendors of assistive technology; (V) the students will be rewarded
in contributing towards solving limitations imposed by physical impairments,
and; (VI) the client will benefit by having the specialized technology that
could enable independence, potential employment, or completion of
schooling.&lt;br/&gt;
