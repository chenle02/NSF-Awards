0124922&lt;br/&gt;Descour&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is the demonstration
of an array of miniaturized microscope objectives. The area of immediate
application is telepathology, a subspecialty of telemedicine that permits an
expert pathologist at one location to provide diagnostic services to remote
locations using digital video microscopy and modern telecommunications links.
The goal of this SGER project is to explore the essential technical challenges
associated with construction of an 80-microscope array In this project a sub-
array of four, NA = 0.4 microscopes will be fabricated that will demonstrate a
substantial imaging capability, i.e., imaging a 1-mm wide swath along the length
of the slide. Image data will be recorded with 1-micron spatial resolution. The
long-term goal of the research is to construct an NA = 0.7, 80-microscope array
capable of 0.5-micron resolution over a 20-mm wide field of view. This SGER
project will establish the technology foundations on which the NA = 0.7
microscope-array design will be based.&lt;br/&gt;
