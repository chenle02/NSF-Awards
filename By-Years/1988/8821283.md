Morphological integration can be defined as a characteristic of a
transformation that deforms one morphology into another. A region of morphology
is integrated if the deformation acts globally; regions are poorly integrated if
they comprise parts that undergo different transformations. The goals of this
postdoctoral project are to: (1) identify integrated parts of the skull and jaw
of species of New World murid rodents; (2) compare parts detected by
morphometric analysis to those predicted by developmental theory and functional
morphology; and (3) explore if developmentally integrated units remain
integrated through phylogeny. Known-age tissue samples of the cotton rat,
Sigmodon fulviventer, will be explored for ontogenetic integration; adult
samples of S. fulviventer, S. hispidus berlandieri, S. hispidus komareki,
Neotoma floridana, Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus will be analyzed for
phylogenetic integration. Changes in shape coordinates will be used to analyze
transformations within and between regions of the skull and jaw hypothesized a
priori to be integrated because of developmental origin or function. The
uniform, global but not uniform, and localized non-linearities will all be
analyzed. The hierarchy of integrated parts will be constructed by application
of the method of principal warps which decomposes non-global components
hierarchically as determined by the amount of "bending energy" required to
displace the landmarks, regardless of the affine transformation. The principal
warps can be used to categorize the features of shape change, each at its own
geometric scale, and to investigate variation in the underlying bending-energy
at progressively larger geometric scales. This one-year fellowship activity will
take place at the University of Michigan.
