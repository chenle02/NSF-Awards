Birmingham This research focuses on the development of a set of tools to rapidly
prototype digital systems taking into account a need to minimize lifetime costs
by building testable systems and including consideration of manufacturing
issues. The knowledge- based synthesis system MICON serves as a software
workbench. MICON takes a input high-level functional specifications for a
microprocessor-based system and generates a complete design. More specifically,
this research focuses on three major topics: 1. A design-for-testability
extension (DFT); 2. A domain-independent version of MICON (DIM); and, 3. An
interface to high-level (behavioral) synthesis tools. Research is concentrating
on three areas: heuristic search methods for large-scale optimization, knowledge
acquisition tools, and timing verification.
