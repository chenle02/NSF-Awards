This grant will support research in several techniques for encoding acoustic-
phonetic information to be used in speaker- independent continuous-speech
recognition. Time-delay and recursive neural network architectures will be used
for spectral analysis of overlapping speech segments, to be compared with a
Bayesian maximum-likelihood classification of the speech spectral dynamics.
Neural-network outputs will then be encoded as approximate phonetic distances,
with a two-level iterative training method to optimize overall recognition.
Integration of this system with hidden-Markov speech recognition will also be
studied.
