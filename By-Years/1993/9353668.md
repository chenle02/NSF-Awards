9353668 Boschmann An Invitational conference on teaching laboratory science at
a distance is proposed. Increasing use of distance education delivery systems
has stimulated the teaching of laboratory sciences by the same means. However,
the laboratory aspect of such courses is usually problematic. Several solutions
have been advanced by professors of biology, chemistry, physics and earth
sciences in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. People having
these experiences will share their solutions with others who are engaged in
similar instructional situations. This conference will identify key issues,
discuss alternative procedures, and establish a network for continuing
communication among the participants and others who are using distance education
delivery systems.
