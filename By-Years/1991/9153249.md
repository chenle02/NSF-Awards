Computer technology is being exploited to produce a "leaner and livelier" multi-
variable calculus curriculum supported by a collection of Mathematica Notebooks
and graphics packages that provide material for classroom use as well as
problems that invite students to explore further the concepts of calculus. A
text will result that will assume that students have access to a powerful
computing environment, but not necessarily Mathematica.
