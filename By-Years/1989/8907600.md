Emulsion polymerization is used in industry for the production of polymer
latexes for applications such as coatings, binders, adhesives, paints and foams.
In this process, polymer particles are created in the presence of stabilizing
emulsifiers with diffusion of monomer from large droplets (greater than
approximately 10 microns in diameter) to the growing particles which are
approximately 0.1 to 0.4 microns in diameter. An alternative to emulsion
polymerization is miniemulsion polymerization in which the monomer phase is
first dispersed into the aqueous phase in the form of small and stable droplets
in the size range of approximately 0.05 to 0.4 microns in diameter through the
use of a mixed emulsifier system. These miniemulsions are formed by the addition
of a co-surfactant (for example hexadecane or cetyl alcohol) to the usual
emulsion polymerization recipe, typically containing sodium dodecyl sulfate as
surfactant. Initiation an polymerization then take place in the monomer droplets
and the product polymer particles are approximately the same size as the initial
monomer droplets. To gain a more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms
involved in miniemulsion polymerizations, the PIs plan to: 1. Determine the
effect of the composition of the particle/water interface and the
monomer/polymer particle on the entry and exit rates of free radicals to and
from the droplets/particles. 2. Test the existing methodologies for the
determination of the entry and exit rate coefficients which have a direct
bearing on the mechanisms of this heterogeneous polymerization. 3. Determine the
relative importance of droplet/droplet, particle/droplet, and particle/particle
instabilities and their influence on miniemulsion polymerization. 4. Examine the
effect of the breadth in the particle/droplet size distributions through
simulations of the miniemulsion polymerization kinetics, hereby approaching a
more realistic description of an actual system.
