On the one hand, this project will advance one's understanding of currently
important topics in signal processing, and on the other, it will stimulate
interactions between two central areas of mathematics, analysis and number
theory. In signal processing, so-called one-bit sensing replaces the usual
linear measurements of a signal by incorporating the sign of the measurement.
There are two motivations for this. First, the sign function is a basic type of
nonlinearity, so results about it can represent a first step towards relaxing
linearity in a number of significant settings. Second, in an important
technological development, one-bit measurements can be done very frequently.
Surprising experiments are using new methods that need theoretical
justification, and in this context one-bit measurements have proven to be just
as effective as linear ones.

Topics in compressive sensing have an intimate relationship to questions in
discrepancy theory, with one-bit sensing being the easiest place to uncover this
relationship. This raises a new set of questions in discrepancy theory, and
brings to compressive sensing new techniques. In particular, there are new tools
to study lower bounds in the subject, which can reveal how effective the current
random techniques are. Also, it can provide new approaches to sampling, such as
the semi-random jittered sampling. In analysis and number theory, the project
will study discrete variants of maximal oscillatory singular integrals. The
latter, in the continuous case, are already fascinating objects. Passing to the
discrete variants entails many additional complications that arise from subtle
arithmetic structures. The results established in the project will be the first
of this type, hence will require novel techniques. The new approach is a
synthesis of breakthrough results of Bourgain and elemental methods in phase-
plane analysis.
