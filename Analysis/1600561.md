The great American physicist Richard Feynman described turbulence as the "the
most important unsolved problem of classical physics." Here, he was referring to
hydrodynamic turbulence, which is the phenomenon one observes on numerous
occasions in daily life, particularly when one travels through fluids either in
watercraft on the ocean or in airplanes in the atmosphere. Despite its intuitive
manifestations, the scientific understanding of turbulence is far from
satisfactory. A related phenomenon is "wave turbulence," which pertains to
similar problems but for different physical systems involving wave interactions
(e.g.,ocean or plasma waves). The aim of this project is to gain a better
understanding of certain phenomena pertaining to wave turbulence from a rigorous
mathematical viewpoint and thereby to take the first steps towards putting the
theory on solid mathematical foundations.

The project addresses two different regimes of long-time behavior for nonlinear
dispersive and wave partial differential equations. The first regime can be
characterized by "out-of-equilibrium dynamics," in which solutions do not
exhibit long-time stability around equilibrium configurations. This is the
typical behavior of nonlinear dispersive equations posed on compact domains,
where dispersive effects do not translate to decay, and is the natural setting
of wave turbulence theory. The other regime of long-time behavior concerns
dispersive partial differential equations posed on Euclidean space, for which
one can hope to have stable equilibrium points for the dynamics (stationary
solutions). The "asymptotic stability" of trivial equilibria (zero solutions) is
mostly well understood by now, but that of nontrivial stationary solutions is
far from settled. The project suggests several avenues of research to improve
our understanding in the two aforementioned directions.
