The department of mathematics at Southwest Texas State University will host the
1990 Spring Topology Conference. This will be the 24th in a series of annual
conferences held at various universities. Over the years, many important areas
of topology have been well-represented, and beginning in 1987, dynamical systems
theory began to play a role. This will continue in 1990. Some survey talks by
well-known researchers will be given as well as talks on interesting new
results. Invited one-hour addresses will include those by James W. Cannon,
Cameron M. Gordon, and Dennis P. Sullivan. Coverage will include (1) traditional
areas of general topology, continua, decomposition spaces, and manifold theory,
(2) dynamical systems, especially developments in the attendant areas of ergodic
theory, chaos, and fractals, and (3) problem sessions to fuse these two areas to
form a basis and motivational force for future researchers.
