The Index to Plant Chromosome Numbers is a compilation of all the original
plant chromosome numbers reported in the scientific literature throughout the
world, covering algae, fungi, bryophytes, ferns, and seed plants. Indexes are
compiled annually but are usually published in volumes covering at least two
years at a time. The chromosome number is an important attribute of a plant
species, and the literature reporting these data provides important information
for plant breeders, geneticists, and scientists who study the classification and
evolution of plants. The Index to Plant Chromosome Numbers is the only worldwide
index of this type and is thus the primary information source for chromosome
data about plants for the world's scientific community. Indexes also function as
a general bibliography for current studies in plant systematics. The scientific
literature is reviewed voluntarily by the approximately 25 contributing editors
for the project, who are spread throughout the world and are assigned
responsibility for particular scientific publications. The data are forwarded to
the editors Dr. Peter Goldblatt and Dr. Dale Johnson of the Missouri Botanical
Garden, who coordinate the reviewing activities of the contributors and
supervise the preparation of the published indexes. The chromosome information
is sorted by computer alphabetically by plant family, genus, and species name,
in which form it is published. All entries are cross-indexed to the original
publication. Information from the Index will be available on-line via computer
from Missouri Botanical Garden's TROPICOS system starting in 1989.
