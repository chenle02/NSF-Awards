Joseph Maher will investigate the large scale geometry of the mapping class
group, with a view towards applications to 3-manifolds. Moduli spaces of Riemann
surfaces, and their symmetries, the mapping class groups, are fundamental
objects of interest in many branches of mathematics. Recently, techniques from
coarse geometry have been applied to these spaces, and using these results
Joseph Maher has shown that a random walk on the mapping class group gives rise
to a pseudo-Anosov element with asymptotic probability one. This project
involves extending this to obtain further information about the mapping class
group, for example, investigating whether random walks on this group make linear
progress in the complex of curves. Such results may have applications to the
study of 3-manifolds, as every 3-manifold has a Heegaard splitting, determined
by a gluing map, which is an element of the mapping class group. One aim of this
project is to show that the volume of the resulting manifold grows linearly with
the length of the random walk. Other goals of this project include attempting to
extend the results for random walks to other counting problems, both in the
mapping class group and in Teichmuller space, and to more general classes of
weakly relatively hyperbolic groups.

The space of all possible shapes a surface may have, called the moduli space of
the surface, is a fundamental object of interest in many parts of mathematics,
and its structure is closely related to its symmetries, which are described by
the mapping class group. These objects have applications in physics, for example
in attempting to build models of quantum gravity in 2+1 dimensions, known as
topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). The moduli spaces of surfaces also
play an important role in certain conformal field theories and string theories.
The study of surfaces and the mapping class group is also useful in the study of
three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are important, as they are spaces
which are locally modelled on the visible dimensions of the universe in which we
live, which has three spatial dimensions, plus one time dimension.
