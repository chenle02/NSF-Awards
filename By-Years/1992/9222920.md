Normal function of the nervous system depends on the proper number of specific
neuron types. This comes about during development through a complicated balance
of cell generation and cell death. This project will investigate various factors
that control these two processes, particularly the role of certain hormones.
This project will result in a better understanding of how the nervous system
develops.***//
