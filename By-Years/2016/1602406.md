PI: Doyle, Patrick S. Proposal Number: 1602406

Very long molecules, like polymers and DNA, can double over themselves and get
entangled in knots. The goal of the proposed research is to study the processes
of creating and relaxing these knots in single DNA molecules. Microfluidic
channels and electric fields will be used to manipulate individual molecules.
Discoveries from the project could impact the design of future instruments used
in genomic analysis.

Knots are among the most ancient human tools used for hoisting of sails,
suturing of wounds, and weaving of clothing. They also naturally occur in very
long polymers such as DNA. The central goal of this project is to develop an
understanding of knot dynamics on single polymer molecules. Single molecule DNA
experiments, computer simulations, and scaling theory will be performed. The
three main objectives of the project are: (1) understand how physical knots on
DNA relax, (2) study how knots on a polymer move when pushed by fields or freely
diffuse, and (3) develop nanofluidic devices to probe processes which couple
knot relaxation and convection. The project will further engage high school
teachers and undergraduates in research opportunities. Materials will be
developed that can be used by grade school teachers to introduce concepts in
knots and topology by linking them to everyday phenomena, such as the entangling
strings and headphone cords.
