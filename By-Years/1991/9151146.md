The Department of Geology and Geography modernizing the existing x-ray
diffraction and fluorescence of a dual goniometer and detector upgrade to
provide instruction in these techniques to upper level geology students in
mineralogy, petrology and geochemistry courses. Additionally, the facilities are
being used by advanced chemistry and physics students enrolled in an
interdisciplinary course designed to provide hands-on experience in powder X-ray
diffraction and fluorescence spectrometry. Students performing undergraduate
research employ they instrument in their investigations of fundamental physical
and chemical principles underlying geological phenomena.
