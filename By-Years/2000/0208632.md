This award supports a pilot Korea-U.S. science and engineering summer camp for
high school students. The camp is organized as a joint effort between the
American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the Korea Science
Foundation, with partial funding for U.S. participation from the Korea-U.S.
Science Cooperation Center and the National Science Foundation. The pilot camp
in July 2002 in Korea will involve 21 American students and 7 adult
supervisors/mentors. This program will provide an opportunity for American
participants to join with Korean students and researchers in a hands-on science,
technology, engineering and mathematics research experience. The outcome will be
early exposure to research experiences, involvement in innovative projects
developed by teams of student participants, learning about the research process
and careers, improved awareness of international scientific and engineering
cooperation, and increased understanding of how research is approached in a
different society/culture.
