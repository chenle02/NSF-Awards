The role of fluids in thrusting continues to be of major concern. This project
will investigate the Blue Ridge Thrust which carries the crystalline Blue Ridge
and Piedmont over shelf sediments in the Southern Appalachians. The work will
involve mapping, kinematic studies and isotopic studies of vein material
associated with the Grandfather Mountain Window, North Carolina. Rock-water
ratios will be estimated along the fault zone and also on other large-scale
vertical alteration zones which cut I-type granites in the Blue Ridge by a
combination of isotopic ratios of C, S, O, H and Sr. This study is a
collaborative effort between workers at Louisiana State University, University
of North Carolina and the University of Wisconsin. Results should provide a test
of several models of overthrusting that involve the presence of fluids.
