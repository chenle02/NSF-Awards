Abstract - Yin - 9403193 Automatic systems widely employed in industry consist
of many interdependent working parts which are individually subject to
malfunction or failure originating from mechanical or physical changes which may
be internal or external to the system. These faults or failures may cause
product degradation, equipment damage, process stoppage or a catastrophe
involving economic loss, environmental damage or the loss of human lives. The
detection, identification and prediction of faults during real time operation of
a dynamic system is also known as a fault detection, diagnosis and isolation
(FDI) process. The aim of this research is the development and study of on-line
FDI techniques. Two detection schemes, an extended statistical approach and a
method based on stochastic approximation and kernel estimation will be studied
for their applicability. The extended statistical approach is an integrated
method of analytical redundancy and an on-line statistical procedure. An input-
output model will be used for residual generation. Both a traditional
probability ratio test and a test based upon a confidence region approach will
be used for decision making. An algorithm based on stochastic approximation and
kernel estimation has been developed and will be employed for fault detection.
This is a Research Planning Grant consisting of computer simulation studies. If
successful, it will be followed by experimental validation of the algorithms
that are developed.
