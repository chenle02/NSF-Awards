The universe contains astrophysical objects that accelerate particles to
energies beyond the reach of any device yet built by humans, but what drives
these accelerators remains a major question in astrophysics. This study uses the
Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) to study very
high energy particle accelerators in our Milky Way Galaxy. The group will
continue to operate and maintain the VERITAS pointing monitors and contribute to
array operations, and lead in the creation of an archive of high-level science
results from VERITAS. The science results will deepen understanding of how
energetic particles are accelerated in our Galaxy. This group has developed a
program to host an undergraduate summer intern from an under-represented
minority (URM) every summer, as a way to increase the participation of URM
students in astrophysics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It had long been thought
that cosmic rays are accelerated in young supernova remnants, but VERITAS
observations unexpectedly showed a lack of the necessary emission at high
energies. Targets for deep observation include gamma-ray sources and other
accelerator candidate objects, which need to be capable of producing cosmic rays
with energies of 10^15 eV, the so-called Pevatrons. The team will also observe a
hard spectrum and extended shell-type supernova remnant recently discovered with
the Fermi observatory, along with other supernova remnants, better to understand
how they could accelerate energetic particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
