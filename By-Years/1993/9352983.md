9352983 Conner The Center for American Archeology (CAA) seeks to initiate a 6-
week, residential, Young Scholars project in Archeology for 34 students entering
grades 10, 11, and 12. The project is based on the principle of research as
education and stresses the multi- disciplinary nature of archeology. Students
will be introduced to all aspects of archeological research, especially to the
role geomorphology, botany, zoology, bio-anthropology, and other disciplines
play in understanding past societies. Other learning experiences include field
trips, laboratory and experimental activities. There will also be lectures and
other classroom activities that explore ethical issues facing modern
archaeologists, career choices, cultural history, and computer applications to
archeology.
