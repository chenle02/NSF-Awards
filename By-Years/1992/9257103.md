Varma This research aims to develop architectures and protocols for highspeed
interconnection within computer systems. Typical applications to be considered
include interconnection of processor subsystems among themselves for
multiprocessor configurations, and the interconnection of processors to I/O
subsystems. The focus is on high-speed crossbar switches as the interconnection
means. The structure of these switches as well as mechanisms for connection
setup, routing, and flow-control across multiple cascaded switches are being
studied. Photonic switch architectures obtained by combining dimensions of
switching, such as wavelength and space, are under investigation.
