The goal of this project is to provide an innovative and creative laboratory
experience for senior undergraduate students. Laboratory courses will be
restructured to provide an introduction to experimental methods in
solid/fluid/thermal sciences including data acquisition/processing, error
analysis, and report writing. A new senior level course will emphasize open-
ended projects and will be directed toward developing problem solving techniques
rather than perfunctory test equipment manipulation. The new equipment includes
a cabinet model X-ray NDI system, a two channel ultrasonic pulser/receiver and a
fast two channel digitizer, a video camera and frame grabber to allow digitizing
experiments with visual outputs, and a desktop computer to control and gather
data. The equipment when coupled with the existing facilities will provide the
opportunity for students to investigate current problems of solid mechanics and
material science.
