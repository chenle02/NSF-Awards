0449452&lt;br/&gt;Wood&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes an integrated research
and education outreach plan in the area of environmental engineering, with a
focus is on the characterization and description of the adhesion and transport
processes affecting bacteria in natural and engineered systems. The proposed
research has the potential to impact a diverse range of areas in engineering
from wastewater polishing for reuse to applications in subsurface
bioremediation. The research is designed specifically to investigate and
describe the multi-scale physical phenomena that affect and control bacterial
adhesion at solid-fluid interfaces, and transport of bacteria in porous media
systems. The work involves both laboratory experiment and the development of new
theory. It is proposed that the most important benefit from the work is the
potential to improve our understanding of the processes involved in the
filtration of microorganisms for improvement of drinking
water&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated education and outreach component of
career development plan involve supporting two graduate students. Matching
departmental funds will also be used. Two specific educational components are
proposed (1) focussed study abroad for graduate and undergraduate students at
the CNRS Institut de Mecanique des Fluides de Toulouse and University Paul
Sabatier, Toulouse, France, and (2) development of a new module on multi-scale
biofilm processes that will be taught as part of the laboratory component of a
senior-level Environmental Engineering Design course. Additional educational and
outreach opportunities such as mentoring underrepresented high-school students
to consider science and engineering as a possible career path, and outreach
activities in science and engineering for students in grades 5-7. &lt;br/&gt;
