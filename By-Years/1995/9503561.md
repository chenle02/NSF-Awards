OCE-9503561 This project will conduct an off-axis geophysical survey out to
about 28 million year old crust on the eastern flank of the Mid- Atlantic Ridge
near 26 degrees north. The survey will cover crust that is conjugate to a
similar, detailed survey that already has been completed on the west flank.
Together, the conjugate data sets will provide a uniquely detailed and long-term
record of ocean crustal structure that will provide fundamental new insights
into the origin, structure, and evolution of slowly spreading ocean crust.
