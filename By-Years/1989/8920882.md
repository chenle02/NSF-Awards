A study will be conducted on the use of DNA gel electrophoresis and related
laboratory techniques, coupled with DNA probe hybridization, and the application
and development of techniques, standards, and instrumentation. The long term
goal and the compelling need for the study is to establish standards for the
application of such recombinant DNA technology to the forensic sciences. Of more
immediate use and general importance for basic science are the automation of the
procedures such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping, the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gel electrophoresis, DNA hybridization, and DNA
sequencing; automation and standardization of these procedures are important for
all genome projects and for biological research in general; in the longer run,
the standards, and the necessary instrumentation that can be used to interpret
results reliably, including the computer analysis of autoradiograms, will not
only benefit biology but also make a rigorous set of techniques available to
forensic science. Support for this study will also be provided by the National
Institutes of Health, the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the Sloan Foundation.
