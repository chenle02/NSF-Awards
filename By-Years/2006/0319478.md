This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a
continuous, rapid- detection water-monitoring device to identify potential
pathogens in water. This device will incorporate immunoassay coupled with
electrochemical detection. The advantages are the speed of detection and the
ability to automate the procedure. This Phase I project will determine the
feasibility of creating a proof-of-concept system to monitor water for the
parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. Cryptosporidium parvum does not respond to
common antibiotics and resists water purification treatments. The objective of
the Phase I project is to show detection time of less than 4 hrs for pathogen
concentrations of the order of 100 organisms per liter without the need for
manual sample concentration steps.

The initial commercial application of this project will be in the monitoring of
drinking water supplies for pathogens. Additional applications would include
testing of water in distribution networks, and at bottling and packaging
facilities. The device could eventually be adapted for emergency field use, for
home use by safety conscious consumers, and for medical, industrial,
recreational and combat purposes.
