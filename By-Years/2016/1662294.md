Operational decision-making in service and manufacturing environments often
requires that decisions respond to real-time changes in available resources and
system characteristics. Because these operating environments are generally quite
complex, capturing the dynamic nature of the system is often very difficult.
This project aims to help the decision maker manage dynamic complexity by
offering a structured approach to the approximation of dynamic decision
problems. The results of this project will advance operational methods in a
variety of domains, including healthcare operations and production and
distribution of goods and services. The project will educate graduate students
engaged in a diverse set of industry-related programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will utilize Stein's method to create novel approximate solution
techniques for stochastic dynamic programing (DP) problems. Stein's method has
recently been used in the context of queueing models to bound the error when
approximating the performance of a queuing system by that of a suitable Brownian
model. This project will extend that approach to the study of controlled Markov
processes, thus moving beyond performance analysis and into optimization. The
research will result in a structured approximation approach that allows for
explicit examination of the optimality gap between the true optimal solution (as
captured by the Bellman equation) and the optimal solution of a Brownian control
problem (as captured by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation). If successful, the
research will lead to computationally efficient approximation methods for DP
problems with explicit guarantees of "near optimality". The research will
advance the mathematical understanding of the relationship between Markov
decision processes and Brownian control problems beyond the context of queueing
