9509698 The project is to coordinate, assemble, adapt, and integrate curricular
components of the GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the
Environment) Project for Phase II of its operation. Modular age-appropriate
curricular units that are integrated with and support GLOBE measurements, as
well as related student materials, are to be developed and classroom-tested. The
concept of the curriculum is to direct students through a progressive
collaborative learning experience so they have both skills and content not only
to gather science-grade data, but to understand the science and meaning of their
findings. Attention is given to adapt curriculum that involves telecollaborative
student investigations so it is readily adapted into a wide range of cultures,
languages, and socio-economic circumstances.
