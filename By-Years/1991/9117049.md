This project presents an analytical and experimental study of the problems
associated with seismic damage mitigation measures for museum art objects. The
proposed research will address the problem of developing design guidelines to
handle the following situations relative to the performance of art objects: 1.
Sliding of rigid systems 2. Rocking of small rigid systems 3. Multiple support
response In view of the difficult analytical aspects of the underlying problems,
newly acquired USC seismic shaking equipment will be used to study the
enumerated problems and develop design charts for use by museum curators,
conservators, or individuals caring for art objects, in establishing sound
seismic damage mitigation measures for art objects under earthquake inputs.
