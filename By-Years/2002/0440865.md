Belowground carbon pools and fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems have received much
attention in global change research. Globally, soils are a significant carbon
pool containing more carbon than the atmosphere. This proposal focuses on two
key processes involving belowground carbon that are still relatively poorly
understood, viz. soil respiration and inorganic carbon transformations.
Uncertainties with regard to these processes originate, in large measure, from
the inability to separate biotic processes (root and microbial respiration) from
abiotic processes (gas transport and CaCO3 transformations) and difficulties in
measuring root respiration rates in situ. These uncertainties will be addressed
by building an artificial root system simulating belowground respiration. In the
proposed project two hypotheses will be tested: 1) short-term increases in soil
respiration after precipitation events are predominantly regulated by surface
microbial processes because changes in soil diffusivity, gas displacement and
root respiration rates are too slow to account for rapid responses as observed
in the field, and 2) CaCO3 precipitation and dissolution are directly dependent
on belowground biological activity and will therefore predominantly occur around
root surfaces. The heart of this proposal is a novel artificial root system,
which will be constructed using perforated tubing connected to a CO2 supply. By
adjusting the flow rate of CO2, the root respiration rates will be fixed and
known Broader impacts of this SGER award include the development of a novel
approach to obtain a better mechanistic understanding of belowground processes
that can be applied to a wide range of questions relevant to terrestrial
ecology. The study complements ongoing research at the Desert Research Institute
and will enhance its research capabilities. The experimental system can act as
an important tool for teaching students fundamentals of gas transport in
heterogeneous environments and help students understand the interaction between
biological and physical processes. One graduate student will be supported to
work on this project.
