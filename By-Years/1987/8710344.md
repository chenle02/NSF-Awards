The research deals with heat transfer in tissue of the extremeties of low-
weight newborn. The mechanisms responsible for thermoregulatory problems found
in the premature infant are investigated. The research is pursued in two parts.
The first part entails the understanding of heat transfer in tissues. The second
portion entails the study of cardiovascular morphology. This project is one
supported under the Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
