A computer program was developed for multiparticle size fluidization, and some
experimental data on segregation were also already obtained using x-ray and
x-ray densitometers. One of the objectives of the study is to apply the single-
size hydrodynamic model of fluidization to predict the shapes and sizes of
bubbles in large-scale, fluid-bed reactors; in reactors under a high pressure;
and in fluid-bed combustors containing tubes. A second objective is to complete
the development of a hydrodynamic model for three-phase fluidization with an
application to bioreactors. These objectives will be accomplished by making
calculations on a supercomputer with several models by comparing the
computations to literature data and to several fundamental experiments. Whenever
possible, computer-generated movies will be compared to movies of experiments.
