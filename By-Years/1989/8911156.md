This research project is to investigate the extent to which characteristics of
the infant, mother and environment are differentially related to attachment and
development in infants in Black American families. The specific aims of the
proposed project are to collect data on two groups of Black American infants
(one high risk and one normative) and their mothers to: 1) examine the quality
of the infant's attachment relationships to mother at 12 and 18 months 2)
delineate sociocultural and environmental factors in the mother- child
relationship that might influence the quality and stability of infant attachment
3) gather information on other child developmental outcomes through age two.
During the planning period, the PI will: strengthen her capability to plan a
proposed research project and prepare a proposal for submission to the MRI
program, facilitate a preliminary study in the area of the proposed project, and
facilitate other activities related to planning the proposed research and
preparing the proposal.
