This award from the Chemistry Education Program supports the continuation of a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at California State
University-Los Angeles. Scott Nickolaisen is the site's Program Director.
Fifteen faculty with a variety of research interests will serve as REU student
mentors. Over the award period (2004-2007), ten students will be supported each
summer in a ten-week program of guided independent research. The focus of
recruitment efforts will be on the very high concentration of minority students
enrolled in regional public community colleges in the Los Angeles area. These
students will have had very little, if any, exposure to a comprehensive research
experience. The areas of chemical research include inorganic and organic
synthesis, electron spin resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and
laser spectroscopy, enzyme kinetics, plant genetics, electrochemistry,
organometallic photochemistry, protein assays, mass spectrometry, atmospheric
chemistry, lipid biochemistry, environmetal analysis and capillary
electrophoresis. At the conclusion of the program, student participants will
present their results to the department in a poster presentation and will
prepare a short written report of their research project. Following the program,
students will be tracked to evaluate their professional development.
