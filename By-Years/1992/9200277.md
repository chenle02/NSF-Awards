The project is the second phase in the development and testing of an instrument
based on acoustic wave propagation to measure, in real- time, the depth of
scouring around bridge foundations. The measurements gathered allow the use of
available data processing technology for signal enhancement which permits
detection of scouring over a broad range of signal-to- noise conditions. These
conditions include measurement during flood stages in a river. The instrument is
rugged, computer controlled to operate unattended, and programmed to analyze the
data for the detection of unusual scouring and alerting a central office of
possible hazardous conditions. The benefits from this work is to acquire the
capacity for detecting in real-time scouring around bridge foundations and
prevent accidents from bridge collapse; and to provide prior notice of dangerous
conditions to enable timely repairs.
