ATM-9701950 Minghua Zhang SUNY-Stony Brook Title: Developing Data Products from
Field Experiments to Interface with Physical Parameterizations in GCMs. An
innovative approach will be used in this proposal to develop, from four field
experimental data sets, data that can be used to evaluate GCM physical
parametrization in stand alone mode. The data include grid-scale vertical
velocity and adjective tendencies that are required to force (or drive) GCM
parameterizations in stand alone mode. This approach has the potential to meet
the accuracy requirements for the generated data to be used for such testing. An
educational component to develop several short and quantitative courses for
undergraduate students is also include in the proposal.
