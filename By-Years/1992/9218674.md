This is a project to combine laboratory experiments and numerical calculations
to investigate the dynamical interaction of melts and solids in the Earth's core
and mantle. The PI will carry out laboratory experiments on thermochemical
convection with crystallization in a rotating, electrically conducting fluid
with a co-rotating toroidal magnetic field, and apply the results to dynamics in
the Earth's core. These experiments will exploit the unique properties of
gallium alloys as laboratory fluids for modeling melt-solid interactions in the
core.
