9360093 Peterson This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop software that enables a researcher to develop and document a social
data set. The software will ease development by automating those tasks that can
best be done by computer. It will improve instrumentation and documentation by
providing a structure and format that are complete and of high quality. It will
also eliminate much of the post-data-collection effort of documenting a data set
for public use. The proposed software program would be a significant resource
for social scientists. It would provide a tool to assist the researcher with
several steps in the research process, including data set development,
documentation, cleaning, and analysis file creation. Furthermore, it would
integrate all these steps in one program and provide a link to the archiving
task for those data sets that are to be placed in the public domain. Successful
completion of this research will lay the groundwork for highly useful computer
software tools of value not only to social scientists but also to market
researchers, government statistical agencies, and others in applied fields that
employ social data. ***
