The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), an NSA/DHS Center for Excellence in
Education and Research, is creating a capacity building program in assured cloud
computing. This project leverages the 2010 NSF Scholarship for Service (SFS)
award, which is developing strong educational, research and system building
activities in information assurance (IA). UTD offers courses at both the
graduate and undergraduate levels in IA. This project is developing courses in
assured cloud computing as well as enhancing existing courses on Systems
Security, Network Security, Data and Applications Security, Data Mining for
Security Applications and Digital Forensics through the introduction of a major
component in cloud computing for each of these courses. The project is also
enhancing the current secure cloud computing framework so that students can use
this framework for their course projects and build features for the framework as
part of their class programming projects. The courses are available to members
of the academic, government and industrial communities. UTD has strong
relationships with minority groups through education grants from agencies such
as NSF (GK-12) and the Department of Education (GAANN). The project is actively
recruiting students from underrepresented groups to participate in courses and
activities in assured cloud computing. As part of the project, the PIs are
teaching cyber security courses at a Texas minority-serving institution.
