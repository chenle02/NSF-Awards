Previous research suggests that the pattern of breast feeding, as opposed to
breast feeding per se, is the primary variable associated with differences in
the length of lactational subfecundity. This has not yet been clearly
established on a longitudinal basis, however, in a naturally fertile population.
The research proposed her will investigate the relationship between lactating
pattern and ovarian suppression, and will be the first prospective study in a
naturally fertile population that uses direct observations of lactating activity
combined with hormonal correlations of ovarian activity. Ovarian activity will
be assessed using the non-invasive technique of radioimmunoassay of salivary
hormones. Thus, this study stands to make a significant contribution to our
understanding of the relationship between breast feeding patterns and fecundity,
and the role of lactation in mediating birth intervals.
