thesis research was in the area of yeast cell biology. He will carry out his
postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Jean-David Rochaix at
University of Geneva in Switzerland. The proposed research is entitled
"Generation and characterization of photosystem I mutants impaired in energy
transfer and electron transport". The postdoctoral experience will expand his
scientific expertise to plant biology and will contribute to his growth as a
member of the world-wide plant biology community.
