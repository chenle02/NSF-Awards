Support for Student Programs at the 2008 Society of Engineering Science Annual
Technical Meeting

The program will support a student presentation competition at the 45th Annual
Society of Engineering Science Annual Technical Meeting, to be held at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on October 12th-15th, 2008. The
Society of Engineering Science (SES) Annual Technical Meeting is one of the
premier annual venues for exchange of research ideas in the field of engineering
science and mechanics in the US. The presentation competition will bring
together dozens of top graduate students in the areas of solid mechanics, fluid
mechanics, bioengineering, applied mathematics, and other areas related to
engineering science. Students will deliver oral presentations on their research
projects in regular conference symposia, and will compete with each other for
prizes to be awarded at the conference banquet. National Science Foundation
support will subsidize reduced student registration fees for the conference in
order to encourage participation in the presentation competition, and it will
pay travel expenses for students selected among a prestigious group of
finalists.

The support will have significant impact by encouraging broad participation
among students in the activities of the Society of Engineering Science. This
will serve individual students by providing an opportunity to present their work
at a major professional conference, and it will help to generate interest and
participation among new members of the Society, which ultimately serves the
broader technical community of researchers in engineering science and mechanics.
