Over three years, Science Central is producing 624 television segments that will
present current, ongoing research through local newscasts on ABC and NBC
stations nationwide. In addition to the regular research segments, ScienCentral
will produce six "sweeps" series per year focusing on important new fields of
research including: nanotechnology, genetics/genomics, ocean science, global
climate change and brain sciences. An advisory board of scientists, teachers,
science journalists and public information officers help inform the producers
about individual stories and evolving fields of research, and they provide
access to scientists and field research. They also provide scientific input and
check the stories for accuracy.

To facilitate production and to assure that research is covered on an
international basis, ScienCentral will establish a footage consortium to
exchange science news video with major Canadian and European newscasters. They
also will provide the news stories to science centers for use in their
interactive exhibits and web sites.
