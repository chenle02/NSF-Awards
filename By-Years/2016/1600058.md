Power systems are changing with the rapid deployment of remote sensing devices
such as Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) and integration of more capable
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. PMU measurements,
generated every second, are used by power system operators to make critical
decisions. With more utilities adopting PMUs for real-time system monitoring,
power systems are exposed to more cyber-threats targeting these
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates means to determine the
impacts of data intrusion on PMU devices, and will propose mitigation
strategies. The outcomes will identify cyber-attacks that can result in
cascading blackouts as well as the most critical components of power systems
that are likely to be targeted by cyber threats. This multidisciplinary research
will focus on three fundamental goals: (1) Quantifying the impact and severity
of false data injection; (2) Detection of anomalies; and (3) Mitigation of the
impacts. The project delineates differences between trivial and critical data
manipulations and evinces the need to protect some measurements more than
others. The project will systematically identify the most critical power system
measurements that are best candidates for additional
protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings of this research will establish
the foundations for protecting the most critical assets in power grids. As part
of the broader impacts of this research, a diverse group of graduate and
undergraduate students, especially women and underrepresented students can be
trained in smart grid protection and planning. Mitigation methods proposed in
this research can be extended to other complex networks and the proposed methods
for identifying most critical components can be employed in other industries.
