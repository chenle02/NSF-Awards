The Sociology Department is equipping a microcomputer laboratory that allows
entry-level students to be introduced to quantitative analysis of sociological
data. The equipment makes possible hands-on experience in analyzing existing
survey data from the National Opinion Research Center (Illinois) and the Survey
Research Center (Michigan), and allows students to do statistical analyses of
data from their own research projects. The instrumentation expands the
laboratory from eight computers, available for majors only, to a larger facility
that allows all students to be exposed to : 1. in-class demonstrations of data
manipulation and analysis; 2. assignments based on the anlaysis of survey data,
and 3. assigned laboratory periods where students work under direct faculty
supervision. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
