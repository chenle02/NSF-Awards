This project will improve the ability of the seafloor compliance method to
determine the two- and three-dimensional structure of oceanic crust, and to
better understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of compliance and
seismic refraction techniques. Three-dimensional numerical codes currently used
to model seismic wave propagation will be modified to model seafloor compliance
thus allowing seismic and compliance for the same model.&lt;br/&gt;
