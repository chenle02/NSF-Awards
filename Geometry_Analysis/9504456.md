Simon 9504456 Two related topics of research are proposed: singularities of
energy minimizing maps and curvature flows. Simon pioneered analytic techniques
for studying the top-dimensional singular set of an energy minimizing map, for
which he recently won the Bocher prize. In addition to continuing this research
- which could lead to a resolution of the important conjecture asserting that
minimizers of energy are stratified manifolds - several problems on curvature
flows are proposed. Proposed curvature flow problems model a wide range of
phenomena, such as the dynamics of soap films, immiscible fluids and crystal
growth, and lie in the area of nonlinear parabolic partial differential
equations.
