Working memory, a critical cognitive function, is a strong predictor of
academic, professional, and overall life achievement. Individuals differ greatly
in their working memory abilities and such variation could be due to conditions
that tax the working memory system, such as stress. Research examining the
influence of stress on cognition through the presentation of negative feedback,
however, has yielded conflicting results. With the help of Dr. Qiong Zhang at
Zhejiang University, the current proposal examines how individual differences
such as appraisal of negative feedback mediate the relationship between stress
and working memory function.

The project examines how one?s appraisal of feedback influences their
performance. Individual differences in response to feedback could be rooted in
the stress perception. Fundamental to the perspective of psychological stress is
the perception and evaluation of potential harm posed by the stressor. Thus,
psychological stress is solely determined by the persons? interpretations of the
situation and not by objective appraisal of the environmental experiences. In
the proposed study, subjects will be assigned to one of two conditions where
they will be given positive or negative fictitious feedback on the working
memory task irrespective of their actual performance. The influences of this
feedback on working memory performance will be examined by assessing individual
variables that may predict whether a stressor is perceived as a threat or a
challenge. Amongst others, one such variable could be cultural background as
previous research has indicated differences between East Asian and Western
cultures in response to feedback. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of
a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry
of Science and Technology.
