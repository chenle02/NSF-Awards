This grant supports research which will treat several aspects of the physics of
rapidly rotating nuclei in the mass 80 region. Spectroscopic studies will
determine the properties of rotational bands which are rapidly changing as a
function of Z and N. Measurements of moments of inertia, electromagnetic
transition rates, spin alignment, and signature splitting and inversion will be
compared with theoretical models of the structure of nuclei near A=80. A search
for electric monopole transitions will be made for heavier, superdeformed,
nuclei as well as for nuclei near A=80. In addition, octupole deformation
effects will be studied in the actinide region.
