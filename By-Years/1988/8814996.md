This research examines the structure of large angle grain boundaries using the
X-ray diffraction facility at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Atomic
structure of grain boundaries is determined based on the X-ray diffraction
results and modeling. The research includes a study of impurity segregation to
twist boundaries and the thermal properties of grain boundaries. The program
provides important, high quality data needed for accurate models of grain
boundaries and gives fundamental knowledge concerning grain boundary structure
shifts due to composition or temperature changes.
