This project will design and implement "Myrmex", a novel crowdsourcing system
for physical-world tasks. For example, an elderly community member could use
Myrmex for help getting mail from a remote post office, as the system would
assign the task to a participant who routinely passes that way. Myrmex leverages
the capacity of computers (monitoring, matching participants to tasks) to
facilitate human activity (assigning and performing tasks). The project will: 1)
develop new privacy-preserving methods for location and context tracking; 2)
design and implement incentives for continuous use of a new social system; and
3) create and implement models of best times and places to notify and offer
tasks for participants.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The Myrmex system
will help strengthen bonds and connectivity within a community and provide
assistance for community members for running their daily lives. Matching tasks
and people based on locations and paths will also help conserve resources and
benefit the environment due to the reduced travel miles needed to perform a
task. The project will provide multidisciplinary training for undergraduate and
graduate students. It will also provide the research community with an
anonymized dataset of human mobility patterns and task activities, and tools to
analyze human behavior.
