The synthesis of a wide variety of liquid crystalline materials needed to test
theoretical concepts, study physical properties, and for use in liquid crystal
displays is proposed. New ideas have been generated by results from the current
NSF grant, and in some areas additional work is needed to complete research in
progress. Thus, investigation of the following specific problems is proposed:
The design of new chiral materials for displays (stable cholesteric,
ferroelectric, and chiral polymers) and to test theoretical concepts, continued
molecular modifications to search for additional materials showing hexatic
phases of smectics B, F, and I and their chiral counterparts; synthesis of
materials with wide range nematic phases above a smectic A phase for phase
transition studies; preparation of deuterated materials to study phase
separation in nematic phases by DMR; continued synthesis of new polymeric
materials for phase transition studies and for use in polymer dispersed droplets
and preparation of new materials having lyotropic and thermotropic nematic
phases which are of both theoretical and practical interest. This effort will
provide both known and new liquid crystalline materials for physical studies by
not only researchers at the Liquid Crystal Institute but throughout the world.
It requires extensive cooperation between both chemists and physicists and will
thus encourage the exchange of ideas and modifications in research goals as new
information is produced.
