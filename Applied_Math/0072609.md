The aim of this work is to understand significant aspects of wave phenomena
through developing and applying the methods of nonlinear dynamics --- the
mathematics of systems that change in time and space. A main goal is to explain
the robustness or stability of solitons, an important class of waves which
exhibit particle-like properties and are capable of a remarkably deep and
explicit mathematical description. The mathematics of wave dynamics is also
unexpectedly important for prograss concerning a fundamental problem in
materials science. To understand how an alloy's microscopic structure coarsens
in time, the investigator is developing a new mathematical understanding of
wave-like transport for singular mass distributions.

This work seeks to explain mathematically a number of poorly understood
characteristics of waves of various kinds, surface waves on fluids being a prime
example. Such characteristics include: the extraordinary stability of solitons
(waves that persist in isolation); the tsunami-like qualities of wakes produced
in certain conditions by modern fast car ferries; and the nature of the powerful
forces created when waves focus and break simultaneously. The common thread that
runs through these investigations is the effective understanding of physical
phenomena through the development of new mathematical methods for analyzing
dynamic change.
