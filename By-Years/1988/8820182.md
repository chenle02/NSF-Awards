Two-dimensional hydrodynamics will be created experimentally with moving liquid
film. The film will be laterally contained between guide wires which can be
formed into a variety of shapes. Various two-dimensional flow fields in the
plane of the film will be determined by LDV diagnostics. They will include
occurrence of flow instabilities, separation, vortex wakes, and turbulence. In
addition, the dynamics of the moving film will be explored for potential
application in film coating and other thin film industrial applications. //
