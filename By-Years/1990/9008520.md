The principal investigator will continue his important studies of three major
areas of nonlinear wave theory: nonlinear dispersive waves, focussing of weak
shock waves at caustics and catastrophic instabilities in square-wave
detonations. The methods of study involve the use of analytic and asymptotic
techniques supplemented with numerical analysis. Such a combined approach is
called for because the phenomena under study occur at the boundaries of existing
theories. Many phenomena in nature cannot be described adequately with linear
models; nature is inherently "nonlinear". The proposed research involves the
study of wave motions that are described by nonlinear differential equations. A
good example is the "breaking" of an ocean wave as it approaches the beach. In
order to describe the behavior of such a nonlinear wave the principal
investigator will use asymptotic analysis in concert with numerical analysis to
obtain qualitative and quantitative information.
