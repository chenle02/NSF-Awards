The funded research will investigate the inner structures of Active Galactic
Nucleii (AGN) by analyzing and modeling measurements of the polarization of the
optical emission lines and continuum in large samples of Seyfert galaxies and
their more luminous counterparts, radio-quiet quasars. The work will address the
following problems in current AGN research: 1) the structure of the broad-
emission line region; 2) the geometry and kinematics of the scattering gas flows
around the accretion disk; and 3) the dependence of these structures on
fundamental parameters such as black hole mass and accretion
rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include training of
undergraduates and a postdoc, dissemination via web pages, and a structured
series of research experiences for local high school students.
