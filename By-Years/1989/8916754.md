Accurately determined pressure-volume-temperature (P-V-T) equations of state of
mantle and core materials form critical input for models of the Earth's
interior. A systematic study of the equations of state of mantle (SiO2-MgO-
CaO-A12O3) and core (Fe-Ni-O-H) materials at high pressures and temperatures.
P-V-T measurements will be carried out using single-crystal x-ray diffraction
methods above 20 GPa, and energy dispersive diffraction methods for 20 GPa,
monochromatic high-resolution x-ray diffraction techniques for polycrystalline
samples to 150 GPa, and energy dispersive diffraction methods for measurements
to higher (core) pressures. Samples will be heated with an external resistance
furnace to well controlled temperatures up to 900 K to measure thermal expansion
at high pressures.
