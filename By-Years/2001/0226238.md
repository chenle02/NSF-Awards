This Collections project is aggregating educational materials associated with
the 220 late 19th-century model machine elements designed for research and
teaching by the founder of modern kinematics, Franz Reuleaux (1829-1905).
Resources of the collection include still and navigable moving images of these
kinematic teaching models; systematic descriptions, and historical and
contemporary documents related to the collection of the mechanisms; computer
simulations of mathematical relationships associated with the movements of the
mechanisms, and sample teaching modules that employ the models and simulations
in the classroom at the undergraduate, secondary and middle school levels. The
use of physical models in teaching mathematics, science, and engineering is
recognized as an important component of visual thinking, and as essential to the
cognitive foundations of mathematical activity and in the transition to an
algebraic description of functions. This project illustrates the fruitful
marriage of museum quality physical artifacts with the potential of digital
media, and enables a much broader audience to access the benefits of using the
physical models than only those who can physically visit the
resources.&lt;br/&gt;
