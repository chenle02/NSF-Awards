This project addresses current issues of interest concerning the structure of
the Universe. The investigator and his students will focus on the study of
matter in compact stars, as natural laboratories that provide extreme densities
and strong magnetic fields. One of the important components of the project
concerns the training of graduate and undergraduate students by involving them
into a modern research program in theoretical nuclear physics. The students are
expected to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills that will be
applied in their future careers in industry or academia. The integration of the
principle investigator's research with education at the Arizona State University
with a substantial enrollment of underrepresented groups of students will
contribute to a high-quality education in science and engineering, as well as to
the development of human resources in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will apply quantum field theoretical methods to study fundamental
properties of relativistic matter in magnetic fields. The corresponding
relativistic types of matter with strong magnetic fields are relevant for the
phenomenology of compact stars, the evolution of the Early Universe, and the
physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. Therefore, the project will add to
a deeper understanding of numerous phenomena in the natural world and will
expand the knowledge about the phases of strongly interacting matter and their
role in the cosmos. The theoretical methods and research outcomes of this
project will also extend beyond the realm of theoretical nuclear physics. In
particular, the results of these studies will be useful in the context of quasi-
relativistic condensed matter materials, which hold a great promise for future
applications.
