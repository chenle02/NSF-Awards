Undisturbed peatland ecosystems are believed to represent a net sink for
atmospheric carbon (C). This research focuses on C balance in western Canadian
peatlands of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, a region where disturbances,
especially fire, diminish the regional C sink strength. In addition to direct C
losses via combustion, peatlands continue to release C after fire, as peat
decomposition continues with greatly diminished post-fire net primary production
of vegetation. The investigators will examine the effects of wildfire on the C
balance of peatlands across western Canada. The research is structured around
three questions: how do post-fire C fluxes vary spatially and temporally across
western Canadian peatlands; to what extent is regional variation in post-fire
C-balance recovery attributable to variation in post-fire plant successional
pathways; and to what extent is regional variation in post-fire C-balance
recovery attributable to variation in post-fire plant nutrient and moisture
conditions in the burned peat substrate?
