In this project, the principal investigator and his collaborators propose to
develop new methods and techniques that will provide a better understanding of
the qualitative behavior of solutions of dispersive models. These models
describe relevant physical phenomena, including several arising in fluid
mechanics and in wave propagation. In a multidisciplinary approach, these
innovative methods will improve the design of efficient numerical tools in the
study of some outstanding problems in fluids dynamics. Also, they will establish
new parameters in the modeling and simulation for these types of systems.

To achieve the aforementioned goals, the principal investigator and the
project's other participants will continue the development of powerful analytic
techniques mainly coming from harmonic analysis. While the new approaches will
be focused in concrete nonlinear problems, their applicability will be broad.
This is of potential interest to researchers in other disciplines. The principal
investigator will disseminate his results as widely as possible through
expositions at professional meetings and electronic publications. Research and
education will be vigorously integrated with special efforts to promote and
broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, with the active
participation of undergraduates, with innovative pedagogical initiatives and
modes of collaboration.
