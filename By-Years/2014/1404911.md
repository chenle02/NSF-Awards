Containers are ubiquitous in everyday life with uses including the preservation
of foods and beverages and to protect products against damage. Molecules need
containers for the same reasons. For example, molecular containers are currently
used in everyday life to formulate insoluble drugs. The research group of
Professor Lyle Isaacs at the University of Maryland, College Park studies the
preparation and application of a new advanced class of molecular containers
called cucurbiturils. The work has the potential to impact both academic and
industrial science by providing a series of container compounds bearing reactive
functional groups that allow their incorporation into advanced functional
systems for real world applications. Additional broader impacts of the research
include education and training of undergraduate and graduate students as
interdisciplinary scientists, which is accomplished in part through
international collaborations and by the development of a series of videos to
attract students to molecular container chemistry via a flipped classroom
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of
Professor Isaacs, which focuses on the development of the synthetic and
supramolecular chemistry of the cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) family of molecular
container compounds. The work aims to understand the anomalously tight binding
CB[7]-diamantane(NMe3)2 complex via the synthesis and Ka determination of
structural analogues. These tight binding CB[n]-guest pairs can be used in
concert with monofunctionalized CB[n] derivatives prepared by the the Isaacs
group to enable new application areas including those that currently benefit
from biotin-avidin technology like bioassays. Finally, the work addresses the
scope and nature of selective interactions between acyclic CB[n] containers and
peptides and proteins.
