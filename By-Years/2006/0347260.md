CAREER: A Framework for Dynamic Self-Tuning of General Purpose Programs

Abstract

As computing systems become more complicated, they are exposing an increasingly
large number of "knobs" that can be used for tuning. These knobs typically
represent a trade-off (e.g., size vs. speed of a local data storage resource)
and thus must be set differently for different workloads to achieve optimal
performance (or power-performance). While many such knobs have been proposed,
there has been little work towards a comprehensive approach to set these knobs
automatically. The proposed research is meant to help fill this gap.

Specifically, this work proposes a dynamic self-tuning framework for optimizing
the compilation of general-purpose programs. The proposed framework draws
inspiration from the successes in empirical optimization frameworks like ATLAS,
applying their ideas to a new context where optimization cannot be done at
install time. By performing the tuning at run time, code can be optimized for
specific input data (a necessity for non-numeric programs), but introduces
challenges in maintaining low overhead and good performance in the presence on
non-stationary workloads.
