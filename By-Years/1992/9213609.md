CEDAR is a 3-phased aeronomy initiative that is recognized within both national
and international communities. Since the fundamental concept of the program
involves collaborative and community-wide use of resources as well as multi-
institution campaigns and science analysis activities, there is a clear need for
coordination. The basic role of the CEDAR Science Steering Committee (CEDAR-SSC)
is to provide for coordination and information transfer throughout the U.S.
aeronomy community as well as in the international realm. CEDAR is currently in
Phase II of the program, durieng which time there will be extensive funded
science campaign activities as well as activities involving instrument and
facility development and upgrades. Members of the steering committee are
selected by the NSF Program Directors for the Aeronomy and Upper Atmospheric
Facilities sections of the Atmospheric Sciences Directorate in consultation with
the current SSC members. During the next two years, the committee will meet
regularly to discuss the various issues involving campaign organization,
instrument operation, the program for the annual CEDAR summer workshop,
promotion of CEDAR in the national and international sphere, facility operation,
and science symposia planning.
