The investigators continue their work on graph drawing and crossing numbers,
random graph models, phylogeny reconstruction, and on fundamental questions of
extremal set and graph theory and discrete geometry. In particular, they will
focus on Turan's hypergraph problem, on novel applications of the lopsided
Lovasz Local Lemma, on Sperner type and extremal poset problems. They will use
combinatorial and probabilistic techniques in phylogenetics and in the theory of
complex network.

Scientific and engineering breakthroughs in many fields have spurred the
development of new theory and algorithms for discrete structures. There is
increasing demand to understand "optimal" extreme structures and "typical"
random structures in discrete mathematics. This project will investigate basic
combinatorial questions about structures and will look for various applications
of discrete mathematics in computer science, biology, and engineering.
