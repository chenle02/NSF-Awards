A reduction in the use of chemical pesticides would have desirable human health
as well as environmental benefits. Consequently, the U.S. Forest Service,
Pacific Northwest Region, has adopted a pest management policy which would give
preference to non-chemical pest control measures. Unfortunately, since reliable,
non-chemical control measures are not available for fungal root diseases of
conifers, chemicals must still be used. Newly developed technologies are
available for obtaining effective environmentally safe strains of microorganisms
which will protect plants from root disease. New methods for coating seeds with
these beneficial organisms have also been developed. These technologies have not
been applied to forest nurseries. Research will be conducted on the use of new
protoplast fusion progeny of Trichoderma and new seed coating technologies in
biological disease control systems in forest nurseries. Co- inoculation with
selected strains of ectomycorrhizal fungi, Laccaria and Rhizopogon, will also be
performed. The test system will be for control of damping-off and root rot
diseases of Douglas-fir caused by Pythium, Fusarium, Phytophthora, and
Cylindrocarpon. The anticipated outcome will be a new seed coating product
available to federal, State and private forest nurseries for biological disease
control of fungal root diseases of conifers. Such systems could also be adapted
for food crops as well as horticultural and ornamental industries. The localized
nature of biocontrol needs for each type of crop could stimulate the development
of small biotechnology companies.
