An investigation of the structure and properties of calcium aluminate glasses
and glass films prepared by unconventional methods is proposed. Calcium
aluminate glasses are of scientific interest because of the changes of their
structural characteristics as a function of calcium concentration. Therefore, it
is proposed to study the feasibility of preparing a wide compositional range of
calcium aluminate glasses by sol-gel and sputtering processes and to asses the
behavior and properties of these materials as a function of various processing
steps. Due to their mid-infrared transparency calcium aluminates have an
important technological potential as low loss optical fiber materials.
