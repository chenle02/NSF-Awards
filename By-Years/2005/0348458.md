John A. Morgan&lt;br/&gt;BES-0348458&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of
industrial chemicals are currently synthesized from fossil fuels, which are a
rapidly depleting and non-renewable resource. Photosynthetic organisms have the
potential to biosynthesize these chemicals through the fixation of CO2 with
energy obtained from sunlight. Currently, the transformation of CO2 into
valuable chemicals is inefficient as a result of the competition for central
metabolic precursors. To improve production, the metabolic pathways can be
manipulated by genetic methods. However, a rationale for selecting genes to
alter is lacking, which stems from the poor understanding of the influence of
genetic and environmental interactions on the rates of metabolic conversions.
Therefore, a technique that analyzes metabolic fluxes under various conditions
is needed. The objective of this project is to develop a novel mathematical tool
and mass spectrometry methods to quantify metabolic fluxes in unicellular
photosynthetic organisms. Based upon results from this work, it may be possible
to engineer plant metabolic pathways for the more efficient production of food,
feed and medicinal metabolites in the future. The primary educational objective
is to integrate metabolic and cellular engineering principles and methodologies
into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. As a result of this educational
plan, a diverse group of students will be able to think critically about methods
to produce chemicals from renewable resources, one of the key future problems
facing society.&lt;br/&gt;
