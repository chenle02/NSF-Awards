This project is a two-year effort to develop a physically realistic ice-flow
model of the flow band passing through ice stream B, West Antarctica. The model
will explicitly treat water and till as well as ice. Earlier models do not
consider the unconsolidated bed that exists beneath ice stream B or water
balance. The proposed model will represent a significant advance in the field.
Seismic data to be collected by investigators from the University of Wisconsin
during 1987-88 will be used to test the model. The model then will be used to
assess the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet in light of possible
anthropogenic climatic changes, and to test possible scenarios for deposition of
sediments in the Ross Embayment.
