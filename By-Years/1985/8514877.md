The term "web" is used to describe materials that are manufactured and processed
in continuous flexible, strip form, i.e., from extremely thin plastics to paper,
textiles, metals, and composites. Web processing effects almost every industry
in some way. As web materials, processes, and products become more
sophisticated, their problems become greater and more costly. Industry is
recognizing that a cost effective approach to research that addresses these
problems is through an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Web
Handling. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Web Handling is
initiated at Oklahoma State University. Research areas to be addressed are as
follows: lateral dynamics of moving webs, longitudinal dynamics of moving webs,
winding and unwinding of webs, wrinkling in moving webs, on-line control of
lateral and longitudinal dynamics, and on-line measurement of web physical
properties.
