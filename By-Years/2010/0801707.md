Demand for fuel is increasing, while petroleum production levels are near their
peak and there is a growing awareness of the problem of greenhouse gas
generation. Alternative, renewable, and sustainable energy sources will be
needed to meet future energy demands. Biofuels, produced from plant-based
materials, are an attractive option. However, the biofuels industry must be
developed in an integrated manner so that the goals of economic, environmental,
and sociological sustainability are achieved. This will require a new generation
of scientists and engineers who understand the entire spectrum of biorefining
technology and also appreciate the ecological, economic, and social impacts of
their technological decisions. Similarly, economists with exposure to the
technological aspects of the biorefining industry will be better poised to
develop accurate policies. Such interdisciplinary training does not currently
exist. This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award
supports the development of the Integrated Graduate Education in Biorefining and
Biofuels program, which will prepare PhD graduates to have a comprehensive
perspective on the biofuels industry. Four focus areas define this integrated
and comprehensive training: crop sciences and plant biotechnology; biomass
conversions; product engineering; and economic and environmental assessment.
This program incorporates cross-disciplinary teamwork, coursework in multiple
disciplines, and research projects that span focus areas. The program will work
to increase the numbers underrepresented students receiving doctoral degrees in
science, technology, and engineering, and will include a collaboration with
Colorado State-Pueblo. Graduates of this IGERT program will be uniquely prepared
to have high-impact careers and to contribute to the biofuels industry. IGERT is
an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D.
scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge
in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills
needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze
a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models
for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative
research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
