White dwarfs are the end product of stellar evolution for stars of mass similar
to the Sun. Old white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres have photospheres with
high densities and low temperatures. The dominant sources of opacity determining
their spectral appearance are the negative hydrogen ion, collision induced
absorption of the hydrogen molecule, and Rayleigh scattering of hydrogen atoms
and molecules. The greatest source of uncertainty in the theoretical prediction
of the colors of these white dwarfs is the opacity of the negative hydrogen ion
at high density. This opacity has not previously been calculated accurately for
matter densities greater then 0.001 grams per cubic centimeter, a regime in
which neighboring particles perturb the ion's bound state structure. This
project is a study of how collisions modify the properties of the negative
hydrogen bound state, including its binding energy, its partition function, its
thermodynamic abundance, and its bound-free and free-free cross sections. The
project director will calculate the opacity of this ion at high densities.

Broader Impact. The research program will educate and train individuals in the
application of basic physics to complex problems. The participants include
students just starting a career in science, as well as individuals with more
experience who will extend their skills to new areas. The training will
contribute to the development of a proficient, scientifically informed group of
individuals of general utility to a technologically advanced society. In an
outreach program for levels K-12, the project director will partner with two
science museums (the Science Center and the Museum of the Earth) and present
interactive discussions on the topic of our modern scientific understanding of
the basic observable features (size, brightness, color) of the Sun and other
stars. A direct connection will be made between relevant fundamental
microphysical processes (nuclear, atomic and molecular, including those that are
the subject of the research program) and the observable properties of the Sun.
