This proposal centers on determining precision tests of the Standard Model of
particle physics and new physics beyond the Standard Model at present and future
collider facilities. The focus will be on probes for understanding for electro
weak symmetry breaking which generates the mass for the W and Z bosons as well
as for the quarks. The PI proposes to understand the effects of final state
interactions on the measurement of the coupling between the top quark-bottom
quark and the W boson. He intends to carry out higher order calculations in QCD
in order to predict the transverse momentum distribution for the Higgs particle.
Predictions will be made for the pair production of W and Z Bosons at LHC in the
standard model that can be compared with exotic production mechanisms due to
extra dimensions. The PI also intends to investigate the effect of neutrino
masses on the phenomenology of Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model.
