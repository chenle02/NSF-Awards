New computing applications require dramatic increases in the energy efficiency
of processors. These applications include personal health monitoring with
wearable body sensors and data processing onboard tiny robotic rescue
helicopters. Energy efficiency allows such applications to run on small
batteries, thus achieving the necessary small form factor. Until recently,
energy efficiency was achieved by shrinking transistors. While the Moore's Law
still keeps shrinking transistors, the smaller transistors are no longer
significantly more energy efficient than large ones. As a result, the quest for
energy efficiency has shifted from transistor fabrication to designing software
and hardware that work well together. Among key questions is how minimalistic
can hardware be without affecting the productivity of programming that hardware.
Minimalistic hardware would not burn energy on tasks that support
programmability, so investigating how to compile programs for minimalistic
hardware is of increased interest.

Traditionally, hardware complexity has been hidden under a programming model and
a compiler. The less heroic the compiler, the more likely was the technology to
succeed (c.f., CUDA's widespread adoption). Unfortunately, a simple compiler
breaks down on hardware without programmability features such as caches. This
proposal investigates extending the compiler with a synthesizer, which has the
power to search a space of alternative programs. The design decision to rely on
search frees the compiler writer from having to develop a (deterministic)
compilation algorithm. As a case study, this project addresses the
programmability question through a programming framework for a spatial ultra-
low-power processor design. The framework includes a programming model and a
synthesis-aided compiler tool chain. The programming model develops a solver-
aided domain specific language (SDSL) that includes constructs for partitioning
programs across processor cores. The SDLS is implemented on the Rosette
framework for SDSL construction.
