Dr. McGrath has been instrumental in developing international cooperation in
chemical engineering between Michigan State University and RWTH-Achen, as well
as other institutions in Germany. This visit will enable to further this effort
and open new windows of opportunity for international collaboration in research
by meeting key individuals and familiarizing himself with the key German
institutions. The utility of this effort is further enhanced by coordinating
this trip with the visits of Dr. R. Wellek of NSF and Dr. Anderson of MSU.
