This award will support collaborative research between a group of U.S. and
Belgian biochemists. The U.S. investigators are Dr. N. P. Higgins, University of
Alabama at Birmingham and Dr. Martin Pato, University of Colorado Health Science
Center. The Belgian researcher is Dr. Ariane Toussaint, Free University of
Brussels. The long range goal of this project is to understand regulation of
genetic transposition in bacterial populations. The Mu transposase and semi-
essential genes participate in a highly efficient replication-transposition
reaction in vivo. In this __ ____ project, experiments will be performed to
analyze the transposase and early genes that influence Mu biology at the stages
of the transcription and DNA synthesis. Objectives of the collaborative work
include i) expression, ii) purification and iii) characterization of DNA binding
proteins encoded by the virus. The investigators will extend joint efforts to
chromosome-associated proteins (HU and other "histone-like" proteins) of E. coli
and _ ____ Salmonella typhimurium. This approach will expand basic knowledge
__________ ___________ of the chromosomal proteins that organize a functional
folded nucleoid. The three investigators run laboratories that have demonstrated
complementary expertise in all of the areas to be studied. Systems involving
purified proteins for analyzing Mu transcription and replication in vitro are
established in __ _____ Birmingham. Methods for analyzing Mu transcription and
replication in vivo are established in Denver. The group in Brussels has genetic
strategies for selecting mutants and carrying out the genetic dissection of
proteins related to Mu biology. By coordinating experiments at the three sites,
the investigators can test a hypothesis genetically and measure predicted
behavior in ___ vitro and in vivo in a relatively short period of _____ _______
time.
