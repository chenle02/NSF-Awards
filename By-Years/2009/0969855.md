This award continues support for a research program at the Rochester Institute
of Technology (RIT) to model merging black-hole binaries in the highly-nonlinear
regime. Research will concentrate on binaries in the technically difficult
small-mass-ratio, highly-spinning, and highly-precessing regimes, that requires
new developments in code optimization, gauge conditions, initial data
generation, and hybrid numerical / perturbative techniques. With these
developments, the code will be used to generate a large number of simulations of
extreme binaries in order to produce waveforms of sufficient accuracy for
LIGO/Virgo data analysis, comparison and validation of Post-Newtonian
approximate waveforms, and to model the astrophysical consequences of black-hole
mergers. This project will directly benefit ground based gravitational wave
detectors such as LIGO and Virgo, the Numerical INjection Analysis (NINJA)
project to see how well numerically generated waveforms can be recovered by data
analysts, and an emerging new field in astrophysics where astronomers search for
the observational consequences of merging and binaries and recoiling black
holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent computational breakthroughs, due in part to
the contributions of the RIT team, have finally allowed numerical relativists to
efficiently solve the Einstein equations for coalescing binaries, and has made
gravitational-wave astronomy in the strong-field regime possible. Gravitational-
wave astronomy promises to provide a revolutionary new view of the universe,
complementary to the electromagnetic perspective. In addition, this award will
be used to greatly enhance the research effort at RIT as a whole by providing
training and mentoring opportunities for postdocs and students. This award will
also allow continuation of activities in education and public outreach,
including programs designed to introduce youths from disadvantaged and
underrepresented groups to exciting scientific developments and the
opportunities offered by the Institute and other local colleges.
