This award funds research using computational methods on a problem in mechanism
design that is especially important in understanding the likely outcomes of
complicated auctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team use mechanism
design theory and linear programming techniques to consider whether first-price
auctions are more or less vulnerable to collusion than second-price or ascending
bid auctions. They also determine how a tacit or explicit cartel might operate
in a variety of different kinds of auctions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
has substantial broader impacts because auction methods are widly used. The
Federal government currently uses auctions to allocate telecommunications
spectrum and rights to offshore drilling, timber, and mining. Proposals to use a
'cap and trade' system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also rely on auction
methods.
