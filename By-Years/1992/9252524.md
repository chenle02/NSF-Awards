A video on using supercalculators as one approach to curriculum reform is being
designed, developed, tested, and evaluated. The video will illustrate the
changes that take place in mathematics classrooms when personal supercalculators
are used regularly for instruction, homework, and tests. Live classroom
instructional scenes, separated by brief interview statements by national
curriculum reform leaders, will be featured. The completed video will be mailed,
free-of-charge, to each of the nation's 2,5000 mathematics during August 1992.
