Numerical and computational techniques are important for all engineering fields.
Such techniques in many cases have underlying basic principles which benefit a
large cross-section of engineering disciplines. Examples include relaxation
techniques, fast Fourier transforms, wave propagation solutions, and numerical
simulation techniques. This meeting brings together experts from diverse
disciplines to address basic aspects of computer engineering and to present
their views and recomendations regarding future directions of the field.
