Part of the brain of mammals is organized into areas that are primary regions
for processing sensory input. The somatosensory cortex is an area where
different parts of the body are represented in different subareas, all showing
an orderly spatial mapping of the peripheral inputs. The area of cortex which
shows a response when a particular fingertip is touched, for example, is termed
the "representation" for that fingertip, and nearby are the representations for
the rest of that finger, and for the other fingers, the hand, and so on. The
discovery some years ago that these maps were not determined during development
alone, but could change during adult life as a result of loss of a digit or
other deprivation, was revolutionary. This project adds two novel aspects to the
progress in this field. First, it raises the issue that sensory experience
changes the organization of adult sensory cortex even when the experience
represents only a small part of the animal's total daily experience. Second, the
approach adds a paradigm of enhanced sensory stimulation, rather than just
deprivation, to drive the changes in cortical organization. In the rodent
somatosensory cortex are distinctive aggregations of cell clusters, called
barrels. This anatomical feature provides an excellent model system for studying
details of morphological changes that accompany physiological changes, and
correlation of these changes at the cellular level clarifies what mechanisms may
be involved in the plasticity of the functional maps. Tactile deprivation or
stimulation of the forepaw in trained rats will be used to define the sensory
experience, and see how the cortical maps change with change in experience.
Results will be important for understanding the effects of use and disuse in the
nervous system, refining models of cortical plasticity, and for understanding
the fundamental role of experience in learning.
