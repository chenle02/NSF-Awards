9304815 Grossman PIs will conduct a stable isotope study to investigate the
paleoceaonographic, paleoclimatic and geochemical changes associated with
Carboniferous glaciation and the formation of Pangaea. They will continue to
develop isotope stratigraphy for the Carboniferous to P-Tr boundary based on
brachiopods, sampling more locations in North America, as well as in Russia. A
Carboniferous geographic divergence will be further studied, with consideration
of diagenesis, calibration of species effects, and evaluation of preservation of
original shell chemistry. The cause of this excursion/divergence will be
investigated; oxygen isotope data will be used to test for glaciation and
climate change on the North American and Russian platforms. ***
