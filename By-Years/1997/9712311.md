9712311 Hofmeister A multifaceted approach is needed to understand the dynamics
of the 410 km discontinuity near subducting plates and its connection with non-
equilibrium transitions from olivine to b- and g-spinel. The PIs propose: (1) to
measure transformation kinetics, hydration, and thermodynamic properties from in
situ (T up to ~900(C at P up to ~50 GPa) infrared spectra of various
approximations to slab and mantle compositions and to elucidate mechanisms
through TEM and petrographic studies of recovered samples; (2) to constrain
olivine metastability and the elevation, sharpness, and velocity contrast of the
410 km discontinuity in and near five subduction zones from seismic traveltime
and waveform modeling. (3) Construct a thermal-kinetic model to link mineral
physics and seismic results. The sub-areas are strongly linked: Rate laws
determined from the IR data form the basis for the geodynamical model which will
provide the temperature distribution for calculating synthetic seismograms.
Matching to seismic traveltimes and waveforms will provide feedback to the
thermal-kinetic modeling in a highly-coupled manner. Model results will provide
guidelines for new IR experiments. ***
