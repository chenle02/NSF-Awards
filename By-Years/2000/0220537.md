This dissertation investigates the impact of high-skilled immigration on the
earnings and employment of high-skilled native U.S. workers. It uses Census PUMS
and March CPS data to describe trends in the highly-skilled labor market and to
analyze the effects of proportion immigrant on earnings and employment in those
labor markets. Highly skilled workers are defined primarily as those with higher
education working in occupations with high average education. Multilevel models
are used to estimate the effects of labor market variables on the individual
employment and earnings outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;
