The goal of this research is to investigate the nature of forces between
particles during sintering of ceramics. The nature of the forces determines the
conditions under which the particles and their grain boundaries are wet and,
also, whether the liquid phase can be rejected from the ceramic after
densification. The specific objectives of the project are to establish whether
particles in a sintering liquid are electrostatically charged and to determine
the force/separation function between particles. The work will primarily be
carried out on zirconia based ceramics. The results are expected to contribute
significantly towards our fundamental understanding of liquid phase sintering of
ceramics and aid in the control the wetting of grain boundaries to optimize
properties of practical ceramics presently limited by intergranular phases.
