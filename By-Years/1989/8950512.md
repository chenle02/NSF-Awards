The Mass spectrometer interfaced to a gas chromatograph is used to introduce
Middlebury College undergraduate students to an important area of modern
analytical chemistry. The instrument sees heavy use in already established
courses in organic chemistry, advanced organic chemistry, and the recently
introduced integrated analytical, physical, and inorganic chemistry laboratory
course. Students in the senior thesis have the opportunity to utilize this
instrument extensively, and thus gain experience with modern instrumentation
similar to that which they will encounter in industry or graduate school. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
