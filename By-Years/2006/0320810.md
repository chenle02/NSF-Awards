With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester will acquire a 500 MHz
NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research
on a) synthesis of polyketides; b) development of a new materials strategy for
photoresponsive polymers; c) studies on hydrogen activation and parahydrogen
induced polarization; d) return electron transfer processes in photoinduced
electron transfer reactions; e) unsaturated, reactive complexes of iron, cobalt
and nickel for insights into catalytic mechanisms; f) C-X bond cleavage studies;
and g) development of new methods of asymmetric synthesis for use in the
construction of complex multifunctional organic molecules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic chemistry and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;
