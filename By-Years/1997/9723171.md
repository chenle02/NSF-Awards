97-23171 Sun Gibberellins are a large family of diterpenoid compounds, many of
which are growth regulators in plants which affect diverse developmental
processes, such as germination, stem elongation, leaf expansion, or flower and
fruit or seed development. The proposed work focuses on the perception of
gibberellins by cells and the signal transduction pathway that leads to the
known responses of the hormone resulting in changes in gene expression and the
developmental and physiological reactions that are well described. Little, in
contrast, is known about gibberellin perception and signaling. The proposed will
characterize the gene, RGA, which very likely encodes a gibberellin receptor,
and study mutants in Arabidopsis which are defective in different aspects of
gibberellin signal transduction. The work includes genetic analysis, gene
cloning and the traditional techniques for characterizations of genes, cell-
specificity of expression and, finally, biochemical analyses for a functional
description of genes. While the work is principally designed for obtaining an
understanding of hormone signaling, the application aspects of the work for crop
improvement, for example, are considerable.
