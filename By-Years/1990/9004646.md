Recent mechanically based treatments flow and erosion in bends indicate that
river meandering is a highly nonlinear, autocatalytic process wherein diverse,
yet self-organized, meander geometries arise independently of variations in flow
and erodibility of valley-floor alluvium. The nonlinearity resides in the fact
that the channel configuration at each instant evolves from a previous channel
state in accordance with mechanical conditions imposed on the flow (and
associated boundary stress field) by that previous state. A suitable equation of
motion can be written which describes the essentials of this nonlinear behavior.
Numerical simulations will be conducted to clarify how the diversity of bend
forms that can occur at any instant, and the tendency for certain of these forms
to recur over time, are compatible features of meander trains that naturally
arise from the nonlinearity of the process.
