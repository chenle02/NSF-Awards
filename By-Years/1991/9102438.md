The study will evaluate changes in the nature of thermocline and nutricline
during the last glacial maximum by bathymetric reconstruction of O-18 and C-13
and organic carbon using a depth transect of cores on the Bahama Banks, and by
time-series analysis of isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera in the
equatorial and subtropical south Atlantic in intermediate and shallow depth
cores. It will lead to a better understanding of chemical and physical changes
in the structure of thermocline during glacial periods.
