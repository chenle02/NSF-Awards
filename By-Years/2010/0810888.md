Abstract (Jovan Popovic, MIT)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive computer-graphics
simulations offer a proven method for learning complex relationships and
procedures. Airplane simulators, for example, tutor pilots through sophisticated
tasks until all procedures are performed safely and efficiently. Of particular
importance to these applications are simulations that are consistent with the
real world. In medicine, for example, physicians can master &amp;#64257;ne motor
skills within physiologically consistent simulations without endangering the
lives of patients. However, the simulations in use today can only emulate
reactive physical systems. Broader application of computer simulation in
medicine, engineering, art, and entertainment requires simulation of active
systems such as robotic devices, humans, and animals that act as well as react
within physically simulated environments. A study of simulations for vehicle and
workspace design, for example, has revealed a pervasive need for digital human
models that can accomplish tasks within physically simulated environments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer graphics today often simulates humans as lifeless
mechanical structures (rag dolls) that do no more than crumple to the ground. Or
it relies on motion-capture techniques (motion graphs) that generate physically
inconsistent motions whenever simulations depart from a few motion-captured
scenarios. In contrast, physically based simulation generates consistent
motions, but the motions are often unnatural and difficult to create. This study
applies the mathematics of modern control theory to establish a more rigorous
foundation for control of such motions in interactive computer simulations. It
simulates natural motions by stabilizing high-quality motion-capture data,
transforming individual motion into a more general action that can be applied in
many different circumstances. A single action may describe short tasks such as
stepping, turning, walking, and jumping. More complex behaviors are assembled
through composition, by concatenating one action after another.&lt;br/&gt;
