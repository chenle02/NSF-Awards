&lt;br/&gt;0112251&lt;br/&gt;Garrick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Americas Program award will support the "Second International Workshop on Iron
and Copper Homeostasis", to be held in Pucon, Chile. Organized by Dr. Michael D.
Garrick of SUNY in collaboration with Dr. Marco T. Nunez of the University of
Chile, &lt;br/&gt;the objective of this workshop is to strengthen international
scientific collaboration in research on iron and copper metabolism, and to
stimulate the interest of young scientists and students in an area highly
relevant to the understanding of toxicology, health and disease states.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron and copper metabolisms are intimately intertwined:
systemic copper deficiency generates cellular iron deficiency, which in humans
results in diminished work capacity, reduced intellectual capacity, diminished
growth, alterations in bone mineralization, diminished immune response and other
symptoms. This workshop will try to provide a better understanding of iron and
copper metabolisms and particularly of their
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop will convene leading
scientists in the fields of iron and copper metabolism from North America, South
America, Europe, Israel and Japan, to exchange knowledge, and to establish
future avenues of collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
