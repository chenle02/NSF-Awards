The embryonic brain is rich in acidic, sugar containing lipid molecules,
sialoglycosphingolipids, or gangliosides. Formation of axonal and dendritic
processes in the developing neuron requires delivery of plasma membrane elements
containing gangliosides of a special higher molecular type. It is not known how
trafficking of plasma membrane gangliosides takes place during the crucial
initial post-mitotic developmental period of the neuron when processes are being
elaborated. This issue will be investigated using a convenient system of early
chick telencephalic neurons cultured under defined conditions in which
synchronous outgrowth of neurites are induced by epidermal growth factor, EGF.
The mechanisms involved in the modification of gangliosides contained in the
membranes of coated vesicles that are taken up into the neuron following EGF
stimulation will be studied. The hypothesis that ecto-sialotransferase activity
is involved in alteration of the ganglioside, GD3, in such a way as to provide
matrix attachment and neurite extension capability to the plasma membrane will
be investigated. These studies promise to provide fundamental information on
ganglioside biosynthesis and function in brain development.
