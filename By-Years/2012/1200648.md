This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site
focused on cyber security at the Dakota State University. The site will provide
a diverse pool of in-service high school computer teachers in South Dakota with
a quality experience conducting cutting-edge research in cyber security. The
teachers will develop research based materials and activities which they will
incorporate into their classes during the academic year. State secondary
computing curricula will be updated to include cyber security and outreach will
be conducted to reach a wide audience of teachers and students within the state.
This site is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive
Research (EPSCoR) Program.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the
expertise of the faculty. The project team has significant related research and
experience in educational applications and K-12 school outreach. The projects
are in research areas that are in an area of national priority and of interest
to teachers and their students. The project also has the potential to make a
significant contribution to the discipline of computer science education through
the development, implementation, and testing of materials and methods for
infusing cyber security into the secondary computing curriculum. The broader
impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to
teachers and the incorporation of sound instructional models into the K-12
schools. The project includes many activities and outreach efforts that should
impact an area that is somewhat geographically isolated and that is surrounded
by a diverse population. The project has the potential to create a sustainable
partnership between the university and schools that can provide long-lasting
benefits to the community.
