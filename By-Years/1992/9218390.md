9218390 Anderson The PI will study continental lithosphere and hotspots to
determine correlations from the present to at least Pangea times. Spatial and
spectral techniques will be used to find, describe and understand relationships
between seismic velocity anomalies, on a global basis, and hotspots, ridges,
rifts, massive volcanism, thick lithosphere and present and past plate and slab
positions. The projects all involve new tomographic results and are guaranteed
to bring new insights from the seismological perspective alone, by combining
available observations from other fields. The mantle has a long memory and
tomography provides much more than just an instantaneous snapshot of conditions
in the interior. ***
