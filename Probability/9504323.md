9504323: Kurtz/Ney Abstract. Research programs will be carried out in the areas
of Markov processes, stochastic analysis, chains with infinite memory, large
deviation theory, branching processes, and stochastic control. Work on Markov
processes will focus on measure-valued processes related to population genetics
and other population models. Work on large deviations will include both further
theoretical developments and applications to simulation. Branching process
models for electron-photon cascades and related physical processes will be
studied with additional applications of large deviation methods. Theoretical
developments for general stochastic control problems will include approximation
methodology and existence theorems for optimal singular controls. New types of
stochastic equations for Markov processes will be studied. Markov processes are
random processes whose future behavior depends on the past only through the
present. If you know the current "state" of a system having the Markov property,
your ability to predict the future is not helped by additional information about
the past. Markov processes play an important role in the study of population
genetics and in descriptions of changing populations more generally, and will be
studied in this context. Markov processes are also important as models of
physical phenomena such as cosmic rays, which will be investigated. Problems to
be considered include control, approximation, and extreme behavior. An
additional direction of research involves processes which fail to have the
"Markov property", but which have special kinds of long range memory.
