In recent years, much has been learned from survey observations of interstellar
clouds that harbor star formation in our Galaxy. These surveys have been
conducted at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, measuring light emitted at
wavelengths invisible to the human eye. A key piece of the puzzle, information
about cloud motions that can only be found with instruments that observe
spectral lines, is needed to transform these surveys into a comprehensive
understanding of the structure and dynamics of our Galaxy. The proposal
sponsored here will allow integration of the Supercam submillimeter-wavelength
heterodyne array receiver with the 12-meter-diameter APEX telescope in
Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology that enables this investigation is
the 64-element Supercam camera, whose design and construction was funded by NSF.
It uses superconducting SIS detectors to observe the sky at a wavelength of
around 850 microns. The Supercam features superconducting SIS junctions in mixer
blocks, and these components are modularized into 1x8 rows with bias
electronics, IF processors, and digital FFT spectrometers integrated into the
modules. The observations are particularly topical and important to modern
astronomy, and were indeed recommended in the Astro2010 decadal
survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve and train students in
many aspects of the work. It also has potentially large broader impacts, as a
survey, on progress in its field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project
is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its
Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.
