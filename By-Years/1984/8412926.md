A combinatorial optimization problem is a problem in which one has to choose
among a limited number of alternatives the optimal one, i.e., one which
maximizes profit, or minimizes cost, etc. Although the number of alternatives is
limited, it is in general too large to enumerate all of them and to compare the
values measuring their benefit. Therefore, combinatorial optimization develops
algorithms to find the optimal alternative without having to know all of them.
In this research, this idea is extended to the case of finding not only the
best, but also the first K best solutions. In a real-world situation modeled by
a combinatorial optimization problem, the best solution may not be available, or
the information about the 2nd, 3rd,..., and K the alternative is essential in
deciding which of the alternatives should be implemented. From a theoretical
point of view, the research will lead to new results regarding the solution of
so-called NP-complete problems, i.e., combinatorial problems, the optimal
solution of which can only be approximated rather than computed. In most of
these problems, an approach will be used which computes the K best solutions of
a simpler problem until the K best solution is feasible for the original
problem.
