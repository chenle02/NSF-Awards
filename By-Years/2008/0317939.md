A two-day scientific workshop with 25 participants is exploring the needs and
opportunities for the Petrology &amp; Geochemistry and Tectonics communities to
participate in and build a cyberinfrastructure for research and teaching.
Participants are identifying the existing and needed databases and tools that
will foster progress in an increasingly data-rich and connected research
climate. They are also determining the sorts of collaborations both internal and
external to the Petrology/Geochemistry and Tectonics communities that are
needed, and discussing data standards. The participants come from a broad
spectrum of the earth sciences and most have some experience in database and
data analysis tool development. The conveners are preparing a report for NSF and
workshop summaries to be published in GSA Today and EOS.
