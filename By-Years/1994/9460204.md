This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to construct an
environment in which automatically translates scheduler specifications input by
a human scheduler into an efficient scheduler. This novel method of building
schedulers promises to make the construction of schedulers very cost-effective.
The current investigating team, has already prototyped `generalized scheduling
environments.` The Scheduling Niche, Inc. proposes as its `Phase 1` research
objective to make the generalized scheduling environments robust and to build a
user-intuitive interface to it. The team's previous research has led to a
classification of a wide range of scheduling knowledge encompassing Jobshop
Scheduling, Transportation Scheduling, Timetabling, and Process Plant Scheduling
into scheduling clusters. These application areas will guide the development of
the environment being proposed here.
