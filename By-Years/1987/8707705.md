Photoacoustic calorimetry is a relatively new technique presently used to study
organic photochemical reactions but not yet fully applied to biological
problems. It has the potential capability of monitoring in real time the volume
change of a protein following a fast perturbation. It measures nonradiative heat
release in molecules after absorption of a photon, thus measuring energy
depositions ignored by luminescence experiments. Dr. Rudzki plans to show that
pulsed-laser, time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry can be used to detect
volume changes and surface charge changes in proteins resulting from
conformational transitions. The enthalpic, intrinsic volume and surface charge
changes in carboxymyoglobin following absorption of a photon will be studied.
The long term goal is to better understand protein dynamics, in particular,
changes in protein conformation in response to stimuli.
