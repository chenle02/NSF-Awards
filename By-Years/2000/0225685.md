Committee for SCOPE, Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment, an
international scientific organization charged with advancing knowledge of the
interactions between humans and the environment. Forty countries are members of
SCOPE, each with a national committee that operates through the country's

important forum for identification of and recommendations for international
scientific discussions of environmental situations affecting humans.
