The objective of the project is to define the mechanisms by which a trace
contaminant is removed from water by polysaccharides that are produced during
microbial growth in bottom muds over which the water flows. The specific
metallic contaminant to be studied in this project is copper and the
microorganism to be used in this study was isolated from metal-laden sediments
of the lower Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada.
