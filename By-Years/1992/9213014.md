The objective of this project is to upgrade the existing Laser Doppler
Velocimetry (LDV) facility at the University of Cincinnati, in order to improve
the quality of the measurements and extend the area of research. The LDV system
will support basic research in particulate flow, turbomachinery aerodynamics and
metal erosion. Advanced optics, signal processing and data analysis equipment
will be acquired. The proposed equipment will incorporate modern burst detection
techniques. The upgrade LDV system will allow for improved research in coating,
turbine design, and coal particle dynamics.
