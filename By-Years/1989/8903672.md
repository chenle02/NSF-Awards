8903672 Walton The purpose of this project is to analyze various mathematical
models of propagating cracks in linear and nonlinear viscoelastic material. For
the linear material models, the principle interest is dynamic crack growth with
emphasis given to boundary value problems relevant to composites. The focus of
this effort is toward obtaining analytical solutions to initial/boundary value
problems incorporating a crack-tip-failure-zone into the model; the fracture
criterion utilized is based upon the work input to this failure zone. Various
crack-tip constitutive models are studied. For the nonlinear material models,
the principal focus is on finite element methods for analyzing crack growth.
Initially, quasi-static crack growth and small strains is assumed, the
nonlinearity entering through the constitutive equations. Subsequently, dynamic
effects and geometric nonlinearity will be considered. The principal goal of
this work is the development of finite element simulations for growing cracks in
nonlinear viscoelastic material utilizing a fracture criterion based upon
incorporation of a crack-tip-failure-zone into the model. Again, various crack-
tip constitutive models will be studied.
