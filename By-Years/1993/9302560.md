This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Paul Dowd at the University of Pittsburgh to study a new experimental
model for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation to further unravel its essential
role in the complex events of blood clotting. The oxygenation of vitamin K will
be studied using isotopically labeled oxygen. This will be followed by other
oxygenations and investigations of the nature of the base(s) involved and of the
effects of other strong bases on activity. Intramolecular models, micelles,
liposomes and environments that mimic those of the membrane locale of the
vitamin K action will also be explored. %%% In this project Dr. Paul Dowd will
conduct an extensive set of oxygenation studies, using labeled molecular oxygen,
to unravel the complex mechanism of blood clotting in which vitamin K plays an
essential role. Not only is a new experimental model used for the action of
vitamin K, but also its environment is modelled to mimic the membrane locale
where the vitamin is active. The influence of strong bases on vitamin K's
activity is an important part of this study.
