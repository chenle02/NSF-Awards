This project examines the transient responses of cracked rotating shafts. It
comprises an analytical and experimental component. In the analytical part, the
crack will be represented by concentrated forces and moments, and will be
assumed to open and close during the motion depending on the conditions at the
crack location. The shaft will be accelerated or decelerated through one or more
critical speeds, and the response will be determined with the use of Galerkin's
method. The effects of acceleration and deceleration rate, crack depth, crack
position and eccentricity will be investigated. Approximate formulas for the
maximum response will be sought. In the experimental part of this project, laser
scan data will be obtained from both uncracked and cracked shaft models and
correlated with the analytically equivalent models. As a result of this study,
it is expected that there will be an improved understanding of the behavior of
cracked structures, and that improved diagnostic procedures for detecting small
cracks in various types of rotating machinery will emerge.*** //
