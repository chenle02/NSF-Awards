Recently attention has been newly focused on the histocompatibility antigen,
Mls, because of its profound effect on the expressed T cell receptor V-beta gene
repertoire. The goal of this research is to characterize Mls-a at the molecular
level in order to define the elusive Mls-a gene product. cDNA encoding Mls-a
will be identified using transient expression systems that allow functional
detection of Mls determinants. Although Mls-a has been described nearly twenty
years ago as a single gene trait that induces strong T lymphocyte proliferative
responses in mixed lymphocyte cultures matched for the major histocompatibility
antigens, the nature of this antigenic determinant has remained an enigma. These
studies should provide direct insights into the nature of this "universal"
tissue specific ligand that is recognized by the T cell receptor in the context
of a class II molecule. This recognition molecule is important because it plays
a role in regulation of immune responses by leading to elimination of immature
thymocytes and activation of mature peripheral T lymphocytes.
