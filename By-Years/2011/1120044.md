For vascular plants the phloem network is responsible for the transport of
nutrients and signaling components, including small molecules, macromolecules
and nucleic acids. The movement of these components is essential to plant
metabolism, development and pathogen defense. Plant viruses hijack the phloem
network to promote their own systemic movement and because of this represent a
unique system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the
trafficking of mobile components within the phloem. The goals of this project
focus on understanding how viruses reprogram phloem specific tissues to mediate
their own movement. Using a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) - Arabidopsis model
system, efforts in this study will exploit TMV?s ability to reprogram cellular
transcription through an interaction with phloem specific IAA transcription
factors. IAA factors are components of the plant's auxin response system and
play an essential role in many aspects of plant development, metabolism and
defense. Specific efforts in this project will focus on examining the
localization of virus interacting IAA proteins; investigating how IAA proteins
affect the virus's ability to move within specific phloem cell types; and
identifying the transcriptional targets of virus interacting IAA proteins and
their potential role in virus mediated phloem transport. Combined results from
this study will significantly advance our understanding of virus movement via
the phloem and shed new light on the mechanisms that plants use to transport
molecules to distal tissues. The broader goals of this project involve the
educational integration of virology and plant biology disciplines for the
training of post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school students with
an emphasis placed on encouraging undergraduate and high school level students
to consider advanced training in these important areas.
