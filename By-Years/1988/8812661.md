Ethics and Values Studies in Science, Technology and Society supports research
and educational activities to enhance understanding of the social values and
obligations and responsibilities that arise in the interactions of science,
technology and society. This project will enable a neuroscientist to study with
two humanities scholars in order to address concerns that arise from new
developments in his field. His career goal is to establish a research and
teaching program in interdisciplinary studies of humanities and basic life
science at a major university or medical college. This project focusses on
ethical concerns and value issues that are emerging from current brain research.
It includes a program of coursework and independent, guided study in the
humanities disciplines needed to develop competence in ethics and values
studies. Historical studies will examine the development of professional
responsibility in the context of modern society and political obligation.
Philosophical and sociological study will examine how contemporary
understandings of society and political obligation create a matrix for
professional ethics, and study of the mind-body problem will place current
research in neural tissue transplants in the intellectual context of current
inquiries about ethics and personhood. The research component will identify
moral values which function in the conduct of neuroscience and suggest the
social responsibilities of neuroscientists. The specific problem to be addressed
is what contributions neuroscientists can make to discussion about human and
social impacts from new developments in brain research and technology. The
project will result in a monograph on ethical and value issues intrinsic to the
conduct and application of research in the neurosciences. This project addresses
a very important issue and will enable a young scientist to develop his
capacities to become a scholar and teacher on ethical issues associated with
developments in his research field. He and his host specialists are uniquely
well- qualified; institutional support is very good. Collaborative efforts are
likely to continue after the period of this award; results are likely to be
appropriately disseminated and useful. An award in the amount of $38,000 is
therefore recommended.
