This project involves three steps into materials science. The first step
naturally follows from previous ab-initio work on gas phase Van der Waals
complexes. Several large transition metal complexes will be examined with the
extended Huckel method. This will answer fundamental questions on the size-
specificity of reactions with clusters; it will also aid in our ability to model
surfaces by clusters. Secondly, the binding of thin metal films to ceramics will
be examined. This is of technological importance and fundamental interest for
the understanding of adhesion between surfaces. This study will utilize the
tight binding method with the extended Huckel Theory. The third activity will be
directed at the study of fullerenes. Since the current software implementation
and computer resources are insufficient to carry out these three projects on
parallel machines new techniques necessary to implement them will be used in
collaboration with the Theory Center.
