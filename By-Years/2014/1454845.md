With this CAREER award, the Chemistry Synthesis program is supporting the
research of Professor Joshua G. Pierce of North Carolina State University.
Professor Pierce will develop new methodologies for the synthesis of nitrogen-
containing heterocycles. One aspect of the research allows efficient approaches
to densely functionalized thiazolines providing unique nitrogen radical
precursors for chemical synthesis. A second research endeavor is asymmetric
approaches for the construction of pyrrolidines, heterocycles commonly found in
complex natural products. Professor Pierce is engaged in a collaboration with
the Natural Sciences Museum in Raleigh, NC involving a series of Science Cafes
for the general public. The partnership also involves an interactive "synthesis
lab" to engage K-12 students in organic chemistry and chemical biology.
Professor Pierce is a mentor for Project SEED students and NSF REU students at
North Carolina State University.
