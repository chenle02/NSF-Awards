9507680 Stein The field of motor control has advanced rapidly in the past
twenty years. Researchers have learned about important basic principles that
explain how circuits of brain cells produce coordinated movements. One force in
moving the field has been an international conference (held every ten years) of
researchers from many disciplines with a common interest in biological motor
control. This award will provide support for the third such meeting. By
advancing the field toward the next century, this meeting will have a great
impact on our understanding of the physiology of movement, the neural mechanisms
and feedback control of behavior, and the engineering analysis of complex neural
functions. ***
