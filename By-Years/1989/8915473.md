The study will model the mechanics of the formation of an accretionary
wedge/arc/forearc basin complex, with the post-collisional Chile margin as a
prime example. The models will lead to an understanding of the growth of the
margin, the formation of the outer arc high, and sedimentation and structure in
the forearc. The work is expected to help resolve the issues between competing
models of accretionary wedge development of the Chile margin.
