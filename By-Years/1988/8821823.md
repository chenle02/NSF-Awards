This proposal outlines an extension of recent work on structured modeling
frameworks that includes the development of a prototype modeling system based on
this extended framework. The proposal is interesting because it involves a very
creative and productive investigator in a project that includes elements from
three important areas of operations research: model representation, construction
of modeling systems, and algorithmic design. The development of a prototype
mathematical programming modeling system, for which the database environment
would itself generate the models, represents an important next step in the
design and application of modeling systems. A number of management scientists
and other researchers are interested in this area but the approach suggested in
the proposal, which would apply object-oriented programming languages to address
model construction, is considered to be novel and highly promising. The scope of
the project is ambitious but necessarily so, with the potential for a high
payoff regarding issues of model management that would be of central theoretical
and applied interest to the operations research and management science research
communities.
