This award supports research on the theory of Lie algebras. The principal
investigator will work on proving a general Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for some
rings associated to reflection representations of Coxeter groups. It is expected
that, for crystallographic Coxeter groups, study of these rings and their
integral forms will have important consequences for some central problems in Lie
theory. The main object of the research is to obtain additional information on
the structure of these rings and related algebras. This project is concerned
with the study of Lie algebras and , in particular, with the Kahzdan-Lusztig
polynomials. The Kahzdan-Lusztig polynomial is a combinatorially defined object
having deep connections with structures in geometry and representation theory.
This work is important both in mathematics and physics.
