9452255 Webers A scanning electron microscope and an upgrade of the attached
energy dispersive system are being used to enhance the electron microscopy
capabilities, including back scattered electron imaging and quantitative
capabilities, of the science division. The scanning electron microscope is
housed in a new laboratory complex with other instruments including a
transmission electron microscope and an X-ray diffractometer. Students in a
large number of biology, geology, and physics courses are using the new
instrument, and students involved with research through either short term
projects or more extensive honors research projects in a variety of disciplines
are making use of the capabilities of the new system.
