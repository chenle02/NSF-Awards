Fifty-five high school science teachers will be given coursework sufficient to
certify them to teach physics. The curriculum has been planned as a result of
collaboration between five University of Wisconsin campuses (River Falls, Green
Bay, Waukesha, Eau Claire, and Platteville), administrators from 54 Wisconsin
school districts and several physics master teachers. Most teachers will take
eleven or twelve semester credits of physics over a period of two summers and
the intervening academic year. The program is flexible enough to accommodate
teachers who need more or fewer credits. Academic year courses will be given at
several locations within commuting distance of most teachers' homes. Master
teachers, Physics Teaching Resource Agents (PTRAs), will be part of the
instructional staff in order to help the participating teachers identify with
their peers and encourage their participation in Wisconsin physics teachers
networks. This program addresses the most important science education problem
identified in a 1986 needs assessment done by the Wisconsin Department of
Instruction. The targeted school districts were identified in 1987 as the
program was being planned. The districts have committed themselves to
implementing more and/or more rigorous physics courses in their schools, and the
Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction has promised continual support for
the program following funding by the NSF. (Women and Minority participants will
be recruited vigorously.) An amount equal to approximately 20% of the NSF
request for funding has been cost-shared by the University of Wisconsin, the
State Department of Education and the individual school districts.
