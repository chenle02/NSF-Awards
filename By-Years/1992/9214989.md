Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, Georgia Tech Research
Institute (GTRI) will develop a wavefront sensor camera for the astronomical
adaptive optics (AO) community. The camera will utilize the best available
charge coupled device (CCD) technology. The camera electronics will be able to
read 4 ports at up to 2 MHz each, with readout noise of 10 electrons rms at 1
MHz read rate. The camera will initially use the MIT Lincoln Laboratory 64 x 64
pixel, frame transfer, 4 port device; for this chip, 1 MHz read rate corresponds
to about 900 frames per second. The Camera will include a controller with 4
modes of operation, a real-time video display and both manual and computer
interfaces. An important feature of the camera is that it is adaptable to
advances in chip technology; it is designed to be easily reconfigured for a
variety of CCD chips. Georgia Tech Research Institute and the U. of Chicago are
contributing a total of $260K cost share to this effort during which 3 cameras
(2 for U. Chicago) will be built.
