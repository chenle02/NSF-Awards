This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Women and students from underrepresented groups are being
especially targeted for support. The students are enrolled in either electrical
or computer engineering in one of three cohorts supported by the project. The
objective of the project is to improve the retention rate of the targeted
students while simultaneously increasing their interest in graduate studies. The
program has components of faculty and peer mentoring, financial assistance, and
increased focus on the first two years of study for both first-year students and
for transfer students.
