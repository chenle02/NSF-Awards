This agenda-setting workshop responds to recent renewed interest in the
geographies of children and youth. This interest stems from a more critical
perspective on what constitutes childhood and youth, with specific focus on how
the production of space disenfranchises and marginalizes children and youth in
contemporary urban society. Additional concerns to be addressed by the workshop
include how children embrace identity politics and create space, how childhood
is commodified and exploited, and how symbols between adults and youths are
being homogenized. The workshop will bring together international scholars from
a broad range of disciplines to discuss and probe this topic with the intent of
identifying a focused research agenda for the near (ca. 5-10 yrs) future. This
is an exciting, emerging, and potentially important area of research in
Geography, and it shares similarities with other investigations focusing on the
importance of spatiality to issues of race, class, ethnicity, gender, diversity,
and physical disability. This workshop on Young People's Geographies will
explore these commonalities and thereby may yield added insight into a broad
range of theoretical and empirical concerns within the discipline. Moreover, the
specific research area will undoubtedly lead to a deeper and nuanced
appreciation for childhood and youth within modern urban environments, and this
would be an essential contribution to contemporary political debates on public
policy directed toward concerns of crime, parenthood, and the overall moral
fiber of society
