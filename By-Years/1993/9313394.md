9313394 Rouch The research is for the development of techniques for controlling
chatter and vibration in machining by use of a actively controlled dynamic
absorber. The inertial force generated by actuation of the secondary mass
relative to the cutting tool assembly modifies the system dynamic
characteristics. The proof of concept design using a piezoelectric actuator
packaged inside of the boring bar has been demonstrated to be effective. The
research is to provide an enhanced theoretical basis for the approach and extend
its range of application to a wider variety of practical machining conditions.
In particular, robust controller methodologies will be investigated and the
system design parameters optimized. Higher force and higher stroke capabilities
will be sought in the application to boring operations. Extension to multi point
machining such as milling are also to be considered. Successful completion of
the research should enable a stable operation of boring bars with higher length
to diameter ratios. Material removal rates and accuracies in boring and milling
operations will be improved.
