The distribution of carbon black, or soot, is widespread with sources such as
fossil fuel combustion and forest fires. Soot is a significant contributor to
the global burden of suspended particulate matter in the lower atmosphere. The
reactivity and catalytic activity of particulate carbon are dependent upon the
nature of its surface. These heterogeneous chemical reactions are poorly
understood, but their role in the chemistry of the atmosphere is becoming
recognized as a possibly an important one. In order to assess the importance of
soot-related heterogeneous reactions, knowledge is required of the reactions of
soot with atmospheric gases and the properties of soot responsible for those
reactions. This project is a continuation of work aimed at understanding the
mechanisms through which the presence of soot influences the chemistry of
atmospheric species including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone. This
work involves characterization of the surface properties of soots produces by
various combustion conditions and identification of reactive intermediates and
mechanisms. This project will extend the research to photochemical processes
under simulated solar radiation and to more atmospherically realistic
multicomponent systems involving oxygen and water.
