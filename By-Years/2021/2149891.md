This three-year REU Site at Marshall University (MU) will recruit students
enrolled in non-STEM majors at community colleges located in the southern
Appalachian region to participate in engineering research related to
subterranean features. The 70-acre MU Subterranean Cavity Research and Training
(MUSCRAT) Park includes mined shafts, culverts, and test pits that will be
utilized for the REU project data collection. Research activities are designed
to promote the progress of science through subterranean hazard investigation and
sustainable uses of abandoned coal mines. This REU Site aims provide educational
opportunities for students in the economically depressed southern Appalachian
region from community colleges, particularly those from non-STEM
majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year REU Site at Marshall University
involves faculty and graduate student mentors from the departments of civil
engineering and mechanical engineering. Located in the 70-acre MU Subterranean
Cavity Research and Training (MUSCRAT) Park, the project objectives are to: (1)
provide community college students, particularly those from non-STEM majors,
with an engineering research experience; (2) improve participants’ research and
creative abilities; (3) improve participants’ communication skills; and (4)
increase the number of women, underrepresented minorities, veterans, and first-
generation college students choosing to pursue degrees (both undergraduate and
graduate) or careers in engineering and other STEM fields. Examples of the
planned research topics include non-destructive detection of voids and potential
sinkholes (e.g., karst), technologies to explore and map abandoned coal mines,
use of mine pools for geothermal heating and cooling, and acid mine drainage
mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
