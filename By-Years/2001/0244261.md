The proposal is to study duality in various field theories. In particular target
space duality will be investigated in two dimensional sigma models. Particular
emphasis will be placed on uncovering geometrical structure in quantum field
theories. Geometrical methods will also be used to study Yang-Mills theory in
the 1/N expansion in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;Another aspect of the
proposal is to study integrable quantum field theories that have boundaries. One
such model is the sine-Gordon model with higher-spin conserved charges. Due to
the exact solvability of the model, one hopes to gain insight into the non-
perturbative aspects of theories with boundaries. This has important
significance for brane-world physics as well as many condensed matter systems.
