This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at Colorado State
University to continue a successful Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Site. The program in Molecular Biosciences will enable qualified undergraduates
to do independent research projects in a range of areas and using a variety of
experimental approaches. Biochemistry/molecular biology employs the methods of
chemistry, physics, cellular biology, microbiology, and genetic manipulation to
study the structure and function of complex biomolecules, how these molecules
generate the phenomenon we call life, and how alterations in these molecules
perturb the living organism. Because of its breadth, biochemistry/molecular
biology serves to integrate didactic and experiential material learned in a
multitude of basic science courses. The REU program is designed to ?a! offer the
participants a wide variety of research areas from which to choose an
independent studies project; ?b! offer project areas that are meaningful and
exciting to the student; ?c! teach the student how to formulate and test
hypotheses; ?d! help develop the ability to trouble-shoot and problem-solve when
confronted with the unexpected; ?e! instruct the participant in state-of-the-art
techniques and instrumentation of biochemistry/molecular biology; ?f! develop
the ability to communicate with one's peers concerning ongoing research efforts
as well as more formal presentations of completed research projects; and, ?g!
provide, in CSU faculty and in outside scientists invited to speak to the REU
students, role models that will reinforce the intellectual excitement of a
scientific career; and ?h! render assistance to the participants in applying for
graduate studies and fellowships.
