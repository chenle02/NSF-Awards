This project adapts Alverno College's Digital Diagnostic Portfolio (DDP)
technology for advanced level SMT courses to address several goals. These
include monitoring and building coherence within the major programs in SMT;
identifying and describing how the implementation of DDP in SMT curricula
affects assessment processes; identifying, describing and comparing how DDP in
non-SMT curricula affects assessment in SMT; and using DDP to study the
differences and commonalties in analytic problem solving. This will provide
important understanding of the ways in which adapting technological innovations
impacts not only the natural science fields but, through comparative analyses,
other disciplines as well. The wider benefit of this project outside of Alverno
College will be in analyzing and describing the process of adapting the DDP
assessment technology and in attempting to describe the effects of such
assessment technology upon student learning and achievement.
