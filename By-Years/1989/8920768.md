Four postdoctoral research mathematicians will study various aspects of
dynamical systems under the direction of the principal investigator. Three of
the investigators will study various aspects of circle dynamics. These include
studies of rotation number, the renormalization operator for smooth maps with
flat spots, hyperbolicity of the renormalization operator, and the Sullivan
program for circle endomorphisms. The fourth investigator will study one
parameter families of unimodal and multimodal maps of the interval. Uniqueness
properties of kneading sequences will be investigated. Orbits of points which
are carried around a circle with given asymptotic rotation have interested
mathematicians working in dynamical systems for most of the century. In recent
years, first Collette and Eckman, and then Feigenbaum made the study of
renormalization famous with their discovery of the "Feigenbaum constant" for
period-doubling bifurcations. This "constant of nature" has been observed in a
wide variety of physical phenomena. These research mathematicians will study
deep aspects of the renormalization operator applied to functions of the circle
and the interval.
