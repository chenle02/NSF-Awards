The logic group at Notre Dame is well established. Our graduate training program
produces doctorates who have experienced the many dimensions of research,
teaching, and mathematical communication. At Notre Dame, the students develop a
solid independent research record. They make themselves known to the
international mathematical community by participating in conferences and
workshops and giving talks, in addition to writing papers. They have the
opportunity to discuss research with specialists from around the world, and to
participate in collaborative research. By the time they graduate, they are full
members of the international community of mathematicians. Notre Dame offers
graduate students opportunities to teach and training to help them be
successful. Our students have experienced a greater variety of teaching
experiences.

Our logic postdoctoral associates have been allowed significant time to develop
a research program of their own. They have taught students of all levels, from
first-year liberal arts undergraduates to advanced graduate students. They have
been involved in mentoring graduate students, in leading small group learning
activities, and other more advanced aspects of faculty life.

This grant provides partial support for all of the US nationals studying
Mathematical Logic at Notre Dame, and support for the first of a two year
postdoctoral associate in logic. In addition, it will provide some travel money
for the students and postdoctoral associate, and some money for books for the
students. Finally, the grant will provide some travel money for outside visitors
to come to Notre Dame to interact with the faculty, students, and postdoctoral
associate.
