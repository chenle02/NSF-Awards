The Interactive Middle.Grades (IMS) Project will apply many of the
recommendations for change in science education to the critical middle grades.
Florida State University at Tallahassee and Houghton Mifflin Company will
develop a science program for grades six through eight that will meet the
diverse needs of today's teachers and students. IMS will integrate teachers,
textbook and laboratory with applications of the microcomputer and the laser
videodisc, producing a commercially marketable system for science instruction,
classroom management and student evaluation. Science content, processes and
skills focusing on appropriate problems of science, technology and society will
be integral parts of the program. This joint effort will involve professional
societies, distinguished science educators and will be consistent with
guidelines offered by the National Science Teachers Association and National
Association of Secondary School Principals. Florida State University has built a
reputation in curriculum development through the principal investigator in this
project and other well know staff members who will be available to assist in the
development of the IMS program. The partner in this project, Educational
Software Division (ESD) of Houghton Mifflin Company, has designed and marketed
high quality computer software for the elementary and secondary school market
since 1966. The publisher will invest in excess of 14 million in this project
during the 3 years development phase and will contribute substantially to its
continuance and teacher training. The proposal addresses a clear need to improve
middle school science and promises to have an impact throughout the nation. It
is consistent with the objectives of Instructional Materials Development
Guidelines, particulary the cooperation of major school systems, publishers and
universities to help in the process of dissemination and utilization.
