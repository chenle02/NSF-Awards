9404419 Rychlik The research entails topics in the dynamics of billiard-type
systems and estimates of the spectrum of the Laplacian in convex domains.
Another component of the research involves the geometry of Lorentz attractors
and homoclinic orbits. This research figures prominently in dynamical systems
and has potential applications to other areas of mathematics and topics in
mathematical physics. ***
