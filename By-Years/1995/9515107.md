The purpose of this project is to determine how international productivity
differences and increasing returns to scale models can explain patterns of
international trade. The first phase of the project involves developing a
detailed database of the world trading environment that would contain data on
bilateral trade flows, production by industry, resource endowments, and input-
output relationships for 54 industries in 75 countries over the period
1963-1992. This is an ambitious data gathering exercise, but is fully
implementable and will be made publicly available. The second phase of the
project will identify models of trade that are most appropriate for the purpose
of understanding the role of productivity and human capital for U.S. economic
success. Without such information it is impossible to design informed public
policy, be it pro-active or noninterventionist. By providing this information,
the results of this research should aid policy-makers in building a stronger
economy, both within the United States and globally.
