ABSTRACT DMS - 0203735.

The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems and
differential geometry. Its principal goal is the investigation of the dynamical
and geometric structures of "higher rank" systems. Such systems naturally appear
both in dynamical systems and geometry. In particular, the principal
investigator will study rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian
and semisimple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal of
classifying such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical hypotheses. In
particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic abelian actions, and actions by
semisimple groups and their lattices preserving affine and geometric structures.
He will also investigate invariant measures of algebraic higher rank abelian
actions. The investigator will also investigate Riemannian manifolds (especially
higher rank ones) and their geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical and group
theoretic tools will be used in this research.



Dynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields that investigate
the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in
a fluid flow). New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos, fractals) have
changed our perception of the world fundamentally. Dynamics and ergodic theory
provide the mathematical tools and analysis for these investigations. Dynamical
systems have had a major impact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic
dynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe
codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far
afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is one of the oldest fields in
mathematics, and generally studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional
analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.
Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now studied for its
close ties with physics and other sciences and applied areas (computer vision
e.g.)as well as internal aesthetic reasons. Geometry and dynamics are closely
related as some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and
geometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems. One main goal of this
project studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is
unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Important examples of such
systems arise from geometry.
