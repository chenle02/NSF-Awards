Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405516&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Paul Seidel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aim of the project is to
harness the power of Fukaya&lt;br/&gt;categories for use in symplectic topology.
This includes&lt;br/&gt;developing computational tools, building a repertoire
of&lt;br/&gt;nontrivial examples, and also studying the relationship
between&lt;br/&gt;Fukaya categories and Gromov-Witten invariants.
Concrete&lt;br/&gt;examples that will be looked at include: Fukaya categories
of&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surfaces; Lagrangian submanifolds in cotangent
bundles;&lt;br/&gt;and the symplectic geometry of Khovanov's
link&lt;br/&gt;invariants. Various aspects of mirror symmetry will be
important&lt;br/&gt;sources of intuition, and the experience gained in this
way&lt;br/&gt;should ultimately feed back into a better understanding of
mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry itself, especially its homological
aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a wider perspective, the project is part of
the reaction of&lt;br/&gt;the scientific community to recent advances in
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics. The contribution that mathematics can make is to
verify&lt;br/&gt;the soundness and consistency of physical intuition, and
to&lt;br/&gt;prepare the general ground on which further development
can&lt;br/&gt;occur. This is particularly important in those situations
where&lt;br/&gt;developments in physics suggest the presence of deep and
complex&lt;br/&gt;structures, which are difficult to detect by direct
experiment. A&lt;br/&gt;nice aspect is that the same circle of ideas allows one
to answer&lt;br/&gt;some purely mathematical (geometric) questions inspired by
the&lt;br/&gt;"old" physics of classical
mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
