Students in physics and environmental technology courses previously gained
little understanding of basic physical concepts from lectures. Furthermore, the
artificial separation of lecture and laboratory in these courses has prevented
the laboratory from rectifying the conceptual shortcomings of lecture. The
department has purchased a single computer and instrumental interfacing
equipment and has begun to redesign the physics courses by melding lecture and
laboratory into an activity-based instructional approach. Equipment is being
purchased to enable the department to set up a number of computerized student
learning stations. Specifically, it is setting up six learning stations that can
be used to teach a two-semester, calculus-based physics course and a one-
semester, technical physics course during the first year of the project. In the
second year, three more stations can be added and activity-based instruction can
be introduced into two environmental technology courses Principles of
Environmental Engineering and Advanced Water and Wastewater Operations. *
