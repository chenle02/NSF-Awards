The structure of the cross-shelf flow has been of interest to coastal
oceanographers for decades because it determines the depth at which upwelled
water originates. This project will test a new idea that differences in
stratification determine whether the upwelled water comes from bottom boundary
layers (under weak stratification) or from interior depths (under strong
stratification). Analysis of existing datasets and numerical models will be used
to test and further develop this idea. This project has important implications
to other coastal oceanographers interested in the transport of nutrients, larvae
or geochemical materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
