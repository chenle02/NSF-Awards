The Division of Chemistry supports this workshop, entitled "Needs and
Opportunities for Mid-Scale Instrumentation in Chemistry." It will be held on
September 29-30, 2016 in Arlington, Virginia. Prof. Robert Hamers of the
University of Wisconsin - Madison has assembled a team to organize the
activities. This workshop brings together a diverse group of approximately 35
faculty from a broad range of institutions and geographic areas to discuss if
research and education in the chemical sciences is limited by lack of access to
instrumentation in the "mid-scale" range. These discussions focus on the
regional and cyber enabled tools that could fill the needs of the chemistry
community.

Goals of the workshop include: (1) identifying chemistry research areas where
scientific progress is significantly limited or inhibited by lack of access to
mid-scale instrumentation, (2) identifying research areas in which co-location
of mid-scale instrumentation into regional instrumentation facilities would
provide opportunities for transformative advances in chemistry research, (3)
educating stakeholders on how mid-scale instrumentation could impact research in
the chemical sciences, (4) preparing a workshop report summarizing the
participants' views, (5) disseminating the report and findings to the broad
scientific community via a publicly available, written report and a short video.
The broader impacts are addressed by benefiting society in ways that maximize
the effectiveness of public support of research and education in the chemical
sciences.
