King 9514687 Successful reproduction in animal species requires the release of
an egg from the ovary, known as ovulation. Ovulation requires the joint action
of a part of the brain, known as the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland. A
chemical substance released by the hypothalamus, luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH), is transported by the blood to the pituitary gland and acts on
cells therein to enhance the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) which helps
prime the ovary for ovulation. The exact mechanism involved in LHRH secretion
into the bloodstream is currently a mystery but through the efforts of Dr. King,
she has demonstrated marked cellular reorganization within the vascular portion
of the hypothalamus, known as the median eminence, that facilitates chemical
secretion by the brain. Dr. King is using the state of the art microscopic
techniques to investigate the anatomical relationship between the cells
producing LHRH and glial support cells in the median eminence and the changes in
this relationship occurring at the time LHRH is secreted. Dr. King is also
examining the role of excitatory neurotransmitters in the dynamic relationship
between LHRH-containing cells, glial cells, and the blood vessels themselves
during the remodeling at the time of LHRH secretion. Studies to identify the
cellular components involved in communication between these cells that stimulate
reorganization are underway. These studies examine the local regulation of brain
LHRH secretion. The coordinated secretion of LHRH is responsible for the
regulation of reproductive abilities in animals and understanding these
mechanisms is central to the survival of all animal species, domestic or wild,
including man.
