This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
research by Dr. Daniel L. Reger of the Chemistry Department, University of South
Carolina at Columbia, on coordination compounds of post-transition metals,
specifically, Sn, Pb, Ga, In, and Tl. Compounds will contain bidentate and
tripod-tridentate poly(pyrazolyl)borate ligands, which have previously exhibited
a variety of coordination numbers depending on the size of the metal. By
modification of the pyrazolyl ring, steric control of the extent of
oligomerization will be attempted. In addition, hydride, alkoxide and amide
derivatives will be synthesized and thermal decomposition of new alkyl metal
complexes will be studied. The solution structure of the previously-prepared tin
complexes will be investigated using NMR methods. Some work on compounds
containing related polyphosphinoylmethanide ligands is also planned. %%% The
ability of the later elements of Groups 13 and Group 14, namely tin, lead,
gallium, indium and thallium, to form coordination compounds has not been
studied extensively. The new coordination compounds which will be prepared in
this project may be useful for preparation of semiconductors and optoelectronic
devices by chemical vapor deposition. Water-soluble gallium and indium complexes
might find utility in radiolabeling studies.
