9412611 Levine This is a group travel project to assist American participants in
the thirteenth World Congress of Sociology, to be held in Bielefeld, Germany,
July 18-23, 1994. The major conference of the International Sociological
Association, the World Congress occurs at four-year intervals and attracts
approximately 5,000 participants. Review of individual requests for travel
awards, selection of recipients, and the distribution of funds will be the
responsibility of the American Sociological Association. Competitive criteria
for an award include an invitation or acceptance of a paper, the scientific
merit of the paper, and the qualifications of the applicant. %%% Support for
travel of U.S. sociologists permits continued growth of international exchange
and collaboration in sociology. This project is particularly timely, given the
necessity to promote international collaboration on global social processes and
transformations, especially those relating to understanding the causes and
consequences of democratization. ***
