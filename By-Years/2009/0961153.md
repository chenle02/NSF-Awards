In this project the PI will develop a nonlinear dynamical method for the
estimation of states and parameters in models of neurobiological systems using
experimental data. Utilizing this method the PI will analyze models of
individual neurons in the crustacean Pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) and
models of sub-circuits of neurons within this CPG. The general problem of
determining the parameters of mathematical models of individual neurons and
networks of neurons will be addressed using a novel method called dynamical
parameter estimation (DPE), which is based on the classical problem of optimal
tracking of a desired trajectory. In this case the DPE is known in the control
theory literature as a Luenberger observer with adaptive gain: a filter in the
sense of Kalman. Using this approach the PI will apply the new technique to the
analysis of experimental data from CPG neurons and CPG sub-circuits. Two
graduate students will be involved in this efforts. The research group of the PI
will also work each summer with Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
undergraduate students program at UCSD.
