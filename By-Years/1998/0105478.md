Modern processors predict the outcome of branch instructions and speculatively
fetch instructions on the predicted path. If the prediction is wrong the
speculatively fetched instructions are squashed (deleted) and fetch continues on
the correct path. Techniques will be investigated that will reduce the number of
such squashed instructions. With compiler and hardware assistance instructions
that would normally be squashed and later re-fetched are identified and
specially handled so they can be retained. Another approach to be investigated
is to delay the fetch of instructions that might have to be squashed, in their
place fetching instructions that would be executed regardless of branch outcome.
A memory access latency hiding technique will also be investigated. It works by
retiring a portion of the dynamic instruction stream (that is
delayed&lt;br/&gt;by a cache miss) out of order, if necessary. The techniques
will help solve two pervasive problems: the limited speed of integer programs
due to branch mispredictions and the reduced performance of
certain&lt;br/&gt;programs due to long memory latency. Branch misprediction
penalty is an increasing function of issue width and pipeline depth; as both of
these are expected increase the techniques to be developed will have
a&lt;br/&gt;greater relative impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
