9414800 Nolte The objective of the proposed research is to create holographic
materials from photorefractive quantum wells. The key breakthrough anticipated
is the development of photorefractive quantum wells into asymmetric Fabry-Perot
structures. These multi-wave interference devices will have the maximum
performance possible for photorefractive quantum well technology, and will make
these devices available for new femtosecond spectral holography applications
that require high-sensitivity and high-speed holographic materials for use in
lightwave fiber communications systems. In addition, several new designs will be
demonstrated that have unique photorefractive features, such as monolithic all-
semiconductor quantum well devices that considerably ease fabrication
requirements, the search for stimulated backscattering in reflection-geometry
devices that may achieve net gain for applications requiring optical
amplification and selfpumped phase- conjugation, and fast free-carrier
photorefractive devices for use with pulsed light sources. ***
