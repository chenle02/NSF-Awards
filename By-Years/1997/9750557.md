In order to modernize the laboratory curriculum, gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy (GC-MS) is being introduced into several chemistry labs. The
principles of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry have been taught in
organic and analytical chemistry courses, but experience with a GC-MS instrument
is introducing students to this technique and expanding and complementing other
spectroscopic methods of structure determination including UV/vis, infrared and
NMR used in organic chemistry laboratories. In instrumental analysis labs in the
analytical chemistry course, GC-MS is providing students with a method for
quantitative and definitive analysis of complex mixtures. GC-MS is being
introduced into the first-year general college chemistry course where it is
being used to demonstrate the existence of isotopes and determine natural
abundance of chemical elements. Experiments are being developed to take
advantage of the unique power of GC-MS to both separate and identify mixtures of
chemical compounds. All students in organic, analytical and general chemistry
(300400 per year) are benefiting from this project. Students in the chemical
technology program especially need profit from this experience with GC-MS, an
analytical technique that is widely used and in demand by local industries and
laboratories. This project helps prepare students for employment and meets the
needs of local employers for this critical skill. *
