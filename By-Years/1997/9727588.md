Abstract 97-27588 Ward and Wetzel Effects of wetland habitats on fate of
dissolved organic matter in a forested wetland Wetlands are important interface
features of landscapes because they modify water flow and material received from
upgradient regions of watersheds as well as determine the quantity and quality
of material transported downstream. However, the processes by which wetlands
modify materials are not clearly understood. In this project we examine the
effectiveness of habitat features associated with different marsh environments
in retention, transformation, and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
Experiments will be performed in simulated wetland habitats in a state-of-the-
art glasshouse facility, where water flow, temperature, light regime, and water
chemistry can be controlled. Amendments of radio labeled DO 14 C will be tracked
in these habitats to determine the amount of carbon retained on surfaces
(sediments, plants, wood), transformed to gases (CO2 and CH2), and exported.
Additional experiments will determine the effects of UV radiation on
characteristics and retention capabilities of microbial communities attached to
the surfaces.
