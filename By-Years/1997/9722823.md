9722823 Schoech The primary goal of this project is to determine the hormonal
mechanisms that mediate parental and alloparental behavior in a social species,
the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens). Because prolactin is associated
with parental behavior in many species, including Florida scrub-jays, the thrust
of the project will address the role of prolactin in promoting helping behavior
by nonbreeders. Previous correlative studies have linked helping and prolactin
in this species. This proposal uses a protocol whereby manipulations of hormone
levels allow more definitive assessment of hormone function. It has long been
known that until a hormone is removed and replaced experimentally, the causal
nature of the compound can only be inferred. Recent advances in our
understanding of the compounds 'upstream' from the pituitary that control the
secretion of prolactin make it possible to remove prolactin with biological
elements. Using a prolactin releasing agent, and by treating Florida scrub-jays
with anti-bodies against this agent, prolactin can be immunoneutralized.
Following removal of the hormone of interest (prolactin), focal observations of
treated individuals will allow the determination of whether prolactin is
responsible for helping behavior. Similarly, modern field endocrine techniques
allow enhancement of an organism's endogenous hormone titres. By removing and
then supplementing prolactin in free-living cooperatively breeding Florida
scrub-jays, this proposal will pioneer the use of these valuable techniques
under field conditions. In addition to greatly enhancing our understanding of
hormonal mechanisms that mediate social behavior, the methods used in this
proposal may prove to be useful in manipulating behavior, and may set the stage
for future research in a variety of species.
