The investigator proposes to develop and analyze variational principles for
various problems that arise in mechanics and in chemical systems theory. He also
proposes to develop algorithms and numerical methods for approximating the
solutions of these problems. Particular attention will be devoted to the
variational characterization of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations,
the initial value problem for pipe flow and of various problems in hydrodynamic
stability. It is also planned to study certain second order equations including
equations from mechanics and certain wave equations and various eigenvalue
problems. Variational methods of the type proposed here have numerous
applications in computational methods in engineering and other sciences.
