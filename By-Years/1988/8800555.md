This conference, the Fourth Southeastern Symposium on Logic, will provide a
forum for the exchange of ideas and results on the leading edge of research in
mathematical logic and its applications to other branches of mathematics and to
computer science, and will facilitate collaboration among researchers and
institutions in the Southeast. The four major speakers are C. Jockusch, A.
Lachlan, J. Keisler, and H. Woodin. Financial support for graduate student
participation is available. Mathematical logic has connections with all aspects
of mathematics, and in particular has applications not only in mathematics
itself, but in theoretical computer science, including formal languages and
their decision problems.
