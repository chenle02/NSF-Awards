Professors Osher, Engquist, and others will continue their individual and joint
research on the development analysis and applications of numerical methods for
nonlinear partial differential equations. Specific methods to be studied
include: essentially nonoscillatory shock capturing techniques, front capturing
algorithms, multiresolution and wavelet based methods, numerical homogenization,
effective boundary conditions, kinetic models, spectral and viscosity methods,
particle methods, and stochastic difference methods. Engineering and physical
applications to be studied include: aerodynamical properties of high speed
vehicles, hydrodynamic device models, miscible flow in porous media, combustion,
reacting gas flows, shock turbulence interactions, microwave scattering,
Boltzmann equations, nuclear fusion reactors, and core-annular flows. This broad
range of activity has value both in its own right and with regard to extensive
applications.
