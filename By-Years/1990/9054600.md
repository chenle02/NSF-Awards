The Denver Earth Science Project, conducted by the Colorado School of Mines,
will develop and implement earth science curriculum programs for kindergarten
through secondary school. "Critical Issue" modules will be written in
partnership with business, government, and education participants. Each module
will stress a critical issue related to the earth. The modules will integrate
science, math, geography, and technology. The program will strive to increase
the interest of students in the earth sciences.
