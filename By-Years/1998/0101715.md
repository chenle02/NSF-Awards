The Midwest Center for Information Technology is a consortium of ten community
colleges together with four-year colleges, secondary school districts and
businesses in Nebraska, Iowa, and North and South Dakota. The Center emphasizes
the areas of networking, computer applications, systems integration, application
development, telecommunications, and digital media. The goal is to increase the
preparedness of the region's information technology (IT) workforce primarily
through faculty and teacher professional development, 2+2+2 articulation,
innovative education/training programs targeting students at various levels
including incumbent workers, and dissemination of best practices and proven
deliverables. Objectives include increasing by 50% the number of teachers and
faculty who hold industry-validated certifications; by 50% the number of
students articulating to community college programs; by 50% the number of
students completing community college IT programs; and by 25% the number of
students articulating successfully to four-year colleges. These activities
should lead to a 30% decrease in the number of unfilled IT positions in the
region's businesses. The Center programs build upon other programs of the
Applied Information Management Institute.
