Problems arising in control theory, in the physical sciences, and in other areas
of mathematics have led naturally to the consideration of linear maps between
infinite-dimensional spaces, as well as to other objects constructed from
collections of such maps. This project is intended to add to our understanding
of these concepts, with applications to the areas mentioned before as possibly
distant goals. The work on this project involves mathematics from apparently
disparate mathematical disciplines, such as combinatorics and probability. More
specifically, it engages various newer probabilistic concepts that are
appropriate for a noncommutative setting. The principal investigator will
involve both graduate and undergraduate students in this research. Indeed, some
of the combinatorial problems can be formulated in a sufficiently elementary
manner as to be accessible without too much technical background. (Previous work
with undergraduate students did result in published material.)

The concrete problems in this proposal fall into several categories. The first
one concerns the Littlewood-Richardson rule from combinatorics and
representation theory. It is hoped that appropriate formulations of this rule
will be found that apply to the study of sums and products of compact operators
and elements of finite von Neumann algebras. The second category is connected
with the free probability theory introduced by Voiculescu. Here the problems
revolve around the addition problem for collections of free random variables and
its applications to random matrices (e.g., the study of outlying eigenvalues
resulting from perturbations). The third category consists of several somewhat
loosely connected problems from single operator theory or the closely related
non-selfadjoint algebras they generate. The problems range from structure theory
for commuting isometries to questions about hyper-reflexivity, invariant
subspaces, and numerical ranges. (As far as applications are concerned, the
second category of problems has connections to communications theory, while
single operator theory is a valuable tool in control theory. These applications
are not the focus of the proposed research, but earlier work of the principal
investigator has had impact in applied areas.)
