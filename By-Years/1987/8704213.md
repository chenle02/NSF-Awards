This grant permits Dr. Beall to conduct human biological research in Phala,
Tibet Autonomous Region, Peoples Republic of China. The approximately 170 male
and female nomads (between the ages of 15 .85) to be studied reside at high
altitudes of between 4900 . 5450 m above sea level and the goal of this project
is to understand how people adapt to year round habitation at such heights. Dr.
Beall will measure the distribution of hemoglobin concentration, percent
arterial oxygen saturation and ventilation. Study participants will provide
fingerstick blood samples for hematological analysis and undergo noninvasive
oximetry. Resting ventilation volumes will also be measured. This will yield
basic epidemiologic data on age and sex differences in these parameters and
allow Dr. beall to test the hypothesis that an inverse association exists
between hemoglobin concentration and percent arterial oxygen saturation. Dr.
Beall also hypothesiszes that there is a positive association between the
percent of arterial oxygen saturation and ventilation. This is an extremely
interesting study population because it resides year round at such a high
altitude. It is also interesting because it appears that Tibetians adapt to the
oxygen stress imposed by high altitude differently from South Americans who live
in the Andes. This latter group exhibit barrel chests and higher levels of
hemoglobin concentration. These features appear to be abscent in Tibetans. This
research is important because it will increase our understanding of how humans
adapt to physical stress. It may aid in the management of altitude sickness and
will help to open this extremely interesting part of the world to U.S.
reseachers. I
