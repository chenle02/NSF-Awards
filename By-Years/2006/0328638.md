HRD 03-28638 Dr. Christine Grant is one of six tenured women faculty in Chemical
Engineering in the nation. Her outreach activities serve students from K-12
through graduate education with additional attention to mentoring junior
faculty. Her goals include doing more intensive outreach to women faculty and
the continued mentoring of women in STEM learning communities. She has built an
array of program activities that seek to stop leaks in the academic pipeline for
women and students from traditionally under-represented groups. Grant notes that
the most important aspect of the mentoring process is to teach students how to
work in the system. The letters of support suggest that she "walks the talk" and
includes students in her research agenda.
