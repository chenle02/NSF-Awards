0216316 Drinkwater This is an exploratory project that will use meta analysis
linked to modeling to provide a synthesis of the extensive literature published
on carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in agricultural systems. The
expectation is to be able to predict the impact of changes in management
practices on primary productivity, yields and global biogeochemical cycles.
Another product of this work will be to determine the impact of substituting
N-fixation for mineral N fertilization.
