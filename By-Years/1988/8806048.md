This grant is to provide funds for the purchase of a Cahn TG 121
thermogravimetric system to be utilized in studies of diffusion and sorption of
large organic molecules in pillared clays. Pillared clays are catalytic
materials consisting of very regular porous structures with uses in for example,
gas oil cracking, methanol conversion to olefins and toluene ethylation. The
equipment will be used to study the diffusivity of various organic molecules in
pillared clays by low pressure sorption experiments in a Perkin-Elmer TGS-2 UHV
thermogravimetric system. The procedure will consist of placing small amounts of
finely ground pillared clay in the quartz microbalance, introducing gas into the
apparatus and then measuring the uptake. There are no other thermogravimetric
systems in the Chemical Engineering Department at USC and this will be of great
benefit to the PI's research effort in preparing new pillard materials and for
improving the catalytic and sieving properties of pillared clays already in
existence. He has already made valuable contributions in this area and this
equipment will greatly benefit his experimental efforts.
