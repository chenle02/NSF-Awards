This project investigates the stability characteristics of realistic robot
manipulator models in the presence of random disturbances. Characteristics which
are often neglected but will be included here are servomotor dry friction,
backlash and saturation, and coupling moments between links. Modeling of the
system is done using the method of random-plus-sinusoid describing functions.
The model is used to look at the stability issues. An experimental phase of the
project tests the theory with real hardware. Once the stability character of the
system is known, this information is used in the controller design to preclude
instability and thus improve the safety and reliability of industrial robots.
