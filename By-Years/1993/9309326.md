9309326 Guzman The objective of this research is to study and explore
alternative applications of metal chelate interactions, and to develop
reversible and specific protein separation methods. Enzymes and inhibitors
(bioligands) are to be coupled to soluble bifunctional polymers previously
modified with a chelating compound at one of the ends. These modified chelating-
polymer-bioligands will then be reversibly attached to a previously fixed metal
in a solid or soluble support. This approach will allow the bioligands to be
replaced whenever their activity is lost by simply removing the metal ion (and
subsequently the chelate-polymer-bioligand) from the system, leaving the initial
chelate matrix intact. With this approach, enzymes and specific inhibitors
bearing a chelating ligand for the fixed metal can be attached in a reversible
manner. ***
