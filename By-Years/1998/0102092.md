This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Producing hydrogen gas from sunlight
and water using green algae." The photosynthesis pathway in green algae can be
altered to produce hydrogen instead of oxygen. This research tests if the
algae's need for metabolic energy is the driving force behind this solar-powered
hydrogen production. An understanding of this phenomenon will aid in the
development of green algae as an alternative-energy fuel source.
