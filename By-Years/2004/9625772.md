9625772 Tornatzky The project, University-Industry Technology Transfer in
Southern EPSCoR States, will focus on research universities located in eight
southern EPSCoR states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia) in a region-wide effort to upgrade
their technology transfer performance and practices. Its operating premise is
that a more robust technology transfer relationship between EPSCoR state
universities and industrial partners will have positive impacts on the
fundamental research and educational activities of the institutions. The project
will conduct an outreach effort focused on EPSCoR-state universities that has
the following components: (1) an annual report to the region (e.g., the Southern
Governors Association) on the state of university-industry technology transfer;
(2) an annual practitioner/stakeholder conference; (3) a network of "best
practitioners" who can provide outreach assistance to peers in EPSCoR-state
universities; (4) a continuing analysis of performance and practice benchmarks;
(5) accelerated dissemination of relevant reports, guidebooks, and tools; and
(6) continued professional development services for faculty.
