This award provides funds to support US participants at the joint Brazilian
School of Probability and summer meeting of the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics in Rio de Janeiro, July 2006. This tenth meeting of the Brazilian
School of probability features two mini-courses conducted by renowned experts in
actively developing areas of probability, and a set of invited lectures
emphasizing recent results that strives to present frontline research to
experts, young researchers, and advanced graduate students. The joint summer
meeting of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics features a symposium on
probability and stochastic processes and collection of special sessions in
statistics. The mix of the two programs promotes interaction between
international groups in the probability and statistics communities.
