The numerical solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations and
eigenvalue problems is central to many scientific and engineering applications.
Iterative methods executed on parallel computers often provide the only means of
solving these problems. Most parallel implementations of iterative methods have
adopted a fine grain allocation of equations to different processors. However,
recent architectural and computational advances suggest that fine-grain methods
may be inadequate. Specifically, high network latencies and synchronization
overheads may make fine grain methods ill suited to clusters of workstations
(COWs) and massively parallel processors (MPPs). In addition, partitioning a
problem to a large number of processors may lead to load imbalances and
processor idling. The increasing use of Computational Grids consisting of
heterogeneous networks only makes these problems worse. Achieving high
performance requires new levels of sophistication in parallel algorithms and in
the interaction of the implementation with the runtime
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the state of the art in
high performance, parallel iterative methods by exploring algorithms that
combine coarse and fine granularity, and dynamic resource utilization schemes.
It will build a new multigrain implementation level on top of traditional
parallelization methods to introduce coarser granularity during the
preconditioning step. It will identify system-aware iterative algorithms and
algorithmic patterns that enable dynamic load balancing, and use them to exploit
available runtime system information. The resulting codes will be made available
to the community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
