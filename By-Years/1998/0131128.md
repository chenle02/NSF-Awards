With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University will acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small
molecule diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: a) analysis of endohedral fullerenes (Dorn); b)
structure-function relationships of natural products exhibiting anticancer
activity (Kingston); c) studies on rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes (Gibson); d)
studies on the structure, physical properties and reactivity of
perfluoroarylated transition metal cyclopentadienyl complexes (Deck); e)
investigations of catalysis using metal complexes of polysulfonated
triarylphosphines in aqueous and biphasic solvents (Hanson); and f) studies on
charge-transfer molecular magnets (Yee).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray
diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts;
materials chemistry; pharmaceutical chemistry; and biochemistry.
