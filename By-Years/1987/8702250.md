Caste Determination in the Argentine Ant, Iridomyrmex Humilis: This award
recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the
Exchange of Scientists and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is
designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
at research institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as
well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities
for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards
are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of
science, the propsective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. This research project
will investigate several social and environmental factors which may play a role
in caste determination in the Argentine ant. These factors include queen
pheromones, worker/larva ratios, influence of queen age on egg bias, and effect
of season on egg and worker bias. Small fragments of colonies will be used to
examine the influence of these factors on the development of new queens. The
project is under the direction of Dr. Edward L. Vargo, Department of Zoology,
University of Texas at Austin, U.S.A. and Dr. Luc Passera and Jacques Bitsch,
Laboratoire d'Entomologie, CNRS, 118, Route de Narbonne, 31062, Toulouse,
France. This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,
international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if
applicable, language training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance
of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
