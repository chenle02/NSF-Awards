9450310 Turchin This project is a planning grant from two community school
districts in Manhattan, District 3 and 5. They are proposing to collaborate with
the Workshop Center at City College of the City University of New York, the NYC
Central Board of Education, and the Educational Development Center to plan a
local systemic teacher enhancement effort for improving the teaching and
learning of science in the elementary schools of both districts. The grant will
allow the districts to conduct a better needs assessment which would include
examining staff abilities in terms of their teachers' ability to use inquiry
teaching methodologies knowledge of science content and process, and ability to
change. They will also be identifying possible lead teachers based on their
willingness to work with colleagues and ability to serve as mentors. Once the
expertise has been identified a model will be developed which will include:
designing the organizational structure; defining the curriculum; identifying the
content of the inservice; defining avenues for collaboration with other NSF
projects and community- based agencies, including the USI effort, and
coordinating with informal science centers. ***
