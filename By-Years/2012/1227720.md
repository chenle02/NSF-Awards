University of Hawaii proposes to support technical services on R/V Kilo Moana
(KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The proposal requests
support for basic services and specialized services. For basic services, they
will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise on R/V Kilo Moana to
support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for
qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.
The Institution also supports some operations on the R/V Ka`imikai O Kanaloa
(KOK), which is not a UNOLS vessel, but does support some federally sponsored
research, including some for NSF. As specialized services, they offer two towed
seafloor mapping systems (HAWAII MR1 and IMI-30) for shallow- or deep-towed
imaging and bathymetry, and they provide services to evaluate the quality of
data from acoustic current profilers installed on UNOLS vessels as well as
continue to support a flee-wide ADCP standardization and quality control
oversight program. The budget included with this proposal is for the first year
of a 5-year continuing grant.

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion
two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its
shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research
projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research
program of NSF). The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
