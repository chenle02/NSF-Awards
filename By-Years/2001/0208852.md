The Timber project addresses the construction of a database system to manage
large volumes of extensible Markup Language (XML) data. The goal is to develop a
native XML database, in which XML data is stored directly, retaining its natural
tree structure. At the same time, without mapping the data into relational
tables, the objective is to obtain all the benefits thereof, such as declarative
querying and set-at-a-time processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this
objective, the Timber project uses a bulk algebra for the&lt;br/&gt;manipulation
of trees as a basis, and creates a principled implementation of a modular,
algebraic framework for the optimization and evaluation of queries against XML
data.&lt;br/&gt;
