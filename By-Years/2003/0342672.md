There is currently major uncertainty regarding the oxidation pathways of
dimethyl sulfide (DMS) within the tropical marine boundary layer and in the
relative strength of biogenic sources to the global sulfur budget. The
investigators extend upon their previous work on the atmospheric chemistry of
atmospheric sulfur compounds by developing state-of-the-art fast-response
Atmospheric Pressure Ionization Mass Spectrometer (APIMS) instruments to
experimentally determine all the terms in the chemical budgets of DMS and sulfur
dioxide (SO2). Important DMS oxidative loss pathways produce dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2). The investigators will use APIMS technology
to measure these species, modifying additional APIMS instruments to this purpose
and evaluating them through laboratory studies. The measurements these
instruments will ultimately provide ambient atmospheric data valuable for
chemical model development and verification, as well as producing a more
observationally constrained budget for climate-relevant sulfur gases in the
marine boundary layer. Broader impacts of the research include new tools to
characterize atmospheric sulfur cycling and through support for a postdoctoral
scholar, research training experience for an early-career geoscientist. With
support from this award the investigators will assemble a research team through
external investigator collaborations to plan and execute a comprehensive
tropical marine boundary layer sulfur biogeochemical cycling experiment to take
place in the near future.
