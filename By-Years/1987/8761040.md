The goal of this research is to develop a fast detection instrument for particle
number chemistry and size distribution. The instrument is based on field-flow
fractionation (FFF) operated in a crossflow mode. The FFF technique has been
developed by Professor Giddings. The P.I.'s research team is very competent in
the specific field, and the research goal is realistic. The program has a high
promise for fruition. Funding at is recommended.
