9309520 Soboyejo The initiation and evolution of damage in
unidirectional/multidirectional titanium matrix composites will be investigated
using a combined experimental and analytical approach. Damage will be monitored
using noise filtered acoustic emission signals, high resolution in-situ optical
microscopy, and in-situ scanning electron microscopy. Incremental damage
accumulation experiments will also be performed in which local and global
measures of constituent (matrix, fiber and interface) or composite modulus will
be used as indicators of damage due to microcracking or plasticity.
Micromechanics and macromechanics models are developed and applied to the
prediction of damage initiation under monotonic or cyclic loading. ***
