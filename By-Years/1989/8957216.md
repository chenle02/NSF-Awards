The principal investigator will continue his studies of intersection cohomology
while partially supported by this Presidential Young Investigator award. In
particular, he will work towards a proof of the Borel conjecture which would
extend his solution with M. Stern of the Zucker conjecture and an earlier
solution to the MacPherson conjecture. In two other projects, he will study
complete Kahler metrics on algebraic varieties with non-isolated singularities
and intersection cohomologies which are direct summands. Cohomology is the dual
of homology. In cohomology theory spaces of functions on topological spaces are
studied, while in homology theory the spaces themselves are graded by their
algebraic connectivity properties. The principal investigator will work toward
solving a deep conjecture concerning square- integrable cohomology as related to
intersection cohomology.
