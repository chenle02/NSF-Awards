SES-1153867&lt;br/&gt;Michael Rosenfeld&lt;br/&gt;Stanford
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social Networks
and Relationship Stability&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Marriage and family life in the
United States have undergone significant changes in the past 50 years. In
addition to the fact that Americans are now marrying later than ever before,
young adulthood is now marked by a more complex process that includes living
arrangements away from family and college. Compared to other developed
countries, American couples also have higher divorce rates and less couple
stability. Most important for this study, fewer relationships are formed via
traditional personal networks (e.g., family, community, work). This project
addresses the following fundamental questions: (1) Are relationships equally
likely to last, regardless of the context in which they evolved? (2) How do
individual factors, as well as personal networks and the social context shape
the odds that relationships last? A previous study gathered nationally
representative survey data (of U.S. adults) on how couples meet. The follow-up
study proposed here will determine whether the couples previously interviewed
have stayed together, and determine the factors influencing relationship
stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Family and
relationship stability is a topic of great interest to the general public,
scholars, and policy makers. Findings derived from this study could help us
understand the individual and contextual factors that shape trends regarding
couple dissolution. This is a subject of considerable debate in public
discourse, but for which there has previously been insufficient data. The
project also will also result in an updated publically available dataset
accessible to other researchers via the Stanford University website; it can been
used to train undergraduate and graduate students in survey methods and data
analysis.
