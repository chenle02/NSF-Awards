Cecilia Richards Abstract The objective of this research is to investigate the
effect of vortex dynamics on droplets dispersion, vaporization, and burning in
round jets. The research will focus on the dispersion of drop and their vapor by
large-scale vortical structures in nonreacting jet, and in reacting jets, and on
the impact of droplet/eddy interaction on the reacting flow structure. An
experimental study of a turbulent jet with point source droplet stream injection
using planar imaging techniques, image analysis, and point measurements of
droplet and gas phase statistics, will be performed. This research will yield
insight on the effect of vortex dynamics on the structure and behavior of
reacting two-phase flows, data from this study will be directly applicable to
improved design of two-phase reacting devices, such as industrial furnaces, gas
turbine combustors, and hazardous waste incinerators.
