The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences is purchasing a side-scan
sonar/subbottom profiling system for fluvial, lake, estuarine and Long Island
Sound field studies in introductory and upper-division courses, as well as
undergraduate research. The coupling of this new system with existing marine
equipment is enabling students to study fundamental sedimentologic, geomorphic,
and oceanographic principles, as well as gain experience in modern methods of
data acquisition and image interpretation. Students, through their courses and
research, are making a major contribution to the database on Connecticut's
rivers, lakes, and estuaries, and on Long Island Sound.
