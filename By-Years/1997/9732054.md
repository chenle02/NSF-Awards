The focus of this research, carried out in an undergraduate setting, is the
development of synthetic methodology for the preparation of porphyrins and
porphyrinoids. The `3 + 1` method, wherein a monocyclic dialdehyde is condensed
with a tripyrrolic structure, will be used to gain a wide range of structural
variation. The scope of the protocol will be explored with the goal of producing
a number of new and novel compounds. With this renewal Research in Undergraduate
Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research efforts of Dr. Timothy D. Lash of the Department of
Chemistry at Illinois State University. In collaboration with his undergraduate
participants, Dr. Lash will focus his work on the preparation of substituted
porphyrin and porphyrinoid structures. The chemistry and spectroscopic
properties of the the latter will be insightful and there the possibility exists
that practical applications could ensue
