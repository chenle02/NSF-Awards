Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies how environmental policy
that is different from a tax on pollution affects the environment and well-
being. The project will focus on the extent to which exhaust standards for new
vehicles, which limit the emissions rate per mile for different local air
pollutants, have been effective at reducing air pollution from the U.S. vehicle
fleet. Using a range of data, including tens of millions of pollution test
readings for individual new and used vehicles, the project first shows that air
pollution emissions from light-duty vehicles have fallen by more than 99 percent
since the 1960s. The project will quantify the extent to which exhaust standards
have caused these reductions, and study how a vehicleâ€™s emissions increase as it
ages. Finally, the research will build analytical and quantitative models of the
U.S. new and used vehicle fleets to study how changes in new-vehicle emissions
standards and feasible alternative policies affect the well-being of
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader objective of this project is to
advance knowledge on the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental policies
for transportation. Microdata compiled for this project show that for the major
types of regulated air pollutants, exhaust emissions per vehicle mile traveled
in the U.S. new vehicle fleet have fallen by more than 99 percent since
regulation began in the 1960s. Regressions exploit changes in new vehicle
emissions standards across years, vehicle classes, and pollutants to assess what
share of that 99 percent decrease exhaust standards have caused. The preliminary
analysis documents several facts which together suggest that existing standards
have not been cost-effective: (1) age and mileage explain large differences in
emissions rates; (2) a small share of vehicles account for most pollution; (3)
policies based on age and other vehicle attributes improve welfare more than
exhaust standards do; and (4) existing registration fees and property taxes are
higher on cleaner vehicles. The analysis also shows that these facts are not
true for fuel economy and CO2 emissions, which have been the focus of much
research. The research builds analytical and quantitative models of the vehicle
fleet to study feasible counterfactual policies that can complement
standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
