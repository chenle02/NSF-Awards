Lattice parameter characterization of one-dimensional random processes has
become a well developed theory with many applications to linear estimation,
spectral analysis, speech coding and synthesis, system identification, and
control systems. This research is directed towards the extension of this theory
to two-dimensional scalar image fields and multidimensional random fields. In
particular, the connection between the very rich theory of scattering/inverse
scattering problems and the lattice section structure will be examined. Central
to this connection is the cascade and the nesting properties of the lattice
filter where the addition of a new section does not change the previous
sections. This work lays the basis for a theory of lattice modeling which is
crucial to applications to multidimensional data processing, pattern
recognition, and digital filtering.
