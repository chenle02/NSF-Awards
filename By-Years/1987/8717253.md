This NSF award to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for support of its
Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) is made through an interagency
transfer to the National Climate Program Office, NOAA which gathers
contributions from 10 Federal offices and makes the award to NAS. The objective
of this award is to provide the funds necessary for the NAS BASC to continue to
provide federal agencies with scientific advice and guidance on atmospheric
science and climate topics. BASC is a parent board with a number of sub-
discipline committees and panels made up of a balanced cross-section of
representatives from the atmospheric sciences and climate communities. The NAS
BASC input to science agencies is important because it allows federal planning
for the support of science to be done based on community concensus and on the
best scientific advice we can find.
