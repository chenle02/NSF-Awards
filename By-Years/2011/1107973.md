The goal of this project is to carry out a systematic study, from radio to
gamma-ray wavelengths, of the&lt;br/&gt;progenitors and explosion properties of
short- and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) -- the most extreme form of
astronomical transient phenomena -- and to exploit their intense brightness to
study the chemical enrichment of galaxies at unprecedented redshifts. The
project will provide a comprehensive set of GRB and host galaxy observations to
both determine the nature of GRB progenitors and to probe the high redshift
universe. The results will be used to confront theoretical GRB progenitor
models, and to uncover the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium at
high redshift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training
of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. The project will introduce
the dynamic universe to middle- and high school students across the country,
through a new program with the Harvard-Smithsonian MicroObservatory, a network
of automated on-line telescopes. The program will enable students to design and
execute their own GRB and supernova observations.
