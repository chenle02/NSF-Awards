This work will extend the observations made as part of the U.S. JGOFS Bermuda
Atlantic Time Series (BATS) Program to include detailed optical oceanographic
measurements. These observations are necessary to develop and evaluate
optically- based primary production models. The goals are to: 1) Characterize
the optical properties at the BATS site; temporally seasonally, as well as on
diel time scales), spatially (as a function of dept) and spectrally (by color of
light); 2) Examine the light utilization by the phytoplankton community and its
temporal variability; 3) Develop and evaluate bio-optical models for determining
in situ irradiance spectra and primary production rates from standard incident
irradiance and pigment concentration measurements; and 4) Provide the "optical
link" by which the BATS observations may be used to evaluate bio-optical models
for pigment concentration, primary production, and sinking particle fluxes from
future satellite- based ocean color sensors.
