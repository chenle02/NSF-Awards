The project deals with the synthesis and characterization of Ti (III)-doped
glasses via sol-gel processing techniques. The Principal Investigator proposes
to develop a new tunable glass laser material which utilized Ti (III) as the
active ion. The experimental work will emphasize the development of the
chemistry and physcial processing requirements associated with the formulation
of Ti (III)-doped glass monoliths of the silicate type via sol-gel processing
technique. Both pure silicates and alkaline earth silicate formulation will be
conducted in a reducing atmosphere. A laser scattering analysis method will be
employed to characterize the optical quality of the resulting glass structures.
Subsequent spectroscopy characterization will include analysis of the absorption
and fluorescence spectra of the formulated glass. Ti (III)-doped sapphire solid-
state laser has an extremely braod tuning range of 600 to 968 nm. This material
exhibits similar optical characeristics as pure sapphire, while affording the
added advantage of shaping capability. Presently, no research work is known on
glass laser material with Ti (III) as the active ion. A glass laser material
with a tuning range which includes the visible light spectra would provide
numerous applications in the communications technology.
