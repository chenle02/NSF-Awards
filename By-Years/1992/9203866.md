During the last glacial period temperatures were colder, the thermocline base
was shallower, nutrient concentrations were lower and oxygen minimum zone was
indistinct. The PI will examine isotopic variations in formaminifera south of
the glacial polar front in the North Atlantic to learn more about their
relationship to thermocline and its dynamics and the changes in glacial polar
front.
