A broad program of research in atomic, molecular, and optical physics and
related areas will be carried out at JILA at the University of Colorado. The
research activities to be conducted include: laser cooling and trapping,
precision measurements, quantum optics, nonlinear optics, photonics, simple
atomic and molecular systems, and larger molecular systems and clusters. The
recently announced first experimental observation of Bose-Einstein condensation
is one example of the research which forms a part of the JILA program.
