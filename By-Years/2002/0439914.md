This study is investigating three questions: (1) How are graduate students being
recruited, trained, and prepared for professional careers by geography graduate
programs? (2) How do the environments of MA/MS and Ph.D. geography departments
shape the abilities and attitudes of students in these programs? (3) What types
of resources are most helpful for strengthening graduate departments in
geography? To address these questions, we are conducting detailed surveys and
interviews with chairpersons, faculty, employers, administrators, and graduate
students in a diverse range of departments. We are also collecting professional
development resources that departments are using to train graduate students,
especially with regard to those aspects of academic work and culture that
receive relatively little attention in today's graduate curriculum, such as
course design, career planning, professional ethics, and proposal writing.
Finally, we are translating the results of this research into a practical Guide
for Enhancing Departments and Graduate Education (EDGE Guide), a collection of
print and digital resources that chairpersons and departments can use to improve
the quality of their graduate programs. Our partners include the Professional
and Organizational Development (POD) Network in Higher Education, several MA and
Ph.D. geography programs, and faculty with extensive expertise in geography and
professional development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
