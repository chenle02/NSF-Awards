This project is a collaboration between the Biological Sciences Curriculum
Study (BSCS) and the Social Science Education Consortium (SSEC). The purpose of
the project is to design a conceptual framework for education about the history
and nature of science and technology. The framework will delineate a scope and
sequence of conceptual themes and will describe how to integrate those themes
into K-12 Science and social studies programs.
