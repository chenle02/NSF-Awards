The purpose of this project is to understand speech variations sufficiently to
develop an approach to speaker-adaptive speech recognition adequate to allow
telecommunication between deaf and hearing people. To accomplish this, a system
will be developed which will automatically partition certain kinds of acoustic
and phonetic variation found across speakers and to cluster speakers into
acoustic speaker-type and phonetic-type groups.
