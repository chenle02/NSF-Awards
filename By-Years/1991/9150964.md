The goal of this project is to employ sophisticated and computerized
instrumentation in a program of undergraduate environmental research and course
work that is facilitated through the Cumberland Mountain Research Center (CMRC).
The equipment to be used in these activities include an Atomic Absorption
Spectrophotometer (AA) with Graphite Furnace and Element Lamps, a Hydrolab Data
Sonde 3 water quality sensor and logger, and Polycorder hand held data recorder
and computer. The instruments are used in 12 major courses of the curriculum,
reaching students in biology, chemistry, and wildlife management.
