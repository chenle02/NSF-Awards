The use of multiprocessor computer systems is increasingly common in scientific
and numeric computing. In developing applications for multiprocessor systems,
new challenges arise in coordinating concurrent accesses to shared data. This is
traditionally achieved through locking, which often restricts parallelism, and
can also cause performance bottlenecks because delayed processes can cause
others to wait. This work aims to eliminate locking from multiprocessor
applications through the use of transparent, wait-free implementations of user-
supplied transactions, which ensure that delayed processes never cause others to
wait. In this project, wait-free implementations will be designed that
automatically resolve conflicts between concurrent transactions, and exploit
parallelism between nonconflicting transactions. Their performance will be
studied through simulation and applications. Finally, a seamless interface for
application code will be developed on several systems. The education plan of
this project focuses on integrating research and education in concurrent
programming. This research will provide new tools for developing efficient
applications in multiprocessor systems. These tools will be used in some of the
future courses in concurrent programming. ***
