STUDIES IN RIEMANNIAN AND COMPLEX GEOMETRY

Anderson, LeBrun and Sawon will pursue research on various topics in
differential geometry with close links to other key areas of the mathematical
mainstream, such as mathematical physics, differential topology, partial
differential equations, algebraic geometry, and several complex variables.
Anderson will carry out research on general relativity, Einstein metrics, and
the geometrization of 3-manifolds. LeBrun will work on the Riemannian geometry
of low-dimensional manifolds, with a focus on curvature and topology in
dimensions 3 and 4, and on Zoll metrics in dimension 2. Sawon will study compact
hyper-Kaehler manifolds and quaternion-Kaehler manifolds from the point of view
of Rozansky-Witten invariants, knot invariants, and topological quantum field
theories.

It is expected that the broader impact of this research program will be
significant. Many of the problems under study are of great interest to
theoretical physicists working in general relativity, supergravity, and string
theory; moreover, members of the group are actively developing links with
physicists working in these areas through participation in conferences, seminars
and collaborative projects. The project will also directly contribute to the
training of a new generation of mathematical researchers, as members of the
research group are actively engaged in the supervision of many graduate
students, including women and minorities.
