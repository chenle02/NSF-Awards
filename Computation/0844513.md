Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) factorizes an input nonnegative matrix
into two nonnegative matrices of lower rank. It is recently discovered that NMF
in the most basic form is equivalent to a relaxed K-means clustering, the most
widely used pattern discovery algorithm in data mining. This direct link between
mathematics and data mining sets in motion a large number of developments on
using matrix factorizations for pattern discovery. It turns out that NMF
provides more consistent and mathematically well-defined optimization
formulations for many fundamental and emerging data-mining problems. NMF
algorithms have well-understood properties; they are simple and easy-to-
implement, well suited for distributed parallel architectures. This research
aims to formally establish a comprehensive NMF-based framework for data mining.
In particular, we will (1) extend matrix factorization data-mining methodology
from current focus on clustering (pattern discovery) to newer problems: semi-
supervised clustering (extending partial knowledge to whole data) and
classifications (pattern prediction, such as predicting a cancer tumor tissue
from a normal one); (2) develop fast numerical algorithms and incorporate state-
of-the-art numerical optimization techniques; and (3) apply and evaluate the NMF
algorithms in different real-world applications including text mining and
bioinformatics.
