The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support an eighteen month research fellowship by Dr. David L.
Green to work with Dr. Jan Mewis at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in
Leuven, Belgium.

This study of dispersions of particles with well-defined shape and size will
provide fundamental information about how interparticle interactions influence
aggregation in concentrated particulate dispersions in polymer melts.

The Leuven rheology group is a leader in flow-rheology-structure relationships
in complex fluids.
