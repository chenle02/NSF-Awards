The US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (US JGOFS) seeks "to understand the
processes governing the production and fate of biogenic material in the sea well
enough to predict their influences on, and responses to global scale
perturbations" (JGOFS, 1984 "identifying and quantifying the physical, chemical
and biological processes controlling biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, and
their interaction with the global atmosphere" (JGOFS, 1984, achieving a
predictive capability is that the processes and interactions quantified today
respond linearly to global scale perturbations and that knowledge of the present
biogeochemical system dynamics will, therefore, allow us to predict response to
global perturbations with accuracy. This is a fundamental assumption and is the
keystone of the JGOFS strategy for predictive capability. The scientific
justification for this assumption has never been stated.
