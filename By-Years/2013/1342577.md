This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides funding to
explore the feasibility of using nanostructured particles and thin films as key
components in a polymeric nanocomposite suitable for solar applications. The
synthesis of the nanocomposite polymers will focus on key constituents in the
polymer/nanoparticle matrix that have the potential to aid in the strategic
placement of the functional molecules, i.e. chromophores, in a solar cell. This
feasibility study will evaluate the photo conversion behavior of the
nanocomposite, focusing on photoconductive atomic force microscopy and
electrical characterization of bulk solar cell devices as well as examination of
the topography and interfacial zones of the nanocomposite. If successful, the
data from this study will provide guidance for the feasibility of water-based
manufacturability of nanoparticle/conductive polymer thin film flexible solar
materials, and will guide future research into fundamental studies of
photovoltaic nanocomposite materials. The effort will contribute to the
development of a new strategy for solar heterojunction materials that is based
on the dispersion of customized nanoparticles within conductive polymer arrays
using facile self-assembly within aqueous phases. An additional advantage is
that the material system would be amenable to inkjet printing and roll-to-roll
processing for flexible solar materials manufacturing.
