9352108 Warnet A Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph/Mass Selective Detector
(GC/MSD) system is being used throughout the chemistry curriculum. Students are
having hands-on experience with this instrument in research-oriented experiments
in courses and as part of their research training. In addition, students are
using the instrument in Freshmen Honors Chemistry, in the Organic sequence for
product separation and identification and as part of a synthetic project, and in
the Instrumental Analysis course for analytical experiments. The instrument also
is serving as a key component in our plan to expand research opportunities for
our majors. One research project is using the GC/MSD for separation and
identification of products from a coupling reaction catalyzed by a newly
discovered enzyme. ***
