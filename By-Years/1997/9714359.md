Developments in networking and software technologies are enabling the
integration of geographically distributed compute, storage, network, and other
resources into high-performance distributed computing systems or computational
grids. These computational grids promise to revolutionize high-performance
computing by enabling both the construction of tools providing qualitatively new
capabilities, and wider access to unique resources such as supercomputers,
scientific databases, and instruments. However, major technical advances are
still required if they are to be broadly deployed and used. This workshop will
bring together leading researchers and practitioners to survey the state of the
art in metacomputing, discuss outstanding problems, and identify future
directions for research and development. The final product of the workshop will
be an edited book discussing the state of the art and research challenges in
building a computational grid.
