This proposal is concerned with research in theoretical and computational
nonlinear wave interaction problems and the chaotic mixing associated with
unstable interface-wave interactions. Mathematical theory of hyperbolic
equations will be developed and will be used to the maximum extent possible
within the computational procedure. Reversing this process, computation will be
used as a support to the development of mathematical theory. Such theoretical
developments are basic inputs to front tracking computations, which allow high
resolution study multidimensional wave interactions. Chaotic flow regimes
require stochastic models, which are tested using high resolution front tracking
techniques.
