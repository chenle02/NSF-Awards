9318102 schenck This is a proposal to purchase equipment for the measurement of
fluorescence lifetimes and fluorescence anisotropy lifetimes of biological
macromolecules. The equipment will be capable of recording fluorescence lifetime
decays spanning the time range from 20 ps to 100 ns and longer, and will allow
the use of a wide variety of fluorophores spanning the spectrum to UV to near
infrared. The requested equipment is composed of a titanium sapphire mode locked
laser and associated optical and electronic components. Among other topics, the
equipment will be used to study the mechanism of bacterial photosynthesis (using
peptides that have been manipulated by site directed mutagenesis), charge
separation reactions in bacterial photosynthesis, and energy transfer in
bacteriorhodopsin. u ~ \ ^ _ ` a b c d e g i q r u v w x y z | } ~ 9318102
