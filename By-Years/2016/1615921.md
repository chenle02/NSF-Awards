The overarching goal of the projects supported by this award is to develop
mathematical tools that can describe the structure and properties of networks
and surfaces that model random evolution in random environments. Examples of
this are contact processes which model infections that spread by contact with an
infected neighbor. Other example are voter models which describe the spread of
opinions where an individual's opinions are affected by his or her neighbor's
opinions. Other motivations arise from extending methods of statistical
mechanics classically done on regular lattices to the setting of random lattices
which we may think of as random graphs or networks on a surface. In this work
the PI will provide an improved understanding of such models in terms of random
metrics. One may imagine these metrics are determined by patterns of disease
propagation or social contact. Interestingly the general study of random metrics
arose from physical investigations of two-dimensional (2D) quantum
gravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central problem of 2D quantum gravity, in
mathematical terms, is to rigorously construct a measure on the space of metrics
on a Riemann surface. This is a long-standing problem of both geometric and
physical relevance. But aside from, and perhaps even beyond this, it serves as a
rich source of novel problems and ideas that are at the interface between random
structures and integrable systems. The focus of this proposal is on emerging
crosscurrents of research between probability theory, with an emphasis on random
geometry and combinatorics, and integrable systems theory with an emphasis on
classical analysis, complex function theory, dynamical systems and conservative
partial differential equations.
