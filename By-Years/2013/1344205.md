This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Engineering and Systems Design and
the Manufacturing programs in the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation
Division of the NSF Engineering Directorate and by the Information Integration
and Informatics Program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems
in the NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering
Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research project is to
establish a universal formal computational model for the information that flows
from design into additive manufacturing. This model plays a role similar to that
of the Church-Turing model that underlies general computation. It describes part
geometry and materials while connecting to the physics that underlies a part.
The computational model is necessary to embody complex information and enable
new behaviors in ways that existing tools and technologies cannot
accommodate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the new world of additive manufacturing,
the central embodiment of an artifact, the thing that we buy and sell and
improve, will be the information used to additively manufacture an object, not
the object itself. This project is developing a language in which to express
that information, a language sufficiently rich and rigorous to unleash design
capabilities and control manufacturing processes. Development of such a language
/ model is a critical step to bringing the Maker culture into the economic
mainstream.
