This project will define the stratigraphy and extent of the major volcaniclastic
units and analyze their textures, facies, and depositional characteristics of
the ignimbrites and related surge and lahar deposits. Combination of data from
the reworked and primary deposits will allow interpretation of the history of
explosive volcanism and catastrophic sedimentation, including pyroclastic flow-
lahar transitions. The study will yield data pertinent to several unusual and
important problems: 1) Caldera development in the Taal magmatic system. 2) The
nature of mafic ignimbrites, their shallow submarine equivalents, and
transitions to sediment gravity flows. 3) The emplacement mechanisms of
widespread surge-like deposits that have previously been attributed to base
surges. A by-product of the geological information gained, and the collaboration
with PHIVOLCS, will be an improved understanding of volcanic and related hazards
for the Greater Manila region.
