Green's Function Monte Carlo (GFMC) is a powerful technique for calculating the
ground properties of quantum systems. A major limitation of this technique in
the study of fermionic ground states is the "sign problem." Over the past few
years, Kalos has developed new techniques for eliminating the sign problem in
fermion calculations. This project will extend that approach to attack problems
of interest in condensed matter physics and develop a parallel algorithm to
carry out these calculations on the IBM SP2.
