Modern language documentation projects endeavor to obtain high quality audio
recordings so that the material will be useful for phonetic analysis at a later
point, but it is not clear how useful the material being collected will be. The
present project will examine archival material in three languages to see how
much material, and of what sort, is needed for phonetic description of a
language. To do that, three languages will be studied: Tarahumara/Rar√°muri [ISO
639 tar], Nahuatl of the Balsas valley of central Guerrero [ISO 639 ngu], and
Arapaho [ISO 639 arp]. These each have extensive documentation in existence, and
measurements from these sources will be examined for the statistical properties
of the languages in question. In particular, the number of speakers and
repetitions of items required to give an accurate view of a language's phonetic
structure will be tested. New evidence from Arapaho, including acoustics and
static palatography, will be used as a comparison. A sketch of the phonetics of
the three languages will be produced, along with a deeper analysis of a small
number of specific features. Recommendations for best practice will also be
generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endangered language documentation is of
increasing value to both linguistic science and to indigenous communities. The
phonetic aspects of a language are important for knowing how linguistic
distinctions are made and for possible reconstruction by heritage learners. A
transformative aspect of this research is the definition of phonetic norms not
only for endangered language documentation but for documentation of any
language; despite years of analysis, this issue has not been satisfactorily
resolved. Finally, the project will provide training for students in language
documentation and phonetic analysis.
