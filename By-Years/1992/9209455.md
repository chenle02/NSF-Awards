This project attempts to develop a theoretical framework for analyzing
different aspects of the internal organization structure of large firms, as well
as of contractual nexuses among firms. Particular aspects analyzed include:
hierarchical delegation of authority to design (sub)contracts, the breadth and
depth of hierarchies, planning and supervision activities of managers,
organizational diseconomies of scale, transfer pricing mechanisms, and the
grouping of activities into different divisions. The approach adopted is to
suppose that information regarding cost and market conditions is dispersed among
different agents in the organization, and that they can communicate with one
another in a restricted manner. Managers act strategically with respect to their
private information. The organization is thus characterized by a decentralized
decision-making mechanism which strikes a balance between the advantages of
adaption to location information, and the disadvantage of control losses arising
from managerial incentive problems. The short-term goal of the research is to
develop consistent theoretical models of the above mentioned aspects of
organizational structure. In the long run these models should generate
predictions regarding the connection between organizational structure, and more
fundamental characteristics such as the nature of technology, information
structure, production scale, product demand, and product market competition.
