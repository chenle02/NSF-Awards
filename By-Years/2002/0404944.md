This project is a continuation of highly successful work by this investigator on
the chemical composition of ambient dust particles by consideration of two
toxicologically important radionuclides, Plutonium (Pu) and Americium (Am),
relatively long-lived species primarily resulting from nuclear weapons testing
fallout. Little is currently known regarding atmospheric transport and eventual
fates of these particular radionuclides, and their contribution to radioactive
contamination of ambient airborne aerosols. This study will quantify Pu and Am
activity in atmospheric soil aerosols measured at sites where dust from major
source regions in Asia or Africa can be sampled. These data will be compared
with historical U.S. data to identify similarities and/or differences in
radionuclide contamination. This research will provide an improved understanding
of biogeochemical cycling of dust and radionuclides in the ambient global
atmosphere, and potentially have important implications for homeland security
with respect to release of radioactive materials to the atmosphere. Other
broader impacts of this project include collaborations with a number of domestic
and international institutions, which will facilitate technology transfer and
considerable value-added science. A full-time graduate student and a number of
undergraduate assistants will be involved in the project providing valuable
research experience and professional development opportunities to these young
scientists. The project also includes a variety of scientific and community
outreach activities, including the development of web-based educational
materials.
