The notion of "bounded combinatorics" in the complex of curves on a surface
controls geometry in a variety of settings. Understanding and bounding how
simple closed curves on a surface can project to subsurfaces provides tools to
construct models for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, classify Weil-Petersson geodesics,
and elucidate the fine topological structure in boundaries of deformation
spaces. Indeed, the existence and uniqueness of hyperbolic structures on
3-manifolds gives little information about their geometric features and their
connection to topological properties of the manifold. Through his expansion of
the use of the bi-Lipschitz Model Theorem (of the PI with Canary and Minsky),
the PI will explore geometric models for arbitrary closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds
and connect their structure to combinatorial features of the manifold. This
ongoing project with collaborators Minsky, Namazi and Souto will produce
explicit models for Heegaard splittings, and a new weak geometrization for
3-manifolds arising as infinite gluings with bounded combinatorics. Further, the
PI will apply coarse methods in the study of the mapping class group via the
curve complex and its associated "hierarchy paths" to understand the large scale
structure of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmueller space, a fundamental
object whose large scale geometry remains mysterious despite many
investigations. Finally, the PI will exhibit further features of the deformation
space of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, generalizing our study of the local topology
of deformation spaces with Bromberg, Canary, and Minsky, and undertaking
generalized studies of central compactness theorems for deformation spaces in
the context of the curve complex.

In mathematics, the study of dynamical systems seeks to describe chaotic
phenomena in simple terms. Sometimes dynamical systems can exhibit a kind of
rigidity, where a small tweak or perturbation does not affect the long term
behavior of the system. In the context of understanding our own three-
dimesnsional universe and what kind of structures three-dimensional spaces can
have, structures give rise to these rigid dynamical systems. The recent work of
Grisha Perelman solving the famous Poincare Conjecture has ensured this study
applies to virtually all three-dimensional spaces. When a space is rigid, one
can understand it completely via "coarse" information, via so-called "models."
In a recent result of the PI with R. Canary and Y. Minsky, such models were used
to classify all constantly negatively curved, or "hyperbolic" three-dimensional
spaces of infinite volume that are tame in a certain sense. The classification
result solved a long-standing conjecture of William Thurston, and opened the
door to developing a more detailed and complete picture of geometries on
manifolds previously considered understood. The groundwork is in place for a
fundamental investigation of algebraic and topological properties of all spaces
of 3-dimensions and how these properties interrelate.
