This award for the LIGO Visitors Program will provide support for visitors to
the LIGO Project to become involved in the science and techniques associated
with the field of gravitational wave detection. At the same time visitors will
contribute their accumulated skills and abilities to enhance the performance of
the LIGO resident staff. The work will be performed initially at the LIGO
laboratories at Caltech and MIT and later at the two observatories in Washington
and Louisiana. Approximately three visitors are expected at any one time. The
preferred length of stay will be for one year although shorter stays, consistent
with the aims of the program, will be considered.
