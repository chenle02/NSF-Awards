Until very recently, characters that would allow us to record biogeographic
histories upon very recent landscapes (in geologic time) were not readily
available. Patterns discerned from restriction enzyme and electrophoretic data
can be used to estimate the historical pattern of relationship between distinct
physiographic regions, based on the analysis of concordance between patterns of
common ancestry in organisms and the inferred history of physical changes that
variously allow dispersal or that erect barriers between regions. A number of
biological attributes suggest that mice in the genus Onychomys provide an
excellent opportunity to reconstruct a model of late Tertiary and Quaternary
(i.e., the past 3-4 million years or so) biogeographic flux among deserts and
grasslands in North America. Additionally, this study will provide a synthesis
of data (molecular, morphological, and behavioral) that will serve to initiate
investigations into patterns of variation across a range of levels of biological
organization, from phenotype to nucleotide sequence.
