This award supports participation in a three-day workshop on recent advances in
geometric representation theory and moduli spaces to be held October 20-22, 2023
at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The workshop will focus on
recent advances in geometric representation theory (the theory of symmetries)
and moduli spaces in algebraic geometry (the study of zeroes of polynomial
equations). The workshop will consist of ten to twelve talks spread over three
days, allowing plenty of time for additional discussions. Participation of
graduate students and postdocs will be encouraged. Spaces that parameterize
geometric objects are known as moduli spaces, and are central to the study of
algebraic geometry and representation theory. There have been many recent
developments on moduli space theory, perhaps the most significant is the
emphasis of general stack theoretic results over traditional Geometric Invariant
Theory based approaches to moduli space theory. Moduli stacks of bundles over
curves are closely related to the theory of conformal blocks and the geometric
Langlands program. A recent development has been a twisted theory of conformal
blocks. There have been a series on recent developments in the geometric
Langlands program, and connections with arithmetic are getting more apparent.
Affine flag varieties (including affine Grassmannians and semi-infinite flag
manifolds) are known to be related to representation theory of affine Lie
algebras, quantum groups, and algebraic groups. The workshop will focus on these
topics, and bring together experts in these areas, with an emphasis on the work
of younger mathematicians. The workshop website is https://tarheels.live/grtm/.
