In the past decade, several procedures devised by economic theorists have been
employed for high value resource allocation problems. These include auctions for
radio spectrum in many countries, electrical power sales, and carbon emissions
reductions in the UK, as well as matching processes for physicians and
psychologists. Most of the new processes are "cumulative offer processes:"
multi-round processes in which offers either remain on the table or could remain
on the table without affecting the outcome of the mechanism. Recent proposals to
conduct "package auctions" (also known as "combinatorial auctions") for radio
spectrum in the US and UK and to use auctions for train scheduling have met with
success in laboratory experiments using other cumulative offer processes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed here is a detailed exploration of
the theory of cumulative offer processes. I anticipate obtaining several kinds
of results. These will include (1) a complete characterization of the market
situations in which cumulative offer processes can guarantee stable ("core")
allocations, (2) an extended analysis of the welfare properties of the
processes, answering questions about who benefits most from which design, (3)
the development of new algorithms that succeed with high probability for
matching markets like the market for new medical residents, in which we know
that no algorithm can always guarantee a stable outcome, (4) a unification of
the theories of matching markets and auction markets, and (5) a game theoretic
analysis of auction and matching processes when the participants have poor
information about one another's values&lt;br/&gt;
