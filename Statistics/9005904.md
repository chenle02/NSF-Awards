This research will focus on the development of static and dynamic graphical
tools to aid in making inferences from statistical models. One of the primary
methods for this work is the display of two-dimensional projections of contours
of a function of many parameters. This method was introduced as a technique for
inference in nonlinear regression but it can be applied to any statistical model
where an objective function, such as a likelihood or posterior density, is
associated with the parameters. This project is in the general area of
statistics and computational mathematics. The graphical modeling has application
in chemical engineering, pharmacokinetics, food science, polymer science and
chemical kinetics.
