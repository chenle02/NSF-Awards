Abstract ATM-9416701 Feldstein, Steven Pennsylvania State University Title: Low-
Frequency Zonally-Averaged Flow Variability Studied with Models and Observations
The primary objective of the proposed research is to investigate the role of the
zonally averaged flow on atmospheric low frequency variability. A combined
approach of examining the real observations, the outputs of idealized simple
models and realistic complex global models is being adopted to achieve this
goal. This approach can enhance our understanding of the fundamental dynamics of
low frequency variability of the atmosphere. Details of dynamical mechanisms
associated with the maintenance, onset and decay of both high and low zonal
index phases will be examined. Regional teleconnection patterns and blocking and
their relationship with zonal index will be studied. The role of SST in the
interannual variability of the zonal index will also be investigated. Low
frequency oscillations of the atmosphere are intimately related to medium and
extended range forecasting. This research has potential for improving forecast
models and in turn forecasts.
