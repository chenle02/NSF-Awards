Polymer and polyer composites are finding increasing applications in bothe the
civilian and noncivilian sector. Processing of these materials is a significant
fraction of the total cost. For cost effectiveness it is necessary to develop
novel processing techniques. The workshop with attendees from both university
and industry would address the research needs and opportunities in the
processing of polymers and polymer composites.
