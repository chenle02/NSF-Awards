9403174 Shear Dr. Jason B. Shear has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Shear received his doctoral degree from Stanford
University under the supervision of Professor Richard Zare. Dr. Shear will
continue research at Cornell University under the sponsorship of Profesor Watt
Webb. His postdoctoral research will involve technique development and
application of laser scanning fluoresence microscopy imaging to study
electrophysiological events in neurons. Longer term, he plans to develop and
utilize other fast analytical techniques for characterizing dynamic chemical
events in biological systems. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
