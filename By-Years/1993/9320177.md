9320177 Thompson This award provides funds to purchase Coordinate Measuring
Machine (CMM) accessories which will be dedicated to support research in
computer and information science and engineering. Specific items include a tool
rack to allow automatic exchange of probes without recalibration, a rotary table
to allow part repositioning under CIMS software control without recalibration,
and the CIMS software upgrade needed to operate each of these. The equipment
will be used for several research projects, including in particular: Sensing
strategies and tactics for the validation and reverse engineering of
manufactured parts, emphasizing the detection and recognition of complex
manufacturing features; automated feature-based inspection of manufacturing
operations; and representations for tolerance specification which unify design,
manufacturing, and measurement. For each of these projects, experimentation
requires the ability to acquire accurate three-dimensional data about real
objects. The requested equipment will allow the CMM currently installed in the
laboratory to make measurements of objects with more complex shape than is
currently possible and to do so in a more autonomous manner than it can now
accomplish. In addition, the rotary table will significantly enhance the utility
of a 3-D range camera to position objects to increase the accuracy of range
sensing and acquire multiple calibrated views of the same object from different
viewpoints. *** TERMINALHLP @ j 9320177 Thompson This award provides funds to
