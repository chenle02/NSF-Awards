ABSTRACT The research is designed to illuminate the psycholinguistic processes
involved in implementing long-distance dependencies during language production.
Such dependencies constitute a considerable theoretical challenge, since the
abstract structural knowledge required to reliably format the discontinuous
elements does not straightforwardly mesh with articulatory requirement of
incremental, word-by-word production. The dependencies to be explored are,
primarily, number agreement between subjects and verbs, and, secondarily, number
agreement between subjects and subject anaphors. Because verb agreement in
English may call on a range of information about number from the nonlinguistic
message, from the lexicon, from the morphology, and from other sources, it
offers many opportunities to examine the transmission and interaction of
information during language production. Conversely, because it exhibits strict
syntactic conditioning, it offers opportunities to observe constraints on the
transmission and interaction of information. Predictions about the nature of
information transmission and the types of constraints likely to operate are
derived from an approach to production developed by Garrett (1975, 1988) and
elaborated by others (Bock, 1987a; Lapointe, 1985; Lapointe &amp; Dell, 1989;
Levelt, 1989). The experiments employ agreement-error elicitation tasks in
tandem with timed pronunciation tasks to explore the nature of the number
information used in the agreement operation, the nature of subject
identification and maintenance operations, and the processing demands of
agreement implementation.
