Lay Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Animals recognize and respond to many
different volatile chemicals in their environment using specialized nerve cells
called olfactory neurons. We are interested in understanding how the specific
functional properties of individual olfactory neurons are defined during
development. We are exploring this issue in the model genetic organism, the
small soil nematode C. elegans. C. elegans responds to and discriminates among
thousands of environmental chemicals using a small set of olfactory neurons
including the AWA, AWB and AWC neurons. We propose to investigate how the
functions of the AWB neurons are defined developmentally. In previous work, we
identified three genes that play important roles during AWB development. In
animals mutant for the kin-29 protein kinase gene, the AWB neurons fail to
correctly express a subset of olfactory receptor proteins. In sns-11 mutants,
the AWB neurons do not exhibit any AWB-specific functional or morphological
properties, while in sns-9 mutant animals, additional AWB-like neurons are
observed. We will utilize genetic, molecular and biochemical techniques to
further investigate the roles of these three genes in AWB neuron development. We
expect that our findings will not only yield insights into the mechanisms by
which functional diversity is achieved among olfactory neurons, but also provide
information regarding the basic principles underlying neuronal
development.&lt;br/&gt;
