This project explores the financial impact of marriage for women. It does this
using data from the Civil War pension files, a unique source of information
about the income and marriage histories of Union Army widows during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. According to the theoretical economics
model of marriage, women with better alternatives to marriage, or greater
"outside options," will spend more time searching for husbands and will make
higher quality matches. Intuitively, if a woman can support herself while
single, she will be willing to wait longer for a better mate. Widows' pensions
can be plausibly considered an "outside option" because they ceased upon
remarriage. The researcher will construct a sample of widows from the Union Army
database created by the Center for Population Economics at the University of
Chicago, and collected information about these widows' pensions and subsequent
marriages from the Civil War pension files at the National Archives in
Washington, DC. Preliminary results suggest that receiving a pension
significantly lowered the rate of remarriage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
contributes to a growing empirical literature on the gains from marriage, with a
focus on women. It identifies a novel way of characterizing these gains by
isolating a source of income that is unrelated to women's individual
characteristics and which does not contribute to output within a marriage, which
means that it should not affect women's "attractiveness" to potential mates.
Pension eligibility depended only on the circumstances of a widow's husband's
death, and it ceased upon remarriage. More broadly, this project will improve
our understanding of the way in which marriage decisions were made during the
nineteenth century, and will provide new evidence that will help to understand
and predict the influence of labor mobility and employment options on marriage
today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most significant impact of this project is the
creation of an original database that other researchers will be able to use.
This is significant not only because the database is new, but because data that
follow women through marriage during the nineteenth century are exceedingly
rare. The project has potential policy implications, as it will contribute to
our understanding of the welfare effects of social programs that alter
incentives around marriage and childbearing for women.
