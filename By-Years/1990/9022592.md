The purpose of the UTSA/RCMS Program is to increase the number of well-
prepared minority students who can successfully gain acceptance into the best
graduate programs in mathematics, statistics, and computer science and to help
to develop a strong research curriculum that will prepare students for ressarch
and professional careers in these areas. To this end, UTSA will recruit and
train honors minority undergraduate students. The students will be strongly
research oriented and will emphasize research opportunities for students with
faculty supervisors. The faculty participants will be asked to commit themselves
to mentor relationships with students and to encourage them to pursue graduate
training. The curriculum in each of the selected areas will be enhanced through
Honors Research Seminars, Independent Research courses, a Distinguished Guest
Lecturer series, off-campus summer research and special workshops which will
become part of the required curriculum for all RCMS students. Each scholars with
GPA>=3.0 will be selected for the program each year.
