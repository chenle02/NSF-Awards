9724464 Flament The University of Hawaii will acquire and install an array of
high frequency Doppler radars, capable of mapping surface ocean currents within
a distance of up to 70 km, operate the array, analyze the resulting data, and
produce various products that will support oceanographic research. The radar
array will provide time series of currents at a resolution of 3 km and data will
be updated often enough to provide good spatial and temporal coverage for
studying dynamic processes. Radar-derived data on currents will be compared with
data from traditional current meters. The PIs anticipate that advances will be
made in understanding processes such as tidal propagation around islands,
formation and decay of island-trapped waves, and eddy generation in the lee of
islands. Studies of biological processes such as recruitment of pelagic larvae
to adult coastal habitats, requiring information on advection by ocean currents
will also benefit from this new capability. An important byproduct of this
project will be real-time dissemination of surface current maps to aid those
with a requirement for such data, such as ship routing, coastal zone management,
pollution abatement, nearshore sediment transport and other uses. The University
is cost-sharing this project.
