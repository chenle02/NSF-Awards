9706391 Kepezhinskas Paleomagnetic data has proven key to the interpretation of
terrane migration and accretion along several convergent continental margins,
with Alaska being as notable example. Existing data suggests that the Kamchatka
Peninsula, Russia may also be a college of accreted allochthonous terranes, but
the geologic and paleomagnetic data base is not extensive, and the area is
difficult logistically. This project will attempt to place the paleomagnetic and
geologic data on a firmer base so that plate kinematic models related to terrane
emplacement can be formulated and tested. Results will increase knowledge about
terranes in Kamchatka and provide the basis for understanding displacement
histories of northern Pacific terranes.
