Many geometric and arithmetic objects have symmetries that can be encoded in the
mathematical notion of a group. Often such groups possess additional structure,
forming what is known as an algebraic group. The PI plans to work on several
research projects related to algebraic groups and their internal structure, as
well as their associated geometric and arithmetic objects, especially symmetric
spaces. In addition the PI plans to write three books during the duration of
this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research of the PI includes work with
Brian Conrad and Ofer Gabber on the classification of pseudo-reductive algebraic
groups, with Andrei Rapinchuk on arithmetically defined locally symmetric
spaces, and with Sai-Kee Yeung in complex algebraic geometry. Under this award
the PI proposes to investigate new directions related to these collaborations.
He will also continue his work on the congruence subgroup problem and the
Margulis-Platonov conjecture (the latter gives a description of the normal
subgroups of the group of rational points of a simply-connected semi-simple
group defined over a global field). In another direction, the PI has associated
a Levi subgroup to any irreducible admissible representation of a reductive
p-adic group. He proposes to investigate the role of this Levi subgroup in the
construction and classification of representations. The three books the PI plans
to write are one on the Bruhat-Tits theory of reductive groups over
nonarchimedean local fields, one on Lie groups based on his graduate courses at
the University of Michigan, and one, jointly with Andrei Rapinchuk, on the
congruence subgroup problem.
