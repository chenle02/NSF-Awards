We propose to continue our investigations in several versions of "functorial
calculus". Each of these is a technique that exploits multirelative connectivity
estimates to describe continuous functors in some context in terms of special
values; for example a functor of spaces might be recovered from its values at
highly connected spaces, or a functor of subspaces of a manifold from its values
at low-dimensional subspaces, or a functor of real inner product spaces from its
values at high-dimensional spaces. Part of the proposal is to refine the purely
homotopy-theoretic version of "calculus". Other parts are concerned with
combining several versions and applying them to various questions in both high-
and low-dimensional differential topology.

Each "functorial calculus" mentioned above is so called because of a not-
entirely-fanciful resemblance to the ordinary diferential calculus of Newton and
Leibniz. Sometimes a fact about numbers is best proved by placing it in a
context where the number is part of a huge family of numbers -- a numerical
function. Properties of the function then lead, by general theorems of calculus
that may seem a bit magical when encountered for the first time, to a
computation of the number. So it is here: sometimes a fact about some
geometrically defined object is best proved by placing it in a context where the
object is part of a huge family of such objects -- a functor -- and using some
magic of a more modern kind. This analogy may show something of the flavor of
the work; the content is harder to get at, because most of the "geometric"
objects in question are connected to everyday reality by rather long chains of
abstract ideas.
