Symmetry is ubiquitous in nature and in mathematics. Mathematicians understand
and quantify symmetry via symmetry groups and their actions (or representations)
on objects. For example, the bilateral symmetry of many animals is encoded by a
reflection operation, while one needs both rotations and reflections to describe
the more elaborate symmetry of a crystal. The noncommutativity inherent in some
settings such as quantum physics, that nevertheless possess some symmetry, is
sometimes viewed via actions of the Hopf algebras that generalize symmetry
groups. This project investigates questions about representations of Hopf
algebras and related algebraic structures. Hopf algebras arise in many fields of
mathematics, such as combinatorics, number theory, topology, and mathematical
physics, and results on their representations are of wide interest. The research
project involves many collaborators and serves as a good training ground for the
many graduate students, postdocs, and other young mathematicians with whom the
PI works.

Categories of representations of Hopf algebras are tensor categories, a rich
structure arising from their coproducts. In comparison to groups, Hopf algebras
can behave quite differently and surprisingly. Tensor categories of
representations can be noncommutative, in contrast to those of groups, leading
to some curious behavior. This project investigates support variety theory and
the triangulated category structure of these noncommutative categories of
representations, with the goal of developing it much more completely, as has
been done in the (commutative) case of finite groups and finite group schemes.
In order to make such progress, the project will also need to advance
homological understanding of (finite dimensional) Hopf algebras, whose
cohomology is conjectured to be finitely generated. In work with collaborators,
the PI aims to prove the conjecture for some important classes of Hopf algebras,
namely the pointed Hopf algebras of diagonal type that include as a special case
the small quantum groups. In contrast to the better-understood small quantum
groups, many in this larger class of Hopf algebras may have noncommutative
categories of representations, and one must take more care in homological work
as this leads to subtle differences. Some related homological projects involve
an action of a Hopf algebra on an algebra, which may be studied by constructing
a larger algebra built out of the two. The PI will study such smash product
algebras and their Hochschild cohomology, in particular the Gerstenhaber algebra
structure, and related deformations.
