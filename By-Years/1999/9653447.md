Non specialist faculty at universities and colleges have few opportunities to
keep up with current research, and they are often required to teach subjects
beyond their area of expertise. For these and other reasons they may be unable
to offer up-to-date pedagogical techniques and disciplinary perspectives. The
Institute for Advanced Study/Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI) seeks
funding to enhance the expertise and teaching ability of undergraduate
mathematics faculty. Specifically, the program seeks to expose faculty to
cutting-edge research, impart new teaching methods, and strengthen their
understanding of the mathematics enterprise as a whole. The PCMI is an ongoing,
NSF-funded program which seeks to better integrate the research and educational
aspects of mathematics. For three weeks each summer it brings together
undergraduates, graduate students, researchers, and high school teachers
(approximately 180 persons) for collaborative activities. Undergraduate faculty
would join this program with the goals of honing their mathematical skills,
exploring new educational technologies, and sharing their own expertise. The
PCMI intends to recruit teaching faculty who are motivated toward the reform and
strengthening of undergraduate teaching. We shall especially seek individuals
who are interested in disseminating what they learn, whether through
publications, educational activities, or other means. The program makes a
deliberate effort to recruit women and minority mathematicians, and to provide
regular, objective evaluation of program activities.
