Kinetic theory is at the center of multi-scale modeling, which connects the
microscopic particle models to macroscopic fluid models. There are many
challenging open problems in kinetic theory which are of great importance from
both mathematical and physical standpoints. The main goal of this research is to
continue developing new mathematical methods to resolve open problems in partial
differential equations arising in the kinetic theory and other fields in
mathematical physics. The investigations will include: boundary effects in the
Boltzmann theory for dilute gases, derivation of various macroscopic fluid
models from the kinetic theory, and nonlinear stability and instability of
steady states in a wide range of applied problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These
research projects will have important impacts in many areas of physical
sciences. The study of stable equilibria in the Vlasov theory (collisionless
Boltzmann theory) will shed new light on plasma control in nuclear fusion and on
galaxy evolution; the study of the Stefan problem will build a mathematical
foundation for morphological stability of crystal growth and many other problems
arising in materials sciences; and the study of phase-transitions in the Vlasov-
Boltzmann model will lead to better understanding of phase segregation in binary
fluids. An important objective of the project is to provide training for
students and junior scientists involved in carrying out this research.
