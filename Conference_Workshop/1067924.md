This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the
international "Conference on Microlocal Methods in Mathematical Physics and
Global Analysis" that will be held from June 13-17, 2011, at the Mathematical
Institute of the University of Tubingen, Germany.

This conference will focus on a variety of topics in mathematical physics and
the theory of partial differential equations on so-called singular spaces,
viewed through the lens provided by the well-established methods of microlocal
analysis. All of the topic areas referred to in the proposal are central to
analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the
meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be
otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.
