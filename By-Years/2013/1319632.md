This project will tackle quantifier elimination by using group analysis.
Quantifier elimination is a problem of taking a complex formula (with
quantifiers) and producing an equivalent but simpler formula (without
quantifiers). Numerous non-trivial and important problems in science and
engineering can be reduced to quantifier elimination problems. Hence any
progress in quantifier elimination can have significant and broad impact on
science and engineering. Group analysis is an approach of applying group theory
to simplify or elucidate a difficult problem, as manifested in algebraic and
differential Galois theories, theories of Lie groups and Lie algebras, among
many others. In particular, the group analysis significantly extended the
practical solvability of various differential equations arising in science and
engineering.

This project aims to make further progress in quantifier elimination by using
group analysis. The main idea is to simplify a quantified formula via group
analysis before carrying quantifier elimination. Preliminary investigation shows
that group analysis could provide dramatic speed-up, when there is a hidden
group structure in the problem (which is often the case due to various intrinsic
symmetries in the nature).

The scientific goal of the project is to develop theory, algorithms, and
software packages that will be used by scientists and engineers for solving ever
more non-trivial problems. The educational goal of the project is to train
future researchers (PhD students) and to inspire undergraduate students via REU
programs and independent studies.
