This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Determining
population structure and dynamics of Class II transposable element families in
Arabidopsis thaliana, using a coalescence-based population genetic approach."
Transposons are major constituents of most eukaryotic genomes that can
dramatically alter genomic architecture, individual fitness, and species
evolution. Little is known about population dynamics and behavior of
transposons. In this research, the availability of complete genome sequence and
biological informatics capability provides a novel opportunity to evaluate their
impact and the forces that influence their movement.
