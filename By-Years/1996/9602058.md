This project investigates ethical and conceptual issues raised by racial and
ethnic classifications in demography, particularly in the context of the 2000
census. Currently, the Office of Management and Budget's Directive 15 governs
the collection not only of census data but of all federal data concerning race
and ethnicity. Over the last several years that directive has come under
increasing scrutiny. Some argue that new categories, such as a `multiracial`
category, ought to be added; others propose changing the names of certain
categories; and some suggest scrapping the entire racial/ethnic classification
scheme. The considerable research under way focuses on empirical questions, such
as how various groups understand and use the descriptors. However, the relevance
of this research for proposed revisions requires an understanding also of the
ethical, conceptual, and methodological issues underlying racial and ethnic
classification. This project will analyze these issues and consider their
significance for competing schemes. One set of issues concerns ethical and
policy choices, such as whether the harms of past classification schemes are
best redressed by preserving, refining, or eliminating them. Answering this
question requires an examination of the significance of racial and ethnic
identity and of the legitimacy of the purposes served by racial classification.
Demographic research needs raise another set of problems, including the
requirement of comparability between past classification schemes and future
ones, the issue of measurement effects -- how and to what extent different
classification schemes may affect what is measured, and the role and
significance of self reports in data collection. The research is a collaboration
between philosophers, a lawyer-social psychologist, and a demographer. Each will
lead a different aspect of the research, which will employ the methods of moral
philosophy, philosophy of science, legal analysis and demography. Among the
products of the research will be a memorandum submitted to OMB, a series of
papers to be published in appropriate journals including public policy journals,
and an anthology.
