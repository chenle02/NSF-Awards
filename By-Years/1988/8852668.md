The project is designed to develop a series of computer-aided design experiments
based on finite-element methods for use in the analysis and design of typical
generic electrical engineering components or structures such as transformers,
reactors, actuators, electric machines, transmission lines, and magnetic
recording heads. The experiments will exploit specific or modified finite-
element software packages which deal exclusively with electromagnetics and run
on microcomputers. These computer experiments will become an integral part of
the course offerings in electric energy systems. The laboratory will have a
strong impact in the teaching of electromagnetic field theory and its
applications.
