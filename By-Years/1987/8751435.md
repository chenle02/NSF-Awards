The National Aquarium in Baltimore will create 20 interactive interpretive
exhibits relating to cetaceans as an integral part of a new Marine Mammal
complex opening in 1989. Exhibits will complement cetacean behavior
demonstrations conducted by mammologists in a 1300 seat marine amphitheater.
Exhibit topics and content will be developed in response to survey and
evaluation data on popular interests and misconceptions about marine mammals by
a design team consisting of aquarium staff, educators, marine scientists,
designers, and evaluators. The resulting interactive exhibits will be seen by
one and a half million visitors a year in an exhibit area adjacent to the marine
amphitheater where visitors will gather prior to and after scheduled
demonstrations. NSF project support will be matched by an equal contribution
from the National Aquarium.
