The XVIth International Congress of Genetics will be held in Toronto, Canada,
August 20-27, 1988. The theme of the Congress will be "Genetics and the Unity of
Biology". The program will be organized into five divisions: I. Genes and
chromosomes, II. Genomes and organisms, III. Populations and evolution, IV.
Genetics and society, and V. Biotechnology. Each division will contain symposia,
workshops and posters. Eleven plenary lectures will also be given. The Congress,
the first in five years, will provide a unique setting for the synthesis of
general concepts derived from many different organisms and systems. The
workshops and posters should stimulate cross fertilization of ideas on
approaches and techniques. U.S. participation will enhance American genetics by
the exchange of information that will take place. Success of the Congress will
depend significantly upon American participation because of the predominant
position of American scientists in the field of Genetics. This award will
provide partial support for the travel of U.S. Scientists to attend and
participate in this important Congress.
