The research supported by this CAREER award examines the role of the naturally
occurring neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) in the brain and its effects on
the physiological functions of interneurons. The excitatory networks of higher
brain structures, such as the hippocampus, consist primarily of relay neurons.
The activity of these cells is controlled by local inhibitory synaptic
interactions, mediated by a small number of specialized cells called
interneurons. These interneurons are a diverse group of cells, each presumably
responsible for a distinct form of synaptic inhibition. The hippocampus receives
a large input of NE-containing fibers, many of which appear to form contacts
with interneurons, suggesting that the noradrenergic system may regulate
synaptic inhibition through direct actions on interneurons. NE has been
implicated in the regulation of sleep, arousal, learning and memory, but our
understanding of how different subsets of NE-responsive interneurons modulate
these neural processes is incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evidence suggests
that NE differentially regulates at least two discrete, functionally defined,
subpopulations of inhibitory hippocampal interneurons. To test this hypothesis,
this CAREER project will use an interdisciplinary approach combining
electrophysiological, molecular-biological and neuroimaging techniques in the
in-vitro rat hippocampus to (i) characterize the effects of NE on different
populations of interneurons, (ii) identify the receptors mediating these NE
responses, and (iii) determine the morphological profile of interneurons
affected by NE. In addition to extending our basic understanding of how NE
modulates interneuron function, the information derived from this project may
yield important insights into the mechanisms underlying certain cognitive and
behavioral states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigator will integrate
education with his research efforts by developing and teaching in undergraduate-
and graduate-level neuroscience courses, and participating in outreach programs
to encourage more high-school and undergraduate students (especially women and
minorities) to consider and pursue careers in science. As part of the continued
mentoring, a team of students will be trained to conduct the proposed research.
In addition, benefiting both students and other faculty, the investigator will
help establish and direct an electrophysiology core facility. Thus, this CAREER
award will not only advance our understanding of how NE affects hippocampal
network function, but also allow for high-quality training and research
facilities, providing stimulating educational experiences for both present and
future generations of neuroscientists.
