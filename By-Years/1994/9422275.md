This research project will analyze the role and nature of business and strategic
planning in driving the effective implementation and continuing development of
Total Quality Management (TQM). The study will characterize effective planning
processes, identify barriers to implementation and other areas which cause
difficulty, and examine the way in which planning systems evolve in conjunction
with the development of a TQM system. An important aspect of the research will
be the examination of processes for resource allocation in conjunction with the
planning process; in particular, researchers will investigate the way in which
difficult-to-measure costs are incorporated into the decision-making process. A
key goal of the research will be to improve the integration of business planning
and quality systems planning. The research methods involve in-depth and on-site
assessments of the planning systems of organizations in varying stages of
development of their TQM systems. Interviews with employees at all levels and
review of company documentation will be the primary data sources;survey methods
may be used as a supplement. Companies participating in the study include
AT&amp;T Transmission Systems, First Chicago Bank, and Hewlett Packard.
