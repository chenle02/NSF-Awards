An analytical transmission electron microscope will be used to strengthen
research programs in metallurgy and materials science and engineering in the
Armour College of Engineering and Science at the Illinois Institute of
Technology. This electron microscope will enhance the current research programs
of an expanding faculty in the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering
Department on: intermetallic compounds, nickel-base superalloys, high-strength
low alloy steels, railroad steels, eutectic systems, ceramics and ceramic matrix
composites. It will also be used by solid state physicists, biologists, chemists
and chemical and mechanical engineers. The microscope will have a strong impact
on the ability of IIT's materials community to develop new research programs and
the quality of both graduate and undergraduate education.
