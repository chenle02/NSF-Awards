This award supports cooperative research between Michael Neushul, Marine
Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, and X.G. Fei,
Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao on the genetics of
Chinese and American kelp. The objective of the research is to define genetic
aspects of the reproductive life history of kelps using new genetic techniques.
The Chinese have been paricularly successful in breeding better kelp strains for
aquaculture and in producing parthenosporophytes. American and other researchers
have had good success with obtaining hybrids between these various taxa of kelp.
This research effort combines these backgrounds with newly developed techniques
for studying genomes to understand kelp genetics. This project is jointly
sponsored by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the US-PRC Protocol
on Cooperation in Basic Sciences.
