The goal of this research is to develop a prototype of a highly interactive
"identification workbench" in the domain of plant- parasitic nematode genera.
The system will be based on principles central to both expert systems and to
expert workstations. There are important interactive systems questions, as the
group of users is a diverse one, varying from novice to expert on domain
knowledge, as well as familiarity with modern computing environments. Dealing
with this diverse group will be handled through the "set of available tools"
paradiam from expert workstations. Graphical assistance will be available to the
identifier, and the object- oriented environment of Smalltalk presents a
powerful and fully integrated environment in which objects will help unify the
system model and the user's model of the identification process. The problem
area is challenging and appropriate from the point of view of expert systems
because nematode identification is highly problematic with weighty economic
consequences, there are very few expert taxonomists and poor geographic
distribution of existing ones, there is large variability within taxa, several
important factors introduce different kinds of uncertainty, and the overall
identification process is based on rules of thumb. Efforts to codify the
knowledge in the domain and assist with the development of an underlying
architecture are proceeding in parallel with this project. The concepts of
protomorphs and nuclei will be fully developed and refined by a panel of about
thirty of the approximately forty expert nematologist worldwide. These experts
will also help characterize the identification process and evaluate the finished
prototype.
