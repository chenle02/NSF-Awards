9316974 Stump The Himalaya provides an opportunity to study continent- continent
orogenesis. This project will collect fission-track data and structural
information from the Everest area of eastern Nepal to address the thermotectonic
and exhumation history of the Higher Himalaya. Results will be useful in
determining uplift dynamics and climatic/environmental effects of the Himalaya's
rise.
