The purpose of Dr. Meinke's research is to identify genes with essential
functions during plant embryo development. The approach is to isolate and
characterize embryo-lethal mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. He here proposes to
1) continue the analysis of embryonic lethals with interesting patterns of
abnormal development; 2) attempt to identify genes with important developmental
rather than housekeeping functions; and 3) develop strategies for the molecular
isolation of mutant genes. Several different models have been proposed to
facilitate the identification of genes with important developmental functions.
He plans to test these models by isolating additional mutants with unusual
patterns of development, defects in genes expressed only during embryogenesis,
lethal phases that correspond to a critical stage in morphogenesis, and arrested
embryos that are green rather than white. Three different approaches to
molecular analysis of embryonic lethals will be pursued in collaboration with
other laboratories; 1) gene tagging with T-DNA following seed transformation; 2)
gene tagging with maize transposable elements; and 3) chromosome walking and
molecular complementation through transformation. He proposes to focus his
attention on three mutants with particularly interesting phenotypes; the biotin
auxotroph (bio1); a fused cotyledon/rootless mutant (emb30); and a green blimp
mutant with no apical meristems (emb22). Additional mutants will be mapped in
preparation for gene isolation through chromosome walking. %%% Developmental
mutants have been used in a variety of animal systems to identify genes with
important developmental functions. This proposal extends that approach to the
genetically approachable plant, Arabidopsis.
