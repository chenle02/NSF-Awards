This award enables Vassar College to connect to NSFNET through a 19,200 bit per
second link to NSFNET through the mid-level network NYSERNet. Access to NSFNET
provides the faculty and students with access to supercomputers, data archives,
a variety of network gateways, automated library catalogs, and a wide range of
software. Primary applications include file transfers, electronic mail
communication between local and remote researchers, and remote login to and use
of supercomputers and other research facilities.
