Large vortical structures have been observed to form at the base of moderate
sized fires and to propagate upwards as the fuel and air are mutually consumed.
This research seeks to understand how and why these structures form, to quantify
their effect on the entrainment of air and the burning rate of the fuel, and to
identify the similarities and differences in the near-field fluid mechanics
among pool fires, strongly buoyant nonreacting jets, and natural convection
above heated horizontal surfaces. Simultaneous measurements are made of the
fluctuating concentration and velocity at multiple locations inside a large, low
speed helium jet flowing vertically into air to simulate a pool fire. The
fluctuating temperature and velocity are measured also above burning alcohol
pools up to nearly one meter in diameter. A three-dimensional, transient
numerical model of the nonreacting system is being developed to interpret the
experimental results. The results of this research will provide a quantitative
basis for the prediction of pool fires. Because it will be based on the
fundamental interpretation of results from medium-sized plumes experiments, such
understanding will be applicable also to fires of larger dimensions, which are
of frequent concern to the community (spills, fuel tanks, etc...).
