The Missouri Research and Education Network (MOREnet) is establishing a
connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line for two community
colleges and a community college district comprising three campuses. The
institutions are Mineral Area College, St. Charles County Community College, and
the Metropolitan Community College District. The connection enables the
faculties and students to communicate and collaborate with the international
scientific and educational community, and to access network resources such as
libraries, databases and supercomputers. This award funds part of the costs for
two years.
