This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at Alma College to
initiate a summer undergraduate research experience for eight students. A
substantial portion of participants will be recruited from Stillman College, a
historically black institution. Participants will learn modern methodology in
the areas of molecular genetics and insect reproductive biochemistry of flour
beetles in the family Tenebrionidae. Students will progress from work on a
common project (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) to independent
investigations involving techniques such as: ELISAs, Western blotting,
immunohistochemistry, DNA purification, DNA compositional analysis, genomic
library preparation and screening, and gene sequencing. Special attention will
be given to enabling the students to become expert in a few techniques while
understanding the ramifications of all techniques used in the project. Each
student will be responsible for integrating all data generated through the above
techniques for a particular species under their care culminating in a written
report. Weekly meetings involving all participants will maximize scientific data
exchange, and cooperation among research peers. In addition to the laboratory
component, participants will be exposed to scientists as role models during site
visits to local industrial and academic locations. Additional scientists will be
brought to Alma College for in-depth discussions concerning scientific careers
and their professional preparation. As a part of the follow-up process, contact
with students will be maintained and assistance will be offered with career
choices throughout the subsequent academic year.
