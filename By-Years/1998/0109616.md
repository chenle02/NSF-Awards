This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop the
technology to inhibit and / or to prevent the fibrosis of peritoneal hydrogel
implants. BioHybrid Technologies' microreactors are hydrogel-based sustained-
release devices containing living cells that manufacture and secrete therapeutic
substances. By encapsulating the appropriate cells derived from primary
isolates, cell lines or stem cells; BioHybrid's microreactors can be geared to
the treatment of a large variety of diseases. These microreactors have been
shown to protect the cells from cellular and humoral immunity. However, the
current design is still prone to cellular overgrowth, resulting in suffocation
of cells within the microreactor and ultimately leading to microreactor failure.
The objectives of this project are to determine (1) if anti-fibrotic agents
included in the microreactors or those used systemically can inhibit fibrosis of
microreactors, and (2) if geometric changes made to the microreactors will
render them less fibrogenic. The ability to control or to eliminate the host
fibrotic reaction to such microreactors would represent a major advance in this
promising technology . This is likely to be the last hurdle that must be
overcome to finally bring BioHybrid's microreactor technology into the clinic.

The commercial applications of this project are expected to be immediate and
significant. The final refinement in BioHybrid Technologies' microreactor
technology is likely to lead to substantial improvements in treatment for a
large number of human diseases including diabetes, Alzheimer's, liver failure,
chronic pain, hemophilia, dwarfism, anemia, hypocalcemia, ALS, Parkinson's,
epilepsy, Huntington's, spinal cord injuries, strokes, kidney failure,
immunodeficiencies, and several others. The commercial market for these diseases
is huge, measuring in billions of dollars in the U.S. alone. The therapeutic
improvements that would result from this technology will lower healthcare costs
and enable other technologies that can take advantage of the advances in
therapeutic substance delivery.
