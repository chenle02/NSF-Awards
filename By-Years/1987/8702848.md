The general scientific objective of this program is to discover and investigate
physical phenomena associated with the abrupt termination of a crystal lattice
which occurs at a crystal/vacuum interface, and similar phenomena associated
with crystal expitaxial layer interfaces and with epitaxial multilayer
structures. Specific physical phenomena which are manifestations of intrinsic
surface and interface properties include electronic surface states, relaxation
and reconstruction, surface screening and core level shifts and surface crystal
field effects. These phenomena are studied using a variety of experimental
techniques which are sensitive to structure (low energy electron diffraction),
composition (Auger electron spectroscopy), electronic properties (angle resolved
photoelectron emission with synchrotron radiation) and magnetic properties
(magneto-optical and spin-polarization techniques). The experimental studies are
carried out and coordinated with theoretical/numerical work of a similar nature.
This project addresses fundamental issues having important technological
significance, specifically in relation to information storage based on these
magnetic films.
