This proposal describes a novel research program on nonlinear and adaptive
attitude control of complex rotating mechanical systems. The special feature of
the research program is that it is framed in terms of control experiments that
can be carried out in unique laboratory facilities at the University of
Michigan. Control experiments will be integrated with and guided by recent
advances in nonlinear and adaptive control theory. Research on adaptive and
nonlinear control theory will be motivated by the experimental results. The
research is expected to advance the state of the art in adaptive and nonlinear
control, especially as applied to control of complex rotating mechanical
systems.
