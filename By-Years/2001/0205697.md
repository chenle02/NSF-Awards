AST-0205697 Miller, Jon

Dr. Miller is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics. He will study black hole accretion for a wide range of
black hole masses and accretion rates, searching for common geometries and
underlying physics. He will study inner accretion flows of stellar-mass black
holes and active galactic nuclei at many wavelengths, and will search for radio,
optical, and UV counterparts to the newly-accessible class of black holes of
intermediate mass and/or extremely high accretion rates. In education, he will
develop a series of web-based video lectures on new and recent results in
astronomy, whch may serve as a supplement to high school courses in earth
science, physics, or astronomy. ***
