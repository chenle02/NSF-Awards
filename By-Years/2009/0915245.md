This project represents a broad investigation into algorithmic algebraic
geometry, traversing complexity theory, Diophantine approximation, real and
p-adic geometry, numerical algorithms, and the nascent field of statistical
algebraic geometry. The main focus is systems of sparse polynomial equations ---
a family of computational problems central in many applications. The proposed
algorithms have immediate impact in certain areas of engineering where the PI
and co-PIs have close connections with industry and faculty outside of
mathematics. Intellectual merits include (1) an approach to a deterministic
solution of Smale's 17th Problem, (2) optimal stochastic root counts for sparse
polynomial systems, and (3) new algebraic examples of problems on the border
between P and NP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include novel approaches
to problems from engineering and computer science, the training of postdoctoral
researchers, and the education of graduate students. In particular, PI Rojas and
graduate student Rusek have an ongoing collaboration with Sandia National
Laboratories (including publically-available software) on rigorously quantifying
uncertainties in the failure of physical structures, e.g., the storage of
nuclear waste. Co-PI Avendano and PI Rojas also have ongoing work with Prof.
Daniele Mortari (of the Texas A and M Aerospace Engineering Department) on
satellite orbit design, with applications to surveillance and astronomical
observation. &lt;br/&gt;
