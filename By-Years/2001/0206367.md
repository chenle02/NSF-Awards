AST-0206367&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
study of stellar radio emission provides complementary and often unique
insights&lt;br/&gt;into physical processes occurring in stellar coronae, winds,
magnetospheres, and circumstellar environments. Radio observations are unique in
their ability to reveal the presence of nonthermal processes in stellar
atmospheres, as well as the magnetic field strength and structure at or close to
the site of magnetic energy release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigations to
be carried out here will allow significant advances in the study
of&lt;br/&gt;the phenomenolgy and physical processes related to: the mass loss
process from evolved giant and supergiant stars, including the wind acceleration
process and the wind driving mechanism(s); the coronal structure of active
binary stars and the physical processes occurring during the impulsive and
cooling phases of the large are events in these systems; the thermal and
nonthermal radio emission of main sequence stars of differing mass and how these
properties change as such stars evolve; the fundamental processes controlling
the level of radio emission and stellar activity in general as a function of
basic stellar parameters and evolutionary state; and finally, the physical and
geometrical relationship between thermal processes in stellar X-ray coronae and
nonthermal coronal processes observed in the radio.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
