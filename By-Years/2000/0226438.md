The 46th International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology
and Nanofabrication 2002, sponsored by the American Vacuum Society in
cooperation with the Electron Device Society of IEEE and the Optical Society of
America, to be held in Anaheim, CA on May 28-31, 2002 will provide a forum for
scientific and technical exchange to advance the practice and progress of
nano/microfabrication, electron and ion lithographies, particle beam optics, and
forefront applications of nanofabrication.

The conference will enable students to present their research to a high-level
international scientific community. Students will observe how scientists and
engineers exchange ideas and information at conferences, and they will hear
first hand presentations of up-to-date research results in nanotechnology.
Students will make personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. In a
special student breakfast, the conference organizers will describe to the
attendees how the conference program is put together.
