Thurston 9701755 This award provides core support to the Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute located in Berkeley, California. The fundamental goal of the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) is to stimulate research in the
mathematical sciences by bringing together, in a programmatically focused
scientific environment, the top mathematical scientists, nationally and
internationally, in given research subjects. The interaction of senior and mid-
level scholars and the very best postdoctoral fellows in a given field produces
a stimulating environment where new ideas can be exploited and developed. The
training of postdoctoral researchers is a priority of MSRI, and the scientific
structure and budgetary allocations of funds reflect this. Normally, two
academic-year scientific research programs take place each year. In addition to
these academic year programs, MSRI conducts workshops and conferences. MSRI also
supports summer research and training programs for graduate students. Programs
are scheduled that reflect timely research interest and opportunities for cross-
programmatic collaboration and scientific exchange.
