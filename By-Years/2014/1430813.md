The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to rapidly engineer yeast for
production of fuels, chemicals, enzymes, and other valuable molecules. Yeast
offers high value production capabilities; however, engineering new strains is
very complex and expensive - costing approximately $75-100 million, and
requiring 7-10 years for development with current engineering methods. This
project will develop a genome engineering technology for yeast that can
substantially reduce the cost and time for developing new strains for industrial
biotechnology applications. This technology will increase the ability of
companies to use yeast to efficiently produce high-quality products from
renewable feedstocks, and help grow the overall industrial biotechnology market.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the
ability to perform rapid whole-genome engineering in industrial yeast strains.
Current technologies to engineer cells for specific functions (e.g., chemical or
fuel production) are inefficient, expensive and extremely time consuming.
Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a disruptive technology that
provides a powerful platform to engineer microorganisms at tremendously reduced
cost. Until recently, MAGE was limited to a laboratory strain of E. coli,
possessing key genetic features that enable MAGE. Recent advances have allowed
us to port MAGE to yeast, and the goal of this project is to increase efficiency
of the system and endow existing industrial yeasts with the capacity to undergo
MAGE. The goal is to improve MAGE efficiency in yeast by developing a high-
throughput system to rapidly create and quantify strain variants for their
capacity to undergo the MAGE process itself. This project will establish a
system to identify and optimize the requisite genetic features for MAGE in
yeast, in order to rapidly engineer industrial yeast strains for specific
function.
