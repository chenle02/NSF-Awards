9623438 Bauman The principal investigator will study elliptic and parabolic
systems of partial differential equations (with physically realistic initial and
boundary conditions) from physical models in two and three space dimensions. In
particular, the Ginzburg-Landau system describing the current and magnetic field
in a superconducting material subject to an external magnetic field will be
studied. The principal investigator will also study nonlinear systems describing
hyperelastic materials based on models developed by materials scientists. %%%
The above problems concern realistic mathematical models for the behavior of
materials which are of practical interest in materials engineering, materials
science, mechanical engineering, and physics. Issues to be studied include how
the modulus of the external field affects current and magnetic field in a
superconducting material, and how defects and inhomogeneities in a material
affect its superconductivity. Problems of this nature are important in
applications such as in the use of superconducting materials for power
transmission and the use of liquid crystals for displaying complex internal
information. ***
