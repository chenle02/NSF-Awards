Integrated analysis of data recorded during the 1987 Whittier earthquake on
strong ground shaking and its effects on structures is conducted. The study
focuses on investigations of (1) the physical process associated with the
earthquake source, (2) wave propagation, (3) response of structures. Current
knowledge and current procedures in earthquake engineering are tested to
determine the adequacies or deficiencies. The project will produce a
comprehensive document of data which will be a basic reference for all future
work on this earthquake. Current design methods and techniques are calibrated
and areas for improvements are to be suggested.
