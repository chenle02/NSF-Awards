The University of Vermont will connect their campus network to the New England
Academic and Research Network (NEARnet), a regional network which is part of the
NSFNET. Direct connection to NEARnet will provide researchers with improved
access to the Internet and other national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and
USENET. The proposed 1.5 million bit per second, dedicated, communication link
will improve reliability, speed, turn-around, and flexibility for data
communication functions such as file transfer, remote login, and
teleconferencing. NEARnet will provide for equipment, maintenance, and
information services. The University of Vermont will be able to integrate
supercomputing and collaborative research into graduate and udergraduate
curricula. In addition the State Library Services and Middlebury College will be
connected to the main campus and provided connectivity to the rest of the
Internet through already existing local networks. This project thus provides
sharing of resources among the state institutions, greatly facilitates research
by students and faculty, and provides a valuable resource to supplement course
work.***
