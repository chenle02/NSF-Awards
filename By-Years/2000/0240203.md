With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
supports the ongoing work of Dr. Kendall N. Houk in the Department of Chemistry
at the University of California, Los Angeles. The work is aimed at using
theoretical and computational methods to address four projects, pericyclic
mechanisms, molecular device design, biological catalysis, and organometallic
mechanisms. Houk is the world leader in the computational study and
understanding of pericyclic reactions. He continues to make key contributions on
methodology for accurate predictions of activation parameters, and in unraveling
mechanistic details including competitions between concerted and diradical
alternatives. Through the proposed work we will gain a better understanding of
stepwise pericyclic reactions, which is intellectually challenging, and of
synthetic importance. In addition, the PI continues to apply his expertise in
pericyclic reactions and computational methods to new areas using theoretical
methods that are complemented by experimental studies. The research provides
valuable experience for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry supports the research activities of Professor Kendall N.
Houk of the University of California- Los Angeles. Professor Houk's work in the
application areas of molecular device and materials and biological catalysis
overlap strongly with technology areas of importance to the U.S. The current
period of funding will allow the fundamental knowledge generated by Prof. Houk
to be transferred into other application areas that could bolster America's
competitive edge in chemical technology.
