Dr. Rachel J. Dewey will spend two years at Princeton University collaborating
with Professor Joseph H. Taylor and other members the Physics Department on
studies of radio pulsars. The major focus of Dr. Dewey's work is a pulsar
astrometry project which uses Very Long Baseline Interferometry to make high
precision meausrements of pulsar positions, proper motions, and parallaxes. Such
measurements are relevant to many fields of astronomy and physics. By providing
direct measurements of pulsar velocities and distances, they yield improved
determinations of pulsar birthrates, ages, and magnetic fields. In addition,
astronmetric measurements yield ties between the extragalactic and planetary
ephemeris reference frames and improve the effectiveness of pulsars as probes of
the interstellar medium and of relativistic gravity. Interactive activities
include: organizing a brown-bag seminar series on topics of interest to women in
physics and closely related fields; superivising junior and senior independent
work; teaching an introductory physics course; working with other
astrophysicists to develop a "Techniques of Astrophysics" graduate seminar; and
participating in the Faculty Fellows program at Princeton's undergraduate
colleges.
