This Career Advancement Award project is in the area of surface chemistry and in
the subfield of interfacial vibrational spectroscopy. During the tenure of this
twelve-month standard grant, Professor Guest and her students at the University
of Cincinnati will construct a photoelastic modulator-based ellipsometer
suitable for fast, in situ monitoring of the air-water interface. This apparatus
will be used to demonstrate ellipsometric detection of adsorbed gases at the
air-aqueous interface which represents an advance in the application of
ellipsometry. This method has potential for development into an non-invasive,
time-resolved monitor of gas coverage, depletion, and chemical reaction on
liquid surfaces. In combination with other interfacially sensitive probes, this
technique is expected to offer unambiguous new insights into the kinetics,
dynamics, and spectroscopy of gaseous adsorbates at the air-aqueous interface.
This Career Advancement Award project reflects Professor Guest's overall effort
to revector her research direction toward the area of gas-liquid interfacial
phenomena. A particular focus of this present work is the development of an
ellipsometric approach to the study of heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry.
