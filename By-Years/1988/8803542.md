A Gordon Research Conference will be held June 13.17, 1988 in New London, New
Hampshire on Multiphoton Processes. The goal is to gather together physicists
and chemists who are working in rather diverse areas of multiphoton effects, as
well as workers who are using multiphoton probes to study a variety of basic and
applied physical and chemical problems. New features arise in multiphoton
processes because the interactions are nonlinear in optical power, produce
extremely high levels of excitation, involve different symmetry selection rules
and have inherent short time structures. Topics to be discussed at the
Conference include the theory of multiphoton processes, processes in intense
laser fields, electronic structure and dynamics of molecules, Rydberg states and
interactions, and dissociation phenomena in molecules.
