A three-year award in the form of a Cooperative Agreement betweenthe National
Science Foundation and the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) will
establish the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval
(CNIDR). In the past year several user-friendly client-server tools have been
developed for locating and retrieving information contained in platforms
reachable over the Internet. Among them, Wide Area Information Server (WAIS),
Gopher and Archie have become very popular, globally, and World-Wide-Web (WWW)
is poised for popularity once suitable client software is developed and
distributed. WAIS, Archie and Gopher present overviews of where information of
interest is lilely to reside, and then they assist the user in locating specific
information objects. WWW permits a user to thread a path through the network by
opening up network connections to referenced information by mouse-clicking on
Ä±active! hypertext. While focused on the particulars of WAIS evolution, MCNC
will work closely with the developers of other tools toward providing
compatibility and consistency, and, to the extent possible, convergence of the
tools. The WAIS-specific activity will provide a central focus and forum for
WAIS evolution and will minimize the divergence of individual WAIS-based
implementations. In addition, the CNIDR will conduct a workshop, under the
auspices of the Education and Human Resource (EHR) Applications of Advanced
Technology Program. The purpose of the workshop will be to evaluate the state of
the art in networked information retrieval as applied to the EHR materials
development, teacher enhancement, network testbed, and dissemination projects,
and to educate and support the NSF project investigators in the uses of
networked information retrieval tools.
