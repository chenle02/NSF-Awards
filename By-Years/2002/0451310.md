Abstract - 0451310 Goodman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines new,
innovative forms of higher education. The &lt;br/&gt;research questions include:
what are the forms or structural properties &lt;br/&gt;of these new institutions
and how do they differ from traditional &lt;br/&gt;research universities? What
is the startup process of these new &lt;br/&gt;institutions? How can the concept
of the "learning contract" help us &lt;br/&gt;understand the evolution of these
new forms of higher education as well &lt;br/&gt;as other learning
organizations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-disciplinary research draws on
the organizational change &lt;br/&gt;literature, role theory literature, recent
work on psychological &lt;br/&gt;contracts, and the literature about innovative
forms of higher education &lt;br/&gt;institutions. The project includes four
related studies of research &lt;br/&gt;university startups. The first two
studies will rely on rich &lt;br/&gt;ethnographic methods including interviews
and observation, as well as &lt;br/&gt;archival records to capture the form of
these institutions and their &lt;br/&gt;processes during the startup phase. The
third study will develop and &lt;br/&gt;validate scales in a survey instrument,
tapping the learning contract &lt;br/&gt;construct. The fourth study will use
data from the first three studies &lt;br/&gt;to examine initial effectiveness
indicators. These last two studies rely &lt;br/&gt;on construct development,
hypothesis testing, and quantitative methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential
broader impact of this research includes: 1) helping U.S.
&lt;br/&gt;universities maintain their historically competitive edge while under
&lt;br/&gt;severe pressure to change due to environmental forces such as
&lt;br/&gt;constrained governmental support, escalating faculty recruitment and
&lt;br/&gt;retention costs, downward tuition pressure from skeptical
constituents, &lt;br/&gt;lower cost content delivery systems (e.g., e-learning),
and &lt;br/&gt;globalization of U.S. style education; 2) educational policy
formation &lt;br/&gt;for new and existing research and teaching universities;
and 3) the &lt;br/&gt;development of the learning contract within university
settings will &lt;br/&gt;provide institutions and policy makers with new
frameworks and &lt;br/&gt;measurement instruments to assess aspects of
organizational effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
