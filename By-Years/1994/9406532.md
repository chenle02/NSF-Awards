Research in asynchronous systems has had a resurgence in the past five years.
Several breakthroughs distinguish this recent work from earlier efforts, and
have made asynchronous operation a viable option for modern system design. CAD
systems have been developed for asynchronous circuit design, asynchronous
processors have been built and evaluated, and controllers and systems have been
designed. Problems in hazard-free operation, formal specification and
verification of designs are being actively pursued. The purpose of the symposium
is to provide a forum where researchers may assess the current state of research
in the field, and exchange ideas about present work in depth. The symposium is
planned for November 3-5, 1994.
