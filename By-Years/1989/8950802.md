This project improves the status of the Human Factors Laboratory in the
Industrial Engineering Department. This was achieved with the acquisition of a
set of interfaces packages, a digitizer, and two computer systems. The equipment
provides the students with an opportunity to develop a "hands-on" familiarity
with the applications of laboratory techniques in measuring different aspects of
human performance. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
