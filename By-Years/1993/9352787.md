The project will purchase a Hitachi R-1200 Rapid Scan NMR Spectrometer. This
instrument will greatly improve scientific instrumentation at Buena Vista
College, and allow chemistry students an enhanced introduction to the principles
and application of modern analytical technique. It will be used in the Organic
Chemistry sequence, the Analytical Chemistry courses, in Physical Chemistry
(Chemistry 351 and 352), Biochemistry, and advanced laboratory classes. In
addition, students will be able to carry out research projects in synthesis or
solution processes in a manner not possible before. The new instrumentation will
expand the capability to act as a scientific resource for a large rural area.
Local high school students and industry will be encouraged to use the facility
through demonstrations.
