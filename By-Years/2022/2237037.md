Machine learning models today must operate amid increasingly dynamic and open
environments. One important characteristic of open environments is that the
intelligent system will encounter new contexts and out-of-distribution data;
that is, data that were not used to train the algorithms the original system.
However, current supervised learning is brittle, lacking a reliable
understanding of the way data evolves over time and how to respond to changing
environments. This introduces a set of new challenges and drives the need for
rethinking the design of machine learning algorithms, that can detect out-of-
distribution data and repair the learned model under evolving data in the wild.
The project will directly impact many real-world domains including autonomous
transportation, healthcare, commerce, and scientific
discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to
lay new foundations for safe, adaptive, and long-term beneficial learning
algorithms in open-world environments. The project has a continuum of three
research aims that will fundamentally transform the way that machine learning
models are trained, updated, and monitored in the wild: (1) create a new
learning framework for reliable decisions, rendering strong safety against
unknowns upon deploying machine learning models in the wild; (2) accelerate
model adaptation, learning to classify new concepts emerging in the wild while
minimizing human supervision required; (3) characterize and understand dynamics
in terms of long-term accuracy and safety, maximizing the impact of models as
they evolve and operate in the long run. The education plan will publicize the
power of open-world machine learning through a new course, a new undergraduate
mentorship program 'Entering AI Research' and outreach
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
