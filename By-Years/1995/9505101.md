9505101 Meeks A variety of problems in differential geometry and topology of
minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces are proposed. Total Gaussian
curvature results as well as topological obstruction results will be sought for
complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature. For infinite total
curvature minimal surfaces, topological uniqueness, growth estimates and the
index theory will be examined. Global properties of constant mean curvature
surfaces will be studied. Computer graphics and (period) computations for some
of these surfaces will also be pursued. Minimal surfaces and constant mean
curvature surfaces were first systematically investigated by the Belgian
physicist Plateau in his famous soap film experiments. These surfaces model
physical surfaces where either the surface area is minimized by surface tension
or in the case of a stable interface between two materials. In recent years,
periodic minimal surfaces are used to model condensed matter on a molecular
scale.
