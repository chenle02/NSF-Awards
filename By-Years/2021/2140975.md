Modern cryptography began with the goal of protecting communications over public
networks. Today, not only do we communicate with each other remotely, we also
delegate our computations to cloud-based services. But can we trust the cloud?
Just as cryptographic techniques developed in the last half century provided the
foundation for secure communication on the Internet, new techniques provide
similar mechanisms for ensuring privacy and integrity of computations. As these
technologies mature and see deployment, it is important to carefully study their
design and security. The focus of this project is on the theoretical foundations
of cryptographic proof systems, a key primitive used to ensure privacy and
integrity of computations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project conducts a
systematic study of the theoretical foundations of cryptographic proof systems
that provide privacy and minimize proof size. The focus is on constructions from
general and unstructured assumptions. This newly enables cryptographic proof
systems from simpler and weaker cryptographic notions. In addition, through the
careful study of the foundations of cryptographic proof systems, the project
expands our understanding of the broader connections between proof systems and
other core cryptographic notions like public-key encryption and witness
encryption. By viewing these notions through the lens of cryptographic proof
systems, this project paves new paths towards realizing these primitives from
simpler cryptographic assumptions. This project also develops new educational
material at all levels (from K-12 students to graduate students) focused on
applied cryptography and the role it plays in securing digital systems and
computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
