This project will investigate three areas of research to study the permanent
deformation of asphalt concrete. These areas are: (a) effect of vehicle loads on
stress conditions in asphalt concrete material; (b) effect of various
proportions of mix on physical and chemical properties of asphalt concrete; (c)
Conducting laboratory experiments to be able to predict permanent deformation of
asphalt concrete materials.
