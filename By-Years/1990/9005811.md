This research analyzes the changes in the official Chinese attitude towards
traditional Tibetan medicine as functions of changes in the larger social-
political context of Tibet within Chinese society. The study will examine the
role of traditional medicine in Tibet through analysis of health policy and the
social organization of healing institutions. Methods include systematic
interviews with officials in the ministry of health, interviews with and
observations of practitioners and of patients of traditional as well as modern
medicine, and observation of a sample of practitioner-patient interactions. This
project is important because it will analyze a case of medical pluralism that
has generalizing implications for other social situations where cultures are in
contact. For example, understanding the issues of medical behavior in this
Tibetan case can sensitize planners to important issues in the design of
treatment regimes for other multi-cultural medical situations, such as the
American southwest.
