TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested in the amount
of $3070 for supporting the travel of US based organizers and speakers
participating in the American Chemical Society (ACS) Symposium: ? Advance in
Functional Polymers with Sophisticated Branched Structures?, to be held in
Philadelphia, PA, Aug.21-25, 2016. The symposium?s objective is to fill a gap in
the coverage of these important polymeric species among recent ACS symposia. The
species include star polymers, graft polymers, molecular brushes, dendrimers,
and variously branched polymer structures constructed from supermolecular
assemblies. Advances, and novelty in structure design, synthesis,
characterization and applications will be emphasized. The meeting will provide
an open platform for active researchers to present their recent achievements,
and allow for the exchange and dissemination of knowledge, ideas, and visions
among researchers including graduate student and postdoctoral fellows.
