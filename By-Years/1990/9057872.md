This project focuses on four topics: 1) data network architectures 2) multi-
user information and communication theory 3) relationship between algebraic
coding theory and digital signal processing and 4) generation of pseudo-random
sequences for cryptographic purposes. The first involves the question of how
common communication resources can be shared in a highly flexible manner by a
large number of bursty users. The second involves questions of the analysis and
construction of multi-user coding and modulation schemes for multiple access
channels with or without noise. The third sis directed at exploiting the
advantages of both the algebraist's and the engineer's point of view, for
example to perhaps characterize the algebraic structure of convolutional codes.
The fourth looks at new techniques to generate pseudorandom sequences from LFSR
sequences over a field with characteristic different from the characteristic of
the desired sequence.
