Peter Wolynes is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical research in the area of
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The proposed work focuses on new models of
energy flow in gas phase molecules, biomolecules at low temperatures and
clusters, as well as the study of reaction kinetics in biomolecules. The energy
flow work is analytical theory using techniques borrowed from the theory of
quantum transport in disordered systems combined with a mesoscopic approach that
examines how intramolecular dynamics changes as the size of the molecular system
grows to approach a macroscopic limit. The biological reaction dynamics is
largely computational and deals with tunneling phenomena in biomolecules,
focusing on ligand recombination in heme proteins. A third area of study
involves intermittency and microscopic theories of statistics of single molecule
reaction dynamics which will be useful in interpreting recent experimental
studies involving the spectroscopy of single molecules. The application of
statistical methods to study the physical behavior of systems containing many
particles at equilibrium is well developed, but similar application to
nonequilibrium systems such as those undergoing chemical reaction is a major
current frontier of physical chemistry. Professor Wolynes is developing
statistical techniques to obtain useful information about such reacting systems,
particularly those undergoing biological transformations or those interacting
with solvents in solution reactions.
