In this project the principal investigator proposes to further advance and
develop the methods for investigations of dynamical, statistical and geometrical
aspects of Hilbertian hyperbolic discrete groups, random dynamical systems, one-
dimensional lattice gasses, geometry, and dynamics of meromorphic transcendental
functions, holomorphic endomorphisms of compact complex manifolds, and
continuity of Hausdorff measures for conformal iterated function systems and
conformal expanding repellers. Aided by concepts and techniques of dynamical
systems, ergodic theory, statistical physics, functional analysis, geometric
measure theory, complex analysis, probability theory, and algebraic and
differential geometry, appropriate forms of thermodynamic formalism, both
deterministic and random, for those systems will be constructed and
investigated. The project will involve the analysis of transfer operators, Gibbs
and equilibrium states, Julia sets of meromorphic functions, and limit sets of
Hilbertian discrete groups, as well as Hausdorff measures and dimensions of
attractors of graph-directed Markov systems.

The fact that the concepts, techniques and methods of the project, while
dynamical in essence, are nevertheless created through the interplay of the
branches of mathematics and physics indicated above, will have interesting
consequences. The project will shed light on these fields themselves, may
stimulate the development of techniques and methods in these areas, and in
particular, may cause their growth in response to demands coming from the theory
of dynamical systems. Along these lines, the project assumes cooperation of the
principal investigator with several specialists in those fields. Such joint work
is expected to broaden their mutual professional expertise and should give rise
to enhancement of the investigated domains. The active involvement of graduate
students is an integral part of the proposed work. The students are expected to
gradually master the topics of the proposed research, to learn more about
geometric measure theory, the theory of transcendental meromorphic and entire
functions, algebraic geometry and other subjects, and finally to contribute to
the project their own creative work. The proposed research is expected to result
in advanced graduate courses and to attract to Denton scholars who by delivering
colloquium and seminar lectures will interact with and scientifically stimulate
graduate students and faculty in Denton.
