In collaboration with a Mexican colleague the PIs are conducting an integrated
geological, petrological, and geochemical study of Miocene to Recent volcanic
rocks from a transect across the southernmost Basin and Range Province (BRP) of
central Mexico. The plan is to extend this work in the transect area by
conducting a comprehensive petrological and geochemical study of mantle-derived
spinel-lherzolite xenoliths. Major-element analyses of whole-rock samples and
constituent minerals will enable the PIs to evaluate petrogenetic models for the
xenoliths as residues of partial melting of fertile peridotitic mantle and to
evaluate regional differences in upper-mantle composition, temperature, oxygen
fugacity, and degree of melt extraction. They also plan to conduct detailed
studies of Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios and trace-element abundances in
clinopyroxenes, which will allow them to investigate complex metasomatic
modifications of the upper-mantle geochemistry by fluid/melts, such as those
related to the Tertiary subduction event and those related to on- going
lithospheric extension.
