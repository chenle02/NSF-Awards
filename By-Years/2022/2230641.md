This project’s focus is on single-use, expendable ocean instruments used by the
scientific, merchant marine and defense sectors. These instruments are left to
accumulate as waste long after their useful life. Instrument manufacturers are
eager for purpose-built, innovative solutions that can meet the material needs
of the Blue Economy, while protecting the ocean. This project involves an
interdisciplinary team of material scientists, microbiologists, and
oceanographers working across industry, academia, and government to develop
ocean-degradable plastics, including products with embedded bacteria and enzymes
that can accelerate biodegradation in seawater. The project supports a robust
academic-industry internship program focused on recruitment of students from
populations historically underrepresented in STEM.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nereid’s ocean-degradable materials are based on the
biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), sustainably produced from waste methane
gas. Because PHB is a compound naturally made by bacteria, many marine bacteria
have evolved to fully degrade PHB to carbon dioxide and water, without the
creation of microplastics or other harmful byproducts. Through incorporation of
innovative “living materials” embedded with naturally-occurring microbes, spores
or enzymes, the project aims to control and trigger degradation for a wide range
of instrument applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
