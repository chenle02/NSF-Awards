A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the
physical properties of subatomic particles such as the proton and neutron. The
radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by
scattering electrons, or heavier particles called muons, off protons. Another
technique is to measure the energy levels of hydrogen, an atom consisting of a
proton plus an electron, or muonic hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton with
the electron replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by
scattering of electrons off protons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and
muonic hydrogen. The proton radius derived from the measurement of the energy
levels in muonic hydrogen disagrees with the radius derived from the
measurements of the energy levels in hydrogen, and with the measurements of the
proton radius by scattering of electrons, an issue known as "the proton radius
puzzle." The discrepancy has attracted wide attention, because it may indicate
the existence of previously unobserved and unexpected differences between the
interactions of muons and electrons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dedicated MUon
proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE), which will run at the Paul Scherrer
Institute in Switzerland and directly compare the scattering of muons and
electrons from protons, is highly anticipated by experts in the field for its
potential to resolve the puzzle. This project will cover the prototyping and
development of several crucial components of the MUSE experiment detectors. The
project will involve the training of students and young scientists, at the
undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. The
institutions involved in the project have trained large numbers of students of
each type, including from minority populations. The training they have received
in the process of doing basic research has led to careers in a variety of areas,
from medical physics to national security, in addition to continued work in
fundamental physics research. The MUSE experiment will broaden the perspective
of American students by having them work in an international collaboration at an
international laboratory, which will prepare them effectively to become
prominent global scientists of the next generation. With the broad interest in
the proton radius puzzle, MUSE has the potential to be broadly inspirational
beyond the current scientific community.
