The 2009 Maine/Quebec number theory conference will take place on October 3 & 4
at the University of Maine in Orono. This conference is held annually, at
l'Universite Laval in Quebec in even years and at the University of Maine in odd
years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Quebec, and
beyond to present and discuss their research, the conference promotes
interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American number theorists.

This year the featured topic at the conference is Automorphic Galois
Representations. We will hear lectures on this topic by leading researchers, in
addition to talks by approximately 25 other invited speakers in all areas of
number theory. The small scale of the meeting (with around 50 attendees) makes
this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to
interact with leading researchers.
