This dissertation represents one of the first attempts to assess the structure
of work organization and labor processes in a service industry. Most previous
work has been confined to manual workers in manufacturing industries. This study
examines the labor process in the hospital setting of a community health care
system. It examines the social goals and rationales behind the design and
deployment of hospital technologies and medical innovations and the complex
relationship between technological change and the structure of work
organization.
