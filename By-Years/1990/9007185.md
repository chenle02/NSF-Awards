This award will support the efforts of the principal investigators to continue
their studies of finite element methods for the numerical solution of partial
differential equations. In particular, the researchers will construct
preconditioners that will enable them to solve the resulting systems of
algebraic equations more efficiently. The theoretical insights gained from their
studies should lead to the development of improved software for use on parallel
computers, which in turn will lead to improved solutions of a host of problems
in two and three space dimensions. The computer has changed forever the way we
go about finding solutions of partial differential equations that arise in
science and technology. Unfortunately the ability of even the most powerful
supercomputer to solve complicated systems is limited very often by the sheer
size of the algebraic equations that result from discretizing the differential
equations. In order to overcome this "size" limitation numerical analysts have
devised ways to "precondition" these algebraic equations so as to make them more
digestible to the computer. The principal investigators on this grant will seek
better ways to achieve this preconditioning.
