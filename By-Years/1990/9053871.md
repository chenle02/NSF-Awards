This project provide 20-25 undergraduate women (recruited from SIUC and seven
surrounding community colleges) with an intensive two-week workshop in the
sciences to expose them to science career options. Sciences include mathematics,
zoology, chemistry,plant ecology, geology, psychology, animal sciences, and
microbiology. Activities cover such fields as molecular biology and recombinant
DNA, assessing ecological integrity, gene expression after bacterial
transformation, geologic hazards, and biotechnology of mammalian embryos. Two
additional single day workshops and three individual mentoring sessions will
follow throughout the academic year. Women scientists from industry give
seminars during both the summerand academic year workshops to expand
participants' perceptions of science career options. A second group of women
will be recruited for the second year for a total of 40-50 participants.
Measurable objectives designed to measure project effectiveness include: - The
number of participants with undeclared majors who select science majors. - The
number of participants who decide to become science teachers. - Of participants
who do not enter a four-year college (e.g., for economic reasons), the number
who enter science-oriented careers with their two-year degree. - A significantly
lower drop-out rate (including change to a non-science major) than among the
general population of women science majors.
