In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project sponsored by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Woods (University of Wisconsin) will develop new methods of
producing high density low temperature plasmas, optimized for producing
molecular ions suitable for microwave structure determinations. The high
resolution spectra obtainable by these techniques will yield accurate molecular
geometries and dipole moments. The direct determination of electric dipole
moments of charged molecules represents a new and unusual way of improving our
understanding of chemistry in electrically conducting media. %%% Plasmas, a
"fourth state" of matter, consist of a tremendously corrosive, reactive high
temperature gas of electrically charged atoms or molecules. Prof. Woods' project
in developing improved plasma sources and analyzing their microwave spectra has
important implications for the chemistry of the interstellar medium and for
plasma reactors used in materials processing.
