The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly reduce the installed cost of
residential solar energy systems, thus enabling widespread access to renewable
energy. Particular emphasis will be placed on low and moderate income
communities, rural America, and renters. The new technology could potentially
generate savings of 30-40% in residential electric
costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance the
translation of a new photovoltaic system. The project objectives include to
design and create a portable on-grid solar system for residential use. This plan
calls for researching and testing crystalline silicon module materials. This is
done in service of developing manufacturing specifications for glassless
frameless photovoltaic modules. Verification and validation plans include
lifetime studies and combined accelerated stress-testing
protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
