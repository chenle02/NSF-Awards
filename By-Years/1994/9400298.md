This project builds on gathering and interpreting high-accuracy low spatial
resolution observations of solar magnetic and velocity fields from the Wilcox
Solar Observatory and active participation in the Global Oscillation Network
Group and International Research on the Interior of the Sun global oscillations
observing networks. The request for support for improvement and continued
maintenance of the facility will continue gathering, reducing, and distributing
data. Finally, the SolarMail system supported in part by this proposal will
continue to expand and provide a valuable service to more than 1000 scientists.
