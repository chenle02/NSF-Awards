This award, of $390,000, is for support of a Center for Education Research
Infrastructure Development in Microelectromechanical Systems. The mission of the
center is to develop model interdisciplinary educational programs and resources
in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) which interact with and support a
coordinated and focused MEMS research program. The core of the proposed program
is a team of four faculty members from Materials Science, Electrical
Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, whose interests and expertise span most
of MEMS technology. The educational efforts include course development,
project/research involvement of graduate and undergradaute students, seminars,
and interaction and outreach to industry and other educational institutions. The
research component of the program consists of several projects which are focused
on the common goal of developing an integrated MEMS technology in which all
major elements (microactuators, microsensors, micromechanical devices, and on-
chip electronics) can be compatibly fabricated on a common substrate.
