The school is acquiring a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to help
in meeting the goal of providing students with the practical NMR laboratory
experience necessary to make them well-rounded chemists. The project details a
set of learning experiences which are being integrated into all required
chemistry courses in years 2-5 of the chemistry program. Students are learning
about the use of NMR for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional spectral
interpretation, and studying molecular dynamics, thermodynamics, and nuclei
other than H1 (eg., C13, N15, P31).
