The purpose of this project is to examine how people resolve disputes in the
context of rapidly changing legal systems and how people come to judge what is
fair and just. It examines this phenomenon on a comparative transnational scale
through an historical analysis of the transference and adaptation of informal
methods of dispute resolution; in particular, the common-law process of
arbitration. This project employs the historical case-study method to examine
these issues in the context of Great Britain's acquisition of colonial territory
in India. As Britain's empire expanded, arbitration quickly became an important
aspect of imperial rule because it served a number of useful purposes, including
the reduction of judicial expenses and the encouragement of the participation of
local elites. Most importantly, common-law arbitration appeared to correspond to
an indigenous form of dispute resolution, the tribal and caste panchayats, and
thus was perceived as a bridge between the two legal cultures. As British
arbitration practices were adapted for use in India, Indian arbitrators were
given broad powers to resolve local disputes. Through the analysis of these
decisions, this project will therefore help to uncover not only how legal
processes adapted to one another, but also how commonplace methods of dispute
resolution expressed contemporary ideas of what is just and what is fair.
