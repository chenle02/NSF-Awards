The purpose of this project is to undertake theoretical and empirical research
into the problem of fraudulent claims filed in insurance markets. A growing body
of empirical work aims to document the existence of fraudulent or exaggerated
claims in selected insurance markets, and to aid insurers in identifying
particular claims which may be fraudulent. Theoretical analyses have focused on
designing optimal schemes for the auditing of claims which are filed to detect
and deter fraudulent claims. This project fills and an important gap in both the
theoretical and empirical literature on insurance fraud by considering
contractual mechanisms by which insures might manage the problem of fraud.
Rather than simply designing and implementing ex-post situations such as claims
audits, the project examines how the initial insurance contract might be
designed in order to provide incentives of claimants not to cheat. Since
efficient policy approaches to the problem of fraud are likely to entail ex-ante
incentives as well as ex-post sanctions, this research promises to provide
important insights into a heretofore ignored aspect of effective fraud
management. The theoretical contracting model will be tested using a large and
detailed dataset on automobile settlements.
