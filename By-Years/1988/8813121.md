A variety of free surface wave research areas are to be addressed, primarily
with asymptotic mathematical analysis. These areas are: 1. The interaction of
sound and water waves, useful in acoustic sensing of the state of the sea. 2.
Wave flow over seafloor ripples, producing an interaction which will amplify the
ripples, possibly explaining certain sandbar formation. 3. Refraction of waves
past breakwaters into harbors. 4. Multiple wave-length interaction and its role
in generating waves from the wind. 5. The effect of wind on the evolution of
capillary ripples.*** //
