The balance between control and independent decision processes in robotic
systems is not well defined and in many cases is poorly understood. From legal
liability to individual versus social benefits, the role of regulation remains
unclear even as the technology rapidly advances. This workshop will help
characterize, frame, and articulate the policy issues related to autonomy and to
explore the best legal infrastructure for law and policy on robotics,
recognizing a fundamental interdependence between policy and technology
challenges, including in the area of autonomy. The Workshop will address four
goals: Enhance the understanding of state-of-the-art technology and market
trends related to autonomous systems, including robotics technology; Identify
opportunities and future research directions for strategic investments in
autonomous systems at the national level; Identify and discuss potential policy
implications of autonomous systems; and Contribute to the development of a
policy framework for autonomous systems. The three application areas of self-
driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, personal and service robots, future
development will benefit from a clearer policy perspective. The workshop will
bring together relevant experts in this diverse topic area from academia,
industry and government to focus attention articulation of a policy framework
for autonomous systems while also identifying future areas for research and
collaboration. The workshop report, with a definition of a draft policy for
autonomy framework, identification of the implications for the application areas
within such a framework, and an outline of future research questions will
provide a foundation for work in autonomous systems policy going forward.
