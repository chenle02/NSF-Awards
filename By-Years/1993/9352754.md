9352754 Melvin This project allows the integration of a computer-based
experimental psychology laboratory. The students conduct, analyze, and write
reports on experiments as well as write short research proposals. The project
also integrates ongoing faculty research into the student laboratory and permits
the construction and use of computer tutorials on the basics of experimentation.
The project is expected to impact psychology majors and upper-level non-major
students. ***
