Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) processing of materials is rapidly emerging as an
innovative technique for the formation of novel protective coatings and free
standing forms. This method of materials fabrication enables the rapid-
solidification-rate (RST) processing of compounds (e.g., BN, TiB2), reactive
metals (e.g., Zr, Hf, Ta, Ti), and high temperature metal alloys (e.g., based on
Ni, Co, Cr, and Fe) for a wide range of applications. Although the plasma
processing is expanding beyond turbine technology, there is very limited
information available as to the relations between VPS processing,
microstructure, and properties. The overall goal of this project is to examine
VPS with the intention of optimizing the spray parameters through the evaluation
of the quality of the coating. A wide range of characterization and test methods
will be employed to gain an understanding of the key process variables and how
their control can be employed to obtain deposits of high quality.
