The objective of this research is to develop a mathematical theory to describe
the exchange of substances across the walls of blood capillaries and the
movement of these substances through the surrounding tissue. The purpose of the
circulatory system is to transport oxygen and nutrients to every cell of the
body and to remove carbon dioxide and waste products that the cells produce.
Such substances cross the capillary wall by fairly well understood physical
processes, and they move through the surrounding tissue either from the blood to
the cells or from the cells to the blood by a variety of different transport
mechanisms. In addition, there is a large movement of water across the capillary
walls from the blood into the tissue or from the tissue into the blood; such
fluid movement is critically related to fluid balance and swelling within the
body. The objective of this proposal is to mathematically describe these complex
processes in terms of the underlying basic physical principles. A predictive
theory will be developed to indicate how the body functions under a broad range
of normal and pathological conditions. Such a theory will provide deeper
understanding of the underlying physiology. In addition, because it is
predictive, it will provide information that supplements and extends
experimental techniques, and will lead to a decreased need for relying
exclusively on animal experimentation for physiological research.
