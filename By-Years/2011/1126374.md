With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Marya Lieberman from University of Notre Dame and colleagues Paul Bohn, Patricia
Maurice, Peter Burns and Franklin Tao will acquire an X-ray Photoelectron
Spectrometer (XPS). The award will enhance research training and education at
all levels, especially in areas such as (a) semiconductor and polymer surface
chemistry of "smart" materials, (b) studies of self-assembled monolayers,
biomolecule/surface adhesion, (c) DNA damage and repair, (d) catalyst design and
characterization as well as libraries of materials, (e) reaction mechanisms of
catalysts, (f) surface chemistry of actinide minerals, and (g) soil and mineral
surface chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray photoelectron spectrometers are
used for chemical analysis. The XPS technique quantitatively measures elemental
composition, empirical formula, chemical state and electronic state of the
elements in a given material. A sample is irradiated with a beam of
monochromatic X-rays and the kinetic energies of the resulting photoelectrons
are measured and related to specific elements. XPS often plays a crucial role in
defining the system under study. The technique requires the use of ultra high
vacuum conditions. The work to be carried out by these investigators represents
a wide array of systems requiring surface characterization. The instrumentation
will be used in research activities and also for research training and education
of a large number of students from diverse backgrounds and will serve for
outreach activities to neighboring institutions such as Saint Mary's College,
Indiana University South Bend and Indiana University Northwest.
