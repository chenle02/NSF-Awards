This award will support Professor Jamie Thomerson of Southern Illinois
University at Edwardsville in collaboration with Professor Donald Taphorn of the
Universidad Nacional Experimental de los Llanos Occidentales in Guanare,
Venezuela. The investigators intend to clarify the taxonomy, distribution, and
natural history of Venezuelan rivulids. Members of a large Neotropical
freshwater fish family the Rivulidae, rivulids, live in marginal habitats. Study
of their distribution will provide tests for zoogeographic hypotheses based on
other fish groups. While they are relatively well understood in terms of higher
phylogenetic relationships, the taxonomy of the non-annual Rivulus species is
muddled and inadequate study material is available. The PI's will concentrate
their collecting on habitats where rivulids live. Many known localities are in
areas undergoing rapid environmental modification. Live material will be
collected for aquarium observation and hybridization studies. This study will:
(1) increase our knowledge of diversity and distribution of Venezuelan rivulids;
(2) clarify taxonomic and systematic problems in the difficult genus Rivulus;
and (3) dramatically increase the amount of Venezuelan fish material available
for study.
