9401189 Quadagno This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research Program. It is a study of public policy and interest group
politics among the elderly in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
The objective of this project is three fold: 1) to examine how the interplay
between welfare state and economic institutions empower and constrain political
actors concerned with age-based policy formation; 2) to account for the
conditions under which elderly people are active participants in the process of
social policy formation; and 3) to explore whether the age-based social policy
changes made during the 1980s signal a transition to a different form of welfare
state in which entitlement to government benefits shifts back to need versus
age-based criteria. %%% This research will contribute to social gerontology,
political sociology and the sociology of social problems. Given the human
significance of policies concerning government benefits for the elderly, the
results should be of interest to policy makers as well as to social scientists.
In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
