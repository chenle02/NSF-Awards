The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses
on a range of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques applied to the study
of the surfaces of silica and related materials. The study promises to enhance
our understanding of these important materials, the basic components of soils
and rocks. Silca surfaces will be directly examined by 1H, 29Si and 17O NMR
techniques, and indirectly examined by chemically modifying the surface and then
using NMR. By varying the size of the chemically modifying molecules surface
topography, and distincitions between internal pore or channel surfaces and the
external surfaces will be investigated. The chromatographically important
C18-silica system will be studied by a combination of deuterium line-shape
experiments, relaxation experiments and other methods.
