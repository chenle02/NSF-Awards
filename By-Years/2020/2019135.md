The Texas Research and Education Cyberinfrastructure Services (TRECIS) center
establishes a regional hub that advances collaborative support for research
computing and expands the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) and expertise
throughout the University of Texas system. It effectively integrates previously
siloed CI and computing support across three UT campuses and the Lonestar
Education and Research Network (LEARN) and builds a unique model of
embedded&lt;br/&gt;collaborative facilitation with scientific projects. TRECIS
trains postdoctoral researchers with domain-specific expertise in high
performance computing and other CI-related services who are then available for
consultations and support. TRECIS creates new career paths in research
facilitation, broadens CI access for research and education and engages students
and underrepresented groups, including historically black colleges, other
minority institutions, and&lt;br/&gt;organizations that promote gender equality
in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRECIS builds upon the model of shared CI and
support developed at UT Dallas, extends fast connectivity and networking to
other campuses, provides outreach and develops a model of research facilitation
through training and collaboration. It initially engages seven scientific
projects from the fields of biomedicine, chemistry, geosciences, and others.
Most are multi-institution collaborations and have multiple CI needs, including
parallel / distributed computing, data modeling, and storage and transfer of
data. TRECIS helps these projects and other users of research computing in
allocating CI resources and developing effective workflows, algorithms and
pipelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
