Urbanization is the most rapidly increasing land use type worldwide. We already
know that biodiversity is radically altered in cities. However, we do not know
what factors control the trophic or feeding structure of urban communities, and
how these controls differ from less human-dominated or natural environments. For
example, reduction of predators in cities could mean that herbivores (consumers
of plants) increase dramatically and are controlled only by resources or stress.
Our research will determine the relative effects of resources, stress, and
natural enemies (predator and parasites) in cities on herbivore and predator
abundances and diversity, and plant biomass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research
addresses fundamental questions - How is trophic structure and dynamics
influenced by urbanization and, are trophic dynamics different in cities than in
less human dominated ecosystems? This research will provide insights into how
food webs and their associated biodiversity and ecosystem services can be
maintained in urban settings. This research is closely linked to educational and
K-12 outreach programs (e.g., Ecology Explorers), as well as partnerships with
state and local governments and businesses. Some of our experimental sites are
K-12 schoolyards, where K-12 teachers and students will directly participate in
the experiments and interact with ASU faculty and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
