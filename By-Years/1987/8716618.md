This award will support the participation of U.S. researchers in a seminar on
the "Molecular Cell Biology of Physarum Polycephalum," organized jointly by
Professor William F. Dove of the University of Wisconsin and Professor Sadashi
Hatano of the University of Nagoya, Japan. United States, Japanese, and invited
third-country participants will meet at the National Institute for Basic Biology
in Okazaki, Japan in May 1988. Seminar topics will include (1) cell motility,
(2) cytoskeleton proteins and their genes, (3) cell differentiation and the cell
cycle, (4) extranuclear genes, and (5) new techniques for the study of cellular
biology. The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum is considered to be an ideal
organism for the study of cell motility, nuclear division, and cell
differentiation. The Japanese have done pioneering studies on cytoplasmic
streaming and cytoskeletal proteins using this organism, while in the U.S.,
research on the molecular genetics of Physarum has advanced rapidly. This
seminar will provide a forum for the exchange of research results and ideas, and
will hopefully lead to increased collaboration between cellular biologists of
our two countries.
