The objective of this research is to continue development of a physically-based
parameterization of clouds and their radiative interaction for use by general
circulation models (GCM's). The refined parameterization scheme will be
implemented and tested using the Oregon State University 7-layer atmospheric
GCM. Careful and detailed evaluation of the efficacy of the parameterization
procedure will be carried out. This cloud/ radiation parameterization may reduce
errors in the sea-surface temperature fields simulated by GCMS and will enable a
quantitative determination of the potentially crucial cloud optical depth
feedback process in numerical experiments of climate change due to increasing
atmospheric carbon dioxide. Dr. Schlesinger will also involve two undergraduate
students (Ms. Bogar and Ms. Bishop) in research tasks related to this grant. Ms.
Bogar will asist in analyzing the inter-annual variability signal in GCM
outputs. Ms. Bishop will work on modeling of climatic conditions during the
previous interglacial (115,000 years ago). Besides gaining technical research
experience, both undergraduates will benefit from working under close
supervision of the PI and in collaboration with other graduate students and
programmers.
