The main thrust of this proposal is to study the flow between rotating eccentric
cylinders. It is expected that the results will contribute to a better
understanding of the operating conditions of journal bearings working around the
transitional point. Current experimental and theoretical knowledge of flow
between eccentric rotating cylinders is limited, and a numerical study, as
proposed, is probably the right way to go at this point. Especially if the
various operating parameters, i.e. Reynolds number, radius ratio, eccentricity,
non-isothermal behavior, temperature dependent viscosity, end-wall effects,
etc., are to be investigated with an ultimate goal of determining better design
criteria. The approach proposed here is mathematically sophisticated, but
practical, well-thoughtout, and appropriate for the task at hand. Support is
recommended.
