This project will fabricate a Phase III array of four spectrometers which will
provide measurements of all emissions with intensities greater than five
Rayleighs at solar zenith angles of >100o at signal-to-noise ratios greater than
ten. The database which covers the mesosphere and thermosphere will provide an
unprecedented capability to quantitatively test the detailed physics of
thermospheric models of major and minor ion and neutral species and associated
thermal structure.
