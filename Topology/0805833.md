Abstract

Award: DMS-0805833 Principal Investigator: Tyler D. Lawson

The goal of this project is to relate the theory of formal group laws to
phenomena in stable homotopy theory and K-theory. In stable homotopy theory, the
objective is to begin making fundamental computations in the theory of
topological automorphic forms developed in joint work with Behrens. This will
first proceed by examining and computing the homotopy of spectra associated to
certain moduli of abelian surfaces such as Shimura curves, and then by working
towards higher chromatic filtrations. In algebraic K-theory, the objective is to
make systematic use of the relationship between formal group laws and complex
cobordism to systematize computations in algebraic K-theory and relate them to
the chromatic filtration, with the hope of gaining understanding of the
"chromatic redshift" phenomenon.

The subject of homotopy theory arose as a method to answer concrete questions in
geometry by way of algebra. In the process, a strange connection was discovered
with formal group laws, which themselves are intimately related to quite
different subjects such as number theory and elliptic curves. In particular,
there is a surprising connection between elliptic curves and mathematical
physics. This research focuses on applying very recent developments in homotopy
theory to study connections such as these, with the hope that our understanding
of number theory and our understanding of homotopy theory can benefit each
other.
