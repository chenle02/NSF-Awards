Ultra high speed signal processing on silicon is a key requirement in
applications such as computer vision, three-dimensional graphics, and phased
array radar. The majority of these advanced algorithms require the use of
nonlinear functions such as the reciprocal,the square-root, and trigonometric
functions. This project is to research the development of Reduced Cycle
Nonlinear Multi-Function Chips to meet these critical needs and to gain new
knowledge in this key area. The proposed approach would reduce such nonlinear
computations for 32-bit data to two clock cycles, or even a single cycle at the
expense of increased complexity the approach is also function independent. It
offers the potential of providing multi-function capability on a single
chip/cell. The functions chosen for the proposed research, based upon a study of
signal processing algorithms, are the reciprocal, square-root, sine/cosine, and
the arctan functions it will also study two- argument functions. The specific
functions chosen are complex (and thus two-argument) magnitude, phase,
reciprocal, and logarithm functions.
