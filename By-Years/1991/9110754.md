Measurements of the collective excitations of liquid helium have led to a
detailed understanding of the microscopic dynamics in both the normal and
superfluid (sf) phases. Inelastic neutron scattering has proven to be one of the
most useful tools in studying these excitations. It is proposed to extend these
studies to negative pressures. At low negative pressure the liquid is
metastable, allowing measurements to be carried out. At larger negative
pressures (around 9 bars), the speed of sound approaches zero and the liquid is
no longer stable. Macroscopic samples (one or more cc. in volume) of liquid He
at negative pressure will be created using a novel expansion cell. The time
structure of a typical short-pulse neutron source will be used to carry out
inelastic n scattering measurements in the interval between pressure
equilibration and the nucleation of gas bubbles.
