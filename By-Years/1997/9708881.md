*** 9708881 SWEENEY This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Hunter
College of CUNY in acquiring an electrospray (ESI) mass spectrometer interfaced
with an HPLC. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) self-assembly of supramolecular porphyrin arrays,
(2) technetium complexes of metal oxides, (3) mitomycin-DNA adducts, (4) the
cycloaddition path to glycosal transfer, and (5) synthesis of adjacently linked
polyethers. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique
of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular
weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in
combination with high resolution provides the latest technique available in mass
spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available
for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this capability in
mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
fields of chemistry. ***
