Understanding the power of nondeterminism is one of the most fundamental
problems in theoretical Computer Science. Many problems that arise in practice
fall into the nondeterministic class NP. A lot of effort has been put, by many
researchers, in understanding various aspects and properties the class NP. The
goal of this project is to enhance our current understanding of the class
NP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project studies the structure
of NP in the average-case world and seeks to develop new techniques to
understand relations among NP and related classes in the average-case realm.
This would bring out new connections between average-case and worst-case
complexities of NP. The nonuniform complexity of NP and related classes will be
investigated. This work attempts to understand the intrinsic properties of NP-
complete sets. All these investigations will help us gain more insight into the
nature of nondeterminism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: A goal of the
project is to unearth connections among several hypotheses that have been
previously used in different contexts. This effort could help in unifying some
of the underlying concepts of these hypotheses. This might pave way to make
progress on some basic problems. The results of the research will be integrated
into advanced courses. The course materials, in the form of lecture notes, will
be made available on the web. The informal seminars will form collaborative
efforts among students and faculty from two different universities. All results
of the research will be broadly distributed to the scientific community, and
will be posted on line at ECCC. Results will be submitted to major scientific
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
