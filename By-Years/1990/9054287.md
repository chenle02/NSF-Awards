The workshops are designed to introduce participants to the rapidly changing
technologies in molecular biology. Teleconferencing and computer networking will
be used to promote integration of the workshops, as well as pre- and post-
workshop activities. Strong lines of communication will be developed, between
the participants and the instructors, to facilitate the incorporation of the
learned techniques and concepts into the education of undergraduates at the
participants' home institutions.
