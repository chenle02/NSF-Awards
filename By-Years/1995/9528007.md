Title: Implementation of a Pilot Global Geocryological Database at WDC-A
Glaciology This is a one year grant to rescue, recover, archive and disseminate
permafrost data that was collected in the former Soviet Union but is in danger
of getting lost permanently. The project is guided by criteria for priority
databases established by the IPA working group on permafrost data and
information. This data is very valuable for climate research.
