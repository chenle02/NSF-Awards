ZnSiGeP2 heteroepitaxial films will be grown by chemical beam epitaxy(CBE), and
plasma-assisted CBE; SiO2/Si structures, and passivated Si reference surfaces
will be synthesized by plasma-assisted processing and wet chemistry techniques
for basic investigations of materials synthesis and processing phenomena, and
for investigations of nonlinear optical(NLO) effects. The NLO studies will be
conducted with ZnGeP2 bulk single crystals and ZnSiGeP2 heteroepitaxial films
grown on Si, GaP and SiGe/Si substarates, and at SiO2/Si surfaces. These studies
are expected to yield basic information relative to NLO mechanisms, and in
particular their dependence on interfacial strain, and interfacial bonding
chemistry. This information will then be used as a basis for the design of
device structures, which will then be evaluated for potential applications. %%%
This research is expected to advance the materials science in synthesis and
processing of novel nonlinear optical materials with enhanced properties. This
information will form the basis for evaluation of their performance advantages
as optoelectronic circuit elements used in advanced computing, information
processing, and telecommunications.
