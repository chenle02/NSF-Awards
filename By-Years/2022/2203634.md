The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry funds
Professor Miriam Freedman for this project which is focused on the acidity of
aerosols. This property of aerosol particles impacts chemical reactions in the
atmosphere as well as human health. Based on the composition of aerosol
particles and gas-phase molecules, the acidity of aerosol particles can be
estimated using models. These models predict that aerosol particles are highly
acidic, but results differ depending on the model used. This project aims to
develop a novel direct measure of aerosol acidity using carbon quantum dots.
Using this approach will make it possible to explore the molecular origins of
the high acidity of aerosol particles for both marine and continental
environments. Further development of the probes will enable applications in
atmospheric chemistry studies or in other fields where highly acidic samples are
of interest. This project has potential for technology transfer, provides
training for undergraduate and graduate students, and supports dissemination to
the public through outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study the acidity of
aerosol particles, this project will use ratiometric fluorescence imaging of
carbon quantum dots. Currently, the Freedman research group has developed a
probe that covers the pH range of 0 â€“ 3.5. To determine the origins of the high
acidity of continental and marine aerosol, the pH of model systems of organic
compounds with salts will be characterized. Ammonium sulfate will be used for
model continental aerosol and sodium chloride will be used for model marine
aerosol. The organic compounds are chosen to be relevant for the specific type
of aerosol as well as to have a range of pKa values, a range of complexities in
composition from single organic compounds to mixtures, and a range of surface
activities. To develop the probe further, the project aims to increase the pH
range that can be measured, incorporate an internal standard, and deposit the
probe on substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
