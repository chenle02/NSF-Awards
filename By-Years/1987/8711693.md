A vertical field-effect transistor may in principal combine the advantages of
both the permeable base transistor and hetrojunction biploar transistor in
providing the capability of achieving ballistic action. A device design is
developed as a new structure for studying ballistic transport, and modifications
to the structure are aimed at limiting parasitics; the results are explored to
make practical use of the device possible.
