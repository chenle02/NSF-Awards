Division 0f Ocean Sciences, the Office of Polar Programs, and the Office of the
Director. Each Sea Grant Fellow will have a wide range of opportunities and

environmental protection in Antarctica, including marine areas, and
Biocomplexity in the Environment. The National Sea Grant Federal Fellowship
Program is administrated through NOAA's Office of Oceanic Research Programs.
Work will involve a variety of activities including active participation in the
review process, reviewing and preparing summaries of environmental impact
assessment, and involvement in meetings and conference preparation.

Over the years, the National Sea Grant Fellowship program has provided NSF with

assistance to NSF in a variety of program offices. The Fellows have benefited
from their experience at NSF and have gone on to further their careers in their
field.
