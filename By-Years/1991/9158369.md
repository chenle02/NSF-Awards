New chemical strategies for obtaining processable gels from alkoxide precursors
will be sought. New chemical reagents for inducing gel formation will be
identified, and alkoxide precursors that decompose to hydroxides by mild
thermolysis or photolysis will be designed. These will be used for the devel-
opment of thermosetting gels and techniques for photolitho- graphically
patterning oxide films, respectively. Group III, IV, and V semiconductor
nanoclusters will be prepared by application of a recently discovered, solution-
phase phosphide synthesis. Major efforts will be made to convert these amorphous
powders into crystalline forms by heating either as solids or in high boiling
solvents. %%% Dr. William E. Buhro of Washington University is supported as a
Presidential Young Investigator by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program. Dr. Buhro's project seeks to develop new
strategies for the fabrication of oxide and phosphide materials. Some of these
materials may have important industrial and commercial applications.
