0923425&lt;br/&gt;Hamoush&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This major research
instrumentation (MRI) proposal requests funding for a Dynamic Shear Rheometer,
Bending Beam Rheometer, Direct Tension-Blister Test, Sessile drop device, and
soil and asphalt test system. This instrumentation will provide important
research tools for North Carolina A&amp;T State University. The instruments will
be used for interdisciplinary studies of a bio-based and bio-degradable adhesive
for construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this instrumentation, the
investigators will study the usefulness of by-products of bio-fuel in
construction adhesives. In particular, this study will investigate the
replacement of petroleum-based adhesives (a non-biodegradable material) with
biobased, bio-degradable adhesives from swine manure. This study will
investigate the rheological characteristics of bio-based adhesives and compare
them with those of petroleum-based adhesives. The requested instrumentation will
lead to fundamental improvements in properties of construction adhesives and
considerable reduction in the cost of their manufacture. The goals of this
research are to both eliminate the need for storing swine manure and to improve
the nation's sustainable infrastructural systems through appropriate usage of
these by-products in construction adhesives such as asphalt binder and sealant
used in highway and airport pavement. This results in major improvements in
environmental and economical impacts in both the agricultural and construction
sectors. Hence, this project offers a unique, simultaneous approach that
addresses increasing depletion of petroleum resources and development of
sustainable construction adhesives for infrastructure.
