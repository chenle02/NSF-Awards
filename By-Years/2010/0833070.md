ABSTRACT

Research Objectives and Approaches The principal objective of this project is to
develop a continuum thermoelasticity of materials with anomalous (non-Fourier
type) heat conduction from the standpoint of fractal material structures. This
will substantially broaden the scope of materials whose mechanics can be handled
by partial differential equations. While the conventional mate¬rials in most
continuum theories are assumed to be smooth and to satisfy the postulate of
separation of scales, the planned research, being focused on fractal materials,
will drop that requirement. New forms of differential equations will be derived
and employed in solution of the initial-boundary value problems, and new
fundamental understanding of constitutive responses (thermo-elasticity and
thermo-viscoelasticity) of various materials having fractal geometries will be
developed.

Societal Benefits This project will have impact on the applicability of
continuum mechanics (and physics) to studies of material response. The highly
complex media which have so far been the domain of condensed matter physics,
geophysics and biophysics etc. (polymer clusters, gels, rock systems,
percolating networks, nervous systems, pulmonary systems...) will become open to
studies conventionally reserved for smooth materials. This will allow the set-up
and solution of initial-boundary value problems of very complex/multiscale
materials of both elastic and inelastic type. Two graduate students will be
involved in this research. The proposed research goes hand-in-hand with the
writing of a monograph Thermoelasticity with Finite Wave Speeds (for Oxford
Mathematical Monographs) on thermoelastodynamics of materials with anoma¬lous
heat conduction.
