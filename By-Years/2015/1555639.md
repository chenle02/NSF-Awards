General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support ongoing
research, translation, and free online dissemination activities of The Collected
Papers of Albert Einstein. The funds would help to support making available in
print and online thousands of Einstein documents and Einstein-related material
accompanied by in-depth scholarly research. The volumes are an indispensable
resource for 20th century science and technology studies, scientists, historians
and philosophers of science, but also for the study of European and American
history, network and scientific communications, education, science policy, the
relation of science, technology, and government and many other areas of
inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the
grant period, the editors will prepare 2 documentary volumes and 2 English
translation volumes covering the years 1925 through 1929, as part of a series
that is projected to reach thirty volumes and ultimately contain more than
30,000 documents and their scholarly annotation. The two volumes will contain
approximately 150-200 writings (articles, drafts, lectures) by Einstein as
annotated full-text, 800 letters by and to Einstein as annotated full-text,
1,500 letters by and to Einstein in English-language abstracts, references to
1,000 third party primary documents a bibliography of several hundred secondary
sources. This work will complement and enhance digital humanities and science
initiatives.
