St. Norbert College, a liberal arts institution established in 1891, is the
recipient of ARI funds to renovate John Minahan Science Hall, a 27 year old
facility, to improve research space for the Division of Natural Sciences.
Students engage in original research, learn to use sophisticated equipment, and
author papers and present results at professional conferences. Active learning
and research training in environmental science, biology, chemistry, and geology,
and independent and collaborative senior thesis projects, mandate efficient use
of laboratory space and the college is committed in accommodating this type of
space. Existing research and research training, and support space will be
reconfigured, providing greater opportunities for students to conduct research
on a daily basis. Once renovations are completed, dedicated laboratory space
will support research training in ichthyology, environmental chemistry and
measurements, ecology, limnology and hydrology. This award will enable the
Division to increase its ability to conduct quality research and research
training and to attract additional faculty and students. An enhanced facility
will help students appreciate and understand the scientific process. The College
is committed to science education, which cannot be obtained without an integral
research component. St. Norbert's goal is to continue to train scientists of the
highest caliber for the 21st century.
