This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at
Tufts University.

Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of
cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of
cosmic strings would provide a window onto fundamental physics at energies
beyond the reach of any accelerator. Observation of a cosmic superstring network
could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory. Professor
Olum's research will advance our knowledge of the cosmic string network as it
would exist today and would have existed in the past under any specific cosmic
string theory. In particular, it will lead to accurate information about the
spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings. This information will
allow us to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if such
gravitational waves are detected in the future. If they are not detected, it
will enable us to set limits on the possibilities for cosmic strings, and thus
on underlying theories of high-energy physics. As a result, research in this
area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one
of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the
universe. Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in the work and
thus train future generations of research physicists. The work will further
connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.

More technically, Professor Olum will study the shape of cosmic string loops to
determine how many cusps they have and to calibrate the signals that they might
produce for comparison with observational limits on gravitational waves from
pulsar timing. He will also study networks that might arise from cosmic strings
with a low probability of reconnection when they intersect each other, as might
be found in cosmic superstring theories.
