9529289 Hsueh In this project, the PI will construct an eddy-resolving General
Circulation Model of the marginal seas of northern China to study the dynamics
of mesoscale flow features caused by topographic effects on the Kuroshio -- an
effect common to all western boundary currents. Data from a Taiwanese study,
KEEP-ll (Kuroshio Edge Exchange Processes- ll), of the continental margin area
northeast of Taiwan will be incorporated into the model. The PI will collaborate
with Taiwanese scientists by participating in these surveys in an advisory
capacity, which will ensure the availability of the data.
