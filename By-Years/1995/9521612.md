Abstract M.Gad-el-Hak Notre Dame CTS-9521612 The proposed research seeks to
explore the feasibility of a pumping technique that would be applicable at small
Reynolds numbers. This regime is of particular importance in
microelectromechanical devices. Such devices are increasingly being considered
for a range of applications. The mechanics for this pump is based upon the
rotation of a non-circular cylinder placed asymmetrically in a duct. Under the
SGER, the PI will undertake a series of computers to test the viability of the
technique, which has been indicated by some of the PI's earlier work.
