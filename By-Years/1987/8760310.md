The incorporation of antibiotics and sulfonamides in livestock and poultry
feeds has risen steadily since 1950. Concern over the addition of subtherapeutic
levels of antimicrobials to animal feed is growing because of its potential as a
hazard to human health. Current methods of analysis of sulfonamides are labor-
intensive, time-consuming and require extensive sample preparation. The goals of
this research are: (1) production of monoclonal antibodies which can serve as
analytical reagents to detect, with high specificity and sensitivity,
sulfonamides in samples requiring little or no cleanup, and (2) successful
construction of stabilized cell lines which secrete the desired monoclonal
antibodies. Successful development of such assays will greatly facilitate the
detection of sulfonamide residues in in meat and poultry and thus help to assure
the safety of food products for the American people.
