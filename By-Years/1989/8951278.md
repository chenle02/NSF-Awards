This project will incorporate modern instruments for the collection, analysis
and interpretation of data from field studies in the geosciences.
Quantitatively-oriented field-based projects will be incoporated into the
regular course offerings and independent studies in geophysical prospecting,
geomorphology, and hydrogeology. This will be done by adding state-of-the-art
instrumentation, computer hardware, and software, specifically a 12-channel
refraction/reflection seismograph, an electromagnetic conductivity meter, an
electronic distance meter, and a Macintosh II with associated peripheral
hardware and software. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
