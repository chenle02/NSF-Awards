This proposal requests support for a conference on the changing role of the
United States in the Circumpolar North. The aims are two-fold: to discuss
priorities for U.S. arctic policy in the currently evolving political, social
and economic climate, and to expand communication among the agencies and
organizations whose decisions affect the Arctic. The conference will explore
whether current policies could benefit from revision, and recommend how this may
be achieved.
