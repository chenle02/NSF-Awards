The regulation of cell metabolism is a complex process, occurring at different
levels during development. Important metabolic enzymes, such as ketone bodies
enzymes, are differentially expressed in other cells from brain. During
development, ketone bodies are an important source of energy for metabolism and
serve as precursors for lipid synthesis in brain. The Principal investigator is
interested in how glucocorticoids, steroid hormones, stimulate the activity of a
ketone body metabolizing enzyme, 3-ketoacid CoA transferase. This research
project will investigate how glucocorticoid hormones influence the metabolic
activity of oligodentrocytes, specialized glial cells which form myelin sheaths,
the insulating layer surrounding axons. Experiments using cultures of
oligodentrocytes will be used to study the various steps in the synthesis of
coenzyme A transferase. Studies will be performed to determine the effect of
glucocorticoids on the transcription of gene coding for this enzyme. As the
myelin sheath assures integrity of transmission in the nervous system, this
research has far reaching implications for neurobiology.
