The Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL) is a web-based collection of
resources for undergraduate STEM education in the analytical sciences. This
project increases the usefulness of the ASDL by adding new services to promote
the library's visibility to its users and foster community building between
teachers and practitioners of the analytical sciences. New features to the
library include automatic notification of newly added content through utilities
such as email alerts or RSS feeds, personal space where users can organize ASDL
content, a system to allow user ratings and annotations to library content,
user-generated discussion forums and the ability to share pedagogical methods
based on library content. The added features emphasize the creation of a
disciplinary-focused internet-mediated community of practice to serve as a model
for how an NSDL digital library can foster shared development of resources and
bring together faculty from remote regions. The internet-mediated community of
practice developed through this project serves as a model for broadening
participation by faculty members at comprehensive universities, liberal arts
colleges, and community colleges. The ASDL features cumulatively work to
increase effective teaching and resources for undergraduate analytical sciences.
