This grant provides support to develop a soft lithography and printing facility
for research and education in electronically-active organic materials at the
University of Texas at Austin. The facility represents the first cleanroom
designated for organic materials research and organic electronics development on
campus. It will be fully complementary to the state-of-the-art nanoscale
fabrication and characterization tools currently available. Recent advances in
organic electronic devices and plastic circuits have rekindled research organic
semiconducting and conducting materials. Efforts in this area at the University
of Texas at Austin have largely focused on the fundamental aspects of materials
design as well as device fabrication and processing development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The facility will be open to researchers and students in
the University community and will greatly enhance the education and training of
students in materials research. It will also strengthen ties with other UT
campuses and foster scientific interactions with current and new industrial
partners. The facility will be open to guest researchers, including lecturers
from undergraduate institutions. As part of the University's effort to increase
awareness in nanotechnology among undergraduates, the facility will also support
team research projects in two laboratory-based courses.
