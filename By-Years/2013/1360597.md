A program of investigations of generation, storage, and distribution of quantum
information, using individual photons and trapped ultra-cold atoms will be
continued. Work in our group has previously demonstrated entanglement of spin-
wave hyperfine qubits to optical qubits encoded in the polarization, spatial or
frequency degrees of freedom of single photons, as well as entanglement of two
remote spin-wave qubits. Most recently, quantum memory times have been extended
beyond 0.1 seconds and low-noise, high-efficiency wavelength conversion between
telecom and storable fields achieved. This opens a path toward long-distance
atomic entanglement using light propagation in optical fibers. However to date,
the success probability of the entanglement generation protocols in a given
trial is always very small, as the light fields contain a large vacuum
component. By exploiting the physics of Rydberg atom interactions the success
probability will be increased by a factor of up to one thousand, fast, efficient
deterministic single photon sources will be created, quantum gates between
qubits encoded in trapped ultra-cold atoms implemented, and storage of entangled
quantum states with lifetimes in excess of 1 second achieved. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This activity will expedite the development of a new generation of
capabilities for creation, distribution and storage of multi-qubit entangled
states and contribute to future implementations of long-distance quantum
repeaters and distributed quantum computing. Moreover efficient production of
multi-qubit entangled states will impact fundamental physics investigations and
advance quantum-enhanced technologies. The research will have a significant
influence on the future development of quantum information processing, resulting
in the development of new tools for light-matter entanglement generation and
distribution. The project will involve extensive graduate and undergraduate
student training and participation.
