Thin coatings are applied to surfaces to prevent oxidation, to control
radiation heat losses, to protect against corrosion, etc. The thermophysical
properties of the coatings are needed for accurate design work. However, special
techniques have to be employed for accurate determination of the properties. The
proposed work is aimed at formulating and implementing a technique for the
accurate measurements of the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of
thin-film coatings. Once developed, the technique will be applied to coating-
substrate systems of industrial relevance.
