Phloem Physiology: Regulation of Sugar Transport and Allocation: Studies will
focus on elucidating the manner in which the connection between the leaf source
and phloem is regulated to control photosynthesized carbohydrate allocation
between storage in chloroplast and vacuolar pools and translocation into the
phloem. The mechanisms will be investigated using patch clamp electrode
techniques on isolated protoplasts and vacuoles. A special technique devised by
Dr. Lucas that uses fluorescent probes incorporated into lipsomesliposomes will
be applied to study whether transport is symplastic via plasmodesmata or
apoplastic. The growth and productivity of plants depends on the movement of
carbohydrate photosynthesized in the leaf from the leaf via the phloem to the
stem, root, flower or seed where it will be used or stored. Knowledge of how
phloem is loaded and unloaded, how these processes are regulated, and the nature
of the signal from sink to source is basic to the planned scientific development
of more efficient plants.
