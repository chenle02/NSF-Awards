High energy density batteries are the power sources of choice for a variety of
military and consumer applications. Presently, much of the primary battery needs
are met by lithium (Li) systems. A problem with Li batteries has been their
tendency to exhibit unsafe behavior due in some part to the low melting point of
Li. To overcome this problem, an anode with similar properties to Li but with a
higher melting point is worth exploring, for example magnesium (Mg). The overall
goal of this study is to develop a high energy density Mg battery which will
have the high power capabilities of Li systems such as Li/SOCi2 and Li/SO2
cells, but would be significantly safer, and would not have the startup (voltage
delay) problems of aqueous Mg batteries. The key to the successful development
of such a battery would be the selection of an electrolyte solution in which Mg
will be stable under both open-circuit and discharge conditions. A perceived
advantage of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a solvent is that the protective films
formed on Mg from its reaction with SO2 would be insoluble in this solvent
making the Mg anode highly stable. Specific uses of the Mg batteries will
include communication devices, robotics, hand-held tools, toys, military and
space equipment and biomedical devices. This Small Business Innovation Research
Phase I will consist of experimental work to test the feasibility of developing
high energy density batteries utilizing Mg as the anode. SO2 will be used either
as a cathode depolarizer or as an electrolyte solvent. In the latter
configuration, the cathode depolarizer will be either CuF2 or NiF2. Two specific
tasks will be performed: (1) Electrolyte characterization - electrolytes
comprised of Mg(AlCl4)2 or Mg(GaCl4)2 in SO2 will be prepared and their
conductivities determined. (2) Fabrication and testing of laboratory Mg cells -
The electrochemical tests will include measurement of the open- circuit
potential of the cells at different temperatures, for example, -20, 0 and 25oC,
determination of their discharge capacities at a variety of current densities
and temperatures, and an evaluation of the storage behavior of the cells.
