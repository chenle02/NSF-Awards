The aim of this project is to enhance the educational opportunities available to
students and to increase the instructional efficiency of the courses. A video
microscopy system is being used to demonstrate microscopic specimens and to
teach microscopy techniques. The macroscopic capabilities of the system are used
to identify anatomical structures and illustrate dissection techniques. An
environmental chamber enables students to examine effects of environmental
factors on biological processes. Ecology study chambers allow students to
observe intractions between organisms in an controlled environment and to
perform pollution studies. Spectrophotometers are used for hemoglobin
determination, enzyme kinetics, and water quality testing. Computers are used
with the video microscopy system to allow students to observe structures and
techniques at their own pace, to quiz themselves at their own pace, and to
design an interactive audiovisual presentation with video discs. This equipment
allows students to engage in a wide variety of laboratory exercises and enhances
the efficiency of laboratory instruction. The college is contributing an amount
equal to the award.
