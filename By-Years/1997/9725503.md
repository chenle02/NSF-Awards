The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), in cooperation with the
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), will hold a two-day
national conference to promote progress in understanding and implementing
outcomes assessment for accreditation in engineering education. The meeting,
which will take place September 19-20, 1997, in Washington, D.C., will bring
together representatives of higher education institutions, industry, government,
professional associations and accrediting agencies to accomplish six things:
increase understanding of national trends in higher education assessment;
examine progress in assessment in other disciplines such as dentistry and
mathematics to understand what may be relevant to engineering; review assessment
practices in industry that may be relevant to educational assessment; increase
understanding of the goals of outcomes assessment in accreditation; promote
dissemination and sharing of best assessment practices; and lay the groundwork
for a continuing forum on outcomes assessment in engineering education. ASEE
requests $49,500.00 from the National Science Foundation to enable this review
of progress in engineering education assessment that will also provide
information on a variety of assessment strategies to a broad engineering
education audience. NSF funding for this conference will provide for set-up
costs, travel costs of the speakers, dissemination of prepared papers and
materials, and a summary report and proceedings.
