Radin will study mathematical problems relating the causes of crystalline
symmetry in low temperature matter and classification of the dynamical systems
associated with uniquely ergodic tilings of Euclidean space. The methods to be
used are a combination of traditional ergodic theory and new techniques from
aperiodic tilings. It is expected that the recent results on rotation symmetric
tilings will open significant new research in the study of material structure
and in the classification of dynamical systems. This project involves research
in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average
behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed
in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can be placed the modern
theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this
way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on
homogeneous spaces.
