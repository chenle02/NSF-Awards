ECS-9409111 Plummer The proposed National Nanofabrication Network initially will
consist of two hub facilities on the east and west coasts at Cornell University
and Stanford University, growing from the existing NNF and the Center for
Integrated Systems (CIS) laboratories. Three additional nodes will offer
critical masses of expertise in fabrication with particular emphasis in specific
areas: wide band gap semiconductors, novel materials and semiconductor etching
at Howard University, the Pennsylvania State University and the University of
California at Santa Barbara respectively. Mechanisms are proposed for future
expansion of the capabilities of the network by the affiliation of a greater
number of university, government and industrial laboratories. The proposed N3,
which has as its core the above five major universities, will provide to the US
research community a new dimension in fabrication capabilities. The network will
lead as a provider of services, as a knowledge resource, and as a source of
instruction to the community. By providing access to the most advanced materials
nanofabrication processes and expertise, the capabilities of a diverse and
growing body of researchers throughout the nation will be dramatically enhanced.
