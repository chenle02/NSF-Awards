We propose the acquisition of a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. The research proposed
for the new instrument will improve our capability for determining high-
resolution protein and nucleic acid structures in solution from two-dimensional
NMR experiments and will improve our ability to elucidate protein and nucleic
acid complexes. The most effective means of deriving nucleic acid and protein
solution structure by using the complete relaxation matrix analysis of 2D NOE
spectra to obtain numerous internuclear distances and scalar-coupling-based 2D
NMR experiments to yield torsion angle constraints, in conjunction with the
computational techniques of distance geometry, molecular mechanics and
restrained molecular dynamics will be explored. Reverse-detection heteronuclear
2D NMR experiments will enable resonance assignments and structural insights.
The improved capabilities should also aid in our studies of ligand binding to
biopolymers, thus leading to greater mechanistic insights.
