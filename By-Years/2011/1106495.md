The PI requests funding to support the 11th National Conference on Science,
Policy and the Environment on Our Changing Oceans, to be held January 19-21,
2011, at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in
Washington, DC.

Our Changing Oceans Conference will provide a forum for exploring the crisis
facing our oceans, the new knowledge and tools needed, and the policies and
governance to protect and sustain oceans. It will be an interactive three-day
event including keynotes, plenary sessions, symposia and breakout sessions
focused on eight major themes: 1) oceans and carbon; 2) coastal ocean change and
the potential for adaptation; 3) oceans and living marine ecosystems; 4) oceans
and human health; 5) how the oceans affect non-coastal regions; 6) tipping
points; 7) white Arctic versus blue Arctic; and 8) exploring to understand
change.

Broader Impacts:

The broader impacts include sharing the current state of science on ocean issues
and linking science to policy where relevant; communicating key messages; and
reframing issues; generating recommendations to foster interdisciplinary
research; developing targeted and actionable science-based recommendations;
catalyzing partnerships among institutions and organizations and create new
initiatives to advance ocean conservation.

NCSE will publish a report of conference highlights and recommendations, which
will be disseminated Nationally. Communication targets for conference outcomes
will include Congress, federal agencies, key national stakeholder organizations,
and international bodies.
