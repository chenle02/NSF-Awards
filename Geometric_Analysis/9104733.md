This award supports a series of workshops concerned with various aspects of
representation theory. The topics to be considered include Lie algebras and Lie
superalgebras, enveloping algebras and quantized analogs, Hecke algebras, graded
algebras, algebras of differential operators, noetherian and artinian algebras,
and classical orders. This award supports a series of summer workshops in
algebraic representation theory, to be held during the summers of 92-94 at the
University of Washington. There will be a series of lectures by visiting senior
algebraists, opportunities for discussions of mathematics of mutual interest,
and collaborative research by various combinations of the mathematicians
present. These workshops will emphasize the involvement of younger researchers
and graduate students.
