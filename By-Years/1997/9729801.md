This award will help fund the 1998 National Conference of Black Physics
Students (NCBPS) meeting which will be held March 5-7, 1998 as part of a joint
meeting with the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP), in Lexington,
Kentucky. The host institution for NCBPS 1998 will be the University of
Kentucky. The 1998 conference will be the twelfth consecutive meeting of NCBPS.
The objective of the annual NCBPS meeting is to assist and encourage Black
students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter and complete
Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research, teaching, or technical careers
commensurate with their educational achievement in physics. This joint meeting
with NSBP will enable the undergraduate and graduate students of the NCBPS to
interact with a large number of successful minority physicists in both a formal
and informal environment. The benefits of this communication should be great, in
terms of the objectives of the NCBPS. The University of Kentucky will bring in
public school minority students and their teachers during one day of this joint
conference in order to enhance the awareness of young minorities in the state of
the opportunities for and accomplishments of African- Americans in physics in
particular and science in general.
