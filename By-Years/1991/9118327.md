The objective of this award is to examine the relationship between chromatin
structure and gene activity in higher eukaryotes. Studies on basal and regulated
transcription by RNA polymerase II have generally focussed upon the
identification and characterization of promoter-and enhancer-binding proteins
with naked DNA templates. Recent findings on the mechanism of transcriptional
activation by these sequence specific factors strongly suggest that dynamic
interactions between chromatin and the transcription factors are involve in the
regulation of gene expression. For instance, it has been found that these
transcriptional "activators" may actually function as antirepressors--that is
they appear, at least in part, to counteract repression of basal transcription
by chromatin. In this award the working hypothesis is that there are key
interactions between transcription factors and components of chromatin in the
course of activation and repression of gene activity. Two different systems for
reconstitution of chromatin will be developed, and then the resulting chromatin
will be used as template for in vitro transcription analysis . These studies
should lead to a better understanding of the process of gene activation and
should eventually be applied to the molecular analysis of diseases involving
improper expression of genes, such as some forms of cancer.
