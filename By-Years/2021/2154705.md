Quantum computers appear imminent. Indeed, after decades of theoretical work
demonstrating the power of quantum computation, followed by steady experimental
progress in academia, several large companies and startups are now investing
significant resources in building quantum computers. It has long been understood
that the advent of quantum computers would render currently deployed public-key
cryptosystems insecure. NIST's post-quantum standardization effort will address
this, but is only the tip of the iceberg. Cryptography in a post-quantum future
does not merely involve swapping out one set of hard problems for another, but
instead requires a paradigm shift in the way we think about attackers and
approach the challenge of securing information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project brings together researchers with complementary expertise in classical
(including post-quantum) cryptography and quantum cryptography to develop new
foundational theories needed for quantum-secure cryptography and, equally
importantly, to train the next generation of students to "natively" view
cryptography from a quantum perspective. Some of the problems to be addressed
include (1) security of symmetric-key primitives against quantum attackers; (2)
investigating the power of the quantum random-oracle model; and (3) seeking to
overcome existing impossibility results by exploring (3a) cryptosystems in which
honest parties use quantum computation (but classical communication) and (3b)
classical constructions proven secure via quantum
reductions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
