Does the dialect you speak determine how you hear the speech around you? With
National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tyler Kendall and Dr. Valerie Fridland
will conduct twenty-four months of linguistic research investigating how vowel
perception is affected by dialect experience. Utilizing web-based perception
experiments to gain participation from across the U.S., and recording speech
from a subset of these participating subjects, the project will investigate what
links exist between the perception and production of vowel categories (e.g.,
"ee" and "ih") and how these categories are mediated by variation at the level
of the community and the individual. In particular, the research will examine
whether distinctive regional vowel changes that affect three main dialects of
American English (Northern, Southern and Western) are contributing to greater
diversity in speech processing, in addition to speech production, and whether
the degree to which individuals show such vowel changes themselves affects their
speech processing in relation to their community norms. To gain a better
understanding of the impact of social influences on speech perception, this
research will investigate whether listeners' categorization of vowels is also
affected by their expectations regarding learned social distinctions among
speakers, such as regional affiliation or
gender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing evidence suggests that socially derived
linguistic variation provides more than simply clues to social identity, and, in
fact, plays a pivotal role in the actual processing and decoding of the speech
signal itself. Research in this area should prove to have applied benefits such
as informing educational approaches to non-native language/dialect populations
and also to the development of voice recognition technologies. Further,
comparative examination of the productive and perceptual range of speakers
affected by different dialect experiences will inform both speech and hearing
science and sociolinguistic research, contributing to basic theories about the
nature of speech processing and of sound change.
