This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program is the logical
extension of Dr. Pirkle's long-standing program in the development of CSPs,
chiral stationary phases, often known as "Pirkle Phases." The PI proposes to
develop new CSPs for the analytical and preparative scale separation of beta-
blocker-like and nonsteroidal, antiinflammatory chiral organic compounds. A new
type of CSP, called "multi-tined" is proposed that will have controlled spacing
between the selectors on the backbone of a chemically bonded stationary phase.
Preparative-scale separation schemes are also proposed based on
nonchromatographic, batch processes and hollow-fiber membrane separation
techniques. The proposed research is vitally important to the pharmaceutical
industry which is always searching for new, more economical methods for the
separation of enantiomeric materials. %%% Professor Pirkle and his students will
develop and prepare new chromatographic stationary phases for the separation of
chiral materials especially moities of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.
