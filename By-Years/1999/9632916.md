This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on fundamental studies of organized media, including cyclodextrins,
polymeric cyclodextrins and dendrimers, for application in analytical
separations with particular focus on capillary electrophoresis. A suite of
molecular spectroscopic techniques, including fluorescence, absorbance, and
circular dichroism, will be utilized in these studies and will be complemented
by stopped-flow kinetic methods. During the tenure of this three year project,
Professor Warner and his students at Louisiana State University, with
collaborative input from Professor Robert Gooden of Southern University - Baton
Rouge, will pursue the objective of better understanding organized media for use
in separation science. Organized media provide a second phase into which
analytes can move from aqueous solution. This partitioning of analytes between
aqueous solution and the organized media has wide application in the field of
separation science. The organized media can serve as a pseudo-stationary phase
and as a way of imparting solubility to otherwise insoluble analytes in aqueous
solution. In this project, organized media, particularly cyclodextrins and
dendrimers, will be synthesized and their applicability in analytical
separations of environmentally significant analytes will be evaluated.
