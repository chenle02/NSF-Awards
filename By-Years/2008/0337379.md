This project focuses on the exploitation of multiple scattering of waves to make
new inferences (statistical and deterministic) about earth materials, both in
the laboratory and in the field. The project is a collaboration between the
Physical Acoustics Laboratory and the Ultrafast Optics Laboratory at CSM and
represents the first application of ultrafast optics to geophysics. New advances
in laser technology (specifically mode-locked femtosecond lasers) mean that we
can dramatically speed up our waveform data acquisition; so much so that "3D
seismic surveys" (i.e., dense spatial measurement of particle motion time
series) can potentially be done in real-time. The experiments involved in this
project include both ultrasonic wave propagation in rocks, acoustic measurements
in boreholes and surface measurements in field conditions. Key applications of
these measurements include spatial fracture visualization in real-time, the
ability to unambiguously separate scattering attenuation from intrinsic
attenuation as well as the retrieval of the effective Green's function of a
random medium from multiple scattering speckle.
