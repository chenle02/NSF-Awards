This award provides support for purchase of an automatic DNA sequencer and
associated software. The instrument will be placed in a departmental DNA
Sequencing Facility, a shared resource serving 22 faculty research groups in
Biology and a smaller number of researchers in the Departments of Chemistry,
Psychology, and Biomedical Engineering. The instrument will enhance research
activities spaning the range of biological organization, from analyses of
molecular evolution, genomics, and bioinformatics, to behavioral ecology,
population biology and systematics. The instrumentation will also provide
significant training opportunities as students are able to use the instruments
in the facility to take their own samples through the entire process of data
collection and analysis. The Facility is an important resource for our summer
undergraduate research program, which provides research opportunities to
students from non-research institutions, and for an advanced undergraduate
course in molecular biology. The research projects of the faculty groups
encompass a variety of topics, including population genetic analyses expected to
facilitate conservation of biodiversity, molecular developmental studies of the
genetic mechanisms underlying development in both plants and animals.
