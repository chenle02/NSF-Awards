The object of this proposal is the development of scalable parallel computing
algorithms for multi-particle system flow with negligible inertial effects. The
particles may have arbitrary shape and roughness. The preparation of the
governing equation combined with the use of the advanced parallel computer in
suspension rheology. The governing Stokes equations are transformed into a set
of Fredholm integral equations of second kind with double-layer densities on the
surfaces of particles and on the boundary of the system. The methodology can be
applied to dilute and concentrated suspension flow, non- spherical particles and
irregularly bounding walls. The emphasis of this proposal is on the
computational algorithm rather than physical problems. The goal is to reduce the
frequency of inter-processor communication, and to shorten the inter-processor
messages, which would increase the overall computational speed. The development
of an efficient computational methodology for suspension flow at low Reynolds
numbers has a broad range of applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and other
industrial processes that use particulate suspensions.
