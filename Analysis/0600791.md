Geometry on the Set of Probability Measures.

Abstract of Proposed Research Wilfrid Gangbo

This project is to analyze certain variational problems connected with partial
differential equations and applications. A primary topic is the Monge-
Kantorovich mass transportation problem and its applications. Also the theory of
infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems on certain spaces of probability
measures including examples such as Vlasov-type equations and the semi-
geostrophic equation. Another class of problems are the systems of nonlinear
parabolic equations that arise in elasticity theory and the design of frames and
structures which are optimal in certain senses.

The problems to be studied in this project have applications in many different
areas including economics, physics, geosciences and engineering. The aim is
always to identify the optimal way for a process to occur; so the results may be
very important and have wide applicability.
