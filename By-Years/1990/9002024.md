This award provides funds for research and research training in the application
of mass spectrometry to the analysis of polysaccharides and the carbohydrate
portions of glycolipids and proteoglycans. Research trainees will participate in
a variety of projects dealing with macromolecules of biological interest from
animal, plant and microbial sources. Development of new techniques in mass
spectroscopy relevant to analysis of glycans will form an integral part of the
activities envisioned. In recent years, there has been growing interest
understanding the structure of polysacharrides in bacterial and plant cell walls
and to the analysis of the oligosaccharide moieties commonly found on a variety
of cellular and extracellular macromolecules. While traditional methods of
chemicals analysis have remained tedious, mass spectrometry has made it
increasingly the method of choice for the analysis of such glycans. This award
recognizes the need for more investigators skilled in the use of mass
spectrometry in this area, and for the continued development of the techniques
necessary for analysis of glycans.
