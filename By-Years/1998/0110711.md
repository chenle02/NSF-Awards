&lt;br/&gt; Steroid hormones can have rapid effects on nerve cells in the brain,
and are known to interact with binding sites in the brain. While peripheral
endocrine organs supply many steroids, it is now known that brain tissue itself
can synthesize some steroids. Glial cells can convert cholesterol to other
compounds, including the steroid dehydro-epiandrostenone (DHEA), one of the main
neuroactive steroids synthesized in the brain. In peripheral tissues a protein
enzyme known as P450c17 is responsible for DHEA formation, but this enzymatic
activity has not been found in the brain. This paradox led to controversy over
the role of this enzyme in brain DHEA formation, and whether regulation of
neurosteroid biosynthesis occurs via a brain-specific steroid biosynthetic
pathway. To help settle this debate, this project develops a genetic model of a
mouse with the P450c17 gene knocked out. The expression and activity of
steroidogenic enzymes in the brain cells of these mice are examined to
investigate the expression of a possible novel alternative pathway for DHEA
synthesis.&lt;br/&gt; Results will be important to resolving a current
controversy in neuroendocrinology. The impact will extend beyond
neuroendocrinology by leading to a better understanding of the neurochemical
pathways underlying brain function in general, and so will be important for
neurochemistry, developmental neuroscience, and the biopsychology of stress and
aging. The project also supports postdoctoral training.&lt;br/&gt;
