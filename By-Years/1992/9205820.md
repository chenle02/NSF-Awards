The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. David Yuen of the
University of Minnesota, will numerically study several classes of problems
related to dynamic evolution of magma bodies. Each problem will be constrained
by observations from classical petrology. The ultimate goal is to better
understand the dynamics of magma chambers and the formation of igneous rocks.
