This project investigates fundamental open problems in the theory of nonlinear
partial differential equations concerning large amplitude or highly oscillatory
solutions that generate shock waves. The first part of the project addresses
both mathematical and cosmological issues related to shock wave propagation in
the Einstein equations of general relativity. The second part of the project
addresses unsolved problems regarding oscillatory and resonant interactions of
strong waves in classical fluids, particularly the Euler equations for a
compressible fluid.

Shock waves are steep fronts that develop and propagate in fluids. Mathematical
models of such fluid flow involve highly nonlinear differential equations that
have solutions with very singular structure, which is difficult to analyze. For
large amplitude or highly oscillatory solutions that generate shock waves, there
is no general mathematical theory that applies, and many fundamental problems
remain unsolved. Such problems are the topics of this research project, which
develops the mathematical theory of gravitational shock waves and of shock waves
in compressible fluids. The work has potential application to cosmological
models of the universe and to modeling of transonic flow for aircraft design.
