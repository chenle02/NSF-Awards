The primary focus of the mathematical research of this Presidential Young
Investigator will be on partial differential equations arising from geometrical
problems. The equations are typically nonlinear of elliptic and parabolic type.
One class of problems involves what is known as curve shortening. The question
is one of describing the long time behavior of a family of plane curves which
evolve so that their normal velocity coincides with their curvature. More
complicated situations arise when the normal velocity depends in a general way
on the curvature and time; the latter case occurring in models of phase
transitions in two dimensions. The solution to a curve shortening problem has
been shown to develop singularities (blow-up) under certain circumstances. The
asymptotic shape of the (suitably rescaled) singular part does not depend on the
initial data. Numerical simulations suggest that the actual blow-up rate of the
curvature is a function of the iterated logarithm of time. Work will be done in
determining if this observation is true and in seeking the mechanism responsible
for the log-term in the estimate. Work will also be done in determining periodic
orbits with prescribed energy of Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles of
smooth compact surfaces. The Hamiltonian is assumed to be convex and even on
each fibre. A particular goal of the work is to establish the existence of
periodic orbits on energy surfaces whose projections on the manifold intersect
the projection of a given periodic orbit a prescribed number of times. Such a
result may be regarded as a global analog of the Poincare-Birkhoff theorem.
Related work will study the linking of parts of solutions of Hamiltonian systems
in two dimensions. Estimating linking numbers can be viewed as analogous to
measuring the number of roots of a scalar parabolic partial differential
equation.
