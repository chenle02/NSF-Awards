We propose major changes in the typical undergraduate science curriculum by
drastically changing the large lecture format. We plan to use new technology to
allow the interactive participation of students in the lecture. At the same time
our plans also include the use of peer instruction during the lecture. The
economics of today and projections for the future suggest that lecture classes
can only increase in size and that revitalization of the large lecture is a
necessity. Revitalization is also necessary since large scale dropouts are a
problem which plague introductory science (especially physics) courses, and
these dropouts have a large, usually minority, student component. IIT has a
strong representation of students from Chicago high schools. The poor
preparation (by no means limited to Chicago) adds to the urgency of the problem.
We have initiated an experiment using commercial wireless keypads and software
during the Spring semester 1995 to make a large lecture class feel smaller, to
provide on-line feedback to the lecturer and to provide motivation for students
in a large class (greater than 40) to actively participate in the learning
process. While our experiment has been not quite a semester in length in several
different classes, its promise suggests further trials and improvements. Since
much of our equipment was borrowed we are requesting funding to pursue the
development and assessment of this program for a two year period. We plan to
monitor our progress and describe the results at major American Association of
Physics Teachers meetings as well as local meetings which are to be followed by
written reports. Preliminary results of our work were presented at the AAPT
meeting in Spokane in August, 1995. This project is being carried out by two
experienced teachers; the PI of this project has been teaching introductory
physics for over 30 years.
