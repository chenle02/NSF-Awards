The Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) will conduct a broad range
of activities in support of U.S. and NSF-sponsored global geosciences programs.
SCOR will convene meetings of Working Groups to address: wave modelling; sea
level and coastal erosion; chemical/biological ocean sensor technology; sea ice
ecology; ocean- atmosphere paleochemistry; and/or pelagic biogeography. The
results of these meetings will be published or otherwise widely distributed.
SCOR will support development of a detailed plan for implementation of the Joint
Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and detailed international scientific planning
for Global Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC). The latter will be accomplished
primarily through a scientific workshop sponsored and organized by SCOR with
support from the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of Unesco.
