This award was funded through the Social and Behavioral Dimensions of National
Security, Conflict, and Cooperation competition, a joint venture between NSF and
the Department of Defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year research project
will explore the challenges and opportunities for U.S. engagement with the
publics of intensely adversarial states, where the situation is short of
conventional war and the U.S. maintains limited or no formal diplomatic
relations with the hostile government. Drawing on experts from a range of
disciplines and institutions, the project will systematically examine ten
historical and contemporary cases that are important to understanding U.S.
foreign policy and national security: the USSR/Russia, China, Vietnam, Cuba,
Libya, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, North Korea, and Iran. The research will analyze
both the costs and benefits of U.S. engagement with the publics of these
adversarial states under conditions of limited diplomatic access, providing
theoretical and policy-relevant comparisons among the cases. In addition, the
project will examine whether and how different levels of diplomatic
representation impact the U.S.'s capacity to engage with the adversary state and
its publics. It will assess what options are available, focusing on such
instruments as summits and other high level meetings, broadcasting, the media,
cultural and student exchanges, sporting visits, and military confidence-
building measures. In sum, the project will evaluate the limits and potential of
U.S. diplomacy directed at the populations of deeply hostile states and the
implications for national security policy.
