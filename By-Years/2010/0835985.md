This engineering education research project to develop and implement a
sustainable, scalable and transferable system to measure and analyze selected
characteristics of students, instructors, courses and curricula in order to
increase success in attaining student learning outcomes and engineering program
objectives. The main goal of the proposal is to develop, test and implement an
IT-supported knowledge management system which allows users to obtain high
quality, high resolution, statistically significant information with proper
controls in order to decide which factors are the most critical and how and when
they can be most impacted by intervention. Three types of studies are planned:
1) Correlational Studies investigating the impact of student, instructor and
course/curricular attributes and characteristics on student learning outcomes
and program objectives; 2) Chronobiological Studies examining the effects of
sleep and scheduling on student performance and 3) An Experimental Instructional
Laboratory demonstrating how educational interventions may be accurately
assessed. The study is using performance criteria derived from student learning
outcomes as defined by ABET as dependent variables and can be transferable
across the board for engineering programs. It incorporates feedback from
cooperative education employers and alumni to ensure the real-world relevance of
measurements and potential educational innovations. It creates a sustainable
system of measurements using information technology as part of an assessment and
feedback and an educational testing paradigm which can be applied to any new
innovation to measure the success against short-term and long-term objectives.
The project design not only allows for direct measures of sleep/activity cycles?
effects on learning and performance, it allows for these effects to be
potentially correlated with other psychological variables, such as learning
styles, multiple intelligences, and perspectives. This will provide unique new
data on student learning processes at the level of higher education.
