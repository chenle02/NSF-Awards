This proposal is concerned with developing new theory as well as the
computational tools necessary to make l1 optimal control theory a useful tool
for designing robust systems. In particular, performance robustness can be
treated in a very straightforward way when the objective function is stated in
terms of the l1 norm. The proposal points out how this can be done in the scalar
case and indicates what can also be done in the multivariable case, which is the
primary motivation of the research.
