The goal of this research is to investigate how children, adolescents, and
adults make judgments about including or excluding people from activities on the
basis of their group membership. As an example: Is it legitimate for an all-girl
ballet club to exclude a boy who wants to join? In general, the research is
designed to investigate how social knowledge, including social stereotypes,
develops across childhood and into adulthood, as well as to study how and when
this knowledge is brought to bear upon judgments in children and adults. This is
a collaborative project designed to link a well-developed literature on social
and moral reasoning from developmental psychology with conceptions of
stereotypes and intergroup relations as developed by social psychologists. The
research is based on the assumption that social stereotypes play a much broader
role in how people think about group relations than has usually been considered
by social psychologists. It is proposed that stereotypes may serve to justify
social actions, in addition to influencing judgments about and behavior toward
individuals. In the research, individuals will be asked to judge hypothetical
scenarios in which one person excludes another person from an activity which is
known to invoke stereotypes. It is expected that when principles of fairness,
equity, and rights are brought to bear on such judgments, the decisions and
behaviors will be non-exclusionary, and consistently so across a variety of
situations. When social-conventional reasoning, including beliefs about group
functioning and social stereotypes, is used as a basis of decision-making,
decisions are expected to be exclusionary, group-specific, and highly contingent
upon the current social context. It is anticipated that the findings of this
research will provide valuable information for teachers, educators, social
workers, and school psychologists who are confronted with intergroup tension in
interactions among children, adolescents, and adults in a multitude of settings.
