9225082 Bowen The purpose of this research is to resolve the population
structure of three endangered marine turtles; the loggerhead (Caretta caretta),
leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea).
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences will be used to test the general conclusion
that marine turtles return to nest in the vicinity of their natal beach. If sea
turtles nest at their natal beach, then each breeding area must be managed as an
isolated population. Since populations are the fundamental units of species
management, these findings have direct applications to the conservation of
marine turtles. Subsequently, this framework of nesting reach data will be used
to develop genetic tags for the resolution of migratory routes and feeding
ground composition. In the Pacific Ocean, genetic tags con demonstrate whether
loggerhead turtles drowned in the drift-net fishery originate on Japanese or
Australian nesting beaches. %%% This application can greatly enhance the
scientific basis for conservation and management of feeding ground populations,
and can demonstrate the utility of this approach for future conservation
efforts. Finally, these data can provide a genetic framework for the
prioritization of population recovery programs. -------- Program Director Date u
