The photosynthetic bacteria are amongst the most versatile of photosynthetic
organisms, in terms of the habitats in which they thrive, the diversity of their
physiological processes and in aspects of their biochemistry. The VIIth
International Symposium on Photosynthetic Prokaryotes (the first such to be held
in the USA) will bring together scholars from around the globe to assess recent
progress in understanding the bioconversion of radiant energy (light) into that
of the chemical bond energy found in the biomass of these organisms. Partial
financial support of the VIIth International Symposium on Photosynthetic
Prokaryotes will make it possible for young US scientists to take part in this
conference. Recent progress in the events involved in harvesting the energy of
light by converting it into more biologically useful forms, in the form of
cellular compounds, will be the focus of the symposium.
