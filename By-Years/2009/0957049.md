A three-day workshop will be held at the Wharton School, University of
Pennsylvania, on December 15-17, 2010. This workshop will bring together some of
the most prominent researchers in the field of statistics from around the world.
The main objectives of the meeting are to facilitate the exchange of recent
research developments, to provide opportunities for new researchers and
underrepresented groups, and to establish new collaborations that will channel
efforts into pending problems and open new directions for investigation.

The workshop will emphasize areas of statistical research offering innovative
approaches to problems arising in various branches of the sciences including
bioinformatics, image analysis, signal processing and genomics. At the same
time, the workshop will cover topics of fundamental statistical theory having
broad applicability. In addition to the core invited talks, the workshop will
feature poster sessions and discussion sessions.
