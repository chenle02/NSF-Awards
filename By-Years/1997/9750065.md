Abstract DBI 9750065 Daniel A. Barbash This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "The genetic and molecular basis of species
formation in Drosophila." The goal of this research is to identify genes
important for speciation in the melanogaster species complex of the fruitfly.
Small genomic regions are being crossed between D. melanogaster and D. simulans
by genetic intogression. Introgressed regions are being examined for effects on
hybrid sterility and viability, and the production of female mating pheromones.
The feasibility of using these introgressed lines for further behavioral studies
is also being assessed.
