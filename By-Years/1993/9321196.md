9321196 Doherty Univ. of Calif. - Irvine Dr. Nancy M. Doherty, Chemistry
Department, University of California Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to develop the synthetic
chemistry needed to prepare transition-metal-containing polymers. Polymers
containing an early transition metals linked through nitrido bridges will be
prepared by the ring opening of cyclic early transition metal nitride complexes.
Analogous polymers containing later transition metals will be constructed using
complexes containing N-M-N linkages as building blocks. Inorganic polymers are
an important class of materials possessing a range of properties and with a
variety of potential as well as actual applications. However, in spite of a
wealth of polymeric systems which can be imagined, this field is very
underdeveloped. The focus of this project is the development of methods to
prepare polymers which incorporate transition metals into a polymer chain. These
materials promise to have a broad range of mechanical, electrical, optical, and
magnetic properties.
