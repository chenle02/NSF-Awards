This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research spans several topics in
gravitational-wave theory, data-analysis and astrophysics of coalescing compact
binaries. It aims at (i) Extending perturbative calculations at higher post-
Newtonian order; (ii) Building effective-one-body templates of precessing,
spinning black-hole binaries which faithfully reproduce accurate numerical
relativity simulations; (iii) Implementing these effective-one-body templates in
Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) software and carrying
out searches for gravitational waves with LIGO and Enhanced LIGO; (iv) Extending
the effective-one-body approach to neutron-star/neutron-star and neutron-
star/black-hole binaries and to eccentric binaries; and (v) Grasping the physics
of recoil from merging black holes, providing a simple, manageable analytical
formula for the recoil velocity that can be easily incorporated by
astrophysicists in numerical hierarchical-merger codes. This research will have
an impact on detecting gravitational waves with LIGO, improve the ability to
extract from observed waves unique information that the waves carry, and test
fundamental equations of general relativity.
