This project is to improve the scientific understanding of Mississippi-Valley-
type (MVT) ore deposits through comprehensive geochemical characterization of
the ore-forming fluids. The approach stresses use of 87Sr/86Sr as an isotopic
tracer in minerals deposited throughout the paragenesis, specifically including
sulfides which have very low Sr concentrations. As appropriate for specific
samples the Rb-Sr analyses will be complemented by isotopic analyses of Pb and S
or C and O and abundance determinations of trace elements (Sr, Rb, K, Ca, Na,
Mg, Pb, U, halogens) (some of these analyses to be performed by collaborators).
These analyses will provide significant constraints on the provenance of the
ore-forming fluids and their flow paths from source to site of deposition.
Studies will focus on MVT districts in the Viburnum Trend, the Upper Mississippi
Valley district, the Tri-State district and the Northern Arkansas Zinc district.
