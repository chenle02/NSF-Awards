The spectacular jets that emanate from blazars - highly variable nuclei of
active galaxies - represent the most energetic long-lived phenomena in the
universe. Although accretion onto a black hole driving the jet outward via
magnetic forces is the preferred model, observational evidence is needed. This
project will monitor the brightness and angular structure of blazars at
millimeter, near-infrared, and X-ray wavelengths, and will study time-variable
polarization to identify the sites of changing emission. Variability will be
related to fluctuations in the direction of the jet close to the core. All these
data will test the many factors affecting variation, including models for
acceleration, energy sources, and amplification and structuring of the magnetic
field, in order to advance understanding of the enigmatic phenomenon of ultra-
high-speed jets in blazars.

Students, at different levels and including under-represented groups, will be
involved in the research, and trained in the discussion and presentation of
results. Data, results, images, and visualizations arising from the research
will be made available on the web, along with educational tools.
