*** 9661141 Kozakoff This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will investigate organic coatings that are both highly reflective in the
microwave and in the optical frequency regime. The technical approach uses high
density barium titanate glass microspheres in a suitable matrix material.
Loading with conductive micro fibers (or micro spheres) produces a radar
reflective as well as an optically reflective surface. This material will have
many military applications. For instance, if a pilot's helmet or raft were
coated with such a material, during search and rescue, this would make the
aircrew easy to spot from an airborne surveillance radar many miles away, long
before they can be spotted visually. The optically reflective feature would make
them easy to see during mite rescue operations where search lights are employed.
These coatings can be used in the marking of other equipment, such as life vests
and rafts, used by boaters in commercial uses. ***
