Software process research is concerned with the problem of systematically
managing and automating the development and maintenance of software systems. Key
challenges in software process research include understanding and describing
existing processes, developing and specifying new processes, and evolving
existing processes toward new processes. This project investigates techniques in
two areas of software process research that fundamentally contribute to
answering these challenges: (1) capture of characteristic process data and (2)
analysis of process data for purposes of detailed problem identification. With
such results, software engineers can gain a statistically-based understanding of
an existing process, uncover systemic problems indicating areas for possible
process improvement, and calculate the effects of changes to processes. The
starting point for the investigation is an event-based model of software
processes. An event is used to characterize the dynamic behavior of a process in
terms of identifiable, instantaneous process milestones, such as invoking a
development tool or deciding upon the next activity to be performed. A novel,
hybrid approach integrating automated and manual data collection techniques
records information about both computer-based events (e.g., tool invocation) and
non-computer-based events (e.g., decision making), relating events within and
across these categories. Metrics appropriate for revealing anomalous software
process behavior are defined and calculated. A flexible testbed for storage and
retrieval of process data with a variety of analysis tools is used as a basis
for correlation analysis. Results are validated by employing the techniques in
the capture and analysis of several real-world software processes used in
industry.
