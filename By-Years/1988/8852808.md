Four very fast numerical coprocessors will enable the incorporation of realistic
models into undergraduate applied mathematics curriculum; solution of
numerically complex problems posed by industry; and enhancement of the new
bachelors degree program in Applied and Computational Mathematics at San Jose
State University. The equipment will provide high speed computing and good
graphics in a networked environment for upper division applied mathematics
courses and industrial projects. Numerical Analysis, Linear and Non- linear
Programming, and Partial Differential Equations will introduce realistic
modeling which minimizes the programming required so that the mathematics
concepts, techniques and graphical output can be emphasized. Faculty workshops
in the curriculum and equipment use will be formed. The grantee is providing an
equal sum for the equipment obtained from non-Federal sources.
