The objective of the proposed research is to develop a parallel multifrontal
method for LU factorization of sparse unsymmetric matrices that takes full
advantage of dense matrix kernels while maintaining a purely unsymmetric
pattern. The resulting algorithm will have the potential for high performance on
large, sparse matrices with unsymmetric pattern. The algorithm will be
applicable to the many problems in science and engineering that require the
numerical solution of sparse unsymmetric systems of linear equations.
