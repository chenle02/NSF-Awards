Long and Medium Term Research: Bedforms and Sedimentary Structures Associated
with Rip Currents, Hawks Nest, Australia This award recommendation is made under
the Program for Long and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.
The program is designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct
long-term research abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards
provide opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of
unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in
foreign countries. The award will support a 7-month research visit by Dr. D.
Sherman, University of Southern California, with Dr. A. D. Short of the Coastal
Studies Unit, Department of Geography, University of Sidney, Australia. The
research aims to elucidate relationships between surf zone flow fields and
bedform dynamics through a series of field experiments. The award recommendation
provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel
abroad, stipend, dependents' allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative
allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
