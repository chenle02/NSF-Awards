We, and the world around us, are made of stardust. The goal of this project is
to learn more about the nature of that stardust. Some dying stars produce dust
made of aluminum and oxygen, which the investigators will study through both
astronomical observations and laboratory work. In the lab, the team will make
new aluminum oxide dust types to understand how they interact with light. The
investigatorsâ€™ lab measurements will be a guide to understanding how dust forms
in space. The astronomical observations trace how the material condenses in
molecular clouds to form stars, planets, and, eventually, life. Astronomy is a
gateway science, one of the first that excites children. As part of this
project, the investigators will also promote science across the K-12 curriculum
and will benefit many children in the diverse city of San Antonio. Most San
Antonio school districts are majority Hispanic. The team will target students
from under-represented groups, by providing cutting edge research via a well-
tested spectroscopy demo. They will create a classroom demonstration that
relates light and colors to the science curriculum, which will align with Texas'
science standards (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills;
TEKS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will (1) produce, characterize, and
determine optical properties of stardust analogs composed of aluminum and
oxygen; and (2) apply these optical properties to understanding dust formation
around low- and intermediate-mass evolved stars. In particular, the
investigators will compare lab-measured spectral features to those seen in
observational (mostly infrared) spectra. New dust analogs will be prepared using
four synthesis methods: smoke production, heating of hydrated aluminous solid,
laser ablation, and a hot filament reactor. These samples will be characterized
structurally and chemically by electron microscopy, and spectroscopically in the
visible to mid-infrared, in order to determine their complex dielectric
functions. Many of the astronomical observations are already complete, including
mid-infrared spectra of nearby stars from the NSF-supported Gemini Telescopes.
They will also use the data to refine theoretical models for how dust forms
around these stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
