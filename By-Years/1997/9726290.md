9726290 Abstract Funds are solicited to help sponsor a seventh scientific
meeting on plant-herbivore interactions as a Gordon Conference on 22-27 February
in Ventura California. The six previous meetings on such interactions have
proven highly productive and made substantial contributions to progress in
ecology. This session would lead to continued progress in the field particularly
in the areas of biochemical and morphological plant defenses, multi-trophic
interactions, assessing the costs of anti-herbivore defenses, the evolution and
coevolution of plan-herbivore interactions. Solicited funds would partially
support the participation of 26 speakers and 8 graduate students and post-docs
at the conference.
