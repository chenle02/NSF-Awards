Daytona Beach Community College (DBCC), utilizing computer and engineering
technology faculty and consultants, proposes to create a new instructional
environment for introductory classes in electronics, computer aided design,
civil engineering and computer programming. This new environment addresses the
various learning modalities, diverse schedules and lifestyles of the non-
traditional students found in ever increasing numbers at institutions nation
wide. The virtual classroom will permit students to access their computer
technology and electronics courses at any time and from any place through the
resources and capabilities of the internet and the World Wide Web. The specific
objectives of this project are to: 1) Develop and implement a Virtual Classroom
Environment which allows time/place in dependent access to course materials and
teaching/learning interchange for students and faculty; 2) Develop and implement
the appropriate interactive curriculum for the virtual classroom to ensure not
only the success of students in their field, but to continually enhance the
learning process as a by-product of this environment; and 3) To provide in-
service training for participating secondary school teachers through Tech-Prep
and School-to-Work programs on the use and development of interactive computer
aided instruction. The significance of this project is that it will demonstrate
how the virtual classroom environment can be developed and utilized to train
postsecondary students in various disciplines; produce course database on CD-ROM
or disk media, and have national and international impact though the Internet
and the World Wide Web.
