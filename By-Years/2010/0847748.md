This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports an
experimental research program to develop new techniques for high-precision
measurements on cold trapped molecular ions. Sympathetic cooling of charged
molecules to sub-Kelvin temperatures has recently been demonstrated, opening the
way for orders of magnitude improvement in the accuracy available to molecular
spectroscopy. However, the fledgling field of cold molecular-ion spectroscopy
still awaits several technical developments, including preparation of trapped
molecules in well-defined excited internal states and development of Doppler-
free techniques commonly used for trapped atoms but not yet for molecules. These
techniques will be developed and used to watch for gradual changes of molecular
energy levels over the course of several years, thereby searching for time-
variation of the electron-proton mass ratio. Surprisingly, this "constant" of
nature is predicted to vary in time by many theories attempting to combine
quantum mechanics with gravity, and discovery of such a time-variation would
revolutionize our understanding of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this work result from leveraging both the laboratory research
and local resources for effective education and outreach. An interactive Grades
4-6 Science Saturdays program will be developed in cooperation with the
principal of Tarkington School of Excellence, the first Green-certified school
in Illinois, located in the predominately Latino Marquette Park neighborhood of
Chicago. The program will focus on the science of energy, using Materials World
Modules developed at Northwestern University, resources from ANSER (Argonne
Northwestern Solar Energy Research), and concepts from the experimental research
program supported by this award.
