Harris The focus of this research is on the design of very large scale
integrated circuit structures that can implement the Ziganirov-Jelenek stack
algorithm for sequential decoding of long constraint length codes. Chips are
being fabricated using mask making and foundry facilities available through the
USC/ISI Mosis Program. This research is also focused on the impact of stack
design and algorithm performance of factors like the word length of the decoding
metric, the length of the stack, and the constraint length. These results can
improve our understanding of the design of high speed sequential decoders. It
will result in devices that can test decoding concepts, and can extend the range
of application of an important technique for achieving reliable communication
and high density data storage.
