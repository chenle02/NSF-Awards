Dr. John H. Frederick and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Nevada at Reno are being supported for a new Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, twelve
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects span the areas of inorganic, organic,
physical, and theoretical chemistry. Building on two years as a self-funded
undergraduate research program, the REU site will feature a nation-wide
recruiting effort particularly targeting talented students from small colleges
with no research opportunities.
