The Department of Biology is implementing a revised curriculum that emphasizes
the process of science through investigative laboratories. Students begin their
study of biology with courses in Structure and Function of Organisms and
Evolution and Ecology in the first year. In the second year, students take
courses in Molecular Genetics and The Biology of Cells. The latter course, which
will emphasize the roles of proteins in cells, is one of the primary targets of
curricular improvements. A modern course in cell biology is being taught by
emphasizing how cells are studied. Students who have learned many applications
of techniques in molecular genetics to study cells from their prior coursework
can now attend a new section on antibodies as tools in cell biology in the new
course. For this project, a cryostat prepares frozen sections quickly and easily
and preserves the antigenicity of proteins from various specimens. These frozen
sections are then stained with commercially available antibodies with a greater
likelihood of success than the old method of using paraffin-embedded material.
Use of antibodies as tools to study protein distribution is also a major part of
the laboratories in an upper-level course in developmental biology, a summer
program for minority high school students, and research projects in both the
biology and psychology departments. In addition the use of this modern
instrumentation, communication of results to other students will be emphasized.
For this emphasis and for improvment of students' training in light microscopy,
a research-quality teaching microscope equipped for fluorescence microscopy,
photomicroscopy, and video imaging is also being purchased. This microscope
makes it possible for groups of students to view their results together instead
of in isolation. This new microscope also allows students to have a permanent
record of their results for later analysis.
