The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to advance a technology that enables
the robotic manipulation of small, delicate, and curved objects. Handling such
objects, which are frequently encountered in precision devices and advanced
electronics, in automatic assembly and packaging processes is challenging with
technologies that exist today. This PFI-RP project will develop miniaturized
adhesion-based grippers to address this pain point. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project aims to develop miniaturized soft grippers with dynamically
tunable adhesion for robotic manipulation of small, delicate, and curved
objects. These soft grippers contain an active material with a stiffness that
can be changed through an electrical signal to match the application. The
grippers are designed such that the stiffness change leads to a change in
adhesion at the contact surface. This adhesion tunability will be exploited for
controllably gripping small and delicate objects. Through mechanics and thermal
modeling, the soft grippers will be designed with appropriate geometry and
dimensions for optimal performance on multiple metrics including response time,
activation voltage, object size and weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
