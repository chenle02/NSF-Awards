Software testing techniques are fundamental to the development of dependable
software. Computer scientists studying testing techniques must be able to
evaluate and compare them empirically, and this requires access to a wide range
of infrastructure support including programs, program versions, test suites, and
fault data. &lt;br/&gt;This project provides that support, focusing on test
generation and on software domains that are increasingly important: concurrent
and distributed systems, software product lines, and web services. The PIs are
collecting and constructing systems, specifications, version attributes, test
attributes and fault attributes relevant to these domains, and organizing them
in formats that allow computer scientists to utilize them efficiently in
controlled experiments. &lt;br/&gt;Th PIs are embedding these artifacts in the
existing Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository (SIR), a repository
established under prior NSF support to facilitate experimentation with
deterministic C and Java systems. They are also enhancing SIR's support for
community contributions, by providing moderated write access to the repository;
this will be expanded in the latter years of the project, following the spirit
of open-source models for system management. The infrastructure being assembled
enables several &lt;br/&gt;specific research and educational projects related to
software testing, by the project researchers themselves and by the software
engineering research community as a whole.
