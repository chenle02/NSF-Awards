Abstract Cooper 9618700 This award supports the US contribution to the Antarctic
Seismic Data Library System for Cooperative Research (SDLS), an international
agency under the auspices of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR) and under mandates of the Antarctic Treaty (ATCM Recommendation XVI-16),
that is responsible for providing open access worldwide to Antarctic
multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) data, including the more than 135,000 km
of data collected to date by more than 11 countries, including the U.S. The SDLS
was designed by consensus of Antarctic MCS data collectors in April 1991, and
was adopted by the Antarctic Treaty in October 1991. The SDLS serves the
international community, and now has 12 library branches in 11 countries. MCS
data are kept at library branches on CD-ROMs, and each branch, overseen by a
senior Antarctic researcher, now has 27 CD-ROMs with over 60,000 km of MCS data.
Processed data must be submitted to the SDLS within 4 years of the time of data
collection, to be kept in the SDLS until 8 years from time of collection, after
which data will be sent to World Data Centers (i.e. National Geophysical Data
Center (NGDC)). Since inception of the SDLS, the US Geological Survey (USGS)
worked with SCAR to manage the SDLS, and until 1994 provided start-up funding to
produce CD-ROMs and establish two U.S. library branches. In 1994, SCAR
recommended that funding for SDLS should come from Managers of National
Antarctic Programs, to assure that data collected by their country were entered
into SDLS in accord with Treaty mandates. The U.S. Polar Research Board
recommended that funds to support U.S. participation in SDLS (e.g. 2 current
U.S. library branches, data submittal, CD- ROM costs, etc.) be provided by NSF-
OPP. In 1994, USGS and Italy's Osservatorio Geofisico Sperimentale (OGS) agreed,
pending funding from U.S. and Italian National Antarctic Programs, to jointly
operate SDLS through the year 2000. Under thi s agreement, Italy would produce
CD-ROMs and USGS would provide general oversight and data distribution to SDLS
branches. Individual countries would support their own SDLS branches. This
Interagency Agreement provides a mechanism to support U.S. oversight and
participation in SDLS, with funding from the U.S. Antarctic Program to USGS, who
will provide general oversight for SDLS and will implement U.S. participation in
accord with ATCM Recommendation XVI-12 and science recommendations of SCAR.
