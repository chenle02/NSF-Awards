The disproportionate abundance of species in mountains is a striking and
mysterious pattern in global biodiversity. This project will unravel the
evolutionary history of one of the largest genera of flowering plants, the
louseworts, whose 770 species are found in mountain ranges across the Northern
Hemisphere, but are especially rich in the Hengduan Mountains of China, the
Altai-Tienshan of Russia, and the Himalayas. Phylogenetic relationships of a
global sample of species will be reconstructed using DNA sequences. This "family
tree" will then be used as an historical framework to test hypotheses about
evolution and biogeography using additional data. For example, louseworts
exhibit spectacular diversity in their flowers, but are pollinated only by
bumblebees. Does competition between co-occurring louseworts for pollinator
services cause evolutionary divergence in flower form and accelerate the
splitting of ancestral species into distinct descendants? Other questions
pertain to geographic origins, such as: is the Hengduan region an evolutionary
"cradle" that favors new species formation, or is it a "museum" that harbors
immigrants from other regions? Finally, the phylogenetic tree will be used to
construct a natural classification for the lousewort genus, with taxonomic names
reflecting lineages with common ancestry.

This project will reconstruct a large, conspicuous, and enigmatic branch of
flowering plants on the tree of life, and reveal historical patterns and
evolutionary processes that have shaped the diversity and distributions of plant
species across the Northern Hemisphere since the Miocene. Understanding these
evolutionary dynamics is critical to conservation planning, e.g., to put future
climate change in an historical context. The mountains where louseworts occur
are particularly vulnerable to climate change, raising the imperative to
document these species and their evolutionary heritage. The research will also
shed light on the evolution of floral form and function, and its contribution to
the tempo and mode by which plant species coexist and proliferate.
