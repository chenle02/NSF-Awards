In this joint proposal between New Mexico State University (Dr. James Ni) and
the University of Arizona (Dr. Terry Wallace) we request funds for a detailed
seismotectonic study of theregions around the Burma Syntaxis and intraplate
mountain belts in eastern Asia. It is in pursuit of the principles governing
continental defrmation that this study is aimed. We are particularly interested
in finding out the extent of strain occuring at various crustal levels in the
compressed continental crust.
