Dr. Morse will continue studies on the consequences of differential foraging
success within a population, using the crab spider Misumena vatia, a common
predator on common milkweed Asclepias syriaca. The tendencies of offspring from
differentially successful foraging mothers to disperse from their natal site
will be measured. Misumena is ideal for this purpose because it lays only one
clutch of eggs, and foraging success can be readily quantified in terms of
clutch size. This research will a) evaluate the roles of natal clutch size and
microhabitat on the offsprings' dispersal away from the nest, and b) the
importance of parents' choice of nesting substrates on juvenile dispersal. This
work is of fundamental importance because it will help to determine the
relationship between foraging patterns and fitness and facilitate integration of
foraging and life-history theory. These are two of the major research areas in
ecology and population biology today. In practical terms it will identify
critical and non-critical periods in life cycles and provide insight into where
windows of vulnerability exist. This knowledge will have general applicability
to other systems, such as those involving agricultural pests.
