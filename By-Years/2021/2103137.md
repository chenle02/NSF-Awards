Funding is provided to continue operations and maintenance of the Monterey
Accelerated Research System (MARS). The MARS cabled observatory provides a deep-
water facility for testing and development and is a compelling solution for many
ocean science experiments. MBARI has integrated the MARS Observatory into the
Monterey Bay Aquarium 'Discovering Monterey Canyon' auditorium program as well
as in the new MBARI exhibit. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has over one million
visitors a year, thereby providing wide exposure for MARS and OOI to the public.
The EARTH Project, a science teacher outreach effort, has used MARS as a tool at
over 20 presentations to high school educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) installed a cabled test bed and
has been operating the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) since MARS
became operational November 10, 2008. The purpose of this proposal is to provide
continued funding for operations and maintenance costs of
MARS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
