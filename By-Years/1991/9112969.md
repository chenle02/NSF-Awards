The main goal of this project is to study how students learn abstract
mathematics. The specific situation to be studied is how students increase their
level of sophistication in mathematics so that they can understand abstract
algebra at the undergraduate level. In addition, since abstract algebra is a
basic course for teachers, it has influence on the education of teachers and how
they learn, and whence, how they teach mathematics in the schools. The design of
the research study will include the study of "traditional" approach to teaching
this course and a pedagogical approach that involves the use of computers to
initially construct the abstract objects that occur in an abstract algebra
course combined with a cooperative learning environment. This study will be
carried out at a number of universities and by several faculty members at those
universities. There will be a faculty workshop and minicourses given at
professional meetings to disseminate the findings of this research and the
techniques developed to help in learning abstract concepts.
