This award is for travel funds to support technical coordination by various
collaborators with the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical team.

The proposed work will make available on Blue Waters computational tools and
environments for social and biological research involving interacting automata
at nodes of very large social contact network or interaction graphs. Such
research includes the evaluation of mitigation strategies for contagion on
realistic national- and global-scale social contact networks, worm propagation
on the Internet, percolation processes, viral marketing, database replication
(in particular for sensor networks), and social phenomenon such as the
propagation of fads and norms.

The results of research with the tools to be deployed may help provide better
understanding of how different strategies for dealing with emerging infectious
diseases can influence the course and impact of pandemics. The principal
investigators are new NSF investigators.
