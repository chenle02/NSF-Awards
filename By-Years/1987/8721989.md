The 1970s saw the first sustained and systematic studies of engineering ethics
in the U.S. These studies have been successful in identifying problems and
raising consciousness about the need for ethical deliberation and education
among technical professionals. There is at least one aspect which has been
neglected, however: investigation of parallel or related work in other
countries. This project will break new ground by systematically inventorying and
analyzing engineering ethics in other countries. The result will be an
"Introduction to Engineering Ethics in Countries Other than the United States:
An Analysis with Annotated Catalog and Bibliography." This scholarly survey will
include a collection of engineering ethics codes or related documents, an
overview and critical assessment of related discussions, comparisons with
engineering ethics in the U.S., a list of relevant professional organizations
and institutions, and an annotated bibliography of publications. Unlike all
previous engineering ethics studies in English, it will emphasize foreign
language works (but will provide English annotations). Two issues likely to be
put forth for greater consideration by the technical and scholarly communities
in North America are those related to the possibilities of a socialist-
communitarian and a religious engineering ethics, in contrast to the
predominantly individualist and secular versions of engineering ethics which
currently prevail in the U.S. This project will make a unique contribution to
broadening our scholarly understanding of different cultural approaches to
engineering ethics. The resulting document will be a resource for scholars and
for classroom teaching. The principal investigator is exceedingly well qualified
to undertake the effort; he has a proven track record and language skills and
connections overseas. His institutional base is very good. The research design
is appropriate and feasible; costs, including funds for necessary translation,
are very reasonable. Results are likely to be widely distributed and useful.
Support in the amount of $43,463 is recommended.
