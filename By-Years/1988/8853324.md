A Fourier Transform NMR instrument is providing student access to a central
instrument for chemistry analysis and providing hitherto unavailable laboratory
experience with topics now covered in the curriculum including the important
techniques of Carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy and Fourier Transform methods. The
instrument is also supporting a new Biochemistry Program which is being
developed. The instrument purchased is flexible enough to be used with the lower
division curriculum, but with specifications which permit it to meet the demands
of advanced courses in physical, analytical, organic, and biochemistry. The
instrument is also being used to support senior research projects. The grantee
is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
