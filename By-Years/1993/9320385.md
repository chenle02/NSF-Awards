The goal of this work is to develop an accurate numerical method which employs
symbolic computation for solving linear and nonlinear multivariable integral and
integro-differential equations of mathematical physics. When possible, a
posteriori (and a priori) error estimates are sought to evaluate the
effectiveness and accuracy of the projection methods used for obtaining the
numeric solution. Projection methods such as collocation using different sets of
basis functions on either a global or local basis are developed to obtain
accurate and results. Symbolic computation permits previously insurmountable
analytic manipulations to be performed for purposes of (1) developing expansion
based solution methods, and (2) establishing error estimates and convergence
rates. The major contribution of the investigation are twofold; (1) to exploit
the development of symbolic manipulation for augmenting analytic, numeric, and
graphic computation in support of solving and analyzing nonlinear integral and
integro-differential equations of mathematical physics, and (2) to investigate,
extend, and develop the recent formulation of Kumar and Sloan for scientific
computation of multivariable equations.
