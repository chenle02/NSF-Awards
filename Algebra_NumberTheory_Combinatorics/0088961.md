This award will support the investigator's ongoing research in the field of
number theory. For example, the investigator will continue his study of the
interplay between the theory of modular forms and partition theory. He will also
study the "Gaussian hypergeometric series'' and their relationships to elliptic
curves, modular forms, p-adic analysis, arithmetic geometry, and combinatorics.
In addition, the award will enable the investigator to expand his efforts in
undergraduate education and research.

Number Theory is a very old branch of mathematics which has its roots in the
study of the whole numbers. In modern times it has become an important tool in
many applied endeavors. For example, cryptosystems which enable secure
transmission of data over the internet are based on Number Theory, as are error
correcting codes for reliable data transmission.
