This project will prepare and deliver to the NSWP a value added data set
providing a summary characterization of the energetic particle environment at
geostationary orbit obtained from data from 1989 to the present. A statistical
data set containing 1-day and 1-year averages which covers the entire 1989 -
present interval from 4 geostationary space craft will be prepared. Included
will be the mean flux values, the mode, maximum, minimum and standard deviation
of the fluxes (or fluences) over specific energy ranges and integration time
constants. In addition, spin averaged, 3- minute time resolution data for the
years 1990 - 1993 (near solar maximum and on the declining phase of the solar
cycle) will be provided from three instruments from one geostationary craft.
Relevant ancillary data such as solar wind data, geomagnetic data, etc. will be
appended to the data sets.
