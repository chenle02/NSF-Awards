The goal of this project is to enable natural science students in a new
introductory course in cell biology and genetics to reproduce experimental
approaches used by researcher scientist in these disciplines. The acquisition of
a high speed centrifuge and digital spectrometers allows students to become more
involved in sample preparation, and data acquisition and analysis.
