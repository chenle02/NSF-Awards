The unmatched advancement in electronics and computer technology has made a huge
impact on the machine tool industry in the last few years. In order to be
prepared for future challenges in modern manufacturing, it is imperative that
students in mechanical engineering and technology have direct experience with
Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machining. The recent acquisition of CNC
equipment (which supplements existing CAD/CAM capabilities) allows students
access to a wider range of modern manufacturing laboratory activities through
experiences with all phases of CAD/CAM design, from concept to final product.
The number of students involved is substantially increased due to the capability
of the CNC equipment to perform machining on one project while simultaneously
being programmed for the next.
