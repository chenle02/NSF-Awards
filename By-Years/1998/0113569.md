Techniques such as program generation, partial evaluation, just-in-time
compilation, and run-time code generation respond to the need for general
purpose programs which do not pay unnecessary&lt;br/&gt;run-time overheads. The
thesis of this project is that a uniform, principled, high-level, and practical
view of these diverse techniques is possible through multi-stage programming, a
novel paradigm for the development of maintainable, high-performance software.
The key idea in multi-stage programming is the use of simple, high-level
annotations to allow the programmer to break down the cost of a computation into
distinct stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to
demonstrate that the theoretical machinery that has been developed for multi-
stage programming can be put to work. This project will involve the development
of compilers&lt;br/&gt;of multi-stage programming languages, addressing both
practical and theoretical problems that arise in the development of such
systems, and using these compilers in interesting applications ranging from
dynamic programming algorithms and rewriting systems to implementations of
domain specific programming languages.
