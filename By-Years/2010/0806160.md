Professor John Simons of the University of Utah is supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program to study the molecular mechanism for electron
capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass
spectrometry using theoretical methods. These studies seek better understanding
and predictive capability for these relatively new and important approaches to
mass spectrometric characterization of biomolecules. They are expected to have
important impact in the fields like proteomics, where they may eventually
provide means to better control and application of mass spectrometric
characterization of the structure of peptides and
proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through collaborations with experimental groups,
Prof. Simons' work provides valuable training in both theoretical and analytical
methodology to a diverse group of graduate students and postdocs. More broadly,
he has been active in providing training opportunities to a wide audience
through Internet-based materials and the establishment of summer schools aimed
at enhancing the teaching of theoretical physical chemistry.
