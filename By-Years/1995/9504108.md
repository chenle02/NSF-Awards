9504108 Sagues This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research collaboration
between Prof. Alberto Sagues of the University of South Florida (USF), and Prof.
Pedro Castro Borges of the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados
(CINVESTAV) in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, to work on corrosion problems of
reinforcing steel in concrete. More specifically, the researchers intend to
determine the causes and mechanism of carbonation of reinforced concrete
structures, study the combined effects of carbonation and chloride ion
contamination on corrosion of reinforcing steel, and investigate the mechanism
of diffusion of chloride ions through concrete. The methodology will include a
literature review update, concrete core sampling of structures on both sides of
the Gulf of Mexico, examination of those cores to quantitatively determine rates
of chloride ingress, and examination of field test specimens already in place.
The work will benefit from existing related research programs on carbonation of
concrete and lifetime prediction of concrete structures at USF, and
investigations on corrosion of steel in concrete at CINVESTAV. This award is
partly supported by the Division of Civil and Mechanical Structures of NSF. ***
