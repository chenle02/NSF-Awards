This award provides renewed support for the Committee on Earthquake Engineering
which was established in 1983 as a standing committee within the Commission on
Engineering and Technical Systems, National Research Council. The committee has
completed two projects: a study on seismic effects on large underground
structures, and a conference on strategic planning to reduce the potential
economic impacts of earthquake hazards throughout the world. Another study of
the committee, Estimating Losses from Future Earthquakes (issued January 1989),
was a project requested and separately funded by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). In 1989, the committee will complete its study on
earthquake engineering for concrete dams, an evaluation of seismic policy
adoption and implementation, and begin a study panel on National Earthquake
Engineering Experimental Facilities. Further, with separate funding, the
committee will soon begin studies on the following: an evaluation of base
isolation techniques for seismic design of structures, a workshop on earthquake
economic issues, and an assessment of federal earthquake engineering activities.
