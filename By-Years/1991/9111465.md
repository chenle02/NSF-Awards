Dr. Rosenberg is continuing his exploration of the causes of neoclassical
economics' predictive weakness and is examining the cognitive status of the
discipline's theories in the light of this explanation of their weakness. The
source of this weakness, Dr. Rosenberg argues, is in the intentional
psychological theory which economists at the same time implicitly presume and
explicitly rejects as irrelevant to their aims and methods. In this continuing
research, he is examining more thoroughly two sets of issues hitherto unexamined
by philosophers of economics: the role of innovations in undermining prediction,
and the nature of information as an economic variable.
