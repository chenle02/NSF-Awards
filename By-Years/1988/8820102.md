The proposed research of this proposal assumes that a major factor in the
regulation of gene expression is the population and concentration of trans
acting protein factors, and that developmental regulation is largely a function
of the regulation of trans factor gene expression and/or trans factor covalent
modification. For this reason Dr. Dure wishes to study the regulation of
expression of a developmental trans factor gene from a higher plant, cotton.
Specifically he wishes to: 1) purify a trans factor for a developmentally
regulated set of genes, 2) via the trans factor cDNA, isolate and sequence the
trans factor gene, 3) examine the structure of the trans factor protein and
identify its DNA binding domain and gene activation domain, 4) describe the
temporal period of expression of the trans factor gene in ontogeny by measuring
mRNA and protein levels of the trans factor and comparing them to the temporal
period of expression of the genes it activates, 5) should these temporal periods
not coincide, examine the possible regulation of trans factor activity by
covalent modification. Ultimately Dr. Dure wishes to express the storage protein
gene(s)in nuclei isolated from non-expressing tissue (leaves) by interaction
with the trans factor and other nuclear factors. %%% Dr. Dure is interested in
the factors which regulate gene expression of cotton seed storage proteins. He
is using this as a model system for studying the tissue and time specific gene
expression during development.
