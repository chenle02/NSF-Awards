This project will examine the physiology of the maternal-fetal relationship in
developing embryos. The elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) are used since
they represent a relatively simple system compared to the more complex mammals
and humans. The mother, to varying degrees, provides oxygen and nutrients as
well as for the removal of wastes for embryos developing in the uterus. This
study will promote a better understanding of the movements of oxygen and carbon
dioxide between the mother and embryo, and the mechanisms by which these gases
move across tissues in general. Nitrogenous wastes accumulate in the fluids
bathing the embryo, and must be eliminated. The manner by which waste products
such as ammonia and urea are detoxified and transported will be better
understood. Lastly, salts are also regulated by the mother, until the embryo may
regulate for itself. The role of the various organs involved in the regulation
of salt (kidney, gills and rectal gland) will be described as well as the
mechanisms by which salt is transported across tissues. The information gained
in this study will be used to provide a model to describe the physiology of the
maternal-fetal relationship.
