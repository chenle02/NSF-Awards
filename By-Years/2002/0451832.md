A grant has been awarded to the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) to continue
a herpetological survey of Myanmar. A previous NSF grant resulted in a detailed
survey of the interior lowland herpetofauna, a preliminary reconnaissance of the
bordering highlands, and training a team of Forestry personnel in scientific
surveying methods. What remains is to survey the virtually unexplored
mountainous regions along Myanmar's borders with Bangladesh, India, China and
Thailand. Some of these areas are conservation priorities and contain two of
Conservation International's biodiversity hotspots and eight of World Wildlife
Federation's Global 200 ecoregions. Given the unique ecosystems of these areas,
and the increasing loss of habitat, it is critical to conduct surveys at this
time. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed completion of a countrywide herpetological survey
will yield the first assessment of Myanmar's herpetofauna of incomparable depth.
The initial survey has increased the known amphibian and reptile diversity by
21% (16 species previously not known to occur in Myanmar and an estimated 56
undescribed species). Specimens and tissue samples, essential for biological
studies of the Asian herpetofauna, will be available to the scientific
community. Through these surveys, publications, training of US and Myanmar
students and Myanmar Forest Department staff, the knowledge and awareness of
Myanmar's herpetofauna are expanding, thereby allowing the Myanmar Forest
Department to make more informed management and conservation decisions. The
American and Myanmar public will be informed about Myanmar's biodiversity and
its importance through museum exhibits at both the Academy, the Myanmar Forest
Department Museum and the Myanmar Biodiversity Museum through the production of
posters and other educational materials. With the assistance of CAS's Education
Division, the Myanmar website with Myanmar survey-related topics that will be of
interest to younger audiences will be expanded.&lt;br/&gt;
