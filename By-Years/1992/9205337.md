The objective of this project is to measure several important products of
atmospheric photolysis including the hydroxyl radical, and gas phase sulfuric
and methanesulfonic acids using a mass spectrometric technique. In addition ,
the instrument used to perform these measurements will be modified to make
possible shipboard and aircraft studies. A recent informal intercomparison
between the mass spectrometric measurement technique and a NOAA long path laser
absorption technique resulted in similar concentrations of OH being measured by
both instruments. The measured hydroxyl radical concentrations were however,
consistently well below model predictions. In order to investigate these
discrepancies these scientists will participate in an additional hydroxyl
radical intercompaion and photochemistry experiment in Colorado during the
summer of 1993. A second study to isolate possible effects of vegetation and
other near-ground loss mechanisms on hydroxyl radical concentration will also be
undertaken. Modifications to the present system would also be undertaken to make
possible measurements on a mobile platform for future studies.
