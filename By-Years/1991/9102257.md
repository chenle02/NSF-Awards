Dr. Walter Pollard has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Pollard's doctoral degree was from the University of California
at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Richard Mathies. Dr. Pollard
intends to continue research at Columbia University under the sponsorship of
Professor Richard Friesner. Dr. Pollard's postdoctoral training will be the
analytical development and numerical implementation of new aqpproaches to the
quantum-mechanical and mixed quantum/classical dynamics of large systems. Longer
term, he plans theoretical studies of the reaction dynamics of excited state
intramolecular proton transfer in hydrogen-bonding solvents %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
