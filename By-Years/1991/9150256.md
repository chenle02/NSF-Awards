This is a proposal for "Inservice Teacher Training in Environmental Education."
The primary goals of this 12-month project are (1) to equip 600, mostly under-
represented, K-12 educators to teach environmental education (EE) in all areas
of the school curriculum, and (b) to increase to 25 the number of teachers
enrolled in the College of Natural Resources extended Master's degree in EE, and
make it available to teachers across the state of Wisconsin. The unique model of
in-service teacher training developed in this project will be implemented as a
pilot program. The courses will be instructed statewide by EE educators who
include teachers, district coordinators, and state education specialists. This
one-year project starts August 1, 1991, and provides cost sharing of 23% of the
amount requested from NSF.
