This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University to acquire a 400 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas such as the following: (1) small molecule-DNA interactions,
bioorganic chemistry, (2) the oxidative polymerization of pyrroles and
thiophenes, (3) preparation of new compounds capable of interaction with the
enzyme nitric oxide synthase, (4) analysis of the chemistry of reactive
intermediates, and (5) transition-mediated organic chemistry. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
