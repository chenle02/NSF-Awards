The principal investigator plans to extend his recent results on the existence
of nonsingular globally defined solutions of the Einstein/Yang-Mills field
equations and to attempt to find asymptotically flat "black-hole" solutions
whose existence would refute the so-called hair trigger conjecture. These
problems impact upon both gravitational physics and relativity theory and have
the potential of determining the role of geometry when gravity is modeled by
Einstein's theory of relativity.
