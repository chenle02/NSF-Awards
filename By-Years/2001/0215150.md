&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project proposes to develop grafted tomato transplants for greenhouse and field
applications in the USA. Genetic-based sources of resistance to soil-borne
pathogens and pests are currently being used as the rootstocks for grafted
tomatoes in Southern Europe, Asia and Australia. In these countries, vegetable
production is being impacted by the elimination of methyl bromide. Biological
control strategies, such as grafting, will have increasing value in the USA as
disease profiles and chemical pesticide regulations change. This research will
demonstrate the production of high quality greenhouse bench grafts using
rootstocks with disease resistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
applications of this project are in the field of agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;
