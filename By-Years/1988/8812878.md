Icelandic fisheries and towns are industrializing. This has affected the work
process, family relations, and the roles of men and women differentially. During
this project the researcher will look at changes in two villages in Iceland, one
of which has been dominated and closely controlled by a merchant elite and the
other which has been controlled by a worker's cooperative. She will see if these
different social and economic organizations affect how men and women respond to
the tensions created within families by changes in the fishing industry. This
study will increase our understanding of gender and family relations during
periods of technological and industrial development and will help define the
effect of different economic organizations on this process.
