The utilization of phase shift between sensed output voltages from an
approximately configured coil with a high permeability core is considered as the
sensing element for a specific type of magnetometer. Specifications are in terms
of low cost, low power consumption, light weight and small size, and sensitivity
to low levels magnetic fields of .01 NT or less. The envisioned magnetometer
would be utilized as a research tool in various disciplines as well as having
commercial applications in navigational devices.
