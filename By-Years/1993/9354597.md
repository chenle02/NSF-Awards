9354597 Sitaraman Demand for trained software professionals continues to be on
the rise. Introductory undergraduate courses in computer science do not provide
an appropriate context for motivating the importance of good design, precise and
abstract specification, and efficient and correct implementations in software
construction. These and other key component and software engineering principles
are therefore introduced only much later in the curriculum as "add on" ideas,
rather than as central themes in problem solving. The relatively late exposure
leaves computer science students with little time to master key concepts. Non-
computer science majors are left in total darkness with respect to software
engineering issues and principles. Using software reuse as a motivating context
(but not as the dominant theme), we propose to introduce software engineering
principles in introductory computer science courses while retaining the problem-
solving techniques traditionally taught in these courses. Specification-based
reuse readily motivates the need for traditional principles such as abstraction
and new principles such as software design. Having seen and used software built
the "right" way early, the students master the ideas by applying them in
projects in the rest of the curriculum. A major objective of the project is to
evaluate the long-term influences of this proposal in multiple programming
paradigms in multiple institutions. ***y
