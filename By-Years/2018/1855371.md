Symmetry is a pervasive concept in mathematics, giving rise to beautiful and
interesting geometric objects, as well as providing an essential tool in
geometry and topology. Classically, research has focused on globally defined
symmetries, but recently it has been realized that symmetries of local
structures offer vastly more examples and connections to other areas of
mathematics. This project will study local symmetry, its applications to the
study of self-similar geometric objects and related algebraic problems, and
recently discovered geometric constructions of efficient networks (so-called
expander graphs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between the geometry of
an object and the algebraic structure of its group of automorphisms has been
intensely studied in the past, but in the last decade, progress has been made on
a much richer theory of symmetries that only appear after passing to a cover,
i.e. are "hidden'" The project aims to study this notion in several contexts,
such as Riemannian geometry (especially nonpositive curvature) and geometric
structures. Further, rich phenomena are expected when the symmetry arises from
self-similarity, i.e. in the case of self-covering manifolds, particularly in
situations of geometric interest such as Kaehler or affine geometry. Finally,
the project aims to study coarse geometric objects associated to group actions
(so-called warped cones), especially in the case of actions with spectral gap,
where these yield expander graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
