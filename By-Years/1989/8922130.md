Description: This project supports a dissertation research by Mrs. W. M.
Tahseen of the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR),
Karachi, who is currently completing her doctoral work at the University of
Illinois, Urbana, in collaboration with Dr. Larry Hansen, and Dr. David
Schaeffer of that Univeristy. The research includes sampling of sites near
chemical plants for pollutants in water, soil, plant and/or animal after
establishing acute bioassay capability for the in-country field work, subjecting
the obtained samples to organochlorine and elemental analysis and additional
bioassays, carrying out of statistical analyses of the data, and developing site
contamination maps displaying multiple toxic endpoint contours. Scope: The
project involves two experienced U.S. toxocologist with a young Pakistani
researcher with the backing of the main industrial research organization in
Pakistan. The problem to be dealt with is critical in Pakistan and other growing
Third World Countries and is also important to the U.S. This project meets the
Science in Developing Countries' criteria for the dissertaion improvement by
allowing the Pakistani graduate student to do field work in that country.
