This dissertation research project involves the research of an anthropology
student from the University of California-Davis. The project involves studying
the dispersal of individuals and families from a location in 18th and early 19th
century Massachusetts. The student will trace individuals who migrated and those
who did not, and test theories derived from evolutionary ecology. The data will
be used to develop a model of dispersal measuring costs and benefits under a
range of constraints. Specific hypotheses to be tested are that males will
migrate less than females, but when they do leave they travel further than
females; that dispersal is a higher risk strategy than not migrating, therefore
the variance in reproductive and economic success will be greater for dispersers
than non-dispersers; and that birth order effects will correlate with specific
inheritance patterns. This research is important because migration is an
enduring pattern of human life. Advances in our understanding of the causes and
effects of human dispersal from this one particular site will help us understand
the general consequences of displacement for persons and populations.
