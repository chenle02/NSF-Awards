This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 02-148. This one-year project
will explore the novel use of circularly polarized laser light to deliver torque
from photon angular momentum to the rotational motion of a molecular
chromophore. The net effect of this transfer is to extract electromagnetic
energy from the laser light, effctively converting it into mechanical energy
manifested as unidirectional rotary motion of a motor on the nanometer scale of
a single molecule. This exploratory research is a step in the direction towards
the actual production of true nanoscale devices. The project provides excellent
graduate student training in spectroscopy, optics, molecular dynamics, and mass
spectrometry as applied to powering molecular scale devices. The project is
jointly supported by the Divisions of Physics, Chemistry, and Materials
Research.
