The parallel processing facility allows students in Mathematics, Computer
Science, Physics and Astronomy the opportunity to study parallel processing and
to apply this method for solving problems. Students in twelve courses have
hands-on experience in dealing with the theory and application of parallel
processing, and in facing problems posed by its implementation. The facility is
the focus for an on-campus 'users group' of faculty and students with expertise
in parallel processing. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an
equal match for the NSF award.
