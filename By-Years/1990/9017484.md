This project will continue the operation of the Fabry-Perot interferometer that
was installed at South Pole Station in early 1989. The instrument measures the
temperature of the atmosphere and the winds in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere (MALT) region of the upper atmosphere. The instrument will be
operated in conjunction with the existing collection of aeronomy instruments at
South Pole, as well as with the coherent scatter radar at Halley Bay Station
which is jointly funded by NSF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). Together
they will give a more complete picture of high altitude atmospheric dynamics at
high latitude, and provide important information for the verification and
subsequent modification of the thermospheric global circulation model that has
been developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This project is
an important component of the Coupling, Energetic and Dynamics through
Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) initiative. This project is jointly funded by the
Division of Polar Programs' Polar Aeronomy and Astrophysics and the Division of
Atmospheric Sciences' Aeronomy programs.
