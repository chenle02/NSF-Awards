GER-9553333 Metcalf We propose to increase the number of optical sciences
students in Stony Brook's highly ranked PhD program. The six specialization
areas are quantum optics, photonics and materials, non-linear optics, X- ray
optics, atomic chaology, and laser cooling. The program features rotation
throughout these groups to familiarize students with the field, our diverse and
highly educational seminars, close laboratory interaction with undergraduates
and high school students, association with post- docs and instrumentation
students, and other special opportunities. We maintain active connection with
optical scientists at Brookhaven, Grumman Corp., Adelphi University, various
campus departments, and other government, industrial, and academic institutions.
We have long experience with recruitment and retention of women and minority
students in our programs. Two optical science faculty are native speakers of
Spanish, and may serve as role models for Hispanics. Two others are among only
three department winners of a campus-wide teaching excellence award. Our own
graduate students have won a disproportionate share of departmental excellence
awards. Optical science offers so many challenges, and has such an important
future in American technology, that the department recently expanded its faculty
by four. Coupled with the plethora of new problems, there is ample capability to
accommodate a five student increase.
