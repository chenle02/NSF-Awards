My main goal in this project is to use the homotopy theory of pro-spaces to
prove non-existence theorems for sums-of-squares formulas over arbitrary fields.
This is a question of primary interest in the study of quadratic forms, but it
is also closely linked to a variety of other fields of mathematics, including
the existence of finite-dimensional division algebras, counting independent
vector fields on spheres, and immersions of projective spaces into euclidean
spaces. There is a long history of applying cohomological methods to sums-of-
squares formulas over the real numbers. My goal is to adapt these methods so
that they work for other fields. This involves the use of generalized etale
cohomology theories (such as but not limited to etale K-theory) of algebraic
varieties instead of generalized cohomology of topological spaces. The correct
definition of generalized etale cohomology involves some subtle aspects of the
homotopy theory of pro-spaces. Motivic homotopy theory is another useful tool in
studying sums-of-squares formulas and more generally quadratic forms. I intend
to work on specific problems that further elucidate the relationship between
motivic homotopy theory and the theory of quadratic forms.

Cohomology was a key unifying concept in the study of topology throughout the
twentieth century. The basic principle of cohomology is to turn a difficult
problem in topology into a computable algebra problem. Many of these
cohomological methods work also in algebraic geometry (i.e., the study of
geometric objects that are defined by polynomial equations), but the technical
details tend to be much more complicated. Traditional cohomology can be used to
prove theorems about the real numbers because the real numbers are a topological
space. Cohomology in algebraic geometry allows us to generalize these theorems
to other number systems, such as finite fields. The basic goal of my project is
to establish some of these generalizations. In short, the point is to use ideas
from algebraic topology to think about problems in algebra in new ways.
