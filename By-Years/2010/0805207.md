The specific objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;-Establish priorities for future
translational nanomedicine and stimulate research, whereby nanotechnologies and
nanoscience paradigms will facilitate drug delivery, drug and therapeutic
development, in vivo imaging, in vitro diagnostics, active implants and tissue
repair/regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;-Include as speakers a multidisciplinary group of
outstanding scientists and engineers from academia and industry working in the
materials, biological and physical science disciplines toward the development of
nanodevices and nanotechnologies, together with visionary
clinical&lt;br/&gt;researchers from translational research programs supported by
NIH and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute who have expertise in genomics,
proteomics, multiple organ systems, molecules and pathways implicated in common
human diseases.&lt;br/&gt;- Stimulate uniquely transformative, novel, and
integrative strategies to catalyze the application to clinical practice of. This
includes acceleration of the development of nanoscale techniques that enable in
vivo probes of cellular and subcellular physiology.&lt;br/&gt;
