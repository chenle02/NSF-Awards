9503369 Hanagan Excessive floor vibrations are not uncommon in many types of
building structures. Previous research conducted at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute &amp; State University has utilized active control to improve the
dynamic characteristics of an objectional floor system. In this research,
control forces were imparted on the structure, by means of an electromagnetic
proof-mass actuator. A collocated velocity feedback algorithm with a simple
command limiter was implemented digitally. Due to the significant improvements
that were observed, continued research is planned for this solution for
repairing floor systems will unacceptable levels of occupant induced floor
vibrations. Three main objectives: 1. Improved Actuators and Algorithms for
Floor Vibration Control. 2. Simulation of Floor Behavior Subject to Occupant
Activities. 3. Experimental Implementation of Active Control Using Multiple
Actuators.
