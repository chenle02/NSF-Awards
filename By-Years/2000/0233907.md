This proposal provides the core support for ground-based solar radio astronomy
carried out at the University of Maryland. This observational program employs
data from the Very Large Array (VLA), the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Millimeter
Array (BIMA), the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), and the Nancay Multifrequency
Radioheliograph. It will address a number of outstanding problems in solar-
terrestrial research including, (i) the inference of coronal magnetic fields and
associated electric current systems, (ii) the properties of MeV-energy
electrons, (iii) a statistical survey of the sizes, morphology and spatial
distribution of flare acceleration sites, (iv) new views of physical processes
in the solar atmosphere at decimetric wavelengths, and (v) the nature of loop-
loop interactions in and around solar active regions.
