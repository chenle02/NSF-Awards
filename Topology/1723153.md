The International Conference on the Foundations of Computational Mathematics
2017 is the ninth of a successful series and will be held in Barcelona, Spain
from July 10 to July 19, 2017. This award funds the attendance at the meeting of
at least twenty junior U.S. participants, including graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and early career tenure track faculty. The conference
features seventeen plenary speakers, eight of whom are from the US, and 21
workshops where the junior participants participants will be able to present a
talk or a poster.

The impact of constantly increasing computational power has changed the
relationship between mathematics and computation. New applications such as
encryption, large scale data management, and signal/image processing, inevitably
led to the study of the computational tools themselves, creating and
reinvigorating a rich spectrum of mathematical disciplines. Mathematicians now
increasingly recognize that, besides its value as a numerical and experimental
tool, computation is a significant theoretical tool in its own right. This
conference aims to further the understanding of the connections between
mathematics and computation, including the interfaces between pure and applied
mathematics, numerical analysis and computer science. This is reflected in the
diverse and vibrant research areas covered by the 21 workshops which are
organized by world experts, including many from the US. This award is
instrumental in enabling the participation of many US young researchers at this
renowned and exciting conference.
