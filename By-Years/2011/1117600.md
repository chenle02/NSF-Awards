This project aims to develop a comprehensive approach for characterization of RF
environment in terms of spatial and temporal features including: i) the number
of active transmitters, ii) their power, direction of arrival and location, and
iii) modulation class. Spatio-temporal spectrum sensing requires novel multi-
dimensional parameter estimation algorithms as opposed to conventional spectrum
sensing that uses hypothesis testing based detection algorithms. In this work,
the Bayesian estimation approach using angle-of-arrival measurements is applied
to create the probabilistic map of the transmitter presence in a given region
taking into account measurement noise and uncertainties. The tools from random
matrix theory are applied to perform joint detection and parameter estimation,
and analytically derive performance bounds. The methods for modulation
classification are based on goodness-of-fit statistical tests with reduced
sampling complexity, and provide the unified classification framework for a wide
range of modulation classes. The results of this research will impact the design
of novel medium access and routing protocols that manage the interference
through awareness of the location and link quality of other transmitters in the
region. The developed technologies could potentially apply for monitoring of RF
transmissions within wireless infrastructure, and for the defense and national
security applications.
