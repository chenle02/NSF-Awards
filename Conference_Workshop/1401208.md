This award will provide travel support for US-based researchers and graduate
students participating in an International Congress of Mathematics (ICM) 2014
satellite conference on "Representation Theory and Related Topics" on August
6-9, 2014, in Daegu, South Korea. The representation theory of Lie algebras,
quantum groups and related algebraic structures has become a comprehensive and
mainstream research area in mathematics with numerous applications in
mathematics and theoretical physics. In particular, representation theory of
quantized Kac-Moody algebras and their categorical and geometric constructions
have taken the lead not only within Lie theory but also in other areas of
mathematics and physics such as combinatorics, group theory, number theory,
integrable systems, partial differential equations, topology and conformal field
theory. Recent developments in representation theory are strengthening these
interactions further.

This conference will bring together international experts working on various
aspects of representation theory who will report on the current research
developments, outline the future directions and interact with other participants
including junior researchers and graduate students. The participating
researchers from the US supported through this award will have an opportunity to
exchange ideas with their international counterparts which may lead to future
collaborations. The graduate students from the US supported through this award
will have a unique opportunity to interact with international experts in the
field of representation theory. The conference website is located at
