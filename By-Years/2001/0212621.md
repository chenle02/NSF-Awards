Almost all biological traits have the potential to evolve in response to
selection. Some traits may not respond to selection as might be expected,
however, because they are negatively correlated with other traits. Such
phenomena generate the tradeoffs that are the basis of life history evolution.
Typically in studies of life history evolution, one focal trait is allowed to
experience selection, and correlations between it and other traits are used to
estimate the tradeoffs. However, selection tends to act on multiple traits
simultaneously, necessitating studies of simultaneous selection on multiple
traits rather than on correlations with one focal trait. Few studies have
examined how the physiological or developmental mechanisms that underlie life
history traits respond to selection on the focal traits and no study to date has
examined the physiological regulation of simultaneous selection on multiple life
history traits. This study will address these issues with studies of the well-
known tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae). This is one of
very few species in which the physiological mechanisms regulating two important
life history traits, body size and development time, are known, providing
essential background for this study. A series of six directional selection
experiments will be run for ten generations. These will include all four
possible combinations of simultaneous selection for increased and decreased
development time and body size as well as selection to increase body size and
selection to decrease development time. The three physiological factors that
determine these traits (critical weight, PTTH delay time, and growth rate) will
be measured before and after selection. This will be the first study to examine
how the regulating physiological factors, constrain or engender, the evolution
of multiple life history traits in response to simultaneous selection.
