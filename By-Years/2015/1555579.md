This project studies Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms
are widely used in a variety of scientific fields, for instance, for Bayesian
inference and for simulations of idealized models of physical systems. At the
heart of an MCMC algorithm is a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is
of particular interest. The efficiency of this Markov chain is measured by its
mixing time, which is the requisite number of steps to reach this equilibrium
distribution of interest. In this project the PI will design new tools for
analyzing the mixing time of Markov chains to gain a better understanding of
settings where MCMC algorithms are efficient. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work in
this project will enhance scientific studies that rely on MCMC algorithms, and
will strengthen ties between the study of randomized algorithms in theoretical
computer science with the study of phase transitions in statistical physics. The
PI will organize a workshop on topics related to this project, bringing together
researchers from statistical physics, discrete mathematics and theoretical
computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to connect the mixing
time of well-studied Markov chains with phase transitions in the underlying
system. In this project the PI will analyze Markov chains that are popular for
statistical physics and combinatorial models. The goal is to understand the
mixing time of these Markov chains and determine how the mixing time relates to
phase transitions in the associated models. Of particular interest is analyzing
the mixing time at the critical points of phase transitions.
