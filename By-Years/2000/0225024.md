0225024 Patten

This award supports an eighteen month Japan Society for the Promotion of Science
(JSPS) Short-Term Postdoctoral Fellowship for John A. Patten at the University
of North Carolina in Charlotte. He will be collaborating with Professor Wei Gao
at Tohoku University in Japan. They will be undertaking research on the
machining of ceramics. This will involve working on three different silicon
nitride ceramics. They are a reaction bonded silicon nitride from Ceradyne, a
hot isostatic press (HIP) material from Japan and a commercial HIP material from
Allied Signal. All three materials behave similarly when machined, in that they
have a ductile to brittle transition (with increasing depth of cut or increasing
feed) yet all behave differently in terms of their machining characteristics.
They will be studying the forces, tool wear, cutting edge radius measurements,
finished surface roughness and then evaluating the material removed (chips) and
the finished surface for signs of phase transformations using TEM and Raman
Spectroscopy.

The researchers hope to determine the behavior differences for these three
materials and then develop methods to exploit their differences. Ductile
machining of ceramics is advantageous in that very smooth, crack free surfaces
can be generated. Such surfaces are useful for many structural and also
microelectronic applications. This project will offer a good opportunity to join
efforts between the two countries. Through the exchange of ideas and technology,
this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to publish results of the
research on the web and report on the findings at scientific meetings.
