University&lt;br/&gt;IBN-0114648&lt;br/&gt;Development of laser-capture
microdissection for plant tissues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The
technique of laser-capture microdissection (LCM) will be developed and optimized
for plant tissues. This is a method originally developed for animal tissues,
whereby individual cells are harvested by tacking them to a plastic film with a
low-power infrared laser that can be aimed at single cells while viewing the
tissue slice under a microscope. Using this method, it should be possible to
recover specific cell types or developmental stages from complex tissues
consisting of many cell types. Cells recovered in this manner can be analyzed
with regard to gene expression profiles, protein profiles, and other properties.
Based on preliminary data, it will be necessary to test a variety of tissue
fixation and sectioning methods to adapt the method to plants. This project will
optimize the LCM technique, using a variety of plant tissue sources and purity
markers for specific cells. Detailed protocols will be provided to the
biological community at the website
