9531790 Dalgarno Dr. Dalgarno will direct theoretical studies of X-ray dominated
regions of space with the intent of identifying specific diagnostic probes that
may distinguish between regions ionized by X-rays and by cosmic rays. The
infrared response of molecular hydrogen as a function of density will be
calculated. The chemistry of deuterated molecular species in the early Universe
will be explored. The molecular composition of circumstellar shells will be
examined using a refined treatment of radiative transfer. Particular attention
will be given to the discrepancy between the present model abundance and the
measured abundance of neutral carbon atoms in IRC+10216. Semiclassical
calculations of rate coefficients of rovibrational transitions of molecular
hydrogen in collision with H will be completed and quantal calculations required
for low temperatures will be initiated. Charge transfer collisions of singly
charged species interacting with neutral atoms will be studied. ***
