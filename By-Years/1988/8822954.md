Many stellar objects are known to possess magnetic fields. In some stars, as in
the case of the sun, the magnetic fields are relatively weak and chiefly
concentrated in certain regions. In other stars, such as some of the white
dwarfs or neutron stars, the magnetic fields may be very strong, exceeding the
terrestrial magnetic field by factors of a million and more. The Principal
Investigator proposes to investigate the magnetic fields found in cataclysmic
binary star systems (which typically contain a white dwarf) and in neutron
stars. In particular, he will study the emission of radiation, known as
cyclotron emission, from the magnetic field regions of these stars. The emission
arises when fast moving charged particles enter the magnetic fields and
experience rotational accelerations. The PI expects that the investigation of
cyclotron emission from cataclysmic binaries will improve our understanding of
mass exchange between the stellar members of these systems. The investigation of
cyclotron emission from neutron stars should provide information about the
observed slowing down and spinning up of the rotation of these objects.
