This research concerns the investigation of linear codes associated with
designs, and continues work that Dr. Jennifer Key has been engaged in over the
last few years which includes a graduate-level book, written jointly with E. F.
Assmus, Jr. Coding-theoretical properties of the design that can lead to a
characterization of design within the set of designs with the same parameters.
Conversely, geometrical properties of the design can lead to immediate insights
into the code which can help in the determination of the usefulness of the code
in practical applications. Interactive activities include teaching a course
either to advanced undergraduates in the area of coding theory, geometry or
group theory, or a course to graduates on algebraic coding theory, or in design
theory; and arranging an advanced seminar series which would include four or
five notable visitors, each visiting for at least a week. Other activities
include substantial involvement in the faculty and with the students, and
informal discussion meetings.
