Writing correct, secure software is very difficult. Languages like C that have
weak type systems exacerbate the problem by making it easy for programmers to
introduce errors and potential security holes in their code.

The goal of this project is the design, implementation, and evaluation of
dynamic error-detection and security-enforcement tools for C programs. Existing
dynamic error-detection tools are limited by poor coverage: they can only detect
erroneous behaviors that actually occur during a given program execution. That
limitation will be addressed by the use of innovative new dynamic techniques for
increasing both "data coverage" (finding errors that could occur given different
input values) and "path" coverage (finding errors that could occur if a
different path were followed through the program). The security-enforcement tool
will provide protection against a wide range of attacks, with low overhead,
without requiring modifications to existing source code, and without requiring
the programmer to give up control over data representations or memory
management.
