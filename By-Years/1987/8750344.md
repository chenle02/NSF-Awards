The Physics Department at St. Olaf College is in the process of modernizing its
introductory and advanced laboratories. The instrumentation to be acquired will
greatly increase access to computers for data acquisition, analysis and display.
A variety of instruments, with stand-alone capability as well as computer
access, will give access to state-of-the-art electronic devices. These include:
a digital multimeter, a digital storage scope, a versatile function generator,
and a power supply; all with GPIB capability. The computing equipment will
include terminals (with and without graphics capability) to allow greater access
to existing multi-user computers, and a PC/AT compatable with high resolution
color graphics, plotter, interfacing cards, and software for data acquisition
and analysis. The large introductory laboratory sections will benefit from the
addition of four microcomputers, with bit-mapped graphics capability, to give
access to a routine already developed for data analysis. Two printers will
supply hard-copy of the results. A number of electronics and advanced laboratory
experiments will take advantage of the greater precision or speed of access to
examine topics of fundamental interest, but not generally accessible with
conventional instrumentation.
