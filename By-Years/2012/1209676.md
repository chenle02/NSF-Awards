This action funds Michael J. Lopez of University of California, Los Angeles to
conduct a research project, entitled "Novel catalytic reactions generating
chemical bonds using abundant and cheap starting materials," during the summer
of 2012 at University of Osaka in Osaka. The host scientist is Professor Hayato
Tsurugi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop dehydrogenative
borylation catalysts using early-transition metals supported by redox-active
ligands.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
