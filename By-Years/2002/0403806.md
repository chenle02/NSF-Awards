The Divisions of Chemistry (CHE), Materials Research (DMR), and Computing &amp;
Communication Foundations (CCF) are supporting Hector Abruna, Geoffrey Coates,
Paul McEuen, Daniel Ralph, and James Sethna of Cornell University and Mark
Ratner of Northwestern University in a research effort as a Nanoscale
Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT). Their work will focus on creating and
characterizing electronic devices based on single molecules and conducting
polymers. The NIRT brings together a multidisciplinary team that can address all
aspects of the project from chemical synthesis to physical characterization and
modeling. The results of these systematic experiments will provide a fundamental
understanding of electronics at the nanoscale. The results from this project
could also directly impact technologically important devices such as single-
molecule transistors and ultra-small sensors. This work will impact
undergraduate and graduate students, including recruitment and retention of
underrepresented minorities, and provide excellent training and research
experiences in a forefront area of nanoscience. This NIRT will serve as a center
of outreach for New York State K-12 teachers by developing and disseminating
hands-on laboratory exercises based on New York Math, Science, and Technology
Standards. The NIRT participants will also prepare and present a colloquium-
style presentation on scientific ethics, which will include a recent case in
molecular electronics.
