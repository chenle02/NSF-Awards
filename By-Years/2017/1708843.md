The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any U.S. university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, on behalf of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS), proposes to continue the procurement of electro-
mechanical oceanographic cables and torque-balanced wire rope to meet the needs
of UNOLS ships for a five-year period beginning 1 January 2017.
