9314399 Dorman This project will deploy a set of Ocean Bottom Seismometers
across the Lau Basin and Tonge Trench, to complement an already-funded land-
based array. The goal is to use seismic velocities to interpret the structure of
the mantle wedge and subducting slab, and thereby to determine evidence for
phase changes in the slab, and sources of arc back-arc magmas.
