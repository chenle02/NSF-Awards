The research objective of this project is to apply multivariate and nonlinear
time series analyses in formulating comprehensive and systematic dynamical model
and data reduction framework. In this framework, smooth orthogonal decomposition
will be applied to the dimension reduction of deterministic nonlinear dynamical
systems and will be contrasted with other alternatives - e.g., proper orthogonal
decomposition. The research approach is to test the framework on several large-
scale structural and molecular dynamics models' short time trajectories, and
evaluate the resultant subspaces suitability for model reduction. Reduced-order
models based on these subspaces will be simulated and compared with the full-
scale models, using frequency response functions, bifurcation diagrams, phase
portraits, and other dynamical characteristics such as fractal dimensions and
Liapunov exponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This framework will provide a
systematic way of evaluating a particular model reduction procedure's
effectiveness and its robustness with respect to the bounded variations in the
system/forcing parameters, and initial conditions. This project is expected to
provide new tools to study slow-time dynamics of complex engineered and
biological systems (e.g., physics of protein conformational changes or folding,
protein-protein association, large multi-physics dynamics, etc.). For a protein
system, e.g., this methodology can be exploited in the rational design of next
generation compound-antagonists. The plan also supports the curricular expansion
of two interdisciplinary graduate courses, the organization of department-wide
workshops on graduate research for junior and senior students, the regular
organization of conferences and minisymposia, the dissemination of results
through the web, personal communication, and traditional publications in top
journals.
