The objective of this award is to offer a control synthesis framework for
feedback laws that harness compliance to realize agile locomotion in a class of
robotic quadrupeds. To achieve this goal, a modeling and control hierarchy that
transforms nature-inspired reductive models of locomotion behavior into concrete
control commands to the robots? actuators is proposed. If successful, this
research effort will impact the study of many other engineered and biological
systems, which, like legged robots, accomplish their purpose through forceful,
cyclic interactions with their environment. Deliverables include models of
locomotion behavior; analytical methods to rigorously characterize cyclic motion
generation and stability of quadrupedal running gaits; constructive control
techniques and systematic control law design tools that minimize laborious,
trial-and-error experimentation; verification procedures to test the controllers
in a variety of running gaits using widely accepted performance metrics; and
engineering student education and engineering research experiences for K-12
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work directly addresses a principal barrier
to innovation that faces the legged robotics community today: systematic
controller design tools that enable legged machines to perform real-world tasks
reliably and efficiently. This way, this research effort promotes the
advancement of a host of real-life applications, including industrial,
agricultural and military applications, which require highly mobile and
versatile robot platforms. In the long run, this work will lead to increased
public acceptance and more pervasive use of robots. In addition, graduate and
undergraduate engineering students will benefit through active participation in
the research process. An integral part of this effort is to immerse K-12
teachers in engineering research experiences, with the purpose of translating
those experiences into classroom activities to enhance their standards-based
curriculum.
