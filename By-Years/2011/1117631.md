This proposal investigates new computational and combinatorial tools for
learning from data and performing inference about data. As such, it serves as a
bridge between the machine learning community and the combinatorics community.
The latter field develops efficient algorithms or shows when an efficient
solution to a particular problem exists. The project will support graduate
students in the intersection of these two fields to combine recent theoretical
results with practical data problems. The team will produce a website of
tutorials, data sets, downloadable code, interactive visual examples and course
materials to allow better integration across the two fields. The combinatorics
community has identified a family of inputs called perfect graphs where
otherwise hard problems are efficiently solvable. This proposal will investigate
how to bridge this powerful theoretical result to the area of machine learning
and formally characterize which learning and inference problems are efficiently
solvable.

More specifically, the team will investigate data learning problems (such as
clustering a data set into subgroups that are self-similar or finding anomalies
in a database) and statistical inference problems (computing the most likely or
most typical outcome from observed measurements). These problems will be
compiled or represented as graphs and networks. Then, these graphs and networks
can be more formally diagnosed using perfect graph theory to determine if the
instance of the problem is easy (or hard) and to provide efficient solutions via
exact algorithms on perfect graphs. These solvers will be implemented using
message passing or convex programming.
