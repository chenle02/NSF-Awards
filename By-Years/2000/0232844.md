This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project applies Infolenz'
proprietary model-reduction technology to the development of a data-driven
economic framework for supporting a firm's offer design. The objectives of the
project are: 1) development of a modeling methodology capable of handling the
complexity of enterprise transaction data, 2) development of a robust integrated
offer design methodology, 3) prototyping the methods in software, and 4)
applying them to actual client data.

The resulting commercial application emerges in a tool that automatically
integrates the strategic decisions of business users with the economic
information gleaned from transaction data to design optimal offers. The
proprietary model-reduction technique of the proposer represents a missing link
that can now support the development of a practical theory of robust modeling
and control of these complex economic systems that is truly data-driven.
