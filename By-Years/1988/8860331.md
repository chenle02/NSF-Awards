High resolution scanned images are difficult to work with for several reasons:
they require large amounts of storage and bandwidth, they are prone to aliasing
artifacts when scaled or rotated, and operators cannot work directly and
naturally on the objects depicted in the scene. We propose decomposing an image
into 'surface patches' where each patch is described by an algebraic intensity
function and a mathematical contour description. These patches will tend to
correspond with objects in the scene, and are a compact and resolution
independent representation of the image. The proposed work will investigate the
feasibility of developing and implementing an algorithm to perform raster to
object (image surface patch) conversion using present day or near future
hardware technology. This will be done by conducting studies to characterize the
image intensity functions and contours in a sample set of pictures. Candidate
algorithms will be examined and promising ones prototyped to determine their
potential for high fidelity image reconstruction and image compression.
