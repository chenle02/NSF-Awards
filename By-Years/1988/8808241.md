The objective of this research is to model the three-dimensional dynamic crack
growth and failure mechanism in a composite laminate subjected to low velocity
impact. This study will incorporate variationally consistent fracture mechanics
elements, multi-failure criteria and parallel processing algorithms. The
computational results will be checked with experimental data for low velocity
impacts of an object on the surface of a composite panel and a cylinder. The
resultant code will provide a quantitative design tool for predicting composite
laminate failure under low velocity impact.
