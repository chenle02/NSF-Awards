This project involves the development and analysis of a new parallel logic
programming system. The system is based on a flat variation of the Pandora
language, incorporating both stream communication with backtracking
nondeterminism. A reduced instruction-set architecture and storage model for
efficient implementations of backtracking and memory management are major
concerns. In addition, methods of scheduling implicit parallelism with graphical
tools will be explored. The radically new approach is based on decompiling the
programmer's interaction with a graphical execution summary. The goal of the
trace-driven graph is to summarize only the program execution characteristics
relevant to performance: granularity and dependencies. This abstraction is
necessary to summarize large programs. Programmer annotations of the graph made
by mouse can be generalized to explicit pragma within the source program. This
approach is used on top of other schedulers (e.g., on-demand schedulers or
explicit schedulers) for fine tuning applications performance. Empirical
analysis of benchmark performance is a critical factor throughout the design
process.
