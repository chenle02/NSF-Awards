This proposal focuses on the study of coadjoint representations and related
algebraic structures related to coadjoint orbits. These coadjoint
representations play a fundamental role in understanding certain aspects of the
Anti-de Sitter Space / conformal field theory conjecture as well as
understanding such diverse topics as black hole quantization and conformal field
theory. The research will focus on understanding the Virasaro algebra arising in
string theory and its dual (the coadjoint representation). By considering the
semi-direct product of the Virasoro algebra and the Kac-Moody algebra, two
symplectic structures of classical mechanics can be obtained which are important
for quantizing the theory. The resulting action can be used for describing
quantization about BTZ black holes as well as for studying Chern Simons theory.
A toy M theory will be studied based on a particular N=1 Virasaro action.
