Semiconductor Nanocrystals with controlled composition, size and shape are novel
materials with the unique potential for specifically engineered electronic and
optical properties. This project addresses the possibilities afforded by
dynamically tuning the charges. One single electron has large consequences even
at room temperature, such as dramatically switching the "color" of a nanocrystal
both in the visible and in the infrared. This project will first address the
challenges to controllably inject and retain a well-defined charge in a small
colloid quantum dot. This is an interfacial redox chemistry problem, which
requires a coupled synthetic and characterization approach. Second, charges
strongly interact with one another and they should greatly influence the carrier
dynamics. Internal carrier dynamics is a basic and poorly understood subject in
quantum dot physics and in this project, time-resolved spectroscopy will shed
light on the influence of charges. Third, colloidal quantum dots are "artificial
atoms", which can be assembled into crystalline solids with controlled spacers
between dots. This project will investigate the transport properties of such
nanocrystal arrays as a function of the charging of each nanocrystals. The
project integrates research and education in a highly interdisciplinary fashion.
It trains students in an area of nanoscience with potential applications in
sensors, lighting a communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only about
100 common elements in Nature but the variety of their chemistry is greatly
enhanced by their various degrees of ionization. For example, the Chlorine ion
Cl- is an unreactive but essential element for life, while the Chlorine
molecule, C12, was the very poisonous gas used in World War I. Over the past
twenty years material scientists have achieved a great degree of control of the
synthesis and assemblies of very small crystals of semiconductors that mimic in
many ways the electronic structure of atoms. By designing size, shape and
composition of the "nanocrystals", one has now the possibility of designing
supra "artificial atoms", from which countless benefits in electronic, optical
and biological technologies are expected while several are already starting to
be realized. The project will provide the basic research to dramatically expand
the realm of these new "artificial atoms" by controlling their various degrees
of ionization. The project integrates research and education in a highly
interdisciplinary fashion. It trains students in an area of nanoscience with
potential applications in sensors, lighting and communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
