ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;25 June 2008&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0825670&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;PI: A.
Walsh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests six Shipboard Scientific
Support items for Columbia University, Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO);
namely two (2) new RADAR?s, communication equipment for deck operations, a
computerized stability program, and a new R/O water maker. Four (4) SCBA?s will
be provided through group purchase. All items will either enhance safety or
provide greatly improved support capabilities to
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V MARCUS LANGSETH supports
federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans and routinely
exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. After
completing trials, the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH began operations in 2008 with seven
3-D seismic cruises and is projected to sail even more extensively in 2009.
