9714045 Yalcintas This Research Planning Grant (RPG) facilitates preliminary
studies related to the development of a research proposal on fatigue damage
detection of composite materials. The technique is based on the change of
vibration characteristics of composites as they experience fatigue damage. Fiber
optic sensors are used to measure the vibration response of the composite
structures. Neural network prediction techniques are then employed to evaluate
the measured vibration information, and predict the health conditions and damage
state of the composite materials. The project addresses the limitations of
composites for defense, space, automotive, and aerospace industries on account
of their brittle nature and low fracture toughness. A continuous fatigue damage
detection method is developed that can inform the user of the fatigue stage and
remaining life of composite materials. ***
