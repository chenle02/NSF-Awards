Dr. Barron will involve two undergraduate students in the research related to
his grant. This involvement is under the aegis of the Research Experience For
Undergraduates Program. The students will be involved in numerical model code
refinement and some simple model experimentation. The students work would not
only enhance the research under this grant, but also give them invaluable
experience working in collaboration and cooperation with graduate students and
programmers.
