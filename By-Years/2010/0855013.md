The origin of the elements remains one of the largest unanswered questions in
nuclear physics today. In particular, nucleosynthesis processes involving nuclei
far from stability (i.e., the rp- and r-processes) remain largely untested. This
award will fund the participation of this group in an initial experiment that
has been approved for a direct mass measurement of proton drip-line nuclei
relevant to the astrophysical rp-process. This work involves an international
collaboration in nuclear astrophysics at the RIKEN Radioactive Ion Beam Factory
(RIBF). Future experiments are planned to directly measure the masses of
neutron-rich nuclei relevant to the r-process of nucleosynthesis, as well as
experiments to measure nuclear structure far from stability. Experiments
involving very exotic nuclei are made possible by the high intensities of the
RIBF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As broader impacts of the program, both graduate and
undergraduate students will participate in the program, providing exposure to
science at an international level. An international collaboration will be
engaged in the proposed work, and an American presence will be established at
what is currently the most powerful heavy ion accelerator on the planet.
