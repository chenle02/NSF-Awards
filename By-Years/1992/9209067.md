The "Conference on The Biology, Chemistry and Modelling of Vision: Visual
Processing" will be held at Vermont Academy in Saxton's River, Vermont from June
21-26, 1992 in association with the Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology (FASEB). Thirty-four invited speakers from different
subareas of retinal research will provide both depth and breadth to the
conference. This is the first FASEB meeting on the topic and the organizers have
invited major leaders in the field of retinal processing. The conference is open
to an additional 120 scientists without invitation, on a first-come basis and
afternoon poster sessions have been organized for voluntary presentations. The
conference offers an excellent opportunity for scientists using the retina as an
experimental and/or model system in neuroscience to interact and share their
expertise. Approximately one-third of the funds provided by NSF will be used for
women and minority participants.
