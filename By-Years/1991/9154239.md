Three two-week workshops will be held to acquaint undergraduate professors with
new curricula ideas and applications in the areas of mathematical modeling,
geometry, and statistics. Leaders in each field, both academic and
practitioners, will interact with seventy-five nationally drawn participants to
enable them to understand new developments in these mathematical fields and to
prepare applications-based modular materials suitable for classroom use. Areas
to be discussed are problem-solving strategies using combinatorics and graph
theory, applications of analysis to biology, and graphical algorithms in the
social sciences. In geometry, emphasis will center on tilings, combinatorial
geometry, and studies in computational geometry. Statistics will focus on data
analysis and graphical techniques as applied to experimental design, quality
control, and sociology.
