This research project involves a comprehensive study of galactic foreground
emission for removal from sensitive maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB), necessary to produce useful images of the CMB. Polarized and unpolarized
galactic emission from 10 MHz to 3000 GHz will be analyzed by combining
available data with simulations. This will be useful both for foreground-
cleaning of current measurements, and for optimizing the design of future
experiments. Publicly available products will include a Global Sky Model; dust
maps; improved foreground-cleaned polarized CMB maps; realistic hydrogen
emission 21cm foreground data cubes; and cleaning algorithms and software.

Broader impacts of this program include student training, development of broadly
useful cosmological tools, and public talks and other educational outreach.
