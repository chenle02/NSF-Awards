A group of natural hazards experts will be organized by the National Research
Council, NAS/NAE, to form the Committee for the United States Decade of Natural
Disasters Reduction. This Committee will include engineers, physical and social
scientists and will prepare a report which will define the need for a national
effort in reducing the damages and losses produced by natural extreme events.
The Committee will also maintain an effective link with other nations and
international organizations which, together with the United States, are taking
part in the International Decade for Natural Disasters Reduction.
