This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Sidney Yakowitz of the University
of Arizona in a research collaboration with Professor Onesimo Hernandez Lerma of
the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN (CINVESTAV) in
Mexico City, Mexico. The purpose of the research is to develop and extend recent
innovative analytical techniques in the field of optimal and adaptive control of
controlled Markov processes. Of major interest is the development of non-
parametric adaptive estimation and control methods, and the use of machine
learning methods to deal with realistic situations when the model of the system
is not completely known in advance. Controlled Markov processes are mathematical
descriptions of the evolution and control of processes that involve sequential
decision-making under uncertainty. Quality of information, inaccurate models,
and computational implementation are important issues. The Mexican PI is widely
acknowledged to be an authority on optimal and adaptive control of adaptive
control of Markov processes, while the U.S. PI will bring to the collaboration,
his expertise in statistical and probabilistic methods and the theory of machine
learning. This wide range of complementary skills makes it likely that the work
will yield advances in the design and analysis of new techniques in this field.
