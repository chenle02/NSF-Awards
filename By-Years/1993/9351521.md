The institution provides a liberal arts freshman and sophomore curriculum. More
than half of the students are older and returning to school or are rural, first-
generation college students. This project, therefore, provides computers and
associated physiological recording equipment and software that helps
undergraduate instruction in biology. The software programs developed have also
allowed faculty to prepare printed and Hypercard-based tutorial material custom-
designed to the backgrounds of our students. It is expected that this project
will enhance the laboratory experience of our traditional students and tap the
currently underutilized capabilities of our large non-traditional population at
the institution.
