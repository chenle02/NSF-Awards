This project supports a biological survey of the dynastine scarab beetles of
Costa Rica and Panama. Dynastines are prominent elements of the entomofauna as a
result of their rich diversity, numbers and, in some instances, their size and
body form; these are the rhinoceros or unicorn beetles of the tropics. The
subfamily Dynastinae in Costa Rica and Panama consists of 32 genera and
approximately 161 species with new species awaiting description. The objectives
of the project are to (1) study the Dynastinae already residing in research
collections in Costa Rica, Panama, and North America, (2) collect intensively in
numerous localities and different seasons in Costa Rica and Panama (primarily at
light traps, flight intercept traps and in rotting logs), (3) assemble and
deposit authoritatively identified collections in Costa Rica, Panama, and the
United States, (4) make available to others duplicate specimens, and (5) publish
a monographic survey of this group as it exists in Costa Rica and Panama.
Included in the monograph will be bilingual identification keys to all taxa,
descriptions of all taxa, geographic and temporal distributions, ecological and
life history data, biogeographical data, and numerous illustrations. The project
is significant because it will provide the first extensive documentation on all
aspects of these beetles as they occur in Central America. This kind of detailed
treatment of Dynastinae has never been done for any mainland country in Latin
America. The study will also provide a sound taxonomic basis for all future
studies on these beetles. Future studies dealing with biogeography, phylogenetic
inferences, and ecological relationships can only be accomplished with the kind
of data gathered in this proposed survey.
