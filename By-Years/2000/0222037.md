This project is to develop a wireless dense sensor array based on PVDF sensors
currently under development for identifying and monitoring the localized damage
of infrastructure. The tasks involved in this project are:

1. New PVDF sensors development; the sensor will be installed in the model
structure to form a dense sensor array for monitoring the damages of the
structure. 2. Develop the smart sensor array by conducting the parallel
vibration tests of two identical models structures on the shake-table, making
different types and degrees of damages on one model, and leaving the other
intact. 3. Develop the smart wireless sensor array: the TCP/IP based data
telemetry will be developed in the project. The sensor array will be divided
into modules consisting of differently distributed sensors used for monitoring
the different members of structure. Each module is connected to a programmed
microprocessor. The signals of "Warning", "Danger-low", "Danger", "Danger-high"
or "Failure" identified in the sensor modules are transmitted wirelessly via the
TC/IP data telemetry to the maintenance central office
