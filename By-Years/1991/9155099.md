Northern Kentucky University will initiate a year-round Early Alert Initiative
Young Scholars project in Mathematics and Physics for 40 students entering
grades 8 and 9; this will include a four-week summer commuter program. The
summer component will focus on space and aeronautics with applied mathematics
and physics activities related to this theme. Students will work closely with a
team of mathematicians and engineers testing materials in a wind tunnel,
studying optics, making holograms, making a scale model of the solar system,
controlling robots, and building model rockets. The program will increase the
awareness and interest of junior high students in mathematics and physics as
potential career options.
