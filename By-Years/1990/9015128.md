The Engineering Research Center for Optoelectronic Computing Systems, in its
third year of NSF funding, has developed a research and education program
focused on three types of optoelectronic systems for numerical digital
computing, signal processing, and neural-like information processing, with a
broad supporting base of research in optoelectronic materials and devices.
Educational impact has been great on both campuses, including new and updated
courses, and a program of research experiences for undergraduates which includes
opportunities for students from other institutions. Industry support and
participation is strong, and considerable technology transfer has been
accomplished. A number of inventions have been made, and several patents have
been received. This action is for a five-year renewal of funding, with the first
year to be at the base level of $2.4 million and increases in future years to be
commensurate with further progress and funds available to the Engineering
Research Centers Program. The research in the coming five-years will proceed in
the directions originally set. This award also, is to fund the Center's Research
Experiences for Undergraduates outreach program, and will support five
undergraduates from other institutions in the current year.
