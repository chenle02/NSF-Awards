A Gordon Conference on Quantitative Genetics and Biotechnology will be held in
Oxnard, CA on January 9-13. The Conference is designed to provide a forum for
the interchange of recent research findings in the fields of quantitative
genetics and biotechnology as applied to natural and laboratory populations,
humans, agronomic plants and livestock. Researchers will report their latest
findings on the application of new molecular biology methods to quantitative
genetic analysis. The new biotechnologies will be useful for studying the
genetic and biochemical basis of multifactorial (many genes involved) traits in
natural populations (e.g., life history traits), humans (e.g., yield of grain)
and livestock (e.g., lean meat).
