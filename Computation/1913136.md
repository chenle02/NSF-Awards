The primary focus of this project is on the development of novel and efficient
computational algorithms for the solution of large scale inverse problems.
Examples of the kinds of problems that are relevant for the planned mathematical
developments for this study arise in (i) medical image reconstruction from data
acquired without invasive procedures and (ii) measurements of the permeability
of a porous medium which is of great importance for predicting flow and
transport of fluids and contaminants in the subsurface. Improved approaches for
the solution of such problems, both in terms of computational cost and
efficiency, have significant societal impact. Students in applied mathematics
will be trained in the techniques that are being developed and graduate and
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be supported for their
roles in this project. As such, the project contributes to the training of the
next generation of a broad group of students in the mathematical sciences.

The principal investigator will extend and enhance the linear algebra techniques
that are inherent within the solvers for the large scale inverse problems.
Specific goals for the project include the (i) mathematical and computational
analysis of oversampled iterative Krylov algorithms; (ii) the development and
analysis of hybrid preconditioning of randomized singular value decomposition
estimates for large scale under-determined problems, and (iii) assessment of
techniques that incorporate multiple regularization types that are required for
the inversion of such large scale and under sampled problems. The encompassing
goal of this project is the recognition that significant information of a large
scale problem is contained within the dominant spectral subspace obtained via
dimension reduction. Thus the research brings together studies of resolution and
rank estimation for the underlying systems of equations that are solved using
the latest linear algebra techniques and provides theoretically-justified down-
sampling for data and model compression.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
