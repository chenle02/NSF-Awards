Carbon nitride in its single-crystal phase is predicted to be harder than
diamond and to exhibit other exotic properties. To date, it has not been
synthesized. The goal of this research is to effect this synthesis through ion
implantation of diamond, then to determine optical and mechanical properties of
the material which results. Past research has resulted in formed nitrides of
silicon, titanium, and boron using this approach. Nitrogen will be implanted
into carbon substrates at ion doses ranging from 2E17 to l.8E18 per cm2 and
energies from 30 to 20 keV. Following implantation, stoichiometry and
crystalline phase will be determined by X-ray diffraction and Auger electron
spectroscopy. Subsequent hardness, coefficient of friction, index of refraction,
and absorption/transmission/reflection measurements will be made to establish
mechanical and optical characteristics.
