This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
organometallic chemistry between J.W. Faller of Yale University and J.A. Osborn
of the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France. The objective of their
research is to develop novel, efficient asymmetric catalysts for controlling the
stereochemistry of doubled-bonded molecules containing both a heteroatom and
carbon atom. Specifically they will investigate catalysts for the hydrogenation
of ketones (acetones) and imines, which are ammonia compounds. Dr. Faller brings
to this collaboration extensive expertise with the design of stochiometric
reagents for organic synthesis. This is complemented by the French group's
experience with hydrogenation catalysts. Asymmetric catalysis and catalysts are
used to control the stereochemistry of compounds. These catalysts and their
reagents play an essential role in the design of non-toxic drugs and
pharmaceuticals. This research will advance our understanding of the catalytical
processes and result in the development of new and more efficient catalytic
reagents.
