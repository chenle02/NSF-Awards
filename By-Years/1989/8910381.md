Microwave and millimeter were computer aided design (CAD) programs currently
available do no include the effect of parastic coupling, that is unintended
coupling between elements of the circuit not electrically connected. Such
coupling can have a significant effect on a circuit's performance as packing
densities and frequencies of operation are increased. In this Research
Initiation Award, a new method of incorporating parasitic coupling into circuit
modeling programs is investigated. The method takes advantage of the weak nature
of the coupling (10 to 30 dB) by using a perturbational scheme in which the
modifications to the currents in the isolated elements are calculated in a fast,
efficient manner. The method promises to improve the speed of existing modeling
algorithms significantly, and yet be at least as accurate when realistic
roundoff limitations are considered. The algorithm is also speeded up by the
development of a uniform, asymptotic expansion of the matrix elements which
represent the parasitic coupling. The method will be tested on a number of
simple, canonical structures and checked against experimental measurements and
results from other available codes.
