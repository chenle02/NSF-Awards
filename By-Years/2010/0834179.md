This research project focuses on the intersection of energy management and
virtual machine environments. Contemporary energy management algorithms are
implemented in operating systems and rely on detailed application, system, and
device monitoring to manage devices and improve energy efficiency. Virtual
machines make energy management more complicated in several ways. First, virtual
machines are lacking application context. Second, guest operating systems lack
global information. Third, virtual machines typically present virtualized
devices to the guest operating systems, so that a guest operating system no
longer has detailed device energy profiles. This project investigates the proper
distribution of functionality between the guest operating system, virtual
machine, and underlying virtual machine monitor so as to improve overall system
energy efficiency. All guest operating systems must collaborate with the virtual
machine monitor to exchange information about current context and the device
state. System-wide energy efficiency requires global information, as is
available in non-virtualized systems. The challenge is to provide the desired
information flow while preserving the abstraction provided by the
virtualization. Solving this challenge is critical since future systems will
rely heavily both on energy efficiency to prolong battery life and reduce energy
costs, and on virtualization to provide isolation, portability, and many other
benefits. The tools and techniques developed in this project will provide a
platform for future research. Furthermore, the goal of this project is to
involve students in designing and evaluating energy-efficient virtual machines
for various devices through in class assignments as well as independent studies.
The projects and assignments will provide students with better understanding of
the challenges that they will face in their future careers.
