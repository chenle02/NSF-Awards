This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at Yale University acquire a laser system. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) time-resolved two-photon photoelectron and photofragmentation spectroscopies
of mass selected negative ions (2) liquid dynamics and solvation probed with fs
THz pulse spectroscopy (3) non-linear spectroscopy of microdroplets, and (4)
nonlinear spectroscopic probes of photo-induced molecular dynamics and the
optical properties of novel materials. A tunable laser can provide important
information about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our
understanding of the properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.
