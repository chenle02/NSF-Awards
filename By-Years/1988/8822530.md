The Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland Incoherent Scatter Radar and associated
optical facilities have become collectively an important facility for many
studies related to: thermospheric dynamics, composition changes,
electrodynamics, the connection between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere and
studies of the geocorona surrounding the earth out to many earth radii. This
award is to a) provide for the continuation of the operation of the optical
instrumentation as part of this community aeronomy facility, b) up-grade some of
the instrumentation to allow for their more efficient and intensive use and c)
investigate a number of scientific problems unique to the location of these
instruments at this high latitude site.
