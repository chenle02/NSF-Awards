The objective of this research is to develop new geotechnolgies (i.e. Piezo-
vibrocone penetrometer) and integrate recent research and development
technologies (i.e. high-energy plasma arc torch) into the practices of civil,
environmental, and earthquake engineering. The implementation of these devices
will provide significant improvements in our understanding of earthquake-
induced liquefaction behavior, environmental containment of wastes, and ground
modification techniques.
