9315445 Bodily This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor David Bodily, Department of Chemical and Fuels Engineering,
University of Utah, and Professor Kiyoshi Higuchi, Department of Mineral
Resources, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. The focus of the project is on
methane recovery from coal beds. The investigators will exchange information on
the measurement of coal seam methane content, perform tests to compare
measurements under the same conditions with each group's equipment, and
construct a model to simulate methane recovery. ***
