This research project will explore several frontiers of atom interferometry. For
example, the work will develop an innovative technique for dispersion
compensation, one that might be useful for waveguide interferometers as well,
and will dramatically enhance the dynamic range of inertial sensors built with
material atom optics. Molecule interferometry and the atom-surface interaction
measurements carried out as part of the project will have an impact in chemical
physics. Proposed measurements of decoherence due to atom-atom interactions will
be used to understand the challenges for large-scale quantum computation. The
proposed measurements of polarizability of all the alkali atoms with 0.01%
precision will become a benchmark for atomic transition matrix elements
predicted by atomic many-body theory. The same theory is needed for interpreting
atomic parity violation measurements as a test of the standard model. Thus,
measurements of polarizability in cesium will help reduce the uncertainty due to
atomic structure theory in these fundamental tests for new physics beyond the
standard model. Similar theory used to predict atom-atom van der Waals
interaction strengths, optical index of refraction, and atomic lifetimes will
benefit from this proposed research. Additional broader impact involves student
education and community outreach.
