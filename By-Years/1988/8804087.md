An understanding of the composition and crystal structure as a function of
depth in the mantle must rely on the comparison of the in situ properties
deduced from seismology with those deduced from laboratory studies. The
laboratory studies can provide data that are directly comparable with the
properties of the mantle as well as data that define theoretical models for
predicting properties which are not measurable. Single crystal acoustic
velocities can best serve these needs, and Brillouin scattering provides a
technique that can best define these data. The thrust of this research is to use
this technique to directly characterize potential mantle minerals under
simulated mantle conditions and to provide data for the purpose of directing
theoretical modeling of material properties.
