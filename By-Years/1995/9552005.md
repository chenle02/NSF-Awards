This project establishes an undergraduate laboratory in which the thermal
behavior of electronics is used as a means of teaching the fundamentals of heat
transfer. Essential heat transfer principles are taught using apparatuses that
model or simulate actual thermal characteristics of electronic components and
systems. This laboratory supports a heat transfer course required of Mechanical
Engineering Technology majors at the university. Ancillary uses of the
laboratory in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and electronics courses are also
supported. As a result of the dramatic increase of electronic packaging
densities driven by requirements for more computing power and real-time
communications, thermal control of electronics has become a critical technology.
The degree and specificity of heat transfer education invoked by this technology
pose unique demands on today's technology graduates. This project helps satisfy
those demands by introducing engineering technology students to thermal control
techniques for electronic equipment. Because thermal engineering of electronics
has been identified as a critical technology for the economic competitiveness of
the United States, this project has the potential of having a significant
impact.
