This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
tunable, compact, high-power Terahertz (THz) radiation source. The unique
discriminator of the source is the projected power level, which is orders of
magnitude greater than available semiconductor sources, should enable for the
first time both wide field of view (FOV) imaging and high-throughput
spectroscopic interrogation from a compact package. The Phase II program will
complete the final design of the THz source developed in Phase I and described
in the final technical report, fabricate a prototype device and demonstrate its
performance at a THz research laboratory. The goal of the project is to
demonstrate that the concept can deliver tens of watts of THz power from a
device that is sufficiently robust and compact to be transportable and operate
in the field.

The THz spectral region combines many desirable features for spectroscopic and
imaging applications. However, higher-powered, compact sources, such as that
here, are needed to deliver practical throughput rates and the signal-to-noise
ratio required for many commercial applications. The major medical imaging
applications being developed are the detection of breast and basal cell
carcinomas. Pharmaceutical industry applications include drug discovery and
quality assurance, DNA analysis and proteomics. In the homeland security and
defense arenas, the potential applications include standoff chemical and
biological agent and explosive detection. THz systems are finding increasingly
widespread use in scientific and University R&D environments for non-destructive
evaluation and medical applications.
