The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center research site at
Northeastern University will work jointly with the industrial members and the
existing Microcontamination Control center at the University of Arizona and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to develop solutions that will improve the
industry's yield and contribute to their competitiveness. The industrial members
at all three sites will share the research results of all the
sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on the fundamentals of surface
cleaning and preparation, particle adhesion and removal mechanisms, reduction of
the use of chemicals through dilute chemistries, cryogenic aerosols and
supercritical fluids (such as supercritical CO2) and reduction of water use
through increased cleaning efficiency. Contamininants in gases will also be
addressed through physical modeling of particle generation, transport,
deposition resulting in contamination in thin film process. The center will also
work toward the development of micro-sensors that can be used to detect
impurities insitu in ultra pure gases used in semiconductor and other
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
