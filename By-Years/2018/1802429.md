The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is to potentially reduce
significantly the number of deaths of premature babies in low to middle income
countries. Premature birth is globally the number one cause of death in children
under the age of 5, with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) being the leading
cause of these deaths. RDS is usually addressed by using a bCPAP (bubble
continuous positive airway pressure) machine that provides the baby with a
humidified blend of air and oxygen at a controlled temperature and pressure. The
goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art, low-cost bCPAP machine
that aids preterm babies in low to middle income countries. While bCPAP devices
are standard in wealthy nations, their $8-10k cost often makes them unaffordable
for countries with fewer resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
will explore the commercial potential of a novel bubble continuous positive
airway pressure (bCPAP) machine. Some of the innovative features of this device
include a cassette format for ease of maintenance and repair, a battery backup
for uninterrupted care, robust component selection for extended lifetime use and
a drug delivery add on for potential treatment of comorbidities. If successfully
implemented, this product would potentially help provide quality affordable
healthcare to underserved populations and reduce premature deaths due to
respiratory distress syndrome.
