The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a high
efficiency, affordable and aesthetically pleasing solar product. Not only would
this product make solar energy more affordable, it might also accelerate the
migration to renewable energy. The proposed solar product could be integrated
into residential roofing or perhaps another building integrated solution. The
ultimate aim is to provide a solar solution that has the utility of ordinary
solar panels but is lower cost and has improved aesthetic. Potential
applications for lower cost, lighter, solar panels will be explored. Also, solar
shingles and other building integrated solutions will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-corps project aims at realizing high
efficiency and affordable solar by fabricating hybrid solar devices using a
simple and low cost surface treatment for the silicon light absorber with a low
cost polymer coating to complete the cell. Initial modeling suggests that high
power efficiencies are attainable with this device structure. A fundamental
innovation is the development of a unique carrier selective contact that can be
fabricated at low temperatures with simple, earth-abundant technology. In
addition to its advantage of simple processing and high efficiency, other
advantages include the use of lower cost silicon substrates, and low-cost local
manufacture without toxic by-products. Because of the simplicity of the
fabrication, including module fabrication, this technology can be rapidly
scaled. Because modules made using this technology will also be substantially
lighter in weight than conventional modules, they may also provide another
market opportunity by substantially reducing the installation costs.
