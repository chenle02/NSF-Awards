In this project the PI will investigate the hypothesis that there is a
fundamental set of nanoscale physical and biochemical properties that serve as
the primary cues for the re-establishment of cell systems that rely on
nanofibrillar scaffolds in their native environment, and they will use an
integrated approach for their investigation. A novel investigative tool,
scanning probe recognition microscopy, will be used in concert with state of the
art immunocytochemistry, fluorescent microscopy and blot techniques in an
integrated physics-cell biology effort that links the physical properties at the
nanoscale with important cellular responses. Results from this research are
likely to have a major impact on regenerative medicine aimed at recreating the
neural cell system following central nervous system injury. Furthermore, as cell
systems that are influenced by scaffold-based environments are ubiquitous
throughout the body, identification of the fundamental set of nanoscale
properties that promote healthy neural cell physiology and function, serves as
the basis for the quantitative exploration of other regenerative cell-scaffold
systems. The research program will be realized with active student
participation. Regular exchange visits, joint training, and regular
communication, with evaluation and dissemination of results, will contribute to
the multidisciplinary training. The proposed pipeline program for the
introduction of traditionally underrepresented undergraduates within the
research, in collaboration with the mentored MI-LSAMP and RISE programs, will
build on the PI,s successful experiences with both.
