General Summary

Does the use of a top-two primary electoral system alter voters' political
knowledge, interest in politics and vote choices. The 2016 top-two primary in
California provides an opportunity to understand whether voters in California
are behaving differently in the primary election or the general election because
of their unusual primary election system. The PIs use a panel survey evaluate
whether voters are more informed about politics, are getting their information
from different sources, are thinking strategically about their primary and
general ballots, and in general are likely to vote differently because of the
electoral reform. The panel survey matches a set of California voters to a set
of national voters at two points in time (immediately after the June primary and
then again after the November general election). This strategy allows the PIs to
examine to what extent California voters are behaving differently than voters
across the nation but will also let us know to what extent their behavior
changes between the primary and general election. We are particularly interested
in whether the primary election laws cause voters to become more informed about
opposite party candidates.

Technical Summary There is limited evidence that the top-two primary electoral
reform has altered voters' choices and electoral outcomes. This project compares
a large scale survey California registered voters to a nationally representative
sample of registered voters. Previous surveys have captured snapshots of voter
behavior from contested top-two congressional or California legislative races,
but until now it has not been possible to evaluate voter behavior where all
statewide voters are participating in a contest where a likely outcome is a co-
partisan general election contest. Specifically, this project evaluates the
effect of the top-two primary on voter behavior and attitudes as related to
political knowledge and moderation of vote choice. This project addresses the
theoretical relationship between electoral system, political knowledge and vote
choice.
