Although netlib has been highly successful in making mathematical software
easily available to the numerical research community, the research
infrastructure of this community and of the broader scientific community
(researchers and educators who are not experts in numerical analysis but who
have a need to use numerical scientific software) could benefit from an
expansion of netlib services. This award will address the needs and tools to be
developed in the following areas: 1. Use Notification; 2. Reconfigurable
Repository Views; 3. Resolution of User Interest Profiles with Software
Classification; 4. Incorporation of Developing Web Technologies; and 5. Tools
and Procedures for Submission Evaluation. Netlib continues to be a valuable
resource for the timely dissemination of software to the research community. The
large body of users of netlib and other software repositories provides a ready-
made environment for getting rapid feedback on new services. Although the
proposed tasks can be accomplished with current technologies and tools, Web
technologies currently being developed look promising not only for improving our
basic service of distributing software but also for enhancing netlib's services.
