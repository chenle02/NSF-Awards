The major scientific objective of this proposed four-year study is to
understand the coupled ocean mixed layer-ice system response to the passage of
atmospheric storms. The most intense surface cooling and wind stresses in the
Arctic are associated with these storms, and their long-term cumulative effects
on the heat and water budgets for the Arctic Ocean cannot be predicted without
including (i) realistic mixed layer physics, (ii) ice thermodynamics, and (iii)
three-dimensional wind-driven ocean circulation. The investigator has shown in
previous work that oceanic instabilities may lead to significant deep oceanic
convection and possible formation of bottom water. The initial energy source to
trigger these instabilities may be provided by transient atmospheric forcing.
Numerical models will be developed including a three-dimensional simulation of
the upper ocean (temperature, salinity, circulation, and ice) response to
passage of atmospheric storms. This numerical model will consist of an existing
ocean primitive equation model with embedded turbulence-closure mixed layer and
an ice model with realistic thermodynamics and mechanical properties. The
embedded mixed layer will include previously-neglected physics to predict the
onset of conditional instabilities and possible formation of deep water. The
realistic prediction of deep convection is necessary to understand the start of
the global conveyor belt and the role of the oceans in climate change. A major
deficiency in earlier ocean models has been the lack of adequate convection
physics to realistically predict the correct temperature and salinity properties
for the convectively-produced deeper water masses. The proposed modeling
program, including realistic storm forcing and realistic ocean convection will
directly tie atmospheric forcing and ice thermodynamics to mixed layer dynamics
and the start of the global conveyor belt in the Greenland-Iceland Seas. The
results will lead to more realistic parameterization of subgri d scale
convection of heat, mass, momentum, nutrients and tracers in basin and global
oceanic models.
