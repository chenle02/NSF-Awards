OCE-0245278&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing the need for international
coordination of ocean carbon observations, the SCOR-IOC Advisory Panel on Ocean
CO2 and the IGBP-IHDP-WCRP Global Carbon Project have initiated a collaborative
Pilot Project to (1) gather information about on-going and planned ocean carbon
observation activities, (2) identify gaps and duplications in ocean carbon
observations, (3) produce recommendations that optimize resources and highlight
potential scientific benefits of a coordinated observation program, and (4)
promote the integration of ocean carbon observations with appropriate
atmospheric and/or terrestrial carbon activities. The information gathered
through this collaborative process will be posted on a new Web site devoted to
making the information accessible to scientists and policymakers worldwide.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first activity of the Pilot Project will be a workshop
to bring together individuals from different countries who make and use ocean
carbon observations, to discuss coordination of underway pCO2 measurements and
repeat hydrographic sections, and begin discussions of how these observations
can contribute to ocean carbon modeling and research activities. This proposal
is to fund the partial or full expenses for 50 individuals to participate in the
workshop and to disseminate the results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
