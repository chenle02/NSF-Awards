Being the terminus for stellar evolution, white dwarfs are important in
astronomy. Their existence as remnants of previous generations of stars makes
them convenient probes of the formation of massive stars back to the birth of
the disk of our Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, their structure is well defined:
if their chemical compositions and masses are specified, their radii become
determined. In this work the Principal Investigator (PI) will combine his
efforts with two collaborators; their joint effort will be a collaborative NSF
supported venture. The three PI's will complete a survey of white dwarfs in
widely spaced double stars. The companions of these stars are on the main
sequence, and their radial velocities, apparent brightnesses, and colors will
permit accurate estimates of the masses and luminosities of the white dwarfs.
High resolution spectra will be obtained of these objects in order to estimate
the surface chemical compositions and magnetic field strengths. When completed,
this study is expected to permit the compilation of the most accurate and
homogeneous physical parameters for white dwarfs to date.
