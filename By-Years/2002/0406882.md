Recent multi-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic
magnetized collisionless plasmas demonstrated a new robust particle energization
mechanism, called the Diamagnetic Relativistic Pulse Accelerator (DRPA).
Subsequent simulations suggest that DRPA reproduces many unique signatures of
cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including their diverse and complex light
curves, spectra and spectral evolution. If confirmed, this new idea suggests
that GRBs are caused by magnetic-dominated, rather than hydrodynamic,
explosions. This research will expand and focus PIC simulations, to construct
relations between observable GRB quantities and test them with astronomical
data. Current and future GRB databases will then be used to investigate
progenitor and cosmological questions, including the origin of ultra-high-energy
cosmic rays. This work will lead to new initiatives in particle acceleration,
both cosmic and in the laboratory, and will stimulate new research on the
interaction of ultra-strong magnetic fields with strong gravity in general
relativity. PIC simulations can also be converted into attractive animation
products for education and scientific entertainment.
