Miller 9505170 The proposed research deals with various aspects of geometric
partial differential equations. Linear elliptic differential operators, gauge
field equations, and Yang-Mills-Higgs equations are among the topics to be
pursued. Methods from topology, geometry and analysis are to be employed:
variational techniques, moduli space techniques, and index theory are to be
applied to tackle these partial differential equations. The proposed research
may have consequences in smooth manifold theory by uncovering new topological
invariants of manifolds. Gauge fields arise naturally in theoretical physics as
attempts to unify basic forces of nature. Yang-Mills-Higgs equations have
applications in early universe physics and the theory of galactic formation.
