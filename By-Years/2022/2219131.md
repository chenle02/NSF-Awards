Tissue engineering is a thought-provoking concept made compelling by the need to
replace failed, damaged, or defective body parts. Unlike the more mature field
of traditional medical-device development (e.g., joint replacement), tissue
engineering is young and evolving. This project can thus change the established
tissue-engineering paradigm to not only address the development of healthy
tissue (associated with healing) but simultaneously address the need to inhibit
bacterial colonization (associated with infection). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
convergent team of researchers with expertise in microbiology, polymer science,
biomaterials science, computational chemistry, veterinary medicine, and medical-
device development will develop a new and flexible approach to infection control
within a resorbable scaffold for tissue engineering. The research plan
encorporates three synergistic research thrusts which will converge around a
specific testbed, namely a new scaffold designed to regrow hard tissue that
simultaneously resists bacterial colonization. To mimic the extracellular
matrix, Thrust 1 will exploit 3D printing to additively create fiber-based
scaffolds with controllable fiber size/spacing using combinations of resorbable
polymers together with signaling factors to influence stem-cell differentiation.
Thrust 2, using synergistic computational and experimental approaches, will
explore fundamental concepts of polyelectrolyte complexation and directed self-
assembly to render these scaffolds self-defensive (able to release
antimicrobials only if, when, and where there is a bacterial challenge). Thrust
3 will employ lab-on-a-chip concepts to understand the competition between
mammalian cells and bacteria and, in Phase 2 of project, include small-animal
infection models able to recapitulate a complex physiological
response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
