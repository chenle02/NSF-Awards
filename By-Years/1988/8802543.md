This zero dollar contract with Air New Zealand has been negotiated to provide
Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) on the National Science Foundation's
LC-130 aircraft. The aircraft undergo a yearly overhaul, and the ability to have
this maintenance performed in Christchurch, New Zealand, will enhance the
capability of VXE-6 to accomplish its mission in the Antarctic Program. Since
the majority of the yearly flying is done in and around Christchurch and
Antarctica, having maintenance capability close to the source of heavy flight
operations will allow more flexibility in the scheduling of yearly maintenance.
This contract provides aircraft maintenance support to the program and will be
administered, including distributions of funds, by the U.S. Navy - Fleet Air
Western Pacific Repair Activity in Atsugi Japan. The program manager recommends
awarding of this action.
