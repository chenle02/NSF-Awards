The goal of this research is to develop a computer-aided design system that can
create hybrids of existing designs, or stated more accurately, can interpolate
between existing designs. We see evidence of interpolation in many designed
artifacts. "Mountain bikes," for example, result from an interpolation of off-
road motorcycles and standard road bicycles. While still fundamentally a
bicycle, motorcycle features like raised handlebars and knobby tires
dramatically alter the functionality. Pedal-assisted mopeds, on the other hand,
are more toward the motorcycle end of the spectrum. To create a CAD system with
such capabilities, the interpolation operations will be formalized, a
sufficiently limited experimental design domain will be chosen, adequate
representations that facilitate the operations will be determined, and a system
implementation will be developed.
