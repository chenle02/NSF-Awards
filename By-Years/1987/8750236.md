Lyndon State College will acquire modern computer work stations that analyze
and display real-time weather data--radiosonde sounding, weather maps, and
satellite pictures--for classroom instruction, operational forecasting and
student projects. EAch work station will consist of an IBM PC/AT personal
computer, high resolution EGA color monitor, and appropriate computer upgrades
(e.g. memory expansion, color graphics card, etc.), which will be consistent
with meteorological data supplied by the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research through its Unidata program. These work stations will familiarize
students with modern equipment and greatly improve their three-dimensional
perception of atmospheric conditions. They will thus improve undergraduate
education in meteorology, as well as weather data dissemination to the local
community.
