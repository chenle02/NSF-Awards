9712227 Fish The proposed research effort develops an experimentally calibrated
mutiscale modeling approach for composite materials and structures aimed at
accurately predicting the macromechanical (overall) structural response, such as
critical deformation, vibration and buckling modes, as well as various failure
modes on the mesomechanical (lamina) level, such as delamination and ply
buckling, and on the micromechanical (the scale of microconstituents) level,
such as debonding, microbuckhng, etc. Adaptive multiscale modeling approach
developed in this research enables the analyst to start from a simple model,
based on the classical step-by-step uncoupled approach, which may or may not
adequately simulate the response, and then adaptively refine both the
mathematical and numerical models to permit coupled multiscale ccisiderations,
whenever and wherever these are needed. ***
