This research has as its objective the pursuit of new directions for empirical
models of exchange rate and the consumption side of current account behavior.
Specifically, Dr. Finn will investigate, at an empirical level, whether the
possible non-neutrality and non- superneutrality of money significantly affects
the dynamics of the exchange rate and consumption relationships. The study will
employ the generalized-method-of-moments estimation technique and data on a
number of different economies. This research should promote our understanding of
exchange rate and current account determination. The interactive activities
consist of teaching two one-semester undergraduate courses in International
Trade and International Finance, leading a number of seminars for graduate
students of macroeconomics, and participating in weekly workshops in monetary
theory and macroeconomics and in international economics. This project furthers
VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to
advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported
by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in sience and engineering by
providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in
industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future scientific vitality.
