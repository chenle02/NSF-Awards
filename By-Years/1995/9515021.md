9515021 Artuso This Career Advancement Award supports a program to design and
produce read out electronics for a particle- physics detector. The devices
developed will be used in the CLEO detector in a research program to study the
properties of B mesons. The P.I. will enhance her competence in microelectronics
techniques to improve her ability to make important contributions in future
experiments. ***
