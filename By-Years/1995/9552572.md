9552572 Fonteyn San Francisco State University is collaborating with MESA of
California to replicate the Mission Science Workshop (MSW) model for informal
science education to establish 10 self-supporting interactive Community Science
Workshops (CSW's) throughout California. The overriding theme for activities at
the CSW's is to let children and parents "be" scientists as they explore through
the use of interactive exhibits, hands-on building/tinkering activities and
content workshops, while at the same time ensuring they learn correct science
concepts. Content to be presented is from the areas of Engineering, Life
Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Mathematics. The target audience is primarily
African-American, Latino, and Native American children in grades K-8 and their
families.
