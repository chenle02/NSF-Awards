&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Drs. Elaine Seaver and Mark Q. Martindale
of the University of Hawaii to investigate fundamental features of the
development of pivotal representatives from the protostome branch of the tree of
life. Prostostomes constitute more than one million of the 1.7 million extant
described species of organisms, including familiar animals such as mollusks,
insects, flatworms, roundworms, and many others of medical and economic
importance. However, relationships among these groups are still highly debated,
so the backbone of the animal tree of life cannot currently be proposed without
a large degree of uncertainty. This proposal will integrate and disseminate the
broadest possible collection of information on selected representative
protostomes to address questions of their origin and evolution over more than
540 million years. In order to do this we will integrate anatomical data on
extant and extinct fauna with developmental data using cell-lineage studies and
broad-based genomic information. These data will be collected for a large pool
of protostome species which will be studied at a level never before attempted in
non-model organisms.&lt;br/&gt; The awarded grant will contribute to the
training of students at different academic levels, emphasizing on those of
underrepresented groups in science. Results will be disseminated to society
through partnership with five of the most prominent natural history museums in
the world, including the Harvard Museum of Natural History and the American
Museum of Natural History in the USA, and the most important museums in
Australia and Denmark. It is also the intention of the PI to publish an article
in non-specialist scientific magazines for a broad lay
audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
