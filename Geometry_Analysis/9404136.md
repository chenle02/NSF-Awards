9404136 Katok The scope of research entails the study of the dynamics of Anovsov
actions via hyperbolic automorphisms and spanning sets for automorphic forms on
symmetric spaces. Another component of the reseach is number-theoretic in nature
and entails the study of non-holomorphic Maass-Hecke cusp forms over Heegner
points. ***
