This award will provide three year support for the University of Notre Dame High
Energy Physics Group to continue its exploration of the energy frontier with
accelerator-based experiments, particularly the D0 experiment at Fermilab and
the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Besides extensive hardware contributions and
detector commissioning and operations, the physics objectives of the Notre Dame
program are broad and will exploit the available data to study top physics,
electroweak bosons W and Z, QCD processes, and to search for evidence of
electroweak symmetry breaking and other new phenomena. The educational
objectives are not only to train postdoctoral researchers, graduate and
undergraduate students to be particle physics professionals but, in addition, to
make significant efforts to engage non-traditional participants, high school
teachers and high school students, in immersive research experiences at the
scientific frontier. This award will provide support for innovative outreach
activities and allow the Notre Dame group to maintain its leadership in outreach
programs. It is one of the four institutions leading the QuarkNet project, hosts
one of the Education Leaders in the Interactions In Understanding the Universe
(I2U2) project, and provides support for the USCMS Education and Outreach
Coordinator.
