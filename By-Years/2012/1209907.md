This award provides base support for the group to continue to participate in the
Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) program to search for neutrino-less double beta
decay in 136-Xenon, a nuclear process which could hold clues into the nature of
neutrinos. Observation of this decay would imply that neutrinos are Majorana
particles, i.e. their own antiparticles, with profound implications on our
understanding of the pattern of masses of fundamental particles and of the
structure and evolution of the early universe.

The EXO-200 experiment, a 200-kg enriched liquid xenon detector is now running
underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico. This group
will also take part in the development and design of a more sensitive tonne-
scale EXO experiment (full-EXO) to follow EXO-200. With the planned research at
UMass, the group will provide key input to the design of a full-EXO experiment
with sensitivity to neutrino masses as small as 10 meV by: i) optimizing the
optical response and VUV detection efficiency of the detector, and ii) supplying
a single Barium ion source, a possibly game-changing tool for the realization of
the EXO-specific background suppression scheme which looks for the appearance of
Barium ions following 136-Xe double beta decay.

Broader Impacts: Noble liquid detectors are finding applications in medical
imaging devices as well as in remote monitoring of nuclear power plant fuel
composition. The ultra-low background methods developed for detectors like
EXO-200 have taken radioactive contamination to levels considered impossible to
achieve just twenty years ago. Processes of interest for the electronics
industry now require similar levels of radio-purity in their manufacturing
lines. Work with EXO-200 and EXO provides ample opportunities for graduate
students to perform cutting edge research and experience working in a medium-
sized international scientific collaboration.
