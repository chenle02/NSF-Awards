The pendulum in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research has periodically swung
from so called "neat" or mathematically rigorous approaches, and "scruffy" or
more adhoc approaches. In recent years, real-world data across varied fields of
science and engineering are increasingly complex, and involve a large number of
variables, which has resulted in a surge of scruffier methods. This proposal
develops a general "neat" framework for such modern settings by leveraging state
of the art developments in two of the most popular subfields of machine learning
methods: graphical models and high-dimensional statistical methods. These
developments have in common that a complex model parameter is expressed as a
superposition of simple components, which is then leveraged for tractable
inference and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our unified framework results not
only in a unified picture of these developments but also provides newer methods
to work with such high-dimensional data. The research thus impacts problems
across science and engineering wherever statistical machine learning approaches
are being used (such as genomics, natural language processing and image
analysis, to name a few). The work on a unified framework for statistical
machine learning problems is highly coupled with a push for imparting training
to students on what we call "comptastical" thinking. This combines both
computational and statistical thinking required for addressing the problems of
limited computation and limited data inherent in modern statistical AI
application domains. The proposal also develops an infrastructure for component-
based courses with relationally organized lecture module components.
