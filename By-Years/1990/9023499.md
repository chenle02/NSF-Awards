This award supports the research of Professor J. Shalika to work in automorphic
functions. He intends to work on applications of the double trace formula to
forms on GSp(4). He also intends to work on generalizations of the Rankin-
Selberg method. Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle
of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus long
realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their
basic nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole
numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its
historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
