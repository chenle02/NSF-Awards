Title: HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS OF CONSERVATION LAWS

ABSTRACT:

This research addresses fundamental issues in the theory of hyperbolic systems
of conservation laws, in one or more space dimensions. The project also includes
the analysis of some new physical models of nonlinear wave propagation, and
applications to the theory of differential games.

For systems of equations in two or three space dimensions, the P.I. will study
basic problems concerning the existence and stability of solutions, in suitable
functional spaces. A major goal will be the description of singularities
determined by the focusing of nonlinear waves in radially symmetric solutions,
and the understanding of oscillation effects, arising from transport phenomena
with highly irregular velocity fields. The P.I. also plans to develop new
mathematical techniques for the analysis of non-linear waves, described by a
class of integro-differential equations. The theoretical results will be
complemented by some rigorous studies on the performance of computational
algorithms, for solutions containing shock waves.

Phenomena related to the propagation of waves can be found nearly everywhere in
nature, and are of great importance in science and engineering. Non-linear
effects are responsible for changes in the shape of the waves, and allow what is
mathematically described as "singularity formation". In practice, this means
that waves can break, such as sea waves rolling up along a beach or shock waves
forming at the passage of a supersonic airplane. In two or three space
dimensions, the singularities can be even more dramatic because of "focusing"
effects, producing a high concentration of energy near a single point. This is
exemplified by an optical lens, concentrating sun rays at a single spot. In the
numerical computation of solutions, the loss of regularity due to wave breaking
is a considerable source of difficulties, because it can greatly reduce the
accuracy of computer algorithms.

This research project is concerned with mathematical models describing the
propagation of nonlinear waves. Its main goal is to understand the formation and
the evolution of singularities, in one or more space dimensions. Particular
attention will be given at specific equations of physical significance, such as
one describing waves in a liquid crystal. The research will also address some
issues related to numerical computation. In particular, the P.I.~will study the
effectiveness of discrete approximations, in case of solutions containing shock
waves. Moreover, work will begin on the design of algorithms that can
automatically recognize the location of shock fronts, with the eventual goal of
producing more efficient computational codes.
