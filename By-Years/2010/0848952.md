This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
methods for the control of larval settlement, metamorphosis and postlarval
growth of Megathura crenulata (keyhole limpet) to support the production of
commercial quantities of Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH), a unique and medically
valuable marine natural product. Unlike many other prospective medical products
from marine organisms, KLH is already in extensive use in over 20 KLH-based
therapeutic vaccine trials. Phase I research successfully identified a critical
"cue" for settlement of M. crenulata larvae and demonstrated the feasibility of
achieving the long-term commercial objectives of this research. Phase II studies
will translate the results from Phase I studies into prototype designs for
testing and optimization of systems, diets and aquaculture methods for
cultivation of the age-specific developmental phases, from metamorphosis to
fully developed adults for KLH production.

The broader impacts of this research are; 1) The elucidation of the underlying
biochemical factors that promote settlement, metamorphosis and early postlarval
survival of this carnivorous gastropod thus adding significantly to the body of
scientific knowledge in this field and improving the potential for cultivation
of other commercially important species with biomedical potential; 2) Providing
sustainable commercial supplies of KLH for new, life-saving therapeutic vaccines
for cancer, arthritis, hypertension, and other debilitating diseases, without
continued dependence on the limited and threatened fishery, and; 3) Providing
regulators and resource managers the opportunity to formulate management
policies to protect the wild population without imposing limitations on KLH or
the important KLH-based vaccines under development.
