This project is directed at studying Cohen-Macaulay rings and algebras, and
effectively computing their invariants. Its aims are to uncover and extend the
role of Koszul homology in the structure theory of Cohen-Macaulay singularities;
to investigate the structure of the algebras of linear type; to examine the
equations of symbolic power algebras; to study the invariants and singularities
of commuting varieties of Lie algebras and their representations; and to develop
methods and algorithms that allow for very large scale computations in
commutative algebra. This research is in the general area of commutative algebra
and the computer-aided computational aspects of this field. There is a growing
interest in using computers to answer theoretical questions. This project makes
serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic calculations to solve
real problems in commutative algebra.
