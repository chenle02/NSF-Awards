Liquefaction of saturated sands and silty sands during seismic events has been
responsible for many failures of civil engineering structures, resulting in high
costs both in loss of life and property. In light of this, geotechnical
engineers have investigated methods to evaluate the liquefaction potential of
soil deposits. These studies have primarily focused on sands, as compared to
silts and silty sands, although the latter materials are known to liquefy.
Because of the variability and lack of repeatability often found in standard
penetration test results, there has been a growing move toward other types of in
situ tests for the evaluation of liquefaction potential. One of the most
promising tools is the cone penetrometer. A major void in the state of knowledge
for liquefaction evaluation of potential sites is the use of the cone
penetrometer for assessing silty sand sites. This research program will
investigate the use of a cone penetrometer in the evaluation of the liquefaction
potential of sands and silty sands using both laboratory tests and calibration
chamber tests. The work will be broken into two phases, with the first dealing
with the issue of effects of fines, per se, on penetration resistance. The
second will involve saturated silty sands. The senior principal investigator is
internationally recognized for his research into the liquefaction of soils. The
junior principal investigator is starting his career and displays the talent and
aptitude necessary to contribute strongly to this project. Together they are
highly qualified to undertake the research proposed, and they have available the
necessary institutional facilities. This research program is very likely to make
a significant contribution to determining in-situ the liquefaction potential of
silty sands.
