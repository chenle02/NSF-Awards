This research project makes important methodological and substantive
contributions to our understanding of business regulation. Methodologically,
most of the sizable literature on regulatory behavior assumes that the regulator
is a "first-mover" in the regulatory setting and is able to commit to incentive
mechanisms which induce the regulated firm to truthfully reveal its private
information or undertake costly hidden actions. This project examines regulatory
price and standard setting where regulators are often unwilling or unable to
make credible commitments to specific regulatory actions or policies.
Substantively, the research provides new insights into technology-forcing
standards. Technology-forcing regulations are those in which the agency writes a
standard that is costly, or even impossible to meet using current technology.
This is an important and interesting class of problems because technology-
forcing standard setting is used in environmental regulation, regulation of
product and occupational safety, and regulation of product efficacy and
durability. The project focuses on the effects of limited regulatory commitment
on sequential equilibrium pricing and investment strategies by regulated firms.
First technology-forcing regulation is studied in a standard setting context.
The incentives for the firm to invest in new compliance technologies and the
intertemporal evolution of standards are emphasized. Second, the project
considers a model of price regulation in which the regulator determines the
firm's rate structure after it has made its investment in capital. Third, the
effects of regulatory commitment on the quality of service are studied.
