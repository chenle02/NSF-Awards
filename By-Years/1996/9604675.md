Rapid kinetic analyses are essential for biochemical research Important
information on the mechanism and regulation of enzymes, the mechanism of
interaction between proteins and nucleic acids, and on the binding of signal
transduction molecules (i.e., ligands) to receptor proteins can be derived from
the use of stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Most enzymes have turnover numbers
between 1 and 106 s-1, which implies that the rate constants for the reactions
between intermediates will be usually greater than 1 s-1 and that each step will
take less than 1 second to occur. In this proposal we will detail the use of
rapid stopped-flow spectrophotometry for the investigation of specific
biochemical reactions and the development of a Rapid Kinetics Analysis Center
that will facilitate its use and be capable of upgrading the instrumentation.
