The objective of this research is to study the homogeneity of segmental mixing
in polymer blends in which a small number of interacting groups are responsible
for miscibility. Although specific interaction has proven to be very effective
in promoting miscibility, there are still unresolved questions about the
molecular picture of the state of segmental intermixing. Based on preliminary
results, diffusional probes to study segment mobility in these blends will be
used because the diffusion of a small molecule in polymers involves the
cooperative motion of only a small number of segments and provides information
about the degree of mixing on a scale smaller than that associated with the
glass-transition phenomenon. CP/MAS carbon-13 NMR studies will be carried out in
parallel with diffusion experiments. This method offers the advantage in being
able to determine the relaxation responses of each component in the blend
independently and should provide answers to the disposition of segments of
otherwise immiscible polymers brought together by a small number of interacting
groups.
