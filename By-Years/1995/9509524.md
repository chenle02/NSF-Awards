9509524 Graham The flowering plant genus Cuphea is the largest member of the
loosestrife family, the Lythraceae, with about 250 species. It is a significant
component of neotropical herbaceous vegetation, especially in Mexico and South
America where it occurs in areas of major environmental and biological concern.
The genus is currently the focus of biotechnological research into the
mechanisms of fatty acid synthesis, and is under development as a new oilseed
source. Specialized floral and vegetative characters of Cuphea, such as the
large, irregular, red flower tubes that attract hummingbirds in the mountains of
western Mexico and the heath-like plants with minute rolled leaves in the rocky
campos of Brazil, provide exceptional character syndromes for studying
evolutionary diversification and adaptation. The projected research by Dr.
Shirley Graham of Kent State University will test hypotheses about the evolution
of selected characters and the frequency of geographic dispersal events that
have been important in the species radiation of this large, diverse genus.
Funding will support preparation of a modern taxonomic monoraph of Cuphea. The
new monograph will be exceptional for its depth of coverage by inclusion of
floral, vegetative, pollen, chromosome, seed oil composition, reproductive and
distributonal data. The extensive database will be analyzed cladistically, to
reconstruct probably phylogenetic relationships, elucidate patterns of character
change, increase understanding of the history of plant distribution in the New
World, and provide a framework for a new natural classification. The largest
section of the genus will be revised taxonomically in a collaboration with a
young Brazilian specialist in Lythraceae, and the monograph will be made
available electronically via World Wide Web and in published hard copy.
