9306751 Lifschitz The goal of this research is to develop and study high-level
declarative languages designed specifically for describing action and change.
The available methods for representing properties of actions in logic will be
characterized as translations from high- level languages into monotonic or
nonmonotonic logic-based formalisms. The claims that these methods are adequate
will be stated as soundness or completeness properties of the corresponding
translations, and the validity of these claims will be investigated. Methods for
describing nondeterministic actions will be developed, and their adequacy will
be investigated in a similar way. Competing methods (using different ontologies
of action or different nonmonotonic logics) will be compared by studying the
high-level languages to which they are applicable. Translation of high-level
action languages into traditional programming languages will also be studied.
This will allow the application of software tools developed for program
verification to the automation of some forms of common sense reasoning.
