Professor Qin will work in the general area of algebraic geometry and its
interplay with representation theory and string theory. The main tools are the
Hilbert schemes of points on projective surfaces, techniques of vertex algebras,
quantum cohomology, the moduli spaces of Gieseker semistable bundles on
surfaces, and the holomorphic Casson invariants for Calabi-Yau three folds. The
investigation should increase the knowledge about the relations among Hilbert
schemes, vertex algebras and quantum cohomology, and shed light on stable
bundles over Calabi-Yau three folds and the S-duality conjecture from physics in
the form formulated by Vafa and Witten.

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects described by polynomial equations.
It has been at the central stage of recent confluence between mathematics and
physics. Many of these interactions have led to profound improvement in the
understanding of both mathematics and physics. Professor Qin's research areas
provide solid mathematical foundation to the physics theories which are vital to
explain the universe.
