Hybrid systems are characterized by non-trivial interactions between discrete
(digital) and continuous (analog) components. A typical example is a digital
controller in an analog environment, e.g., a micro-controller in a car or plane.
The correct behavior of the system depends critically on the interaction between
the controller and its environment. The purpose of this project is to develop
algorithms that automatically determine the correctness of such systems using a
state exploration technique called Model Checking.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although several methods for hybrid system model checking
have been proposed and implemented in research tools, the applications reported
in the literature are usually handcrafted examples carefully constructed to
illustrate the concepts. The goals of this project are to: (i) develop a new
graph-based technique for hybrid system model checking; (ii) develop new methods
that combine the power of SAT solvers - which have been successful in hardware
verification - with tools for handling continuous variables; and (iii) perform
extensive empirical studies to evaluate the relative strengths of several
methods for hybrid system verification, including the ones developed in this
project, using a set of new extensible benchmark problems (A navigation problem
for autonomous vehicles, a leak detection algorithm for pressurized gas
pipelines, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
