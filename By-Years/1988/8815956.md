This award will support a seminar, "Earthquake Resistant Design of Reinforced
Concrete Beam-Column Joints," organized jointly by Prof. James O. Jirsa of the
University of Texas, Austin, and Prof. Hiroyuki Aoyama of the University of
Tokyo, Japan. Participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii, from May 24 to 26,
1989, to report results of research programs under way in both the U.S. and
Japan, and to discuss the implications of those results to the design of
structures. In this meeting structure designers have been invited in addition to
pure earthquake researchers, in order to facilitate rapid transfer of
conclusions into practice, and to assist in the evaluation of research data. The
seminar will bring together researchers in the field from the U.S. and Japan,
with some observers from both countries and from New Zealand. Thus, continuity
with several earlier joint seminars involving participants from those countries
with the strongest efforts in the field, viz. the U.S., Japan, and New Zealand,
is assured. This seminar will concentrate on the previously little-con- sidered
problem of beam-to-column connections, and will be important, therefore, in
assisting the rapid development and utilization of techniques for earthquake
resistant, reinforced-concrete construction.
