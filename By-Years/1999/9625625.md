9625625 Ritter The tribochemical deposition of ceramic surface films on ceramic
substrates will be explored under an SGER award. Initial studies will involve
ambient temperature rubbing of alumina substrates by sapphire balls in various
gaseous atmospheres. The resulting films will be characterized for growth rate,
microstructure, composition, adhesion, and strength.
