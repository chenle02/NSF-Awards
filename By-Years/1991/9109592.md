Filament winding is an efficient method for manufacturing large, high-
performance composite shells and structures. The research will investigate the
use of infrared heating to continuously-cure filament-wound composite structures
as they are being wound onto a mandrel or preform. Fundamental to proving the
viability of this novel process is understanding the radiative heat transfer
upon the winding's surface and its affect upon the resin's cure kinetics,
optical characteristics, and mechanical properties. To this end, these
characteristics will be measured and a thermo- mechanical model will be
developed to describe the concurrent winding-curing process. "Proof-of-
Principle" experiments will be conducted using pilot-scale infrared oven with
thermal imaging equipment with a bench-scale filament-winder. Comparisons will
be made as to the efficiency of continuous curing versus batch curing. In the
event that manufacturers are interested in commercializing this technology,
process procedures and design guidelines will be developed.
