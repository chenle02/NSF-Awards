This work will investigate several polyimide precursors to choose one which will
be directly imagable by electron beams and which will be a dielectric with
properties suitable for use in the semiconductor industry. Phase I research
demonstrated that a polyimide precursor can be made a negative or a positive
resist, and the sensitivity can be enhanced, by the addition of a small
percentage of a polymeric additive. One positive- and two negative-acting
polyimide resists will be studied during Phase II to provide an explanation for
this effect. This information will be used to improve the properties of one
material. Integrated circuit process tests which include thickness and
uniformity of coatings, adhesion tests, and thermal stability will be performed.
Lithographic properties (electron beam sensitivity and resolution) and
dielectric properties (resistivity, dielectric strength, dielectric constant,
and dissipation factor) will be tested.
