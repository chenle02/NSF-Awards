Work to be done continues a program developing the function theory on domains
in n-dimensional complex space using the language of metric geometry. Recent
progress made in the theories of Hardy spaces, Nevanlinna theory, boundary
limits along curves and the theories of Lipschitz and Bloch spaces has provided
considerable impetus to the directions this mathematical research will take. In
particular studies of the Lusin area integral and other aspects of harmonic
analysis will be carried out using the metric geometry approach. The long-term
goal of this work is to develop a unified theory for boundary behavior of
holomorphic functions in all dimensions in which the unifying language is that
of Riemannian geometry. Specific topics to be undertaken include investigations
into mapping properties of the Lusin area integral for strongly pseudoconvex
regions using newly defined approach regions and a study of the regularity for
the d-bar problem - a first order partial differential equation. The latter
concerns extremely delicate norm estimates which cannot be achieved in
conventional function spaces. New spaces will have to be developed to obtain
sharp results. Additional work will be carried out to establish whether or not
certain rigidity must occur in holomorphic vector-valued maps which exhibit
higher order contact with the image domain. Such results are false in one
complex dimension but considerable evidence exists suggesting that the situation
is different in higher dimensions. Continuing efforts will also be made to
understand the structure of automorphism groups of biholomorphic maps between
domains. Powerful results show how these maps extend holomorphically across
boundaries of strongly pseudoconvex regions. The next logical step will be to
consider weakly pseudoconvex regions, especially those of finite type, to
determine the extent of such analytic continuations.
