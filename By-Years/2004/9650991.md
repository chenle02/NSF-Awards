The aim of the project is to give a complete, better and real learning
experience for the undergraduate students in the organic chemistry curriculum by
added instrumentation and computer modeling. Recipe approach to organic
synthesis will be transformed into a discovery approach by the addition of FT-IR
spectrometer, requested through this proposal. The project integrates theory,
computer modeling and FT-IR spectroscopy to give the students a collaborative,
mini-corporate world experience. Students use FT-IR spectroscopy to follow
chemical reactions, identify isomeric mixtures and for structural elucidation of
products of chemical reaction. The theory of IR spectroscopy they learn comes
alive by their personal handling of the IR spectrometer in the organic
laboratory. Students as a team use SIPDE-SPARC approach to design and carry out
their own synthesis; they use FT-IR spectroscopy to learn about quality control
and product development in collaboration with a local industry. The
collaborative, autonomous nature of these projects aided by FT-IR spectrometer
and computer modeling gives the students a glimpse of the real professional
world and prepares them adequately with all the requites of the
cyberspace/virtual reality age.
