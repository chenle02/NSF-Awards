INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This Communicating Research to Public Audiences project from
the University of South Carolina (USC) is based on the ongoing multidisciplinary
investigations of Eugene Karabanov and Douglas Williams (OPP-0229737) in the
Russian Arctic. The scientific objective of the 2003 expedition was to
reconstruct the variability of freshwater discharge and terrestrial carbon flux
to the Artic Ocean from the Lena River during the last 500 to 1,000 years,
improving understanding of the impact of climate change. As part of that
undertaking, the team collected broadcast quality digital video. This project
will interpret the research findings and documentation through collaboration
with EdVenture Children's Museum (ECM) in Columbia, South Carolina. Deliverables
will include: Meet-the-Arctic Scientist programs; Artic Discovery Weekends;
Arctic Discovery Boxes (three hands-on units); and Arctic CyberLoft Experiences.
Content will include the role of the Arctic in global climate change;
watersheds, fresh water systems and ocean circulation; human adaptations and
culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: The CRPA project will share the
results of the research expedition with children and families attending
EdVenture through this university-museum partnership. In addition to visitors
from the six-county Midlands area of South Carolina, the project will reach an
extended audience through an Arctic Science website at USC with links to the
EdVenture site.&lt;br/&gt;
