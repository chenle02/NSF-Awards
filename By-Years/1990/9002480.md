This proposal is to make helium and tritiummeasurements on the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the southeastern Pacific on longitudes
88 and 150 west. These tracers data are used to identify upper ocean formation
processes, and are important in the assessment of ventilation and subduction
mechanisms. These measurements and related tracer observations, along with
hydrographic measurements will form the basis for the ocean circulation
descriptions and models which are the principal objectives of WOCE.
