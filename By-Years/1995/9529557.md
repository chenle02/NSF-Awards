9529557 Bourne This proposal seeks funds to help support an International Summer
School on Macromolecular Crystallographic Computing which is organized under the
auspices on the International Union of Crystallography. This will be the
fourteenth such meeting and will be held at Western Washington University from
August 16-22, 1996. Macromolecular crystallography is concerned with the
accurate determination of the 3-dimensional structure of biological
macromolecules. This is important for a better understanding of biological
function at the molecular level, which in turn leads to advances in medicine
through a better understanding of the cause of disease and the design of new
drugs to combat medical problems. The School will be limited to 150 scientists
and students who will receive lectures and hands-on teaching in the
computational aspects of macromolecular crystallography. This School is
considered especially timely since computing and communication technology in
general, and computing techniques in macromolecular structure solution and
interpretation in particular, are advancing at a rapid rate. A total of $5,000
is sought towards supporting the School. The overall cost of the School is
estimated at $93,000 ***
