9351321 Daniel The project will purchase an FT Infrared instrument for use in
development of a new environmental sciences coop course. The instrument will be
used in eight different laboratories. More than 600 students per year are
expected to use the proposed instrumentation. Implementation of an Environmental
Science degree will require the development of several new laboratory courses as
well as the restructuring of many of our chemistry offerings for Engineers.
Proposed new experiments include kinetic studies over catalysts, the
identification of air, soil and water pollutants, the determination of total
carbon in water and the characterization of industrial raw materials and
industrial waste, as well as traditional compound characterizations. ***
