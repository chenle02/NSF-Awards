The goal of this project is to determine consequences of seed dispersal by
birds to composition and genetic structure of shrubs in a tropical rain forest.
The research involves two phases. The first phase (planning activities) will
determine plant species diversity, seed density, and genetic relatedness of
seeds within droppings from five species of common fruit-eating birds. Seeds
passed by these birds are identifiable and the relatedness of seeds within
droppings can be estimated using starch gel electrophoresis. During phase two
the consequences occurring with related or unrelated seeds to plant survival and
growth will be examined through competition experiments using three light
environments characteristic of tropical rain forests. In tropical rain forests,
most seeds of understory plants are dispersed by birds. This study will be the
first to examine relatedness of seeds in bird droppings and consequences to
plants of having seeds eaten and dispersed by different birds. Information on
genetic and species composition of seeds in droppings of birds (planning
activities) and results from competition experiments (phase two) will be used to
develop models that predict genetic structure and composition of rain forest
shrubs. This research will contribute substantially to understanding tropical
rain forests by testing ecological and evolutionary theories of plant-animal
interactions.
