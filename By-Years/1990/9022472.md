Agitation and air-sparging are necessary for providing oxygen and other
nutrients to dense populations of cultured animal cells. Understanding the
injury of fragile animal cells due to fluid-mechanical forces is an important
issue to the culturing of these cells in bioreactors of various scales and for
various applications. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to investigate
the factors that effect the forces experienced by cells due to bubble break-up.
Bubble-column and agitated bioreactors will be used to study the effect of
operational parameters and medium composition on cell injury. Video microscopy
will be employed to visualize and quantitate some aspects of cell to bubble
interactions. The PI also proposes to investigate sparger and impeller designs
that will allow the sparging and mixing of cells in bioreactors.
