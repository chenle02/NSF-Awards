9731618 Lundeen This work is a continuation of high-resolution spectroscopic
measurements of the structure of high angular momentum Rydberg states of the
helium atom and the hydrogen molecule. The motivation for these studies is to
stimulate and test improvements in fundamental atomic theory, particularly of
few electron systems.
