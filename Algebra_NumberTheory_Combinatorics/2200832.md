Representation theory is a study of symmetries of linear spaces. Going back to
its founders, Frobenius, Schur, Burnside, and Brauer, who first developed the
subject over a century ago, the standard approach is to decompose a linear space
with its symmetry into a sum of "simple ones," and then classify the simple ones
into coherent and (relatively) comprehensible lists and families. The "Atlas of
Finite Groups: Maximal Subgroups and Ordinary Characters for Simple Groups" is a
classical and fundamental example of this strategy in action. In this project,
the PI turns to the study of symmetries which do not subject themselves to such
nice decompositions as in the classical case, which live in the world of "wild"
representation theories. Such theories are ubiquitous in mathematics. They arise
in algebra, topology, math physics, combinatorics, and, of course,
representation theory itself. The PI will employ the new and rapidly developing
subject of tensor triangular geometry, which combines topological, homological,
and categorical techniques, to induce some structure in this wild representation
territory, thus advancing our general understanding of this complicated world of
symmetries. This project will provide research and training opportnities for
undergraduate and graduate students.

In more detail, this projects will advance knowledge in several new directions
within the realm of tensor triangular geometry. It builds on PI's expertise in
support theories in modular settings and branches out to different areas where
the representation theories to be studied differ from the setting of finite
groups in one or more significant aspects. The most interesting is when the
theory is monoidal but not symmetric, such as for small quantum groups and their
Borel subalgebras. Besides quantum groups, the PI will study and develop further
the tensor triangular picture for complex Lie superalgebras, Nichols algebras of
diagonal type, Schur algebras, Frobenius kernels, and finite supergroup schemes.
The PI will also study local properties of some representation categories
associated to Gorenstein algebras and the cohomology of finite dimensional Hopf
and Nichols algebras.
