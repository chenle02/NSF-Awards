This Graduate Research Traineeship award will support five new trainees at the
Georgia Institute of Technology for graduate study leading to a Ph.D. degree
with a specialization in composites. The students will be enrolled in one of the
six participating Schools. The traineeship program being administered through
the Composites Education and Research Center(CERC), a campus-wide facility.
Georgia Tech has considerable depth of expertise in all technical areas related
to composites technology, with very active research programs involving 25
faculty members who are collectively supervising 62 Ph.D. and 51 M.S. students
(about one-half are engaged in composites research) in the various participating
units and have considerable financial support from industry and government.
There are also a large number of composites courses available to students
pursuing a Ph.D. degree in composites. Several of these courses are cross-listed
and are team-taught by faculty from different schools. Seven of these courses
will form a set of required core courses to be taken by all trainees from all
disciplines. %%% Composite materials have extensive potential for use in
aerospace, automotive, recreation, civil structure (highway and bridges), and
telecommunications industries and have been identified in several recent federal
reports as one of the key technologies for the future economic well being of the
United States. A multidisciplinary approach involving expertise in materials
science and engineering mechanics, manufacturing and design is needed for the
full commercial exploitation of these materials. Trainees will be undertaking
research and graduate studies in advanced composite materials.
