This research utilizes complementary phylogenetic and population genetic
information to infer modes of speciation in the cave spider Nesticus. The
nesticid spiders of the Appalachian region are a recently diverged, species-rich
lineage that provides an excellent system for studying both the geographic and
populational contexts of speciation. The sister-species relationships of
Nesticus will be estimated, and in combination with biogeographic evidence from
other cavernicolous clades, will define how historical geology and geomorphology
have influenced patterns of taxonomic diversity. To complete the analysis,
research efforts will be directed at assessing how the population genetic
attributes of the species under study might have influenced the speciational
process. To this end, the ancestral population structure of phylogenetically
defined parental species will be characterized, along with the type of sampling
event which gives rise to daughter species. This historical inference will be
derived from a comparative analysis of the amount, the rate of change, and the
geographic pattern of genetic variation for mtDNA and nuclear DNA genetic
systems.
