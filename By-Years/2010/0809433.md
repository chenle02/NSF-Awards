This award of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports the work of Professor Mark E. Bussell of Western Washington University
(WWU) and Professor Stephanie L. Brock of Wayne State University (WSU) to
develop highly active and sulfur resistant hydrotreating catalysts based on
noble metal phosphides. The properties of the noble metal phosphide catalysts
will be tailored for deep hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of alkyl-substituted
dibenzothiophenes; the removal of these species from crude oil is crucial to the
production of ultra-low sulfur fuels. Monometallic and bimetallic phosphide
catalysts of noble metals dispersed on high surface area silica will be prepared
using the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) method. The catalysts will be
characterized with a variety of bulk and surface sensitive physicochemical
techniques, with the primary goal of these characterization studies being to
facilitate correlation of the bulk and surface chemical properties of these
materials with their deep HDS catalytic properties. To facilitate deeper
understanding of the catalytic properties of the noble metal phosphide catalysts
prepared via TPR, parallel studies will be carried out on oxide-supported,
monodisperse nanoparticles of the same metal phosphides. The proposed research
will build and strengthen collaborative activities between the two
investigators, their students, and scientists at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory. Undergraduate (and M.S. level) students will be involved in all
aspects of the research project at WWU, as will be a doctoral student at WSU.
