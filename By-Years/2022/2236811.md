This project will design and implement an eight-week entrepreneurial program for
approximately 100 participating teams (each consisting of three researchers
within the educational and learning technology field) focused on finding
problem-solution fit and developing a minimum viable product (MVP). The training
and curriculum proposed will be based on teachings from the NSF Innovation Corps
(I-Corps™) program and the Lean Startup pedagogy that focuses on the
identification of a business model. The curriculum will teach value
propositions, stakeholder identification, methods to build customer
relationships, and distribution processes. These educational sessions will be
interspersed with customer discovery activities as well as interviews with
industry experts to expand the teams’ awareness of the educational/commercial
ecosystem. This experience has the potential to provide all teams with the
resources and foundational tools necessary to move their proposed innovations in
learning and technology out of the lab and into the
market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
