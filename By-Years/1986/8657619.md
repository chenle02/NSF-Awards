This research is concerned with dynamical systems. Specifically, it deals with
dynamical systems with inherent uncertainties, especially in the areas of random
vibrations and multiphase flow and in the design of realistic and robust
computational models for the stochastic analysis of engineering systems. It also
addresses reliability-based design of structural and multiphase fluid systems,
applicable to the study of vibrations, the investigation of cumulative damage,
the treatment of waste, and the recovery of petroleum. It furthermore addresses
the performance of dynamical systems which could be significantly affected by
innate uncertainties. This awareness has tended to urge over-design and
conservatism in predictions of system performance, rather than an organized
study of the inherent uncertainties. It is herein proposed to conduct a program
of interdisciplinary research to study the design of stochastic engineering
models that are easily amenable to computational procedures. A fundamental
objective lies in the construction of realistic and robust models for large
classes of dynamical systems for the purpose of determining the effect of input
uncertainties on the output.
