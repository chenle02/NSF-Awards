In this project, the investigators will study the functions of a family of
proteins called calmodulin binding protein 60 (CBP60) in plant defense
signaling. Calmodulin is a small protein that binds calcium ion and regulates
the functions of other proteins by binding to them. Preliminary work in the
reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that two of these proteins, called
CBP60g and CBP60h, play partially-redundant roles in plant defense signaling.
Plants lacking both of these proteins produce greatly reduced amounts of the
important signaling molecule, salicylic acid (SA), in response to pathogen
attack. Consequently, they are more susceptible to a bacterial pathogen. The
major goal of this project is to understand how the CBP60 proteins function to
control activation of defense signaling. There are four main parts to the
project. In the first part, the investigators will define the site of CBP60
protein action within the framework of the plant defense network. In the second
part, altered versions of the CBP60g and CBP60h genes will be constructed and
used to test hypotheses about why the two proteins have slightly different roles
in different aspects of defense signaling. In the third part, proteins that
physically interact with the CBP60g and h proteins will be identified. In the
fourth part, the mechanisms by which calcium ion and calmodulin modulate CBP60g
function will be investigated. Science education will be an important part of
the work. Graduate and post-graduate students will receive training and
mentoring to prepare them for careers in research and teaching. Undergraduate
students will participate in various aspects of the project. They will be drawn
from programs that encourage participation by members of under-represented
groups, and from a network of teacher-scientists, faculty at nearby
undergraduate institutions with whom the PI has established relationships.
