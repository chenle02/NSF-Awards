The research objective is to develop a multifactor endogenous mortgage rate
model. To obtain accurate predictions of the mortgage rate, a model needs to
consider many state factors such as multiple factor interest rates, real estate
prices, unemployment rates, etc. The conventional approach to solve such a
multifactor model suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is, therefore,
computationally intractable. This research will develop a computationally
tractable algorithm by a fundamental shift in the formulation of the problem:
instead of computing the mortgage rate that corresponds to a multidimensional
state factor, the algorithm computes the set of state factors that correspond to
a given mortgage rate. This approach eliminates the curse of dimensionality: the
complexity of the algorithm is independent of the number of factors used to
model the mortgage rate. The research will develop regression based Monte Carlo
methods and a new randomized quasi-Monte Carlo sequence to implement the
algorithm.

The accurate modeling of the mortgage rates, and thus accurate modeling of the
prepayment behavior, improves the stability of the financial markets, reduces
risk for mortgage investors, and, consequently, lowers mortgage rates for
homeowners. At present, the common approach to model mortgage rates by the
financial industry is based on a very simple heuristic: the 10-year Treasury
yield plus an exogenous constant. Recent empirical evidence suggests that this
heuristic is seriously flawed in certain economic situations. This research will
develop a computationally efficient algorithm to solve an accurate mortgage rate
model.
