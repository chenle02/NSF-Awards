This research is concerned with the basic principles that determine the
engineering properties of immobilized enzyme and cell biocatalysts and
immobilized-protein affinity adsorbents. Attention will also be focused on
thermophilic microorganisms and heat-stable enzymes. Of central importance of
these research areas is the development of new methodologies suitable for
analyzing proteins and whole cells in complex environments of biotechnological
interest. Fundamental studies of extremely thermophilic organisms and their
enzymes are also in progress. Finally, research in affinity chromatography, an
extremely powerful method for purifying biological macromolecules, is also
underway. The goal is to identify factors that govern the efficiency of affinity
separations through measurements of key paremeter, molecular-level
characterization of immobilized species and mathematical modeling.
