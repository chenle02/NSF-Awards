This project will provide undergraduate students in computer science, computer
engineering, microelectronic engineering, and electrical engineering the
opportunity to design, implement, and test significant digital systems. It will
provide the necessary equipment for a new computer architecture laboratory. This
laboratory will be used primarily by students in two new undergraduate
concentrations: the 3- course digital systems design concentration in computer
science and the 2-course very large scale integration (VLSI) design sequence in
computer engineering. It will be used by microelectronic engineering students to
provide functional testing of integrated circuits (IC's) fabricated at RIT.
Three new computer aided design (CAD) workstations will provide schematic
capture and simulation at the functional, logic, switch, and circuit level. They
will also include capabilities for board placement, routing, and layout, as well
as integrated circuit layout. A fourth workstation will be used for testing
boards and IC's. It includes 32 bits each of pattern generation and state
analysis. Additional equipment includes oscilloscopes and 2 multibus computer
systems. The multibus systems will provide the computer interface for boards
designed by students. The oscilloscopes will be used to analyze and debug boards
and other circuits. The project will produce computer science students with
greatly increased competence in hardware and embedded systems. It will result in
computer engineering students who have considerable experience in the design of
complete systems involving VLSI components. It will also provide new
undergraduate research opportunities for seniors in both disciplines.
