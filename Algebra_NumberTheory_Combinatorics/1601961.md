This research centers on finite reflection groups -- these are the symmetries
that, for example, make the five Platonic solids known to the Greeks (the cube,
tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron) so irresistibly
attractive and fascinating. Part of their mystery and beauty is a bit
frustrating; we want to understand their common features, not just as a list of
five unrelated objects. It has long been known that having enough reflection
symmetries is part of this story. This project is about understanding reflection
groups, via their generating reflections and the algebra that governs how the
reflections compose, in a broader context. Results of the work are expected to
have application to random sorting networks and to better understanding of the
representation theory of the finite general linear groups. Classical reflection
groups are not only unified in that they are generated by reflections -- they
also share common features with general linear groups over a finite field.
Particularly gratifying is that, when viewing the finite general linear group as
a reflection group, one is led to questions about its representation theory and
its invariant theory that (conjecturally) have surprisingly simple and elegant
answers. In this project, the ordinary representation theory of finite general
linear groups will be explored using the method pioneered by Okounkov and
Vershik for studying symmetric groups. Also, the characteristic-p invariant
theory of finite general linear groups will be studied using ideas arising from
the connection between Catalan combinatorics and the characteristic zero
invariant theory of real reflection groups.
