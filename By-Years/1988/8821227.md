Increasing use of "hubs" as switching centers through which large volumes of
traffic are channelled has transformed the character of many transportation and
communications networks. Scholars in geography, regional science, operations
research, and related fields have recently given more attention on the role of
hubs in circulation networks, but most studies conducted to date have focused on
the characteristics of individual nodes rather than on the entire network. This
research project will build on work already completed by the investigator that
enhances theoretical models of spatial interaction. These improvements will
determine the number and location of hubs that would best serve a network and
the best routing of flows through the network. The research will combine
extension of mathematical models to accommodate additional factors that more
accurately reflect actual conditions within which networks function, the
development of heuristic procedures for better determining solutions for such
complex models, and the analyses of graphic representations of networks to
measure the connectivity and efficiency of alternative networks. The project
will set the stage for empirical analyses of hub systems in a variety of
different types of networks. This project will significantly advance theoretical
understandings of the roles of hubs within circulation systems by more
realistically representing network configurations and operations and by
assessing hub operations from perspectives of overall network efficiency.
Previous work by the investigator along this line of inquiry already has been a
catalyst for new studies by other scholars examining spatial interaction and
other locational factors; this project will continue to foster that kind of
advancement. This research ultimately will also yield practical rewards, by
providing an improved basis for assessing the operation of real circulation
networks and by encouraging development of new procedures for determining
optimal configurations of new networks.
