This project will provide an opportunity to broaden the dissemination of a new
experimental program for introducing more plant science into biology teaching
(vis-a-vis current heavy emphasis on animals) and enhancing the hands-on
character of plant science teaching. It is based on the use of a new variety of
brassica, christened "Wisconsin Fast Plants", developed by the Principal
Investigator at the University of Wisconsin. They have many characteristics
which make them well suited to school laboratory experimentation, but
particularly important is their very short life cycle (35 days from planting to
seed harvest). Teaching methods and materials designed to allow full
exploitation in school settings of the characteristics of the Fast Plants have
already been developed under an National Science Foundation Materials
Development grant. Nine teams spanning the country will be trained in the use of
these methods and materials and extend them as necessary to serve primary and
secondary students. Teams will be made up of elementary, middle and high school
teachers, science supervisors, university professors, both of science education
and science, and representatives of state departments of education. Each team,
with the cooperation of an Advisory Board which includes school, business and
community representatives, will develop a regional plan for further
dissemination. All teams will participate in setting up a Fast Plants
Cooperative to continue networking and outreach.
