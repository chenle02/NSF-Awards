Eddy 9631248 This is a project for training pre-doctoral and young post-doctoral
statisticians in cross-disciplinary research and teaching. Training of
Ph.D.-level statisticians for effective service should emphasize these two
central elements of statistical activity. There will be project six on-going
cross-disciplinary research projects: in cognitive psychology; in functional
magnetic resonance imaging; in genetics and psychiatric statistics; in
statistical physics; in criminology, governmental statistics, and public policy;
and in environmental statistics. These will serve as the subject matter portion
of the research program. Effective teaching accommodates the needs of the
learner; thus, the collaborative research in cognitive psychology is an
essential part of the teaching element. The program has three components:
research that will guide training, the training program itself, and a plan for
evaluation of the success of various components of the training program.
