The Department of Computer Science at the University of Georgia proposes to
trade-in its intel iPSC/2 D4 hypercube for an intel iPSC/860 Model 8
supercomputer system (see specifications in part V). This equipment will be
dedicated to the support of research in mathematical sciences. The equipment
will be used for several research projects, including in particular: (i) Dr. T.
Taha (Computer Science Department) for developing parallel algorithms for
Inverse Scattering Transform IST numerical schemes for solving both one
dimensional and multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These
equations arise in many areas of application including nonlinear optics, signal
propagation, plasma physics, etc. (ii) Dr. S. Cater and Dr. R. Robinson (both
from the Computer Science Department) for developing a prototype computing
environment on an Intel iPSC/860 supercomputer based on the GNU C++ compiler and
libraries. The objective is a system which is productive for the user and
effective in the exploitation of parallel computing resources. (iii) Dr. D.
Gordon (Computer Science Department) for developing a parallel algorithm for
solving large sparse matrices using conjugate gradient algorithm. (iv) Dr. A.
Granville (Mathematics Department), for better understanding of the distribution
function of the number of integers, in intervals of length z, that are free of
prime factors &lt; y. Sieving different intervals in parallel will speed up the
computations considerably. (v) Dr. J. W. Smith (Computer Science Department),
for developing a general parallel method for the reduction of boolean (bit)
matrices.
