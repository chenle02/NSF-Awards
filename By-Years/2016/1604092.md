This award provides funding for the conference Symmetry, Integrability, and
Special Functions, to be held at the Centre de Recherches Math√©matiques at the
University of Montreal from July 3 to July 9, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields
of difference equations, orthogonal polynomials, and integrable systems. A
number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are
members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to
attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive
to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of
different activities. More information will be made available
