Dr. Marin S. Robinson has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Robinson's doctoral degree was from the University of
Colorado/Boulder under the supervision of Professor Charles DePuy. Dr. Robinson
will continue research at the University of Colorado/Boulder under the
sponsorship of Professor Margaret Tolbert. Dr. Robinson's postdoctoral position
will provide her the opportunity to construct a flow tube apparatus and study
heterogeneous processes between gas phase molecules and metal surfaces. Longer
term, she plans to apply her postdoctoral experience to the study of chemical
reactivity of ion-molecules and ion-radicals on model ice surfaces and metal
surfaces. These studies will advance our fundamental understanding of both
atmospheric chemistry and catalysis by metals. %%% The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
