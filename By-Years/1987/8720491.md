Social organization can be inferred from the manner in which societies use
space in architecture and settlement patterns. Changes in social organization
due to demographic, historical, and other factors, therefore, will be reflected
in alterations in architectural form, the placement of houses, and the location
of settlements. In the course of this research project, the researcher will
investigate the changing organization of Zuni society during the historic
period, from 1680 to the present. Specifically the student will use aerial
photographs to analyze the spatial remains of settlements and compare Zuni sites
over time to delineate changes in settlement patterns, housing, and social
organization. An innovative research technique utilizing photogrammetrics will
be developed and tested during the course of this project. Thus, this research
will advance archaeological methodology as well as make substantive
contributions to knowledge about the development of Puebloan society.
