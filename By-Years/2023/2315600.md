This award will support research to develop innovative methods for policy
evaluation. The wide adoption of experimental and observational data to evaluate
policy changes has revolutionized policy making in the twentieth century.
However, policy makers face several complications when making data-driven policy
choices. For example, there may be concerns about whether the results from the
experiments might be generalizable or the experiments may feature imperfect
compliance. These problems imply that the available data only provide partial
information about the welfare associated with a new policy. This award will
support research that uses the framework of Statistical Decision Theory to
develop new decision rules that can be used to make policy choices in these
complicated, but realistic, situations. The methods to be developed are easy to
solve mathematically and allow researchers to make the most out of the available
data when making policy decisions. The new methods will be useful in several
areas of economics, econometrics, biostatistics, and other social sciences. The
researchers will write a statistical code to implement the new methods. Besides
improving economic science, the results of the research supported by this award
will improve policy design and thus improve economic performance and the
wellbeing of US citizens.

This award supports research that uses three projects to develop new methods of
estimation and inference by connecting Statistical Decision Theory to economics
and econometrics. The first project studies a binary policy choice problem in
which payoff relevant parameters are partially identified. A key research output
will be a novel decision rule that makes explicit use of an estimator of the
identified set for the payoff relevant parameters. The rule will be justified by
a new finite-sample optimality theory that refines the minimax regret principle.
The second project concerns a policy maker uncertain about the true policy
effect but has access to data generated by an RCT with imperfect compliance. The
research will give a decision theoretic interpretation of the usual “IV”
estimators, irrespective of whether it admits a causal interpretation. The
researchers will apply these results to study data-driven policy making with
experimental and observational data. The results of this research will improve
methods of data-driven policy decision-making. Besides improving economic
science, the results from the research supported by this award will improve
policy design and thus improve economic performance and the wellbeing of US
citizens.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
