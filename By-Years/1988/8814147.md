This research deals with a process for selective separation of metal ions from
aqueous solutions using the highly selective complexing properties of various
ligands. The ligands, with attached hydrophobic tails, would then be adsorbed on
surfactant micelles and easily separated by ultrafiltration due to the
relatively large size of the micelles. The Principle Investigators call the
process ligand- modified micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration. Equilibrium
conditions for various metal-ligand complexes will be measured and the overall
separation process will be demonstrated. The research may lead to a useful new
separation technique for removal of undesired metal ions from industrial aqueous
waste streams and to recovery of desired metals from mining waste streams.
