This project will provide enhancement and professional development for
approximately 40 middle school teachers from public and private school systems
in the metropolitan Detroit area (Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb Counties), for a
five-week summer workshop, a semester of follow-up sessions, and visitations to
classrooms. Further, it proposes to make available the materials developed
during the workshop to middle school teachers across the Nation through articles
outlining the model and methods used in the project. One of the major objectives
of this proposal will be to conduct a workshop that will improve the knowledge
of chemistry of middle school teachers and also students. Modern science topics
appropriate for middle school students; how chemistry concepts and principals
can be applied to students' personal lives and career choices; and societal
issues and technology will be the foci of the workshop. Emphasis will be placed
on the development of inquiry process and problem-solving skills.
