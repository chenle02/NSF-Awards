This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes on two problems: (1)
deciphering ancient texts using computers, and (2) training automated language
translation systems without using parallel texts. Statistical language
processing software has played little role to date in the analysis of ancient
texts, where data is limited and human intuition has so far ruled. Data for
automated language translation is more plentiful, and research has made great
strides in the 21st century. However, researchers are addicted to training on
large parallel texts, which are limited for the diversity of languages and
domains for which people need automated translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project develops unsupervised methods that compensate for the lack of parallel
data, using alternative sources of linguistic knowledge. For ancient languages,
these sources include known languages as decipherment targets, capitalizing on
tight connections within a language family. In translation, large quantities of
untranslated data are exploited to induce strong bilingual connections.
Formulating these tasks in a decipherment framework brings powerful
cryptographic theory and algorithms to bear. Such theory also helps estimate
expected translation accuracy given fixed data resources, and gauge whether a
lost language is decipherable, given a fixed amount of
script.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational analysis of ancient scripts offers a
better understanding of ancient cultures, and unsupervised techniques construct
language connections of great interest to historical linguists. Applying such
techniques to automated language translation offers the chance to bring many
more language pairs and domains to the population at large.&lt;br/&gt;
