Under a Research Planning Grant, initial steps are to be taken for the
development of a numerical code which would produce visual animation of computed
unsteady separation of flow from solid surfaces. The formulation is one which
couples the animation directly to the flow computation, to follow it as the
computed flow evolves. The computation will be fully viscous, eventually three
dimensional, and unsteady. Realistic dynamic representation of simulated flow
separation phenomena will be of great utility in comparing simulated and
experimental results and contribute to the ability to more reliably predict this
complex flow phenomenon.
