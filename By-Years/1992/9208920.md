This is the first year of a three year continuing award. The effort focuses on
coordinated research in robotics, vision, real- time AI, and real-time software
systems, in the context of a robotic assembly testbed. The emphasis is on
flexible manufacturing automation involving active perception, planning, and
cooperative activities among agents in real time. The project investigates
integration of dextrous manipulation and vision, with cooperation among static
and mobile robots and humans, and addresses current limitations of robotic
systems in dealing with uncertainties and rapidly changing environments and
tasks (such as occur in short-run production). Activities include development of
multiple resolution representations which permit arbitration between local
reflexive and global combinatoric strategies; studying tradeoffs between
solution quality and computational speed in real-time systems; modeling
cooperation and communication to achieve goal-oriented behavior; integrating
architectures and algorithms for extracting relevant environmental information
for control of distributed robotic manipulators; implementation of active
perception to support model-based, goal oriented sensing for manufacturing
assembly operations; constructing high level symbolic approaches to reasoning
about geometry; and implementing learning mechanisms which model the environment
based on experience over a general class of tasks to guide perception, planning,
and multi-agent cooperation.
