9726797 Crews This award supports the participation of American scientists in a
U.S.-Japan seminar on Bioorganic Marine Chemistry, to be held in Santa Cruz,
California from December 14-18, l998. The co-organizers are Professors Phillip
Crews of the University of California at Santa Cruz and Takenori Kusumi of
Tokushima University in Japan. The seminar will address a broad range of topics
including: (a) chemodiversity of marine macroorganisms; (b) marine-derived
microorganisms as a resource for unusual metabolites (c) new materials as a
focus for marine biotechnology; (d) interactions between species mediated by
secondary metabolites; (e) pharmacological tools from marine sources; and (f)
mechanisms of marine biosynthesis. Marine bioorganic chemistry continues to be
regarded as an exciting area of research, watched closely by scientists from
many disciplines in both chemistry and biology. Interest in marine bioorganic
technology is also escalating in both the academic and industrial domain
worldwide. A majority of the major labs, as well as the new investigators in
this field, are concentrated in the U.S. and Japan. Frequently, the ideas and
techniques developed by academic and industrial research groups in these two
countries are extremely influential. In addition, younger scientists will be
included in the seminar. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in
this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set
the stage for future collaborative projects. ***
