The objective of this research is to develop a computational method for
assessing the safety of underground facilities in jointed rock under various
types of catastrophic loads. The model will be based on three dimensional
deformable blocks in which the rock is represented by deformable elements and
the joints are represented by interfaces. Models for dilatory joint behavior and
asperity degradation during cyclic deformation will be included in the model.
The models will be integrated in time by explicit integration. The computer
program will be implemented on massively parallel computers so that realistic
three dimensional models can be solved in a reasonable amount of computation
time.
