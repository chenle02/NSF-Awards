9418612 Foufoula-Georgiou The Fifth International Conference on Precipitation
will be held in Crete, Greece in June 14-16, 1995. Following the tradition of
the previous four conferences this meeting aims at fostering interdisciplinary
interaction between meteorologists, hydrologists, mathematicians and
statisticians. The central theme of the conference will be research issues
related to the problem of linking stochastic and dynamic of descriptions of
rainfall for the purpose of modeling, estimation, and forecasting. In
particular, emphasis will be placed on the following topics: (a) precipitation
dynamics, (b) space-time variability and statistical characterization, (c)
linkages between dynamics and stochastic descriptions, and (d) applications of
physical and/or statistical theories in the development of rainfall
estimation/retrieval algorithms
