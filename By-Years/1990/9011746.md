The objective of the proposed research is to develop new methods which utilize
recombinant DNA technology and affinity separations to produce peptide (small
proteins) effectively. Emphasis will be placed upon improving two complex parts
of the purification process: 1) removal of cell debris, and 2) final
purification to high purity. The peptide, human atrial natriuretic peptide, will
be expressed fused to the protein asparaginase in the bacterium e. coli. The
fusion protein will also contain a metal affinity binding site (MABS), which
will be utilized in selectively removing the fusion protein from the cell
debris. Two different MABS and two different locations of each MAB on the fusion
protein will be evaluated. Final purification of the fusion protein will be by
affinity chromatography on immobilized D-asparagine. The significance of the
proposed research is that it can lead to new processes for producing peptide at
significantly lower cost and on a much larger scale than at present. The
research is also significant in that it can lead to a better understanding of
how to design a MABS on proteins, which would be useful in the purification of
proteins as well as peptide.
