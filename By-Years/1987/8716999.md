This project provides for the maintenance and utilization of the CTD
calibration facility for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. As a long lead
time WOCE activity, it is essential to establish procedures and facilities to
calibrate sea-going equipment. This ativity will occur at several US and foreign
sites as the program evolves. The present effort is to provide continuity with
existing techniques as a prologue to WOCE larger calibration requirements.
