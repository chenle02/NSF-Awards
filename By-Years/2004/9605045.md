To understand the spatial relationships among structures within biological
specimens, three-dimensional imaging is required. Soft x-ray tomography offers
the possibility to image several micrometer thick specimens at 30-100 nanometer
voxel resolution, unique contrast mechanisms, and the ability to examine
hydrated specimens. Nanotomography with soft x-ray optics will be developed by
adding tomography capabilities to a soft x-ray scanning transmission microscope
with a liquid nitrogen temperature stage. Fresnel zone plates will be used to
focus a soft x-ray undulator beam to a 30-50 nanometer resolution probe (the
smallest focused spot of electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength), and the
specimen will be scanned through this probe at a range of tilt angles. The depth
of field is such that each image will represent a projection through the
specimen, at least in problems selected for initial studies. After initial
studies of freeze-dried specimens, hydrated specimens which have been vitrified
will be imaged at liquid nitrogen temperatures. These novel nanotomography
capabilities will be employed in ongoing and new interdisciplinary studies with
our biology collaborators at our x-ray microscope user facility. These
collaborations have included the study of chromatin folding in metaphase
chromosomes, imaging of the malarial parasite P. falciparum, quantitative
mapping of protein and DNA concentrations to understand chromosome packing in
sperm, calcification in cartilage and bone (with implications for arthritis and
osteoporosis), and the localization of RNA transcription sites in the nucleus.
