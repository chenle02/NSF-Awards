This doctoral dissertation project examines how children’s language abilities
and experiences impact their production and comprehension of speech
disfluencies. Speech disfluencies, including fillers 'uh' and 'um', are common
in spontaneous language production and reliably precede difficult-to-retrieve
words (e.g., words that are low-frequency or new to a conversation). Adults
harness this association between fillers and production difficulty to anticipate
upcoming novelty, but the mechanisms underlying children’s production and
comprehension of fillers are poorly understood. This is particularly so for
children who have Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and/or are exposed to
more than one language (bilingual children). The overarching goal of this
proposal is to examine both production and comprehension of fillers in children
with a range of language skills and experiences.

The researchers measure children’s production of fillers in natural speech as
well as measure their ability to understand disfluency in a listening task.
Monolingual and bilingual school-aged children representing a full range of
language ability (from DLD to typical language (TD)) participate in the studies.
Across multiple studies, the researchers measure filler production in natural
speech, manipulating task demands to elucidate the consequences for disfluency
and investigate filler comprehension by monitoring children’s eye gaze during a
listening task. Effects of language ability (TD vs. DLD) and bilingualism are
examined continuously, through core language scores and years of language
exposure. The project examines the factors that support filler use and
comprehension, and it has implications for how speech practitioners measure and
use disfluencies within clinical settings.
