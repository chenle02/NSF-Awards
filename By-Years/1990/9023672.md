Dr. Anderson is a leading investigator in the area of molecular genetics of
pattern formation in Drosophila. Her work focuses on the role of the dorsal
group genes, Easter and Toll. The question addressed is whether the Toll protein
is a receptor, and what the ligand and effector for Toll are. This award is a
National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers.
The proposal fulfills the FAW objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding
and promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and
teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their careers.
