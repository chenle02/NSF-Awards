This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to Professor Christopher
Bretherton of the University of Washington. Professor Bretherton's primary
research interest is in hydrodynamic instability theory as applied to convection
and in techniques for understanding complex and chaotic geophysical fluid
systems, particularly those in which dispersive waves play an important role. He
has conducted research on cumulus clouds in the atmosphere using linear models
in which clouds are simply treated as sources of heat as well as nonlinear
perturbation theory to show how internal gravity waves help organize a field of
clouds and to determine how the horizontal mean properties of the convecting
layer are modified by the clouds in it. In the coming years Professor Bretherton
will continue his research on several important topics in atmospheric
convection. One topic is the role of cloud-top entrainment instability in the
maintenance and breakup of marine stratocumulus clouds; this is important since
marine stratocumulus covers a significant portion (nearly 25%) of the world's
oceans. A second topic is to investigate the horizontally averaged properties of
fields of deep cumulus clouds and their response to changes in convective
forcing; this can address basic issues in atmospheric chemistry, such as how
fast chemical constituents from the boundary layer become homogenized throughout
the troposphere and get into the stratosphere. Professor Bretherton will also
examine the interplay between gravity waves and convection.
