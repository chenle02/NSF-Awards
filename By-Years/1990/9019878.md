This award provides funds for the Principal Investigator to study the
application of a multi-parameter adaptive control algorithm to astronomical
adaptive optics. If successful, this method would obviate the need for complex
interferometers and wavefront sensor systems. Based on an approach patented by
the Principal Investigator and his collaborator, the method utilizes a simple
cost function to provide feedback to the variables that are being controlled. It
promises to be fast and easy to realize in hardware.
