***&lt;br/&gt;9733791&lt;br/&gt;Templon&lt;br/&gt;The atomic nuclei consists of
nucleons (neutrons and protons); these are bound together by a delicate balance
of strong, short-range repulsive forces and longer-range but weaker attractive
forces, which operate between pairs of nucleons. The attractive forces are
exhibited in many well-studied nuclear phenomena, but the repulsive short-range
forces have proved elusive and have only been studied indirectly in
nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;The research carried out under this grant is aimed at studying
nuclear reactions, initiated by electron-beam bombardment, which are explicitly
sensitive to the short-range repulsive&lt;br/&gt;forces between the nucleons.
The mechanism by which these nuclear reactions proceed will also be studied,
since these reactions occur with very small probability and are therefore
sensitive&lt;br/&gt;to other, multiple-step reactions which can occur. Some of
these multiple-step reactions are interesting in their own right anyway, since
they depend on the quark structure of nucleons, and quarks&lt;br/&gt;are the
ultimate fundamental particles from which neutrons, protons, mesons and nuclei
are made.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
