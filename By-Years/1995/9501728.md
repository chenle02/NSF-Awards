U. Cal Los Angeles This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in
support of the research and teaching activities of Dr. David C. Myles. The
research will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of self
assembled mono- and bilayers that serve as membrane mimics that will be used to
study fundamental parameters of interfacial recognition, orient complex
structures in the membrane, and carry out catalytic transformations. Receptors
such as bis-aminopyridines will be tethered to the surface of the monolayer
membrane to study the effects of the environment on the surface and the binding
and detection of ligands such as alkylbarbiturates. The information gained
through this research will be used to self assemble membranes that model cell
membranes by incorporating helical peptides. These systems will be used to model
complex membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. The teaching plan will
address issues specific to communicating chemistry to the large classes
encountered at UCLA without losing sight of the individual. The focus will be on
individualized education, organic chemistry curriculum development, mentoring ,
and outreach programs in elementary and junior high schools. The goal of this
research is to gain insight into membrane bound phenomena through study of well
defined chemical events in the context of structurally proscribed systems. Such
studies are surface and interfacial analogues of molecular recognition in
solution and are relevant to recognition phenomena in cell membranes. This
research will also provide high quality research opportunities for both graduate
and undergraduate students.
