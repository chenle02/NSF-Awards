This project supports a state-of-the-art transition in industrial technology
education. Using the equipment purchased through this award, students are able
to gain expertise in Computer Aided Design and Drafting, migrating from the
traditional two-dimensional paper and pencil environment to a three-dimensional
dynamic environment. The primary equipment housed in the laboratory includes:
Zenith CAD workstations with hard disks, co-processors, and CAD software. The
workstations are networked, allowing design interaction and use of a digitizing
tablet an printer/plotter. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
