The goal of this project is to investigate a number of questions in harmonic
analysis, discrepancy theory, approximation theory, and probability as well as
connections between these questions. Most of the proposed problems revolve
around a harmonic analysis problem -- the Small Ball inequality, which provides
a lower bound for hyperbolic sums of Haar functions. While in two dimensions the
sharp form of the inequality is established, the higher dimensional case is
extremely difficult due to subtle combinatorial complications. This inequality
is intimately related to the discrepancy theory, although this connection is yet
to be understood. One of the main objects in this theory - the discrepancy
function - quantifies the extent of equidistribution of a point set and measures
the set's adequacy for numerical integration. It is known that this function
must necessarily be large in various senses, however precise estimates in the
most interesting cases are established only in two dimensions. The Small Ball
inequality is also related to sharp estimates of the small deviation
probabilities for Gaussian processes, in particular the Brownian Sheet, and the
entropy number estimates of certain mixed derivative spaces in approximation
theory.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project investigates important and delicate
connections between diverse fields of mathematics. Some parts of the proposed
research have potential for applications in areas outside pure mathematics, e.g.
mathematical finance. The research proposed in the current project will be
actively disseminated through publications, conferences and research visits,
leading to important exchange of ideas between mathematicians of different
countries, schools, and areas of expertise. The PI also plans to involve
students, both graduate and undergraduate, and young mathematicians to
participate in this project.
