This project exposes undergraduate students to advanced graphical
instrumentation control techniques. The laboratory supporting this project
includes Macintosh II computers, special hardware interfaces, Labview (TM)
software and a collection of oscilloscopes, function generators, multimeters and
other accessories. Using these configurations students carry on instrument
control via a user-friendly graphical programming technique, transform data to
their exact requirements, and tabularize and graph results in an integrated
environment. This lab not only serves students in the existing computer
engineering controls laboratory but also non-computer-majors from the College of
Science and Engineering who need to be involved in computer controlled
instrumentation and students who wish to carry on projects and independent study
in a laboratory environment. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
