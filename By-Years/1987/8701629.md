The investigator will examine the properties of diffusions on manifolds and
diffusion corresponding to elliptic divergence form operators. Diffusion
processes provide widely used models especially in Physics. Both the analytic
and the probabilistic tools will be used to seek solutions to these important
problems. On manifolds, the smoothness of the exit distribution of Brownian
motion will be studied. On special structures, the investigator will study the
asymptotic behavior of conditioned Brownian motion. For diffusions arising from
elliptic divergence form operators, transformation of drift formulae,
conditional gauge theorems and sample path properties will be studied.
