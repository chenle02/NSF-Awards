This award supports the development of a new database of science and engineering
department chairs and the development and administration of a comprehensive
survey of department chairs. The department chairs survey will collect
information about the respondents' personal and professional background, their
career-related perceptions and attitudes, and the institutional setting of their
department. This data will support detailed multivariate analysis examining the
determinants of women's entry into, or lack of movement into, positions of
departmental leadership.

The lack of demographic data on department chairs and the processes by which
they are chosen represents a significant gap in the knowledge about the progress
of women in assuming a key academic leadership position. To address this gap in
knowledge, project objectives are to develop and implement a department chairs
survey and to construct a new database of demographic and career-related
information on science and engineering department chairs. This study will help
to achieve significant change by bringing to light the criteria and processes
used to select chairs. Institutional accountability and presence of public data
on the proportions of female chairs can make a profound difference in the level
of attention paid to the appointments. Systemic change must include not only
increasing leadership diversity in the upper administrative levels, but also at
the local level (i.e., the department). The chair is also critical to initiating
other change within the department.

This project is jointly supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program and the National
Institutes of Health. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase
the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through
the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers.
