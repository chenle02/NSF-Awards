The Investigator and his colleagues will study a number of problems in complex
algebraic geometry. First, they will explore some new asymptotic invariants of
linear series on a projective variety, especially their variational behavior.
While the geometry of linear series is a very classical topic, new methods have
the potential to shed light on basic properties that have not up to now received
much attention. A second project involves the exploration of some new invariants
arising from multiplier ideals: these jumping numbers generalize the much-
studied log-canonical threshold of a divisor or ideal, and they seem to encode
quite interesting geometric and algebraic information. Lazarsfeld also intends
to use multiplier ideals to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of reduced
projective varieties defined by equations of given degree.

The basic focus of this project (so-called "linear series on algebraic
varieties") can be viewed as families of functions constrained by geometric
spaces. When the spaces have low dimension such linear series have been used to
find efficient ways to encode data, for example on CD's. The Investigator and
his colleagues will study the new phenomena that arise when the geometric spaces
have higher dimension.
