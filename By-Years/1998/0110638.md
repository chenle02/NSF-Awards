This project supports studies on the identification of phloem loading mechanisms
in leaves. Sugars manufactured by photosynthesis are loaded into the phloem of
minor veins for export to growing organs. There are two known phloem loading
mechanisms. Apoplastic loading involves trans-membrane transport while
symplastic loading takes place entirely through the plasmodesmata-connected
cytoplasm. It is important to be able to distinguish between these mechanisms
because they are inhibited by environmental stress, presumably in different
ways. According to the current paradigm, apoplastic- and symplastic-loading
species can be identified reliably by plasmodesmatal counts. An alternative
hypothesis to be tested in this investigation is that apoplastic loading is
universal, except for those species that translocate stachyose, or other
carbohydrates of similar size, and load by polymer trapping. Phloem loading
studies, based primarily on the specific inhibition of trans-membrane transport
by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, will be conducted on five species that
translocate sucrose but have been putatively identified as symplastic loaders on
the basis of plasmodesmatal counts. The prediction is that these plants load via
the apoplast. Further studies will be conducted to test the hypothesis that
plasmodesmatal frequencies in minor vein phloem reflect overall plasmodesmatal
numbers in leaves, depending on plant growth habit, and are not necessarily
related to phloem physiology.
