The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will initiate a three- week, commuter
Young Scholars Early Alert Initiative project in Mathematics and Physics which
will provide science enrichment activities for 30 precollege students entering
grades 7-9. This summer and academic year program which takes place at the
Haystack Observatory will allow students to participate in applications of
mathematics and physics to astronomy, geophysics, and atmospheric science
involving experimental observations and studies of astronomical sources of radio
emissions; measurements of distances, velocities and vectors, analysis of plate
motion data and studies of earthquakes; and investigations of the earth's
atmosphere, its variations and man's effects on the environment. In the follow-
up academic year program a staff mentor will be assigned to each participant and
each student will work on an individual project to be presented at a science-
fair style event at the Observatory.
