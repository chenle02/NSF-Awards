Dr Strickland's work will improve our understanding of the 'superwinds' that
emerge from star-forming galaxies. These powerful multiphase outflows are
important for understanding the development of star-forming galaxies, and how
nascent galaxies heat and enrich the intergalactic medium. The proposed research
will address two competing mechanisms for cloud acceleration: the ram pressure
of the outflowing wind, and radiation pressure. Dr. Strickland will develop
numerical tools for determining the observable signatures corresponding to
different models of cloud acceleration, and will model large populations of
clouds, as opposed to single clouds alone. The work combines analytical
approaches with pre-calculated hydrodynamical simulations. It will incorporate
several physical effects that are often neglected in studies of clouds in
galactic winds, including thermal conduction, stripping, and the dynamical
effects of the wind on the clouds.

The numerical codes and simulation tools will be made available to the
community, so that observers can compare their data with predictions of the
various wind models. The research will help to understand galaxy feedback, which
is one of the least understood but important processes in the study of galaxy
formation and evolution.
