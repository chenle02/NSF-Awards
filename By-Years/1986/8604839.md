A research equipment grant is awarded to assist in the procurement of a Zeiss
Stereomicroscope with a linear point count inspection system. The
stereomicroscope with the image analysis system will permit magnification of a
specimen surface with the resulting image recorded by a video system. The
stereomicroscope with the line point counting inspection system is a special
purpose instrument which optically samples discrete points (small areas) on the
speciman to determine if the image is due to a solid or a void. The results of a
sweep along a line are statistically analyzed by a micro processor to determine
void count, size, and spacing.
