Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium aims to bring together
researchers working on quantifying nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;carrier transport
processes in excitonic solar cell devices. Excitonic solar cells, including
allorganic, hybrid organic-inorganic and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),
offer strong&lt;br/&gt;potential for inexpensive and large-area solar energy
conversion.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium
strongly encourages the participation of underrepresented
groups,&lt;br/&gt;including Hispanics, Native Americans, and women, through
appropriate travel and&lt;br/&gt;registration support. Specific efforts to
encourage their participation include: distribution&lt;br/&gt;of information
encouraging women/ethic minorities, researchers from
undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;educational institutions along with abstract acceptance.
