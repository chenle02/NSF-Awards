TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The symposium entitled ?Solid Stat Chemistry of
Inorganic Materials IX? will be held at the 2013 Fall Materials Research Society
Symposium in Boston, MA and is partly funded by the Solid State and Materials
Chemistry Program within Division of Materials Research at NSF. Solid-state
chemistry is an interdisciplinary field, which draws from a diverse group of
scientists such as chemists, condensed-matter physicists, material scientists,
electrical, chemical and mechanical engineers, ceramics, metallurgy, and
mineralogy/geology. Solid-state chemistry encompasses the synthesis of new
materials, preparation of materials in new forms (nanocrystalline, thin film
heterostructures, porous materials, and composites), with emphasis on the
relationships between composition, structure and properties, as well as the
application of cutting edge characterization methods. The scope and importance
of solid-state chemistry has grown not only with the discovery of new materials,
but also through the advancement of techniques for preparing and studying them,
and in advanced computational predictions for structures and properties. This
symposium, the ninth in an established biennial series, will provide an
international interdisciplinary forum for the presentation and discussion of
recent advances in the solid-state chemistry of inorganic materials and their
impact on commercial applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL
SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will provide a dynamic venue for scientists and
engineers from all ages, including undergraduate and graduate students as well
as postdoctoral fellows, the opportunity to present there work. We have a broad
cross-section of scientists with the 23 invited speakers ? five are from a
national laboratory, five are junior faculty, and nine are women. There will be
strong attendance and participation from North America as well as Europe and
Asia. Given the interdisciplinary nature of solid-state chemistry the MRS
meeting is an extremely popular venue for such a symposium.
