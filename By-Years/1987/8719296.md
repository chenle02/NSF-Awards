A continuing research project aiming at the development of improved procedures
for earthquake analysis and safety design of concrete dams is undertaken. The
study addresses: 1) the effect of spatially varying ground motions, 2)
interaction between dam and rock foundation, 3) stability problems, associated
with rocking and sliding, and 4) modelling of water-sediment-rock interaction.
These investigations are followed by documentation and distribution of tools
such as computer programs and design guides for practical applications. The
research will lead to improved capability to assess the safety of existing
structures and to design new ones.
