9316694 Lopilato Genes are expressed or transcribed using a complex of proteins
called the transcriptional apparatus which requires access to DNA. However, DNA
is highly compacted by histone proteins. To investigate how DNA structure
affects gene expression, this project utilizes the bgl operon, a set of genes
found in Escherichia coli. Changes in DNA structure result in bgl expression.
When the bgl operon is expressed, the bacterial cell can utilize beta-glucoside
sugars. However, the bgl operon is silent in wild-type cells, and therefore the
cells cannot utilize these sugars. A variety of mutations cause the bgl operon
to be expressed, including mutations that affect proteins involved in twisting
or supercoiling the DNA. Mutations that affect the histone-like protein H-NS
result in bgl expression. The goal of a genetic approach in analyzing bgl
expression is to identify all the genes and gene product involved in the
expression and the regulation of this operon. To this end, I have isolated a new
regulatory gene, bglJ. A mutation in this gene results in bgl expression. My
specific aims are to characterize and to analyze the mechanism of the bglJ gene.
Characterization of bglJ will reveal whether bglJ encodes a novel histone-like
protein. %%% Studying bglJ expression may lead to better understanding of how
DNA structure affects gene expression in bacteria. ***
