This is a 3-year Information Technology (IT) project, "DAMSALS," to provide 140
contact &lt;br/&gt;hours of professional development for 72 science, technology
and mathematics teachers who in turn will provide 30 hours of staff supported IT
instruction for 180 students. The project&lt;br/&gt;uses the integrated science
approach of past professional development efforts to
deliver&lt;br/&gt;agriculture-related concepts. Participants use GPS devices and
graphing calculators with &lt;br/&gt;CBLs to collect data. On-site visits,
compressed video meetings and Blackboard &lt;br/&gt;discussions support
implementation during the academic year. Participants include students and
teachers in grades 7-12 from rural schools in the Mississippi River Delta of
northeast Louisiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
