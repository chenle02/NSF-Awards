For a robot to operate in a complex environment over a period of hours or days,
it must be able to plan actions involving large numbers of objects and long time
horizons. Furthermore it must be able to plan and carry out actions in the
presence of uncertainty, both in the outcome of its actions and in the actual
state of the world. Thus, key challenges are hedging against bad outcomes,
dealing with exogenous dynamics, performing efficient re-planning, and
determining conditions for correctness and completeness.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an approach to robot planning
that addresses these challenges by integrating several key ideas: (1) Planning
in belief space, that is, the space of probability distributions over the
underlying state space, to enable a principled approach to planning in the
presence of state uncertainty; (2) Planning with simplified models and re-
planning as necessary to enable planning efficiently with outcome uncertainty
while still enabling action choices based on looking ahead into likely outcomes;
(3) Combining logical and geometric reasoning to enable detailed planning in
large state spaces involving many objects; and (4) Hierarchical planning with
interleaved execution to enable plans with very long time horizons by breaking
up the planning problem into a sequence of smaller
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods developed will be tested in a system
that combines planning, perception and execution for real physical robots
navigating and manipulating objects in real, complex environments. The software
developed in this project will be freely available as a collection of ROS (Robot
Operating System) modules for easy porting to a wide variety of robots. The
research in this project will contribute materials for two courses that the PIs
are developing: (1) a lab-based introduction to electrical engineering and
computer science based on mobile robots (currently taken by around 500 MIT
students per year) and (2) a new project-based senior-level subject on robot
planning and perception. All of the materials for these subjects will be
available freely through MIT's OpenCourseWare site.
