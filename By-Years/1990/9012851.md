In this project, the P.I. will continue, and complete studies of low frequency
and mesoscale variability in the eastern equatorial Pacific, using data
collected during three major projects related to the Tropical Ocean / Global
Atmosphere (TOGA) program: EPOCS, Tropic Heat, and the Hawaii/Tahiti shuttle
experiment. Specific focus will be on the equatorial undercurrent, eddy
energetics, and twenty-day waves.
