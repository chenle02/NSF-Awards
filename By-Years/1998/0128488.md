This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves
development of fully inorganic nanofiltration (NF) membrane modules that combine
the attributes of low cost, excellent chemical resistance in aggressive organic
and aqueous media, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength. The key
objectives will be to develop NF membrane modules based on low-cost multi-
channel honeycomb supports with 220 square cetimeter membrane area and to
demonstrate they have NF retention capability, high productivity (flux rates),
and resistance to aggressive organic and aqueous media. Preliminary work to
fabricate analogous modules with 1200 square centimeter membrane area will be
performed.

The modules, when ultimately commercialized to very large size, will be
especially suitable for in-process recycling of solvents used in a wide variety
of applications and could replace distillation as a cost-effective purification
method for solvents such as hexane and acetone that are used in very large
quantities in edible oil processing. In addition, the products would have wide
application in the chemical manufacturing, petrochemical, petroleum production,
pharmaceutical, food processing, and water treatment industries.
