94-02159 Farley In this project the PIs will participate in the EDISON cruise
(Germany, Canada, US, and Australian participants; Crusie ship- Sonne (German)
to investigate structure, petrology, tectonics of the young alkaline volcanic
centers (TLTF) in the southwestern Pacific. An intriguing aspect of this study
is the presence of mantle wedge xenoliths in some of the alkaline basalts. These
xenoliths are sulfate and carbonate-rich (metasomatized). Another intriguing
aspect is the 1982 discovery of a gold deposit in Lihir island. The authors
argue that "this is probably the best known locality in the world" in which to
investigate the interrelation- ship between extensional tectonics in a
convergent margin, arc magmatism, mantle metasomatism, and gold-copper
mineralization. This is what the team will do. Ship time and other expenses at
sea will be borne by the Germans; the PIs are only requesting funds for pre-
cruise expenses and post-cruise research.
