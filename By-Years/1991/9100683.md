This applicant plans to study the occurrence and mechanism of negative
regulation of cellular functions by the formation of steroid receptor
heterodimers. Negative interactions of progesterone on estrogen-induced
functions will be used as the model system. The work is planned to take place in
the laboratory of Dr. Jan-Ake Gustafsson at the Karolinska Institute.
