Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9803241 Principal Investigators: C. Taubes, R. Bott, and B. Mazur

Professor Bott's research will center on two topics. The first deals with
imbedding invariants based on integrals on configuration spaces of points which
were introduced by Witten, Axelrod-Singer and Kontsevich. A particular aim is to
understand the Casson invariant as a configuration space integral, and to
understand how these integrals behave under surgery. The second topic aims to
extend the Duistermaat-Heckmann theorem to variationally complete orbits of
symmetric pairs. Professor Mazur's research centers on four projects. The first
studies the p-adic interpolation of modular eigenforms and their L-functions.
The second studies the question of the representability of elements in the
Shararevich-Tate group of elliptic curves. The third studies the Euler systems
of Kolyvagin in a general motivic context. The fourth project will study certain
"circle method-type questions" related to the ABC conjecture. Professor Taubes
work centers on two topics. The first deals with the theory of pseudo-
holomorphic curves for the singular symplectic forms on 4-manifolds which arise
as self-dual harmonic 2-forms. The regularity of these curves will be analyzed,
their use in defining obstructions to symplectic form existence will be
considered. The second project studies the compactness question for various
generalizations of the Seiberg-Witten equations. The goal here is to determine
whether these generalizations can be used to obtain manifold invariants.

More colloquially, Professor Bott will study, first, a series of new invariants
which deal with the different ways in which a loop or surface can be fitted into
a higher dimensional space. These sorts of questions have arisen recently from
physics in some novel quantum field theories. The second part of Professor
Bott's project studies the ways in which the symmetries of a space constrain its
global structure. Professor Mazur will be studying, first, the ABC conjecture.
This is a finiteness assertion that may govern the number of solutions to a
broad collection of equations. (For example, the equations which occur in
Fermat's last theorem.) Second, Professor Mazur plans to study the Fourier
coefficients of modular forms. This is an area with results of use to quite a
number of other branches of mathematics (group theory, complex function theory,
and, surprisingly, theoretical physics.) Professor Taubes plans to study the
behavior of four dimensional spaces and to develop techniques to distinguish
such spaces from each other. For example, with time included, our universe is
4-dimensional and its large scale topological structure is not known. In this
context, Professor Taubes' research concerns the classification of those
structures which are possible.
