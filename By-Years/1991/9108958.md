Linear and nonlinear regression models are used for statistical analysis of data
from physical, social, and biological sciences as well as engineering and
economics. One of the omissions made by the analysts is the question of
stability of the regression parameters. For time-ordered data, however, this is
a major question.The proposal will develop effective methods to determine the
points at which these changes might have occurred. Polynomial,harmonic
and,generalized linear and nonlinear models are considered. Bayes estimators for
these situations will be developed.
