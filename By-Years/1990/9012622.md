Intertidal algae in sub-polar and temperate regions experience frequent and
severe freezing during tidal emersion in the winter. The ability to survive
repeated freezing is an important adaptation, and may greatly influence vertical
zonation. In contrast to higher plants, relatively little is known about the
ecological or physiological effects of freezing on marine macroalgae. This
research will focus on the role of freezing as a sub-lethal stress, which
reduces growth and perhaps competitive ability, by examining the effect of
freezing on photosynthesis. The research will address the following questions:
(1) what mechanisms are responsible for freezing resistance, (2) does the same
mechanism confer resistance to both freezing and desiccation, (3) are
interspecific differences in freezing resistance correlated with tidal height
due to genetic adaptation or phenotypic acclimation, and (4) does the relative
importance of freezing acclimation vary between upper-shore, stress tolerant,
and lower-shore, competitive algae? This investigation will contribute to our
knowledge of freezing as an ecological factor, and also address questions of
general importance to all scientists studying the intertidal zone.
