The principal investigator will analyze various problems reflecting the
interaction between partial differential equations and the geometry and topology
of manifolds. Specifically, he will extend his existing work on L^2-cohomology
and derive topological invariants for L^p-cohomology spaces. In addition, the
problem of small eigenvalues of negatively curved manifolds will be
investigated. L^p-cohomology has links with number theory, algebraic geometry,
group representations, and combinatorial topology. The principal investigator
will use his knowledge of the L^2 theory to solve two difficult but natural
problems which arise from considering the more general L^p case.
