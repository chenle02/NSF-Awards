9701576 Brundage This is a renewal project from an undergraduate institution.
The proposed work is a study of the stability of trivalent and divalent ions in
fluorophosphate glasses and the effect of valence on the coherence of excited
states. The project is motivated by recent measurements of unusually long
coherence times for trivalent europium in fluorophosphate glasses developed for
high-power laser applications. The divalent europium ion is stable in this
glass, but can be photoionized to the trivalent ion by intense UV light. The
divalent ion is unusual for rare-earth ions, but is stable for ytterbium and
samarium as well as europium in some crystals and glasses. We will investigate
the stability of different valences, the photoionization process, and the
coherence times of excited electronic states for these three ions in
fluorophosphate glasses. %%% This is a renewal project for the study of the
fluorescence of rare earth ions in glasses. Rare earth ions play an important
role in many optical devices, such as lasers and optical memories. The ions
absorb and emit light when they make transitions between different electronic
states. The frequency bandwidth f these transitions is an important parameter in
determining the performance of optical devices. The narrower the bandwidth the
greater the storage capacity of an optical memory based on frequency coding of
data. The PI recently discovered that the bandwidth of the emission of the rare
earth europium can be decreased by starting with divalent ions and removing one
electron by photoionization using intense UV light to produce trivalent ions.
The PI will study europium and other rare earth ions that occur in the divalent
state to determine the effect of photoionization on the bandwidth of optical
transitions. ***
