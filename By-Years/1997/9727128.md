9727128 Homer Walker Large-scale systems of linear and nonlinear equations occur
almost ubiquitously in the computational modeling of physical phenomena through
the discretization of partial differential equations, integral equations, etc.
Krylov subspace methods make up a large class of iterative linear algebra
methods that have been widely used for these large-scale linear systems. These
methods have been adapted to large-scale nonlinear systems through Newton-Krylov
implementations, in which they are used to solve the linear systems that
characterize Newton steps. This research is a continuation of an ongoing program
aimed at developing more robust and efficient Newton-Krylov methods for
nonlinear problems and, concomitantly, more effective Krylov subspace methods
for linear problems. The current research focusses primarily on Newton-Krylov
methods and related methods for large-scale nonlinear problems. Specific
objectives are to develop more robust globalizations, to implement and test
additional and more effective Krylov solvers, to improve preconditioning
strategies and options, and to explore new techniques such as automatic
differentiation. A major extension of the previous program goals is to develop
effective methods for large-scale continuation problems. The approach is based
on certain ways of adapting Krylov subspace methods and Newton-Krylov
methodology to the continuation setting that allow the use of existing
preconditioners and other previously developed problem technology. A particular
aim of this work is to develop improved methods for large-scale computational
modeling of complex physical phenomena on high performance computers. Particular
target applications include full-physics modeling of reactive flows (combustion
and other chemically reacting flows) and related problems in computational fluid
dynamics. Success in these applications will have great potential benefits in
the design and operation of industrial facilit ies such as furnaces for heat and
power generation and chemical vapor deposition reactors for semiconductor
manufacturing. This work will build on previously established collaborative
activities with researchers at Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, and the University of Utah Center for High Performance
Computing, in which the methods under development have been successfully applied
to a number of realistic flow problems involving heat and mass transport on
massively parallel computers. Likely future collaborations are with researchers
at the University of Utah on modeling accidental fires and explosions and at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on modeling contaminant transport in
aquifers, with applications to environmental management and bioremediation.
