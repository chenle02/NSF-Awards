Preliminary investigations indicate that acoustic radiation forces have the
potential to give rise to new separation techniques. Acoustic radiation and
other acoustic forces generated at modest energy levels in the MHz frequency
range are sufficiently strong to effectively move and concentrate suspended fine
particles in aqueous systems. In this proposed separation technique the forces
causing the separation are only exerted upon the particle and not on the
suspending medium, and separations can be achieved without the presence of
apparatus in the fluid to be processed. In Phase I of the project the P.I. will
determine particle and ultrasonic parameters necessary to achieve effective
separation. In Phase II, flow-through separators will be constructed and
evaluated. These separators will have application, for example, in the efficient
removal of particulate contaminants in critical fluids used in semiconductor
processing, and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and thin-film adhesives.
