This SBIR Phase I project will overcome key technical challenges to develop new
materials to enable a point of care sensor for whole blood biomarker monitoring
for markers with existing CPT codes. Ultimately this, sensor will be used to
improve treatment and quality of life for diseased persons of all ages. It will
be used at the point of care as a rapid, diagnostic for newborn screening (~3.9
million babies born annually in the U.S.) and as a daily monitoring system for
people living with specific diseases (~600,000 people in the U.S.). Ultimately,
manufacturing of consumable, single use sensors and sensor readers will create
new jobs in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical innovation
lies in 1) the ability to increase sensor specificity, by eliminating signals
from interferents, 2) increasing sensor sensitivity by improving the sensing
material, and 3) enabling measurement directly from whole blood, instead of
separated plasma. Current clinically used measurements, which rely on plasma
separated from whole blood, suffer from inaccurate results from pre-analytical
variability in sample handling. The goals of this work are 1) to chemically
modify materials to create new materials capable of eliminating blood components
that could confound the sensor, 2) increase the sensing material surface area
for faster sensor response, and 3) to analytically validate the performance of
the sensor with whole blood as compared to commercially available
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
