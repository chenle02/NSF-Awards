An increasing amount of economics research makes use of randomized control
trials (RCTs), where research participants are randomly assigned to a control or
experimental group. There are ethical challenges relating to the use of RCTs in
economics, including how to explain research findings to participants
appropriately once a study ends. This project will document existing RCT
practices, identify ethical and practical obligations, and support the formation
of new norms around sharing research results with local communities. The project
will include in-depth reviews of existing research protocols to establish
current practices. In addition, it will implement interviews with development
economists and local communities to create a best practices guide to initiate
conversations between researchers and research participants.

The project will result in a series of research and educational outputs centered
on changing the norms around the sharing of results with research participants.
The project focuses on the use of RCTs to collect data in the field of
development economics. The research team has three aims. The first aim is to
document current practices for disseminating research findings in economics and
related social science disciplines. The second aim is to gather perspectives
from economists and research participants regarding the experiences with RCTs.
The team will collect quantitative and qualitative data by conducting surveys
and interviews with development economists and research participants. The third
aim is to develop a best practices guide that will be openly shared through
several strategies including publications and at conferences.

This project is jointly funded through the ER2 program by the Directorate for
Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and the Office of International Science
and Engineering.
