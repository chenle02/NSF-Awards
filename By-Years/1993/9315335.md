9315335 Bachmann This award supports a two-year collaborative research project
between Professor Klaus Bachmann, Department of Materials Science and
Engineering, North Carolina State University, and Dr. Mitsumasa Koyanagi,
Research Center for Integrated Systems, Hiroshima University, Japan. The joint
research will focus on the development of new technologies for vertical optical
interconnection of silicon (Si) devices by III-V compound semiconductor
optoelectronic devices using active and passive optical components. The
following research issues will be addressed: (1) heteroepitaxy of III-V
optoelectronic materials on Si chips; (2) heteroepitaxy of Si on III-V
optoelectronic heterostructures devices; (3) low-damage dry- etching of Si and
III-V's; (4) metal contacts to Si and III-V's; and (5) passive optical
components including waveguides and dielectric mirrors. The U.S. and Japanese
research groups are already working on projects closely related to the broader
goals of the integrated program, and the interactions will build on and enhance
the value of these programs. The expertise and facilities at Hiroshima
University are in nanofabrication and optical integration, while the North
Carolina State University group is strong in fundamental knowledge of materials
growth, device processing, and materials characterization. These complementary
attributes will permit the researchers to address advanced topics in both
scientific and technological research areas that could not be pursued by either
institution separately. This research is important for the successful
development of new parallel processing computer system concepts such as
optically coupled three dimensional common memory structures. ***
