This research is to map Pn and Sn seismic velocities undercontinental plateaus
in a number of major regions of lithosphericplate convergence in the world. The
method will use theextensive 22.year ISC database and apply tomographic
techniquesto confirm and further delineate lateral variations of
seismicvelocity. This work is an extension of similar detailed mappingof Pn
velocities beneath the Colorado plateau now underway. These results will serve
as constraints to dynamic models of thetectonics of plate convergence regions.
The high level ofearthquake activity in plate convergent regions makes
thisresearch an important contributor to models of earthquakeoccurrence there
and, thus, this work is a contributor to theNational Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
