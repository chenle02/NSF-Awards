Abstract ATM-9729571 Woodhouse, Connie A. University of Colorado Title: Expanded
Dendroclimate Reconstruction of Great Plains and Central Rocky Mountains Drought
This award supports research to: 1) reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of
drought in the central Rocky Mountains and central High Plains through
dendroclimatic reconstructions of Plains drought back at least 700-1000 years
and South Platte and Arkansas River basin snowpack back at least 300 years, and
2) characterize and examine relationships between atmospheric circulation
patterns that have accompanied droughts related to both low snowpack and lack of
growing season moisture over the past centuries. This work will provide an
expanded temporal context from which to evaluate the variability of seasonal
precipitation, and thus water supply, as well as provide information about the
influence of atmospheric circulation features on drought variability in the
region.
