This project studies stochastic processes that model complex, interacting
behavior, such as interacting particle systems and interface models. Basic
examples of particle systems studied are exclusion-type processes and
Hammersley's process. Special situations studied in this project include
bottlenecks, traffic jams, boundaries between different phases, priorities
between individuals, and other irregularities that disturb the individual
particles. An interface model describes the growth or decay of one phase
relative to another. Examples of mathematical models in this category are last-
passage models, models of increasing sequences, and marching soldiers models.
The questions addressed are the speed, the eventual shape, and the roughness of
the interface. The results of this project will concern the macroscopic behavior
of these models and the fluctuations and deviations around the expected
behavior. A basic feature of the world around us is that natural processes occur
at several different scales. Large scale features are formed through the
combined effect of a vast number of operators on a smaller scale. This can be
observed in physical processes, biological processes, and man-made processes.
For example, the disorganized motions and collisions of individual fluid
particles make up the flow of a river; competition and cooperation at the level
of individuals determines the evolution of a population; and the behavior of
vehicles on a freeway determines the flow of traffic. Many different complex
systems share common basic principles of organization and behavior. Such shared
features can be abstracted in mathematical models, and analysis of these models
then has implications for many particular applications. This project is about
the mathematical study of such models, and the outcome of this project is a
better understanding of the behavior of certain classes of models of complex
systems.
