ABSTRACT Proposal No. CTS-9407958 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign P.
I.: John Kieffer The investigation of the densification behavior of gels, using
a combination of experimental and computational techniques is proposed. The
objective of the proposed research is develop a better understanding of the
molecular scale mechanisms of densification, particularly during the drying and
sintering phases of sol-gel derioedceramics. Brillouin light scattering will be
used to measure the high-frequency complex mechanical modules of the equilibrium
gel structures, prepared under different chemical conditions, and at different
stages along their densification path. The elastic component of this modulus
assesses the structural rigidity of the gel skeleton, and allows one to monitor
structural developments along the densification path. The loss component
predominantly reflects the viscous dissipation between the gel backbone and the
solvent which flows throughout its pores. The interpretation of the experimental
findings will be accomplished by means of molecular dynamic computer
simulations. With simulations, models of the gel-solvent systems will be
generated which allow one to study their properties on the same time and length
scales as the inelastic light scattering, and to establish the relationship
between the gel structure and is dynamic behavior. The relative contributions of
network relaxation and solvent-network friction will be assessed by
complementary a.c. conductivity measurements of samples containing salt-doped
solvent. The expected outcome of the research is a fundamental understanding of
the molecular scale mechanisms that control the drying and densification of
gels. This permits a better control of this processing method. Furthermore, a
technique for the direct measurement of gel viscosity and permeability,
parameters which are difficult to access otherwise, will be devised.
