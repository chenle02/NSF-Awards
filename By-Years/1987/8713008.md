The members of the Chemical Physics Institute at the University of Oregon are
being supported to establish an undergraduate research program for students who
are interested in the field of physical chemistry. Ten research supervisors will
be involved in the program and the research opportunities will include: o
Spectroscopy of Organometallics and Molecular Radicals o Preparation and
Spectroscopic Characterization of Urea and Thiourea Complexes o Mercury
Adsorption on Semiconductor Surfaces o Pulse Generation in Dye Lasers Pumped
Asynchronously This program will involve faculty members from institutions that
do not offer the Ph.D. degree in 1988 and 1989. It is believed that the plan to
develop this program at Oregon will encourage more undergraduate science majors
to pursue research careers in chemical physics/physical chemistry. It is a goal
of this program to insure the availability of an adequate number of technically
able U.S. students for our future academic and industrial research positions.
