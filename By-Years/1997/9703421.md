Roundoff error and catastrophic cancellation in floating point computations can
quickly lead to inaccurate results. The research objectives of this project are
to design, develop, and evaluate hardware support for avoiding such errors. The
project will concentrate on hardware and instruction set modifications to
support variable-precision arithmetic and interval arithmetic. Work will include
the development of algorithms, design and simulation of hardware support, and
evaluation of cost, performance, and power consumption of the resulting
hardware. Promising designs will be fabricated. Education in computer
architecture and processor design is being addressed by the development of
courses, by encouragement of undergraduate and graduate research, and by
outreach to middle school and high school students.
