Abstract Machedon It is proposed to study two kinds of questions. The first one
is the Question of optimal regularity and blow-up of non-linear wave equations,
continuing previous work with S. Klainerman. Fourier analysis methods applied to
special bilinear quantities are of cental importance in this work. The second
one is the question of asymptotic behaviour of the trace of the Szego kernel,
and how this local quantity relates to the global geometry of the boundary. It
is motivated by the example of a disc bundle over a Riemann surface. It is joint
work with J. Millson. The first problem is motivated by some equations of
Mathematical Physics, such as the famous and very difficult Einstein Field
equation. Simplified models are studied, hoping to understand the mathematical
theory of questions such as: What mathematical features of a nice solution
determine for how long that solution stays nice, before a singularity (such as a
black hole) forms? The second question relates local quantities (such as
curvature) to global quantities (such as shape).
