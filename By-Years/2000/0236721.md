0236721&lt;br/&gt;Cormier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for
the acquisition of a 16 processor cluster computer and related imaging hardware
and software facilitate modeling studies of two- and three-dimensional structure
of the earth's lower mantle and inner core and studies of the fabric of
solidifying basalt. The increased processing power of the system will
particularly aid in the seismic imaging of small scale (1-1000 km) heterogeneity
of the earth. The small-scale structural fabric of the Earth is important to the
understanding of the formation of oceanic crust, mantle convection, slab
cycling, plume formation, and solidification of the inner core. The small-scale
fabric of the inner core controls deformation of the inner core boundary and its
relation to the differential rotation of the inner core and mantle and the
earth's magnetic field. New constraints on the small-scale structures enabled by
the acquisition can also aid in determining the origin of the heterogeneous
structure in the lower mantle: remnant slabs, solid-solid phase transitions,
pools of primitive mantle, partial melt, or core-mantle chemical reactions.
